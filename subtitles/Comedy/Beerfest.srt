1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
BEERFEST (2006)

2
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:01,002
You've got spunk, Wolfhouse.
I'll give you that.

3
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,611
I don't got room in my
pocket for more of your money.

4
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,614
I got a little spunk for you.

5
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,451
You couldn't hit your own ball bag
with your own wrinkled cock.

6
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,284
Chance.

7
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,900
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You play rim rules?

8
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,263
Doesn't everybody?

9
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,928
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.

10
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,767
Hold on there, girlfriend.

11
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,438
You're gonna chance...

12
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,681
...you're gonna have to earn it.

13
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,313
Oh, no. No way.

14
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:47,184
Forget about it.
I'm out of here. Where's my--?

15
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:52,960
Hey. You said you wanted to chance,
now take a chance.

16
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,061
All right, all right.

17
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:02,996
Son of a bitch!

18
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,299
Up yours, Johnny Cash.

19
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,601
Okay. Grab him, boys.

20
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,977
You weren't trying to play me for
a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?

21
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,136
Beginner's luck.

22
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,751
You don't come into my place of business
and take my money like that.

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,320
Now, what I should do is
beat seven shades of shit out of you.

24
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,322
-But I'll teach you something somebody--
-Hey!

25
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,157
What's going on down here?

26
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,124
Todd, welcome home!

27
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,163
I'm just having some fun with your
younger, dumber brother.

28
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,596
Might not be the best time.
Everyone's waiting.

29
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,826
Oh, of course.

30
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,764
Padre?

31
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,978
I'll come back for the rest.

32
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,197
Great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,237
My friends...

34
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,905
...as we gather today to mourn
the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...

35
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,685
...what can I say that
Johan can't say for himself?

36
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,086
<i>Hello, all.</i>

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,388
<i>If you are watching this,
then I have croaked.</i>

38
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:41,168
<i>Now I will never know what happens on
The Young and the Restless.</i>

39
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:45,205
<i>-He loved that show.
-But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...</i>

40
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,108
<i>...for what you have added to
my long and happy life.</i>

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,044
<i>Most of all, my mother.</i>

42
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,746
<i>Mother, I always knew
you would outlive me.</i>

43
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:59,616
<i>I loved you.</i>

44
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,847
<i>Prosit.</i>

45
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,136
<i>Todd, Jan,
my smart and talented grandsons...</i>

46
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,906
<i>...take good care of the restaurant.</i>

47
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,743
<i>It is the last piece of your heritage.</i>

48
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:33,150
<i>And don't worry,
someone will be watching over you.</i>

49
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:36,914
<i>Popo!</i>

50
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,993
<i>-Hey. It's Popo.
-Popo was given to me...</i>

51
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,830
<i>...by my father on his deathbed.</i>

52
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,257
<i>Prosit!</i>

53
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,840
<i>And finally, to me.</i>

54
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,907
<i>Looking good down there.</i>

55
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,391
<i>Say good night, Popo.</i>

56
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,968
<i>Good night, Popo.</i>

57
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,345
For hundreds of years,
it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...

58
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:36,713
...to spread the ashes of
our loved ones in Munich.

59
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:39,719
I am too old.
I want you boys to go to Germany...

60
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,517
...and carry out this tradition
for your grandfather.

61
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,655
Sure, it would be an honor for us,
Great Gam Gam. When?

62
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:49,286
Well, you must leave immediately.

63
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,366
The tradition is to spread the ashes...

64
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,696
...during the festival
on the Theresienwiese.

65
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,396
There you will meet
a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

66
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,235
He will take you to
the family resting place.

67
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,140
The festival begins this week.

68
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,745
The festival of the what-what?

69
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:09,010
Oh, boys, you know this festival
as Oktoberfest.

70
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,709
We're in.

71
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,052
We really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen
and spread Grandpa's ashes.

72
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,747
He's supposed to meet us here.

73
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:25,155
So there's nothing we can do
but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?

74
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,307
Come on, guys.

75
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,424
Are you making fun of us, mate?

76
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,751
What? No.

77
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,626
We're singing the beloved
drinking songs of our country...

78
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,790
...and you sing us
that bloody jingo jango?

79
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,829
I reckon you're taking
the piss out of Oktoberfest.

80
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,995
We're just singing.

81
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:12,471
What do you think, mate?

82
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,633
I think we should fucking brain them.

83
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,172
Hey, we love Oktober--

84
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,394
Hot cheese soup!

85
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,030
Hot cheese so--!

86
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,682
<i>Come on.
This is the Fräuleins Gone Wild!</i>

87
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,317
<i>Just kiss each other, ja?</i>

88
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,736
Helmut, my God, are you okay?

89
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,374
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!

90
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,122
Let's get the bastards!

91
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,306
So this is Oktoberfest.

92
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,639
Wolfhouse?

93
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:00,904
Yeah.

94
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,482
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

95
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,813
-Hi!
-Let's go.

96
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,050
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here.
There's some crazy--

97
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,286
-Gotcha.
-Hey!

98
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,055
-He's got me!
-He's gone crazy dingo.

99
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:20,826
Make fast! Make very fast!

100
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:21,992
Split! Split!

101
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,315
Where are we going,
Mr. Spiedelspackel?

102
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,781
Schniedelwichsen. Come.

103
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,079
Halt. See, we're here.

104
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,385
Johan?

105
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,687
The ashes.
We left them back at that tent.

106
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,830
We gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.

107
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,929
Come. Come now.

108
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,362
We in the right neighborhood?

109
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,869
Oh, hello, blondie.

110
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,506
You care for a dance?

111
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,401
Jan? Jan?

112
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,507
Leave my brother alone.

113
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,671
I miss you!

114
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,524
The password!

115
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,613
<i>Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

116
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,057
They're playing Quarters!

117
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,323
Hey, Beer Pong!

118
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:11,071
Upside-down Chugs!

119
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,375
Come! Come in here.

120
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,150
I'd bugger her
for a game of soldiers, huh?

121
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:30,281
Hello. Pim Scutney.
This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.

122
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,619
Team England.

123
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:35,025
I am Jan Wolfhouse and
this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.

124
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,825
And what is this?

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,458
Beerfest, innit!

126
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,137
Is this part of Oktoberfest?

127
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,763
Oktoberfest is for tossers and
sheep-shaggers.

128
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,876
Beerfest is our lives.

129
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:53,276
The ultimate test of
a beer-gamer's mettle!

130
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,983
-Where's the American team?
-Yeah.

131
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,786
-That's worth a squirt, innit?
-What?

132
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,514
Excuse me, guys.

133
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,219
Please vomit in proper receptacles!

134
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,490
Wait a second.
Look at those urns over there.

135
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,133
They look just like Grandpa's.

136
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:15,530
That's why Schniedelwasher
brought us here.

137
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,264
We're supposed to put Grandpa's urn
up there with those.

138
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,998
We gotta go back and get it.

139
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,575
You go. I'm never leaving this place.

140
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:27,512
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

141
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,015
Hello, guvnor!

142
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,986
We got ourselves a tie.

143
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,819
You see them blokes in the knickers?

144
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,052
That's the German team, the champs.

145
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:43,562
Their family owns
the oldest brewery in Bavaria.

146
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,166
They're regular diamond geezers,
they are, right?

147
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,997
Why does the last guy
chug out of a shoe?

148
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,401
That's no shoe!

149
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,407
That's Das Boot!

150
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,868
And she's a cruel old mistress, she is.

151
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,683
Drink up, Hansel!

152
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,517
Wow, they're fast!

153
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,352
Das Boot!

154
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,262
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

155
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,553
Schniedelspanker!

156
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:00,804
Von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.

157
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,401
Your last name's von Wolfhausen?

158
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,176
Get the fuck out of here. So is ours!
Wolfhouse.

159
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:12,277
We're cousins?
Oh, this just gets better and better!

160
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,324
We must be related through
our grandfather, Johan von Wolfhausen.

161
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
Why are you taking him?
Where's he going?

162
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,903
We kind of need to stick close.

163
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:40,881
-He is of no concern to you.
-But he was just walking us through. He--

164
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,581
You do not speak of Beerfest
outside of Beerfest!

165
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,046
You do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.

166
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,350
But our grandfather
was Johan von Wolf--

167
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,993
Your grandfather
was no von Wolfhausen.

168
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:56,325
Your grandfather was a thieving
bastard stable boy.

169
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,660
-What did you say?
-Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen...

170
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,703
<i>...our great-grandfather, the most
legendary brewmeister in all Deutschland.</i>

171
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,363
He perfected the von Wolfhausen
beer recipe.

172
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,342
It was the greatest beer in all the world.

173
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,610
When Ludwig died, your grandfather stole
the only copy of the recipe created.

174
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,479
Hold on a second.
Our grandfather didn't brew beer.

175
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,451
He had this little sausage house
in Colorado. He couldn't--

176
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,089
<i>He could und he did.</i>

177
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:26,485
<i>He stole our recipe und fled Germany
with his mother...</i>

178
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,426
...a common Bavarian....

179
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:34,061
What's the English word I'm looking for?

180
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:35,225
Whore.

181
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,669
Gam Gam a whore?

182
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,099
Obviously there's
a translation problem here.

183
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,243
Hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.

184
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,869
-Now you're crossing the line.
-No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!

185
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:50,382
<i>Und now, instead of having Deutschland's
greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.</i>

186
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,357
<i>Ja, we are not your cousins.</i>

187
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,522
You are the offspring of the bastard son
of some whore!

188
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,999
-Don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not!
-Punch me! Do it!

189
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,538
<i>Ja, you big tough guy.
Kill me, come on.</i>

190
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,541
Do it now! Kill me.
What are you waiting for?

191
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:20,309
Typical Americans. This is why
we don't allow you in our Beerfest.

192
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,315
<i>You get a few drinks in you
und you become the Dirty Harry.</i>

193
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:27,080
You should go back to your strip malls
and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.

194
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,884
<i>Und then you can punch each other silly.</i>

195
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,084
Okay. Okay.

196
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,789
Okay. Sounds like you guys
fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?

197
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,996
<i>Ja, maybe a little.
I think we just beat the Irish, so....</i>

198
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,536
-Oh, that's good. The champions. What?
-Well, I'll tell you what.

199
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,505
Why don't you pick your best two?
Because you just opened up a can of corn.

200
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,540
Corn.

201
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,538
We are laughing.
We are laughing at you.

202
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,206
-Our best two? You want our best two?
-The corn.

203
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,752
How about our worst two, right?
Hammacher! Schlemmer!

204
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:24,173
You take the big guy.
I'll get the little one.

205
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,974
<i>You ready, du kleiner Hosenscheißer?</i>

206
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,620
Everyone at once.
First team to finish wins. On my word.

207
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,587
<i>-Let's do this.
-Ja, do it.</i>

208
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,962
Hey, boys, why don't you let us
put a nipple on that for you?

209
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,940
I remember my first beer.

210
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,770
Prosit.

211
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,660
Allow me to introduce our grandfather:

212
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,592
Wolfgang von Wolfhausen.

213
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,357
Take a good look...

214
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,730
...for this is a real von Wolfhausen.

215
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,666
Grandpapa.

216
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,637
Oh, shit.

217
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,871
So you are the progeny of Johan.

218
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,746
I am guessing that he is the one
who taught you how to drink beer.

219
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,683
Now...

220
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,788
...where is our recipe?

221
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:22,162
What fucking recipe?

222
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,940
Friends...

223
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,869
...this is all that remains
of a thieving stable boy...

224
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,177
...who ran away to America
with his whore mother!

225
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:58,323
I'm a sucker for family reunions.

226
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,359
Here are a couple of euros.

227
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:08,238
Go back and get a BJ
from your great-grandma, on me.

228
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,741
Now get out of here.

229
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,177
<i>BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!</i>

230
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,312
They called Grandpa a thief
and Gam Gam a whore!

231
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,472
We gotta go back.
We gotta go back and beat those guys.

232
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,381
-Oh, come on, man, that's crazy.
-Is it? We can do this.

233
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,215
We can do what?

234
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,583
Great Gam Gam.

235
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,157
<i>Mein boys. Oh, willkommen.</i>

236
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,928
Honey, what happened to your eye?

237
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,692
I accidentally walked into a wall.
Yeah, the Berlin Wall.

238
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,099
I'll tell Tippy to get
some cold pig stomach.

239
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,671
We put that on Janny's eye.

240
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,643
So tell me,
was the ceremony beautiful?

241
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:22,174
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.

242
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,341
Was it a peaceful resting place?

243
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,921
Have you ever been
to the family resting place?

244
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,457
No, but I've been told it is wonderful.

245
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,761
-Quiet, lovely.
-Yeah.

246
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,159
And how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?

247
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,665
-Oh, he's fine. Great guy.
-Yeah. Good.

248
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,301
He says hi.

249
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:46,003
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.

250
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,701
Now your grandpapa can rest in peace.

251
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:56,907
She couldn't be more not a whore.

252
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,450
We're gonna defend her honor.

253
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,212
We're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!

254
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:02,788
-We're gonna put together our own team!
-Yes.

255
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,359
We'll get the biggest drinkers, the best
beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.

256
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,528
Then we're gonna go back
and kick the tar out of those Krauts!

257
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,292
That's my brother!
God, I missed you.

258
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,900
Beerfest it is.

259
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,558
They want a war?

260
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,728
We'll give them a war
they won't believe.

261
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,674
So how'd you find him?

262
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,372
Some dude, used to work
with him at the brewery.

263
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,541
Haven't seen him since
Hands Across America.

264
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,879
Oh, that's right.

265
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,490
I heard that when the brewery gave
him his pink slip, he killed a guy.

266
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,489
I heard that too.

267
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,752
There he is.

268
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,561
You got nothing, baby.
I got everything!

269
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:49,495
You got nothing! You got nothing!

270
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,851
We're gonna win this thing.

271
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,182
Can I have your autograph?

272
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:11,450
Oh, no autographs, kids.

273
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,719
No, no, no. Thanks anyway.
Get you next time.

274
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:17,228
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.

275
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,293
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!

276
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,802
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!

277
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,601
I haven't seen you guys since....
Hands Across America?

278
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,936
We were just saying that.

279
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,045
We almost made it.
Couple breaks in the chain, right?

280
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,877
What's going on?
You disappeared for a while.

281
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:39,953
We heard you got fired from the brewery.

282
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:45,155
Goddamn brewery!

283
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,959
They brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.

284
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,963
I drink 45 off the assembly line,
and I'm the asshole.

285
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,624
Jim Tobleson said they called in
a hostage negotiator.

286
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,737
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.

287
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,540
I did my three years up at the county pen.

288
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,269
Made some friends, went Muslim.
Now I'm out, praise Allah.

289
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,637
I heard that someone died that day.

290
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,642
Yeah, somebody did die that day.

291
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,580
Me.

292
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,154
I had the greatest job in the world,
brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.

293
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,920
Not to mention all the beer
you could drink, right?

294
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,755
They took it away from me.

295
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:27,058
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get
that feeling back again.

296
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,629
What?

297
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,001
There he is.

298
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,703
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...

299
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,941
...pneumono-ultra-microscopic-
silico-volcano-canaisis.

300
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,517
Big round of applause, people.

301
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,781
You want that geek?

302
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:51,091
What's he gonna do, check my urine?

303
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,462
I met Finkelstein back in college.

304
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,358
He was a real brainiac, that nerd.

305
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,456
Studied everything about everything.
Including beer.

306
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,258
So shut the fuck up.

307
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,529
What are you doing?
Put the frog on the table.

308
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,037
Clean out the floxinator
or something, all right?

309
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,142
People, listen up. Use your thumbs.

310
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:13,179
Locate the seminal vesicle here,
the ejaculatory ducts here.

311
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,579
Then stroke it.
Stroke it. Stroke it hard.

312
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,015
Cup the gonads.
If you don't cup the gonads....

313
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,381
Finky!

314
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,524
Jan? Todd?
What are you guys doing here?

315
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,422
-Hey, smart coat.
-Oh, thank you. It's rayon.

316
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,923
What are you doing?

317
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,465
We're extracting frog gamete
for cloning trials.

318
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,326
You're jerking him off.

319
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,732
-Who's the hippo?
-Phil Krundel.

320
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,571
The name's Landfill.

321
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,508
Listen, Fink.
We're putting together a drinking team.

322
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,168
There's a competition
and we want you to be part of it.

323
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,108
-Come on. I'm really busy.
-We're serious.

324
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,187
You don't understand. I'm a respected
member of the scientific community.

325
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,278
Sorry.

326
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:58,255
-We can't do it without you, Fink.
-No chance. I have a job.

327
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,827
I've got a house with a pool
and a two-car garage. I got three Ph.D.s.

328
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,657
Hey! Don't do that!

329
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,800
-I'm published in four journals.
-What?

330
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:06,956
<i>Toad Load Weekly?</i>

331
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,627
We need you, Fink.
America needs you.

332
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,796
That sounds a little dramatic.

333
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:16,501
That's the part we haven't told you.
We're competing against the Germans.

334
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,344
Germans?

335
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:25,975
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.

336
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:33,785
You got 15 minutes to tell me more.

337
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,966
-Can you move over, please?
-I like to sit in the middle.

338
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,571
What am I supposed to do?

339
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,536
You have room. You're little.

340
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,302
-You wanna sit on this side?
-Fuck you.

341
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,873
Jan, who are we meeting out here?

342
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,811
-Jan, who are we meeting out here?
-Barry Badrinath.

343
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,415
-What? No.
-Who's Barry Badrinath?

344
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,387
-I'm putting a team together.
-Turn around.

345
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,151
-Who's Barry?
-Don't worry.

346
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,727
Who's Barry Badrinath?
Who's Barry Badrinath?

347
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:11,229
Will you shut the hell up? Shut up.

348
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,594
Barry Badrinath was the
best beer-gamer ever.

349
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:15,998
Best at Quarters, at Pong,
best at everything.

350
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,930
We should put him on our team.

351
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:22,708
Well, actually, Barry and Todd
had a falling-out.

352
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,243
-See, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend.
-Yahtzee.

353
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:26,437
-Zip it, Fink.
-Sorry.

354
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,878
Just think about Gam Gam
for a minute, all right?

355
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,585
-Is this guy really that good?
-Yeah.

356
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,583
He's the best.

357
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,889
We should put him on our team, then.

358
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,398
-There he is.
-Where?

359
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:47,762
Right there.

360
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,925
Oh, my God.

361
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,434
What happened to him?

362
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:54,204
All right. It's a regular
hot-dog cart in here, huh?

363
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,709
All right, here's how it works.

364
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,540
One dollar to look at it.
Two dollars to touch it.

365
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,012
Three dollars to watch me touch it.

366
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,844
That's lots of nice-looking manhood.

367
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,576
Back the fuck up, Antonio!

368
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,414
My dick!

369
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,756
My apologies.

370
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:11,892
Five to touch it
while I touch my toes.

371
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,824
Six dollars to touch it
while I touch your toe--

372
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,223
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?

373
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,730
Todd. And Fink.

374
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,138
-Hey, looking good, Finky.
-You too, Barry.

375
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,973
I wish I could give you a deal here,
but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?

376
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,579
So it's $ 10 for a BJ,
$ 12 for an HJ, $ 15 for a ZJ.

377
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,845
What's a ZJ?

378
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,785
If you have to ask, big man,
you can't afford it.

379
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:44,857
I got $4.

380
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,756
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...

381
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,262
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.

382
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,631
Move along, then.
I got a mouth to feed.

383
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,494
Barry, wait.

384
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,306
Jan, hold on.
That's not such a good idea.

385
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,839
Barry!

386
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,369
There's this big beer-games competition.

387
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:04,944
We're putting a team together.

388
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,781
-We want you.
-Twenty-five bucks.

389
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,385
No, no, no. You'd be training
with us over the next year.

390
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,716
-Thirty bucks?
-Jan, forget it.

391
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:18,723
No, just show us some of
the old coin tricks. Come on.

392
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:23,523
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.

393
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,222
-No. Wait.
-No?

394
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,362
Clearly, you've fallen on hard times.

395
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,197
This would be a chance
to get back to the glory days.

396
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:33,363
It's a chance to show you still got it.
You still got it, right?

397
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,142
You bet your ass I do.

398
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,643
Show them.

399
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:42,849
Watch and learn, baby diapers.

400
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:44,348
Just like college.

401
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:59,861
It's nothing to worry about.
He's shaking the cobwebs off.

402
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,968
I got it. I got it.

403
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,566
All right, here we go.

404
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,536
-A little sticky on the:
-Yeah.

405
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,843
-This guy blows.
-Come on. You can do it.

406
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:12,378
Glasses, maybe. I....

407
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,912
What are you looking at?

408
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,619
Barry, what happened to you?

409
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,389
Get out of here! Get out of here!

410
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,590
-Get out of here!
-Barry, Barry--

411
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,860
-Get out of here!
-Help! Help!

412
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,337
So, what about
Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?

413
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,268
He'd down a beer ball
with every meal.

414
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,908
He's no good.
He had that Al Roker surgery.

415
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,168
He went black?

416
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,539
Don't be a moron.
He got his stomach stapled.

417
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,443
Most he can fit are two Triscuits
and a glass of water.

418
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:49,981
Really?

419
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,546
Oh, boy.

420
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,985
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.

421
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:59,320
Forget about it. You're done.
You don't have any more, Badrinath.

422
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,018
Oh, yeah?

423
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,142
He's got a gun!

424
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:32,987
Unbelievable!

425
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,521
That's incredible.

426
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:36,861
I'm better when I'm drunk.

427
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,261
-I'll say.
-Of course. So is everybody.

428
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,598
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!

429
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,035
-Get them in there.
-All right!

430
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,536
Well, boys, if we're gonna train...

431
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,472
...we're gonna need a training facility!

432
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,850
It's perfect!

433
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:04,822
It's amazing!

434
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,961
Look at the size of this
graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!

435
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,528
A direct-draw beer dispenser.

436
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:13,193
Half-barrel capacity,
with an anti-foaming mechanism.

437
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,698
These are really the coins?

438
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,972
Hey. I think I found us
a creepy new mascot.

439
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,811
Yeah, fuck it.
Yeah, give it a rim job.

440
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,809
Don't. That belonged to our grandpa.

441
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,207
Sorry.

442
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:31,810
Listen up, fellas.

443
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,388
The next 11 months
are gonna be tough.

444
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,716
As tough as anything you've ever done.

445
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,520
We're gonna drink beer.
And a lot of it.

446
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,053
If anybody here isn't up to it...

447
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,098
...l'm gonna give you one last chance
to walk out that door.

448
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,865
-That's a good one, Todd.
-Good. That's what I wanted to hear.

449
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,636
Because in this silver slice of
heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.

450
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,245
Golden, delicious beer.

451
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:02,541
And no one leaves here until we finish
every single last drop.

452
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,617
All right, let's have the keys.

453
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:09,519
-All you guys. You too, big boy.
-Don't lose these.

454
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,215
All right, Fink, hit me.

455
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,857
Sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.

456
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:19,389
Hey, Barry, how about
a little warm-up match?

457
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,532
Good one. But I'll leave
the practicing to the amateurs.

458
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:31,369
All right, guys, let's focus, huh?
Huddle up.

459
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,070
All right!

460
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,211
Guys, those Germans
are incredible drinkers.

461
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,643
Better than anything I've ever seen.

462
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,449
Now, Fink, they've got
this thing called The Boot.

463
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,319
There's a secret way to drink it.
I don't know what it is.

464
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,462
-You'll have to figure that out for us.
-You got it, Hot Toddy.

465
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:51,029
One more thing,
I cannot stress this enough, people.

466
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,727
This is a super-secret competition.
You cannot tell anybody about this.

467
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,063
Or else what?

468
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,638
The guy that brought us there,
they killed him.

469
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:06,505
But let's not worry about that now.

470
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,216
-Let's drink some beer!
-Yeah!

471
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:13,080
-All right!
-Yeah, cheers!

472
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,188
Ice cold.

473
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:22,795
-Anyone else's cold?
-Really cold.

474
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:26,525
Drinking and dancing at the same time.
That's what's making it tough.

475
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,794
Thought there might be a bug in there.

476
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,167
My teeth hurt, it's so cold.
That's what makes me have to stop a bit.

477
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,808
-How many beers in this thing?
-About 125 beers, yeah.

478
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,671
A hundred and twenty-five?

479
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,675
Might have a cavity here.

480
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,446
-You're dead, bitch.
-Oh, yeah?

481
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,781
Remember we made Fudgsicles out
of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?

482
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,179
Eight points.

483
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,693
These big ones have
a different flight pattern.

484
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,464
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

485
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,200
That shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?

486
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,030
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.

487
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:05,638
It's great motivation.
A reminder of the humiliation.

488
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,831
I wouldn't mind having it
while training.

489
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,537
Okay.

490
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,177
You are a good friend.

491
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:22,754
All right, here we go.

492
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:27,820
Oh, yeah.

493
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,929
I know you love it, Muscle Lips.
Let's go.

494
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,258
Lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.

495
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,258
Sorry.

496
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,900
Get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.

497
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:40,563
<i>Don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke,
you goyim schmendrik miskayt.</i>

498
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,073
I don't know why you're here.
You can't drink beer.

499
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,405
I'll show you how to drink
a beer, motherfucker.

500
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:46,603
Fucking man cow.

501
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:53,516
Hey, I think somebody's trying
to chug in my face!

502
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,746
Look out, Germans!

503
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,287
<i>You got chutzpah, Fuckelstein.</i>

504
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,153
-That's great.
-Hey, Todd.

505
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:06,596
About the old girlfriend thing.
Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?

506
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,733
-I don't know.
-It was just a one-night stand, right?

507
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,966
Wasn't even that good-looking.
Real dead fish, right?

508
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:19,345
I mean, she just laid there, taking it
like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?

509
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:24,079
I happen to have married
that plastic fuck doll!

510
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,582
Todd, no!

511
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,854
Hey! Get off him!

512
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,319
Someone's chewing my leg!

513
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,735
I hate you, Badrinath!

514
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:05,891
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.

515
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,925
Oh, my God.

516
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,655
Hello? Yes.

517
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,959
We need an ambulance immediately
at 622 Francis Drive.

518
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,430
Come on, Phil.
Stay with me, honey.

519
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,711
Oh, my God, what is that?

520
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:28,473
Ham.

521
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,205
Phil?

522
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,604
Not again.

523
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:21,690
How'd we do?

524
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,599
Not good.

525
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:33,104
If we're gonna drink like the Germans,
I think we're gonna need a little help.

526
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:35,071
You don't have to yell.

527
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,451
Don't say anything to Great Gam Gam
about the competition.

528
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,479
Don't talk about her being a whore.

529
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,418
-She's a whore?
-No, she's not a whore.

530
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,786
-So what if she was a whore?
-She's not.

531
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,394
I'm just saying, some of
my best friends are whores.

532
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:49,756
Yeah, we know.

533
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,092
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.

534
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,434
-Can I help you?
-Who are you?

535
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,932
My name's Cherry.

536
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:01,802
-Is everything okay?
-Everything is fine.

537
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,637
Great Gam Gam.

538
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:08,305
Cherry is here to help me
now that my Johan is gone.

539
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,149
<i>Mein darling great-grandboys...</i>

540
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,879
<i>...und their delicious-looking friends.</i>

541
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,023
Come in.

542
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,995
And summer sausage.

543
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:26,065
Just came out of the refrigerator.

544
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:30,226
Here, try this. Oh, no, wait.
Here, let me warm it up for you.

545
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:43,580
No, that's fine. We're okay.

546
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:48,085
When we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed
that the Germans were excellent drinkers.

547
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,486
-Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing.
-How do they get good?

548
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,957
Well, from the time
that they are little kids...

549
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:56,756
...Germans are raised
to be excellent beer drinkers.

550
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,365
-How?
-Well, for one thing...

551
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,001
...they train high up in the Alps.

552
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:06,572
Interesting. High-altitude training.
Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.

553
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,369
They are also taught to relax
the muscles of the throat.

554
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:13,012
Germans can pretty much
stick anything down there.

555
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,810
I myself can probably fit in at least....
Oh, at least nine inches.

556
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,777
-Here, let me show you.
-No. You don't have to demonstrate.

557
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,389
What else do the Germans do?

558
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:27,516
They also practice by drinking
the urine of a ram.

559
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,019
-The what?
-They drink ram's piss.

560
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:32,062
-Because of the pH balance?
-No.

561
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:37,193
Because if you can drink ram's piss,
fuck, you can drink almost anything.

562
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:41,207
-She said "fuck."
-Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?

563
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,004
No, I was saying it was a tradition
back in the old country.

564
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,179
Damn, that's nasty. The old country
must have been fucked up.

565
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,317
Now, come on, baby,
it's time for your nap.

566
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,452
-Come on.
-Okay. Well....

567
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,053
See you boys later.

568
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:59,282
I always sleep better
when I have a little sausage in me.

569
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,660
Look, if you ask me...

570
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,929
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing
is a real possibility.

571
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:15,041
Bavarians have been warming
sausages like that for hundreds of years.

572
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,336
Would you say
it's their oldest profession?

573
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,535
Shut up, Landfill.

574
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:21,647
All right, but more importantly,
where are we gonna find a ram?

575
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,625
I'm gonna fucking puke.

576
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,292
That's the most
disgusting thing I've ever drank.

577
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,801
I doubt that, playboy.

578
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,070
Oh, God, is there anything better?

579
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,502
Not right now.

580
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:56,078
You know, fellas,
maybe training alone on a rooftop...

581
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,741
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.

582
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:02,514
Maybe we should get out there and
mix it up with some randoms, you know?

583
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,090
-Smart idea, college boy.
-Go test our mettle.

584
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:07,591
Yeah, challenge somebody.
Challenge ourselves.

585
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:08,989
Let's get bombed!

586
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:10,755
Yeah!

587
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,991
<i>Hey. Who ordered
the Queer Eye makeover?</i>

588
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,736
We're the party brigade.

589
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,037
We're here to play
some drinking games.

590
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:06,982
Drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.

591
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,314
You've gotta drink.

592
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:09,819
I've got one.

593
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,049
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.

594
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,430
My turn. I never fooled around
with Coach Gerber.

595
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,078
This one's called the Strikeout.

596
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:35,477
What you're gonna do is take a hit...

597
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,777
...chug your beer, do a shot,
then blow out the smoke.

598
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,783
Here goes nothing.

599
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,192
Careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.

600
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,373
That's not bad at all.

601
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:10,640
"Strikeout," right?

602
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,412
That's nothing.

603
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,856
Don't...

604
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:20,183
...really, however, see what...

605
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,689
...all the...

606
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,496
...fuss is about.

607
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,156
-Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein.
-Do I know you?

608
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:31,065
-Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy.
-Hey, Jerry.

609
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:37,041
While I have you here, you forgot
my Sunday supplement last week.

610
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,344
Wake up, Finky. Wake up.

611
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,579
Cops, cops, cops!

612
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:31,463
Dude, aren't you like 40?

613
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,695
I'm 33.

614
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:46,309
Hey, what the hell?

615
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:47,802
Help!

616
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,349
What a great morning.

617
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,626
Night, ladies.

618
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,136
-Night, Todd.
-Bye, Todd.

619
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,973
Say hi to the missus.

620
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,507
All right, guys, come on.

621
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,009
-One, two, three.
-Go.

622
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:22,211
My glasses!

623
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,051
Two, three, go.

624
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:32,721
Maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.

625
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:34,155
He's so strict.

626
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,454
Hey, Finky...

627
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,995
-...how you doing with The Boot?
-Not there yet.

628
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,328
I have figured out the problem,
I just don't know the solution yet.

629
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,661
Check this out.

630
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,828
Hey, fellas, gather up.

631
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,034
Here's the thing.

632
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:56,148
When you drink, the shape of the boot
causes an air bubble to form in the toe.

633
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,305
The bubble.

634
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:59,475
This air bubble
shoots around the heel...

635
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:02,121
...and explodes towards your face
while drinking.

636
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:04,723
In your face, it explodes.

637
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:07,655
-It's impossible to handle.
-It's impossible to handle.

638
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,887
It's unavoidable.
The Germans know how.

639
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:13,191
I find the whole thing frustrating
because I can't figure it out.

640
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,096
It's frustrating.

641
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:16,735
It's frustrating.

642
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:18,598
It's frustrating.

643
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:21,104
It's frustrating. It's frustrat--

644
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:22,866
Can you get the puppet off of me?!

645
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,937
-Hey, it's Popo.
-Sorry.

646
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,341
You knocked his head off.

647
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:29,448
Wait, wait. There's something in there.

648
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,549
Hey, what is that?

649
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,818
-Looks like it's German.
-Aren't you guys German?

650
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:37,722
-Yeah, so?
-Give me that.

651
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:41,021
I used to work
on a German cruise ship.

652
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,330
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.

653
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,662
-Really?
-What recipe?

654
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,998
Must be the old German beer recipe.

655
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,664
Those Germans said our grandfather
stole their family recipe.

656
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:58,310
-lf he had it, why didn't he brew it?
-Hebrew?

657
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:01,345
-Maybe he didn't know it was in here.
-It supposed to be good?

658
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:05,611
If this is the recipe, this used to be
Germany's greatest beer.

659
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:10,214
Okay, we want three cups.

660
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,448
That's right. Good.

661
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,616
Pour it on in, pour it on in.

662
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,625
Okay, good. Let's have a little....

663
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,673
-How is it, Jan?
-Tell us.

664
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,943
It's....

665
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,950
It's beautiful.

666
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:49,791
-It's magical.
-It's laughing at me.

667
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,760
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.

668
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:54,162
-I wanna put my dick in it.
-I want it to put its dick in me.

669
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:57,303
I wish it were winter, we could
make it into ice and skate on it.

670
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,564
Then melt it in the springtime
and drink it.

671
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,900
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?

672
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,877
This means Gam Gam
really was a whore.

673
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:23,455
It is good, it is good.

674
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:29,098
I can't serve it fast enough.

675
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:32,102
-Hey, buddy.
-Go with God.

676
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,638
Hey, Wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.

677
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,544
-Nice bottle.
-Hey, Landfill.

678
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,439
Look at this guy! He's getting better.

679
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,679
Dude, you want a Schnitz?

680
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,482
Do you want a tip with that?

681
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:52,918
Yeah.

682
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:54,250
Good one.

683
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,758
-Give me six Schnitzes.
-What the doctor ordered.

684
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,735
Drink, drink, drink!

685
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,884
Good, good, good.

686
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:23,449
Special delivery!

687
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,486
I have this special delivery
for Herr Baron.

688
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,150
Can't you see we are training?

689
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:31,860
<i>I am so sorry, but this package
comes all the way from America, ja...</i>

690
00:52:32,032 --> 00:52:34,865
...and look, it is marked:
"Most urgent."

691
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,081
What is it, Grandpapa?

692
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:03,561
They have the recipe.

693
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:08,334
-Who else knows of this package?
-Absolutely no one.

694
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,661
Only me. It's just me.

695
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,360
-Dispose of him.
-Wait!

696
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,367
No, no, no! What about
"Don't shoot the messenger," right?

697
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,372
We're not going to shoot you.

698
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:19,011
Boys, prepare your things.

699
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,338
We are going to America.

700
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,910
To get our recipe!

701
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,321
<i>Hasta la vista, messenger boy.</i>

702
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,254
<i>Up your nose mit the rubber hose!</i>

703
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,728
I don't really have a move
except this one.

704
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:46,463
Are you out?

705
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,937
Finish your beer, asshole.

706
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:50,565
<i>Asshole!</i>

707
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:52,439
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

708
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,480
Eat that tomato in one bite, asshole.

709
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:01,652
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

710
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:06,457
-Good job, asshole.
-Oh, no.

711
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,059
-Where you going?
-Get out of here.

712
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,545
Watch out. He's coming your way.

713
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,772
See you later, asshole.

714
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:14,271
Hey, Jan.

715
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,079
-You all right?
-That's a good shot.

716
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:21,112
Like the love.

717
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:30,858
Yeah.

718
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:41,643
Looking good, Barry.

719
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:46,470
Looking good,
you handsome motherfucker.

720
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:05,761
We gotta get you out of those
wet clothes and into a dry martini.

721
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,699
-What?
-I said, "Out of the martini?"

722
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:11,772
-Get away from me.
-All right.

723
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,999
Two shots, please.

724
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:46,607
How about a little Sex on the Beach?

725
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:49,101
I think my place is closer.

726
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,446
-You wanna get out of here?
-You looking for a little slap and tickle?

727
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,744
Oh, yeah. Something like that.

728
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:01,352
I'm gonna go grab a taxi, baby.

729
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,116
Okay.

730
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:07,491
-Yeah?
-Barry, what are you doing?

731
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:09,893
You kidding me? She's hot as hell.

732
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:12,226
I'm looking for
a little slap and pickle.

733
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,266
You sure you wanna do this?
You're drunk.

734
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:18,806
I'm drunk. You're drunk.
Everybody's drunk!

735
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,510
Hi, Daddy.

736
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,307
Hey, Mama.

737
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:33,454
Damn, that's nasty.

738
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,124
Come here.

739
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,858
I'm gonna butter your bread, baby.

740
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,762
Nice and toasty, please.

741
00:57:18,534 --> 00:57:22,698
-You wanna get out of here?
-Looking for a little slap and tickle?

742
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:23,962
Something like that.

743
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,675
I think I dropped my monkey.

744
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:40,216
How many licks does it take
to get to the center.

745
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:44,151
I'm gonna rock your world.

746
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,453
I am going to break your dick off.

747
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:49,061
Suck them.

748
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:51,399
Lick them clean, Daddy.

749
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:52,829
Suck them. Suck them.

750
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,936
Lick them clean. Yes!

751
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,628
Suck them! Suck them!

752
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:59,136
Now, don't peek.

753
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,199
Quit squirming!

754
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,851
Oh, Daddy.

755
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,819
Oh, you dirty motherfucker, right there.

756
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:25,991
Come on.

757
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:28,827
I knew it the whole time.

758
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:48,018
I'm better than you!

759
00:59:03,368 --> 00:59:05,165
Somebody had the pig snouts over here?

760
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,498
Who ordered the pig snouts?

761
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,690
Gentlemen...

762
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,622
...it appears it is time to initiate
Operation Recipe Retrieve.

763
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:39,864
Is that the title we all agreed on?

764
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:43,235
I kind of like Operation Stein Grab.

765
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:45,273
Or what about Brauheist 2006?

766
00:59:45,444 --> 00:59:47,469
-Oh, that's a good one.
-It's kind of spunky.

767
00:59:47,646 --> 00:59:49,944
<i>-Ja, it's fun.
-One second.</i>

768
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:54,711
<i>-What if it takes longer than a year?
-Ja, I was hoping to be done by 2007.</i>

769
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,718
That's true. I have big plans for 2007.

770
00:59:56,889 --> 01:00:00,882
<i>Ja, we should take a vote, because
I never liked Recipe Retrieve either.</i>

771
01:00:02,161 --> 01:00:03,253
This is not a democracy.

772
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:06,528
We always waste so much time
arguing about names.

773
01:00:06,698 --> 01:00:08,131
I'm sick of it.

774
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,736
I came up with Operation Recipe Retrieve,
and that's the name!

775
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:14,634
-Okay, fine.
-I like it now.

776
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:17,938
I'm sorry.

777
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:21,638
It's just that I start to feel
so cooped up in these U-boats.

778
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:23,280
I had a bad experience once.

779
01:00:25,117 --> 01:00:26,345
Thank you.

780
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:29,479
Now, let's go get what belongs to us.

781
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:32,585
Battle stations.

782
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:40,665
<i>Landfill! Landfill! Landfill!</i>

783
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:43,096
Watch out. Okay, here comes
the bubble. Get ready.

784
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,802
Damn it! It's the bubble!

785
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:50,237
I know. No, it's a bitch.
Don't worry. Come on.

786
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:52,001
You're getting better. Next time.

787
01:00:52,177 --> 01:00:53,166
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Krista.

788
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,336
-Can I try that?
-Honey, we're practicing.

789
01:00:55,514 --> 01:00:57,709
-Hey, fill her up, okay?
-Practicing for what?

790
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:00,745
-Nothing.
-No, seriously.

791
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:03,513
You said you were practicing.
Practicing for what?

792
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:10,157
Hey, honey, let's go take a look
at the glockenspiels.

793
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:13,389
No, I don't wanna look
at the goddamn glockenspiels.

794
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:15,795
-They're really shiny. Come on.
-I don't wanna.

795
01:01:17,336 --> 01:01:20,237
Well, hello, Dirty Harrys!

796
01:01:20,405 --> 01:01:22,134
Holy cameltoe.

797
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:23,899
<i>Ja, the last time we saw you...</i>

798
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:27,443
...you were wearing
your grandfather's ashes as a hat.

799
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:30,341
You have one minute
to march out that door.

800
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:32,210
We have come for our recipe.

801
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:33,646
That's our recipe.

802
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,548
We figured you would say that.

803
01:01:37,122 --> 01:01:41,525
Despite your thievery, we are prepared
to buy it from you, right now...

804
01:01:41,727 --> 01:01:43,092
...in cash.

805
01:01:43,262 --> 01:01:46,231
Big deal.
A suitcase full of Monopoly money?

806
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:47,797
Come on, those are euros.

807
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:51,129
What's that, like pesos?
Yeah! Come on.

808
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:53,032
That is legal European tender.

809
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:55,105
We should have brought deutsche marks!

810
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:57,333
-But they are so hard to find!
-They're not!

811
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,477
No, there's five ATMs.

812
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:02,113
No, there's a Quickie Mart
right around the corner.

813
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:08,109
Enough!

814
01:02:11,757 --> 01:02:15,955
Here is 500,000 American dollars.

815
01:02:16,128 --> 01:02:17,425
It's not for sale.

816
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:23,198
Well, why don't we make it interesting?

817
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:26,531
You seem like sporting fellows, no?

818
01:02:33,512 --> 01:02:36,276
I am so sorry. I'm really sorry.

819
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:38,473
How about a match?

820
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:42,416
<i>You win, you keep the recipe
und the money.</i>

821
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:44,478
We win...

822
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:46,749
-...the recipe is ours.
-Give me that thing.

823
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:50,826
All right, Barry. It's showtime.

824
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:55,228
Yeah, there's something
I haven't quite told you yet.

825
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,765
I don't play Pong anymore.

826
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:01,005
What are you talking about, man?
You're the best. Here, let's go.

827
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:07,168
-Come on. Let's go kick their ass.
-I don't fucking play Pong!

828
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:09,041
Jesus, calm down.

829
01:03:09,214 --> 01:03:11,614
Pull it together.
You're acting a little crazy here.

830
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:15,719
Your wife didn't think I was crazy when
I double-teamed her with "Silo" Johnson.

831
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,411
-The double-team.
-The double-team.

832
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:20,524
Yeah, that's right.
Never knew it was a three-way, did you?

833
01:03:20,692 --> 01:03:23,217
-With the Silo?
-Yeah.

834
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:24,759
Let me tell you something:

835
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,490
-He wasn't storing corn in that thing.
-Son of a bitch!

836
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:31,531
Fuck it! I quit.

837
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:33,762
What? Barry!

838
01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:38,306
The fuck is that?

839
01:03:39,144 --> 01:03:40,304
Are we playing or not?

840
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:42,504
<i>Time to scheiße or get off the crapper.</i>

841
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:45,514
Get bent, umlaut. We're gonna sell
the shit out of this beer.

842
01:03:45,684 --> 01:03:50,018
You are making a big mistake, cowboy.

843
01:03:50,222 --> 01:03:53,885
Don't think you have seen the last of us.

844
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:00,856
Oh, I forgot the money.

845
01:04:05,604 --> 01:04:07,834
You should get a pinball machine
that works.

846
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,371
That machine works just fine.

847
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,304
Does it?

848
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:27,354
Folks, I'm sorry. Finish your meals.

849
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:30,222
Enjoy. Let's-- Come on,
let's have some polka, all right?

850
01:04:35,267 --> 01:04:38,498
-Fuck.
-Hey.

851
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:45,568
-You know we should have played them.
-I wasn't about to give them that recipe.

852
01:04:46,244 --> 01:04:48,769
-What do you wanna do about Barry?
-We don't need him.

853
01:04:48,947 --> 01:04:50,505
We can get someone else.

854
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:53,310
What's that?

855
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:55,744
<i>Local family restaurant...</i>

856
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:59,118
<i>-That's us.
-...or disease-infested rat hole?</i>

857
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:03,625
<i>Exposé Colorado has this exclusive
interview with former kitchen workers...</i>

858
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:07,196
<i>...who will tell a story that will curdle
your strudel.</i>

859
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:08,457
What the fuck?

860
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:13,900
<i>We were undocumented aliens smuggled off
in a cargo container to work in the kitchen.</i>

861
01:05:14,072 --> 01:05:16,006
You gotta be kidding me.

862
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:19,337
<i>It's very common for German restaurants
to use immigrant labor.</i>

863
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:20,910
<i>It's true, Sandy.</i>

864
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:22,706
<i>Tell us about the work conditions.</i>

865
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:25,645
<i>The biggest surprise,
other than the oppressive hours...</i>

866
01:05:25,817 --> 01:05:27,409
<i>...was the unsanitary conditions.</i>

867
01:05:27,586 --> 01:05:30,453
<i>Yeah. Last month my finger was cut off
with the cake mixer.</i>

868
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:33,557
<i>When my finger fell into the cake batter,
they didn't even stop.</i>

869
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:36,285
<i>-They just kept making the cupcakes.
-Dear Lord.</i>

870
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:40,557
<i>And the rats-- Just yesterday I opened up
a bottle of Schnitzelgeigerbräu...</i>

871
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:44,395
<i>...and guess what I found?
A rat fetus inside.</i>

872
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:47,166
<i>-It's true, Sandy.
-Rat fetus?</i>

873
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,239
<i>-Oh, my God.
-Goddamn it!</i>

874
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:51,272
Now we really gotta kick
those guys' asses.

875
01:05:51,443 --> 01:05:53,172
Absolutely.

876
01:05:53,345 --> 01:05:55,040
Schnitzengiggle Tavern.

877
01:05:55,514 --> 01:05:57,914
No, no. It was totally false.
It was a joke.

878
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:01,882
Yeah, I understand.

879
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:05,548
Canceled reservation.

880
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:08,083
Schnitzengiggle.

881
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,957
No, no, no. No rats. No rats at all.

882
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:13,290
We've been rat-free since 1976.

883
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:16,766
I promise--

884
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:19,326
All right, no problem.

885
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:20,801
-Another one?
-Yeah.

886
01:06:21,973 --> 01:06:23,440
Schnitzengiggle.

887
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:26,807
No, I'm very happy
with my long-distance service.

888
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,581
Yes. This is a really bad time. Thanks.

889
01:06:30,749 --> 01:06:33,217
God. Solicitors.

890
01:06:34,052 --> 01:06:35,883
Take this one.

891
01:06:37,188 --> 01:06:39,122
Schnitzengiggle Tavern.

892
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:42,090
-It's the health board.
-Hang up. Hang up.

893
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:45,586
-Give me this.
-Put that in the cooler.

894
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:51,999
Guys...

895
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,297
...l'm really sorry...

896
01:06:54,472 --> 01:06:57,236
-...but I gotta quit the team.
-What are you talking about?

897
01:06:57,409 --> 01:07:00,071
I got fired from the lab
due to slipping performance.

898
01:07:00,245 --> 01:07:02,770
So a couple of frogs didn't get
their around-the-world.

899
01:07:02,948 --> 01:07:04,609
No, you don't understand.

900
01:07:04,783 --> 01:07:06,978
I don't know how it happened,
but somehow...

901
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:10,417
...I cloned a batch of monkey-frogs.

902
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,921
Don't they hand out
Nobel Prizes for that?

903
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:14,251
Let me see that.

904
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:16,527
Let me see you little....

905
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:19,129
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God!

906
01:07:19,297 --> 01:07:20,628
What have you done?

907
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:26,426
Landfill?

908
01:07:33,278 --> 01:07:34,540
What's wrong?

909
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:38,911
Krista said she couldn't handle
all the lies and the drinking anymore.

910
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:40,642
She took the kids and left.

911
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:42,309
Oh, my God.

912
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:44,114
You've got kids?

913
01:07:47,592 --> 01:07:50,220
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

914
01:07:50,395 --> 01:07:52,693
I just need some time.

915
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:55,456
-Maybe a beer.
-Get him a beer.

916
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:58,495
Thank you.

917
01:08:03,408 --> 01:08:04,739
Did you know he had kids?

918
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:39,477
Schwarzemaiden to Iron Eagle.
Come in, Iron Eagle.

919
01:08:39,644 --> 01:08:41,202
Iron Eagle, are you there?

920
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:43,370
Mission accomplished.

921
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:46,682
Mission accomplished. I got it.

922
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:48,910
I got it.

923
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:54,424
Cherry?

924
01:08:55,827 --> 01:08:57,920
Hey. Okay, now.

925
01:08:58,363 --> 01:09:01,093
-Don't be rash, Phillip.
-How did they get to you?

926
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:05,498
I was in the employ of the von Wolfhausen
family long before I came to this stinkhole.

927
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,434
And now that I have
your precious beer recipe, I can go.

928
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:11,905
Well, you're gonna have to
get through me first.

929
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:23,076
What?

930
01:09:56,755 --> 01:09:58,347
Yeah, girlfriend!

931
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,784
Come on!

932
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:09,996
Yeah!

933
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:27,777
Feel that pulling you down?
That's the yeast, baby.

934
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:30,879
It's like quicksand.

935
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:33,148
Say goodbye.

936
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:09,454
Love you.

937
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,489
Hey, Landfill, where are you, buddy?

938
01:11:13,665 --> 01:11:15,758
Why don't we have a beer
and talk about it?

939
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:17,367
Lan--

940
01:11:24,509 --> 01:11:26,602
No!

941
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:50,000
That's it. We're packing it in.

942
01:11:50,168 --> 01:11:51,692
What, the team?

943
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,304
The team, the beer, the restaurant.
All of it.

944
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:59,102
-What? No, you're crazy--
-Jan. Let it go.

945
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,571
Our friend is dead.

946
01:12:02,313 --> 01:12:04,178
It's over.

947
01:12:46,891 --> 01:12:50,486
Landfill could eat a ton.

948
01:12:51,696 --> 01:12:55,689
But he could also love a ton.

949
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:02,505
He had this habit
of swallowing his food whole.

950
01:13:03,274 --> 01:13:05,435
I called him "The Tiger Shark."

951
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:08,909
I used to joke
that if you cut open his belly...

952
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,813
...you would find a license plate
and a tire and half of an 8-year-old boy.

953
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:19,817
One time, he farted an entire plum.

954
01:13:24,829 --> 01:13:27,627
I was plumb surprised.

955
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:32,500
I always told him
to try to chew his food better...

956
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:35,337
...but he never listened to me.

957
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:39,340
But that was Landfill.

958
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,375
He was a fat asshole.

959
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:46,144
But...

960
01:13:48,486 --> 01:13:51,512
...he was my fat asshole.

961
01:14:26,391 --> 01:14:29,519
-Hello.
-Hey, Laurie. How are you?

962
01:14:29,694 --> 01:14:32,356
-God, you're looking good.
-Thanks, Barry.

963
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,465
Wow, what have you been up to?

964
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:37,957
Me, l--

965
01:14:38,336 --> 01:14:43,364
-Working on bridges. Under bridges.
-Like an architect?

966
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,338
Yeah. Yeah.

967
01:14:45,943 --> 01:14:50,573
-Still in contact with the Silo?
-The Silo.

968
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:58,020
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

969
01:14:59,057 --> 01:15:00,285
Sorry. Hi.

970
01:15:00,892 --> 01:15:02,519
Good to see you.

971
01:15:03,528 --> 01:15:06,292
-Krista, I'm so sorry.
-Thank you. Thank you for coming.

972
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,863
I appreciate it. Thank you.

973
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:12,935
-Krista, I can't begin to tell you how sorry--
-You should be ashamed of yourself.

974
01:15:19,143 --> 01:15:20,474
Oh, my God.

975
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:23,244
Oh, my God!

976
01:15:50,775 --> 01:15:53,335
Great Gam Gam.
What are you doing here?

977
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:56,912
I too came to pay my respects
to a good man.

978
01:15:57,315 --> 01:16:01,877
But unlike you, I am not weeping.

979
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:05,454
We're not weeping. We're mourning.
Our friend just committed suicide.

980
01:16:05,623 --> 01:16:07,921
-When were you going to tell me?
-Tell you what?

981
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:10,526
That you are not competing in Beerfest.

982
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,792
-How did you know about that?
-One death.

983
01:16:17,869 --> 01:16:20,770
-We should see if they got crab cakes left.
-Oh, great idea.

984
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:22,371
Stay put, you.

985
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:25,999
I want you all to hear the true story...

986
01:16:26,177 --> 01:16:29,476
...of the Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen,
who fell in love...

987
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:35,586
...with a beautiful young Bavarian whore.

988
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:37,914
So you really were a whore?

989
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:39,579
What do you think this is?

990
01:16:39,757 --> 01:16:42,419
You said you got kicked
in the face by a Clydesdale.

991
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:44,458
This is the mark of the whore.

992
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,560
<i>It was a simple time, a beautiful time.</i>

993
01:16:52,036 --> 01:16:56,905
<i>You see, the Baron Ludwig
and I were in love.</i>

994
01:17:01,846 --> 01:17:05,577
But we had to keep our love secret...

995
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:09,811
...because he was married
to a young baroness.

996
01:17:09,987 --> 01:17:13,081
<i>We also had to keep
your grandfather's birth a secret...</i>

997
01:17:13,257 --> 01:17:16,249
<i>...because he was
the baron's first-born son.</i>

998
01:17:16,427 --> 01:17:18,987
<i>Wait, Grandpa was the first-born?</i>

999
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:20,528
<i>Yes.</i>

1000
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:23,531
<i>But the baroness found out about it,
me and my young Johan...</i>

1001
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:27,637
<i>...and had us tarred and feathered
and run out of town.</i>

1002
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:32,507
You two are the rightful heirs
to the von Wolfhausen brewery.

1003
01:17:32,677 --> 01:17:36,010
You should have the balls
to take back what is yours.

1004
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:37,772
Wow, you even talk like a whore.

1005
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:42,848
We are all whores in some way,
Mr. Finkelstein.

1006
01:17:43,754 --> 01:17:44,846
She's right.

1007
01:17:45,022 --> 01:17:48,549
<i>You boys are a team, und a good one.</i>

1008
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,759
If you can't do it for your grandfather
or your country or your dead friend...

1009
01:17:54,031 --> 01:17:56,329
...do it for yourselves.

1010
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:58,662
-I'm in.
-Me too.

1011
01:17:58,836 --> 01:18:00,701
-Hell, yeah! I'm in.
-Yeah!

1012
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:03,704
-Yeah!
-I can't do it.

1013
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:07,774
I can't play Pong.

1014
01:18:09,847 --> 01:18:12,475
It happened a couple years after college.

1015
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:17,011
I was in Thailand,
playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

1016
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:22,221
I was in a real high-stakes game
in some opium den.

1017
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:26,554
Turned out the guys I was playing
aren't the kind of guys who like to lose.

1018
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,399
After I beat them...

1019
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:31,768
...they beat me.

1020
01:18:33,371 --> 01:18:35,805
Worked me over pretty good.

1021
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:40,503
And this is hard to say...

1022
01:18:41,946 --> 01:18:44,039
...but they held me down...

1023
01:18:45,983 --> 01:18:48,281
...and they shoved
a Ping-Pong paddle up my ass.

1024
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,054
It's never been the same.

1025
01:18:56,394 --> 01:18:58,225
I'm damaged goods.

1026
01:18:58,396 --> 01:18:59,727
Gosh, Barry, I'm so sorry.

1027
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:03,424
I don't know what I would do if somebody
shoved a paddle handle up my ass.

1028
01:19:05,136 --> 01:19:06,433
Wasn't the handle.

1029
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:11,967
I've been shitting pancakes ever since.

1030
01:19:14,445 --> 01:19:16,538
Mr. Badrinath...

1031
01:19:16,981 --> 01:19:20,041
...we are not so different, you and I.

1032
01:19:21,752 --> 01:19:24,152
I've had all kinds of things
shoved up my ass.

1033
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,755
I got over it.

1034
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,585
You will too.

1035
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,668
You will too.

1036
01:19:48,579 --> 01:19:50,638
-So much to digest in there.
-Yeah.

1037
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:52,248
Calgon, take me away.

1038
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,612
You guys are my family.

1039
01:19:56,987 --> 01:19:58,284
Without you, I got nothing.

1040
01:20:02,593 --> 01:20:03,924
Let's do this for Landfill...

1041
01:20:04,695 --> 01:20:06,390
...and for Johan...

1042
01:20:06,564 --> 01:20:08,395
...and for Great Gam Gam.

1043
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:17,501
One question.

1044
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:19,973
Who we gonna get to replace Landfill?

1045
01:20:21,612 --> 01:20:24,740
Now, this is the party
I was hoping to find.

1046
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:28,652
Landfill? You're alive?

1047
01:20:30,321 --> 01:20:33,620
No, I'm not Landfill.

1048
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:37,325
I'm Landfill's twin brother, Gil.

1049
01:20:37,495 --> 01:20:38,723
-Gil?
-Gil?

1050
01:20:38,896 --> 01:20:42,332
I taught Landfill
everything he knew about drinking beer.

1051
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,492
I wanna fulfill his legacy
by taking his place on your team.

1052
01:20:47,171 --> 01:20:49,731
-You must be Fink.
-How'd you know?

1053
01:20:49,907 --> 01:20:51,704
Landfill told me everything about you.

1054
01:20:51,876 --> 01:20:53,707
I feel like I know all you guys.

1055
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:56,608
So we won't have that awkward
get-to-know-each-other stage.

1056
01:20:56,781 --> 01:20:59,306
-Perfect.
-And if I could just ask one favor.

1057
01:20:59,483 --> 01:21:02,850
-Name it.
-lf it wouldn't be too uncomfortable...

1058
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:07,354
...I was hoping maybe you guys
could call me Landfill, in honor of him.

1059
01:21:07,525 --> 01:21:09,152
-Yeah, sure, sure.
-Sure.

1060
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:11,055
It'd be like we never lost Landfill.

1061
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:13,788
Landfill...

1062
01:21:13,964 --> 01:21:17,024
...it would be an honor
if you would join us.

1063
01:21:22,506 --> 01:21:24,235
Cheers.

1064
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:28,302
Oh, my God, he's faster than Landfill.

1065
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:45,720
Oh, my God, what is that, bratwurst?

1066
01:21:46,397 --> 01:21:50,060
-He even smells like Landfill.
-God, someone open a window, fast.

1067
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:51,730
Wait!

1068
01:21:51,902 --> 01:21:56,430
-I wanna bask in it.
-Yeah, yeah. Just let it be.

1069
01:21:57,575 --> 01:22:00,066
Welcome back, Landfill.

1070
01:22:01,712 --> 01:22:04,374
Hey, let's go get sour on some Krauts.

1071
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:05,810
Yeah!

1072
01:22:05,983 --> 01:22:08,543
-Yeah!
-Come on!

1073
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,778
Yeah!

1074
01:22:57,501 --> 01:23:01,062
Landfill Two,
you are twice the man Landfill One was.

1075
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:03,433
Well, thank you, little lady.

1076
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,672
Yeah!

1077
01:23:33,404 --> 01:23:34,701
Are we lost?

1078
01:23:35,873 --> 01:23:39,274
The thing about it is, you know,
we were shit-faced when he took us there.

1079
01:23:39,443 --> 01:23:41,377
-What?
-Really drunk.

1080
01:23:41,545 --> 01:23:44,776
We been training for an entire year,
lost our jobs and our family...

1081
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:47,918
-...and you don't know where this is?
-You haven't been training.

1082
01:23:48,085 --> 01:23:50,553
-Can it, college boy!
-"College boy"? I thought you--

1083
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:55,215
-Hey, guys. Please, give it a rest.
-You know what? I got an idea.

1084
01:23:55,392 --> 01:23:57,451
It might work. I did this study in college:

1085
01:23:57,628 --> 01:24:00,688
Finkelstein's Theory on Effects of Alcohol
on the Temporal Lobes.

1086
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:02,695
-English.
-Drunken recall.

1087
01:24:02,866 --> 01:24:07,064
I made people drink massive quantities, then
taught things while they were blacked out.

1088
01:24:07,237 --> 01:24:09,637
Now, in the morning,
they had no recollection of it.

1089
01:24:09,807 --> 01:24:12,332
But when I got them drunk again,
they remembered.

1090
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:15,273
-Bullshit.
-Now you're coming after me?

1091
01:24:15,446 --> 01:24:18,210
Cowboy on one side,
Indian on the other. It's the Wild West.

1092
01:24:18,716 --> 01:24:20,149
-I got it published.
-Where?

1093
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:24,344
<i>Maxim magazine, under the title
"E Equals MC Hammered."</i>

1094
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:27,747
-All right, let's do this.
-Which one of you two was more wasted?

1095
01:24:27,925 --> 01:24:29,825
-He was.
-He was.

1096
01:24:29,994 --> 01:24:33,088
All right, okay, I was.
I actually hadn't eaten much that day.

1097
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:42,163
Anything?

1098
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:45,274
Sorry. But I have been training
for a beer-drinking competition.

1099
01:24:47,645 --> 01:24:49,340
Drink.

1100
01:24:58,389 --> 01:25:01,552
-Sober as a bird.
-All right. Enough fucking around.

1101
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,094
Here. Try this.

1102
01:25:36,694 --> 01:25:38,423
The password!

1103
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:53,271
-That was great.
-That was last year's password!

1104
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:54,433
Oh, come on.

1105
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:56,977
-That's cheap.
-Shit.

1106
01:25:58,882 --> 01:26:00,907
I got an idea.

1107
01:26:04,388 --> 01:26:05,878
The pa--!

1108
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:50,226
Silence.

1109
01:26:53,937 --> 01:26:56,497
The old Trojan keg.

1110
01:26:57,007 --> 01:26:58,907
Very clever for Americans.

1111
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:02,269
-Now get them out of here.
-Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1112
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,877
We're here to honor our grandfather,
Johan von Wolfhausen.

1113
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:09,177
The stableboy thief?

1114
01:27:09,353 --> 01:27:11,082
No. Your half-brother.

1115
01:27:11,455 --> 01:27:15,892
Your older half-brother and rightful heir
to the von Wolfhausen brewery.

1116
01:27:16,059 --> 01:27:17,390
Oh, please.

1117
01:27:17,561 --> 01:27:19,529
Johan wasn't even Ludwig's
true offspring.

1118
01:27:19,696 --> 01:27:21,857
No?

1119
01:27:24,668 --> 01:27:26,067
Look at the portrait.

1120
01:27:27,437 --> 01:27:29,769
Not a true offspring?

1121
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,931
I'd say it looks pretty close to me, eh?

1122
01:27:32,109 --> 01:27:34,441
You know the von Wolfhausen brewery
is our brewery.

1123
01:27:34,611 --> 01:27:39,548
Even if your silly fairy tale was true,
we have a little saying in München.

1124
01:27:39,716 --> 01:27:41,707
Get the fuck out of here.

1125
01:27:41,885 --> 01:27:44,012
-Guards.
-Wait, wait!

1126
01:27:44,621 --> 01:27:46,088
We came here to drink some beer.

1127
01:27:46,523 --> 01:27:50,152
Are you gonna let us do that, or are you
afraid of getting your asses stomped?

1128
01:27:50,994 --> 01:27:52,461
Let them drink!

1129
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:54,995
Yeah! Let them compete!

1130
01:27:55,165 --> 01:27:56,757
<i>Let them drink!</i>

1131
01:27:56,934 --> 01:27:58,094
<i>Let them drink!</i>

1132
01:27:58,268 --> 01:27:59,496
<i>Let them drink!</i>

1133
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:00,762
<i>Let them drink!</i>

1134
01:28:00,938 --> 01:28:03,133
Grandpapa, we've crushed them once.

1135
01:28:03,307 --> 01:28:04,740
Let us do it again, huh?

1136
01:28:04,908 --> 01:28:07,172
Let us humiliate them.

1137
01:28:07,344 --> 01:28:08,777
Please, Opy, we can do this.

1138
01:28:08,946 --> 01:28:10,743
-We can do it.
-Yeah.

1139
01:28:10,914 --> 01:28:12,506
Okay.

1140
01:28:12,683 --> 01:28:14,150
Why not? For shits and giggle.

1141
01:28:14,318 --> 01:28:15,410
Let them drink!

1142
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:06,299
Beer drinkers...

1143
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,267
...welcome to Beerfest.

1144
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,968
-Yeah!
-Come on!

1145
01:29:13,377 --> 01:29:15,641
You are the privileged few.

1146
01:29:16,546 --> 01:29:18,241
We got the Brits in Round One.

1147
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:22,051
We already kicked their asses in WWll.

1148
01:29:22,219 --> 01:29:24,210
Cheerio, let's do it again.

1149
01:29:24,388 --> 01:29:27,050
Drink well. Drink with honor.

1150
01:29:27,224 --> 01:29:28,851
Let the games begin.

1151
01:29:31,662 --> 01:29:36,497
<i>Beerfest! Beerfest! Beerfest!</i>

1152
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,401
First round is best of five.

1153
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:44,563
U.S.A. versus England.

1154
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:47,710
You're all fur coat
and no trousers, you are.

1155
01:29:47,878 --> 01:29:50,039
-I'm sorry. One more time?
-Shove off!

1156
01:29:50,213 --> 01:29:54,172
We're gonna put the skitters
in your Alan Whickers, you plonker!

1157
01:29:54,651 --> 01:29:58,917
-Do you know what he's saying?
-Volume Chug!

1158
01:30:00,357 --> 01:30:03,383
Come on, big boy.
What, are you gonna fucking cry?

1159
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,188
That's all you, Landfill. All you.

1160
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,488
Come on!

1161
01:30:11,435 --> 01:30:14,666
Come on, motherfucker! It's time!

1162
01:30:14,838 --> 01:30:19,002
Come on, baby. It's all you, buddy.
Drink it down.

1163
01:31:43,493 --> 01:31:47,520
How about this? How about that?
How about:

1164
01:31:47,697 --> 01:31:51,497
Now, how do I say this? The Mexican.

1165
01:32:45,355 --> 01:32:49,815
Championship round,
Germany versus U.S.A.

1166
01:33:00,036 --> 01:33:03,028
All right. This is what we came for,
the Germans!

1167
01:33:03,206 --> 01:33:05,504
Yeah, the Germans!

1168
01:33:08,278 --> 01:33:09,438
Oh, that's good.

1169
01:33:09,613 --> 01:33:12,081
Oh, my God.

1170
01:33:12,249 --> 01:33:14,046
Oh, my God.

1171
01:33:14,217 --> 01:33:15,377
Oh, my God!

1172
01:33:15,552 --> 01:33:16,541
What's up, Finky?

1173
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,188
I got it. Beating the boot.
It's so simple.

1174
01:33:19,789 --> 01:33:24,317
It's all about fluid dynamics
and quantum bubblenautics. Follow?

1175
01:33:24,895 --> 01:33:27,955
I missed that first part
when he said something.

1176
01:33:28,131 --> 01:33:31,726
Pay attention. I'm only doing this once,
okay? Excuse me!

1177
01:33:32,869 --> 01:33:34,302
Do me a favor, top me off.

1178
01:33:35,472 --> 01:33:38,464
Thank you. Okay.

1179
01:33:38,642 --> 01:33:41,543
Now, look. The bubble is essentially
a high-pressure vacuum...

1180
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:44,111
...that grows and grows
until it gets to the heel...

1181
01:33:44,281 --> 01:33:46,681
...then it pops and explodes
out of the boot. Okay?

1182
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:49,478
So, what you wanna do
is create a spiral effect...

1183
01:33:49,653 --> 01:33:51,780
...by spinning the boot
and making a whirlpool.

1184
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:54,617
When the bubble hits the corner,
gravity will take over...

1185
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:56,452
...and shoot beer down your throats.

1186
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:58,992
So, what you're saying is,
when the bubble comes...

1187
01:33:59,162 --> 01:34:00,527
...just turn the boot.

1188
01:34:00,697 --> 01:34:04,292
If we find ourselves in a
boot challenge, we can beat these guys.

1189
01:34:05,168 --> 01:34:07,193
Way to go, Finky.

1190
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:10,635
All right.
Let's light this Kraut candle.

1191
01:34:10,807 --> 01:34:12,638
Yeah!

1192
01:34:14,311 --> 01:34:16,677
I'm still peeing! I'm still going!

1193
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:24,180
<i>We're gonna wipe our schwanz on you.</i>

1194
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:26,618
<i>Bring it on, meine bitch.</i>

1195
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,089
Championship round is best of seven.

1196
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,750
<i>Und jetzt...</i>

1197
01:34:31,928 --> 01:34:37,059
...for the ultimate battle!

1198
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:44,830
<i>First up, long-distance krügerbounce.</i>

1199
01:34:45,008 --> 01:34:48,967
Distance, 10 meters.

1200
01:34:49,913 --> 01:34:51,437
What do you say, Barr?

1201
01:34:51,615 --> 01:34:53,549
Watch and learn.

1202
01:34:58,989 --> 01:35:01,787
Shaking your butt.

1203
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:05,359
Move the bucket 20 meters.

1204
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:08,319
Twenty meters!

1205
01:35:08,498 --> 01:35:10,864
Twenty meters.
You're never gonna make it.

1206
01:35:11,034 --> 01:35:12,160
Oh, yeah?

1207
01:35:12,335 --> 01:35:14,496
Thirty meters.

1208
01:35:14,671 --> 01:35:16,366
Thirty meters.

1209
01:35:16,539 --> 01:35:19,064
Okay. Let's see it.

1210
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:27,138
Yeah!

1211
01:35:39,896 --> 01:35:42,831
Germany, the winner!

1212
01:35:44,034 --> 01:35:45,262
It's okay. It's okay.

1213
01:36:00,016 --> 01:36:01,984
Yes!

1214
01:36:05,388 --> 01:36:06,480
<i>U.S.A. sucks!</i>

1215
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,190
Germany, three.

1216
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:12,328
U.S.A., zero.

1217
01:36:12,495 --> 01:36:17,728
If Germany wins, they are the champions!

1218
01:36:22,072 --> 01:36:25,132
Hold. Hold on. Wait a minute.
Hold the phones.

1219
01:36:25,308 --> 01:36:26,605
Herr Referee...

1220
01:36:26,776 --> 01:36:29,836
...there is an American player
who has not competed in any event.

1221
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:32,880
And the rule says every competitor
must compete, otherwise...

1222
01:36:33,049 --> 01:36:34,482
...disqualification.

1223
01:36:34,651 --> 01:36:35,743
Hold on there, Hansel.

1224
01:36:35,919 --> 01:36:37,614
That is the rule.

1225
01:36:37,787 --> 01:36:40,017
Your fifth teammate must compete now.

1226
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:42,522
Are you talking about me?

1227
01:36:48,765 --> 01:36:52,565
Jan, if we let him play, we're gonna
get slaughtered and it's over, kaput.

1228
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,465
You heard the guy.

1229
01:36:54,637 --> 01:36:56,366
I'll play with him.

1230
01:37:00,243 --> 01:37:01,267
Barry, are you sure?

1231
01:37:02,045 --> 01:37:03,103
Sure as schnitzel.

1232
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:12,546
Hey, Barr-zo, I'm proud of you.

1233
01:37:12,722 --> 01:37:14,349
Hey, thanks.

1234
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:18,984
Hey, Comrades, how about loser
takes a paddle up the ass?

1235
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:21,087
I like that.

1236
01:37:22,799 --> 01:37:23,857
Volley for serve.

1237
01:37:25,802 --> 01:37:28,293
You know you have to hit the ball.

1238
01:37:32,008 --> 01:37:33,873
What do you think about that, fuckhead?

1239
01:37:34,043 --> 01:37:36,534
Yeah, Barry, you got him. He's yours.

1240
01:37:42,385 --> 01:37:45,479
What do you think about that, headfuck?

1241
01:38:16,453 --> 01:38:18,011
Match point!

1242
01:38:18,188 --> 01:38:19,780
Come on, we gotta win this one.

1243
01:38:19,956 --> 01:38:22,550
You got nothing. Bring it.

1244
01:38:24,894 --> 01:38:26,555
Jiminy.

1245
01:38:28,665 --> 01:38:29,859
Come on, Barry.

1246
01:38:56,192 --> 01:38:57,420
Wow, what a shot!

1247
01:38:57,594 --> 01:39:01,030
Hey, Todd,
sorry about porking your wife, man.

1248
01:39:01,197 --> 01:39:04,462
Hey, Barry,
you can pork my wife anytime.

1249
01:39:09,405 --> 01:39:10,895
What's the name of the game?

1250
01:39:11,074 --> 01:39:12,063
Thumper!

1251
01:39:12,242 --> 01:39:13,732
And why do we play it?

1252
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:15,241
To get fucked up!

1253
01:39:25,555 --> 01:39:27,489
No! No!

1254
01:39:27,657 --> 01:39:31,320
No, I didn't! No, I did this!
No, I didn't! No, I didn't!

1255
01:39:31,494 --> 01:39:33,394
Bullshit! I did the--

1256
01:39:33,563 --> 01:39:36,623
Look at the scoreboard! Scoreboard!

1257
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:49,500
I'm burying you.

1258
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,169
You're not even close, girlie.

1259
01:39:51,381 --> 01:39:52,575
Halt!

1260
01:39:54,784 --> 01:39:57,617
You're worried now.
You're worried now, aren't you?

1261
01:40:03,293 --> 01:40:05,989
Take that. Moment of truth.

1262
01:40:06,162 --> 01:40:09,495
Germany, 224.

1263
01:40:10,533 --> 01:40:12,023
That's good, that's good.

1264
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:13,930
U.S.A...

1265
01:40:14,938 --> 01:40:17,805
...228.

1266
01:40:26,549 --> 01:40:29,313
All tied up. Sudden death.

1267
01:40:29,485 --> 01:40:32,283
You know what that means.

1268
01:40:32,455 --> 01:40:35,447
Das Boot!

1269
01:40:38,895 --> 01:40:40,226
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

1270
01:40:40,396 --> 01:40:42,660
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

1271
01:40:43,499 --> 01:40:45,797
Hey, guys, this is that moment.

1272
01:40:45,969 --> 01:40:48,062
The moment that only exists in sports.

1273
01:40:48,237 --> 01:40:50,637
The moment where the good guys
take on the bad guys.

1274
01:40:50,807 --> 01:40:53,139
The moment that,
if this was a speech in a movie...

1275
01:40:53,309 --> 01:40:55,436
...this would be shown
up on the humongotron...

1276
01:40:55,612 --> 01:40:58,513
...to get the home-team fans
fired up, huh? Right?

1277
01:40:58,681 --> 01:41:00,046
Us versus them!

1278
01:41:00,216 --> 01:41:02,309
We're the bad guys
and they're the good guys.

1279
01:41:02,485 --> 01:41:05,511
And I'll be damned
if we're gonna let the good guys win!

1280
01:41:05,688 --> 01:41:10,819
Yeah, we're actually the good guys
and they're the bad guys, so....

1281
01:41:10,994 --> 01:41:13,519
Right. Let me start that again,
guys, huh?

1282
01:41:13,696 --> 01:41:15,186
Hey, guys, this is that moment--

1283
01:41:15,365 --> 01:41:16,354
Fellas. Fellas.

1284
01:41:16,532 --> 01:41:19,831
I just wanna say
thanks for the greatest year of my life.

1285
01:41:20,003 --> 01:41:22,403
All right? And no matter what happens,
win or lose...

1286
01:41:22,572 --> 01:41:25,473
...drinking beer with you guys
is just plain old-fashioned fun.

1287
01:41:25,642 --> 01:41:27,303
Yeah. Yeah.

1288
01:41:27,477 --> 01:41:30,776
Hey, let's do this
for Grandpa Wolfhouse.

1289
01:41:30,947 --> 01:41:32,539
And for Landfill.

1290
01:41:32,715 --> 01:41:33,909
And Gam Gam?

1291
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:36,916
And America. On three. One, two, three:

1292
01:41:37,086 --> 01:41:40,249
Grandpa Wolfhouse, Landfill
and Gam Gam and America!

1293
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,589
Go, go, go!

1294
01:41:44,694 --> 01:41:49,393
Line Chug. Germany versus U.S.A.

1295
01:41:49,565 --> 01:41:51,795
Winner is champion...

1296
01:41:51,968 --> 01:41:56,200
...of Beerfest!

1297
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:58,272
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

1298
01:41:59,575 --> 01:42:01,736
Yeah, you can suck your own dick.

1299
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:05,140
We're gonna take you all the way--

1300
01:42:06,983 --> 01:42:09,577
-Cherry?
-Our finest secret agent.

1301
01:42:09,752 --> 01:42:11,913
We sent her to keep an eye on you.

1302
01:42:17,293 --> 01:42:18,658
Oh, hit that, Grandpapa.

1303
01:42:18,828 --> 01:42:21,023
Take what's yours, Grandpapa.

1304
01:42:21,197 --> 01:42:22,789
Damn, that's nasty.

1305
01:42:22,965 --> 01:42:25,627
Always bet on black. Yeah.

1306
01:42:25,802 --> 01:42:28,362
Yeah, always bet on black.
That's a great quote.

1307
01:42:28,538 --> 01:42:31,974
Game on. Not a drop can be spilled.

1308
01:42:35,244 --> 01:42:37,041
Shake it off.

1309
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:24,020
Hey, fatass, when I dropped
your brother in that vat...

1310
01:43:24,193 --> 01:43:25,888
...he squealed like a stuffed pig.

1311
01:43:32,401 --> 01:43:34,460
Germany!

1312
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:36,470
Did you hear what she said?

1313
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,537
Get out of here. Get out!

1314
01:43:43,713 --> 01:43:46,181
No, no. Hey, ump. Do something, ump.

1315
01:43:46,349 --> 01:43:47,543
Losers.

1316
01:43:49,652 --> 01:43:51,779
See you later, stableboy.

1317
01:43:51,954 --> 01:43:53,945
Say hello to the family whore.

1318
01:43:54,123 --> 01:43:58,719
<i>U.S.A. sucks! U.S.A. sucks!
U.S.A. sucks!</i>

1319
01:44:04,233 --> 01:44:05,598
Double or nothing.

1320
01:44:05,768 --> 01:44:07,633
On what, huh?

1321
01:44:07,804 --> 01:44:11,740
The von Wolfhausen family recipe.

1322
01:44:12,508 --> 01:44:14,772
You win, you get to keep it.

1323
01:44:15,611 --> 01:44:18,774
We win, we get your brewery.

1324
01:44:18,948 --> 01:44:21,007
Or should I say our brewery?

1325
01:44:21,184 --> 01:44:24,449
But we already have the recipe.

1326
01:44:26,055 --> 01:44:28,148
I got it off of the nerd's computer.

1327
01:44:29,525 --> 01:44:31,686
-You're fucked.
-Yeah, he's fucked.

1328
01:44:35,164 --> 01:44:37,325
-That's rich, Baron.
-What's so funny?

1329
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,434
I didn't put that recipe on my computer.

1330
01:44:40,236 --> 01:44:45,037
However, you are holding the recipe
for a low-carb strawberry beer.

1331
01:44:45,641 --> 01:44:48,132
We call it She-Wolf. It's okay.

1332
01:44:48,311 --> 01:44:50,472
Strawberry?

1333
01:44:52,014 --> 01:44:53,982
No. No. You know how
you like strawberries?

1334
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:56,618
You want me to lose weight,
so that was the low-carb--

1335
01:44:56,786 --> 01:44:59,584
Wait a minute, we like strawberry--
Get your damn hands off--

1336
01:44:59,755 --> 01:45:02,747
You're trying to see my panties.
Goddamn it, put me down, please!

1337
01:45:02,925 --> 01:45:07,692
Where are the Africans?
Can the Africans come help me? Jesus!

1338
01:45:10,766 --> 01:45:13,257
So are we gonna play for the recipe...

1339
01:45:13,436 --> 01:45:16,599
...or should I just roll it up
and eat it? I'm hungry.

1340
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:19,707
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait!

1341
01:45:19,876 --> 01:45:21,468
Put your money where your mouth is.

1342
01:45:21,644 --> 01:45:25,944
Us against you. Ten boots.
Five against five.

1343
01:45:26,115 --> 01:45:29,744
You couldn't even do one boot.
You can barely stand!

1344
01:45:32,121 --> 01:45:33,110
Grandpapa?

1345
01:45:33,756 --> 01:45:36,850
Take the bet, you fucking pussy.

1346
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:43,858
Okay. Crush the bastards.

1347
01:45:44,967 --> 01:45:47,527
And then I want spectator number one
killed.

1348
01:45:47,703 --> 01:45:51,195
Yeah, this is going to be like taking
black walnut candy from the baby.

1349
01:45:51,374 --> 01:45:54,537
<i>That's very funny, Deutschbag.
Only thing is:</i>

1350
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:59,409
One, we're not babies, and two--

1351
01:45:59,582 --> 01:46:01,777
We're not that drunk.

1352
01:46:03,686 --> 01:46:07,144
They're not that drunk. Cheeky bastards.

1353
01:46:07,323 --> 01:46:11,089
<i>They're not that drunk!
They're not that drunk!</i>

1354
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:14,423
<i>They're not that drunk!
They're not that drunk!</i>

1355
01:46:14,597 --> 01:46:16,360
<i>They're not that drunk!</i>

1356
01:46:16,532 --> 01:46:18,329
Five boots? Are you fucking mental?

1357
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:19,968
Trust me, we can do this.

1358
01:46:20,136 --> 01:46:22,229
Just spin the boot
when the bubble comes.

1359
01:46:22,405 --> 01:46:23,872
Trust me, this will work.

1360
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,440
Gentlemen. Ready?

1361
01:46:26,609 --> 01:46:29,237
Good luck. You're going to need it.

1362
01:46:30,846 --> 01:46:34,247
<i>Das Boot!</i>

1363
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:36,578
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

1364
01:47:00,743 --> 01:47:02,608
<i>Deutschland, you're floored!</i>

1365
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,808
Look, the little one looks like he has
pubic hair all over his head.

1366
01:47:07,984 --> 01:47:10,953
It's okay, it works.
Yeah, because you have a dickface.

1367
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,111
You son of a bitch!

1368
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:16,081
Yeah.

1369
01:47:16,258 --> 01:47:19,489
I accidentally pushed his thingy off.

1370
01:47:21,063 --> 01:47:23,554
That's a great one. Dickface.

1371
01:47:26,669 --> 01:47:28,034
Fink's got the eye of the Jew.

1372
01:47:28,204 --> 01:47:31,298
He's got the eye of the Jew.
Fink's our anchorman.

1373
01:47:31,474 --> 01:47:34,773
Come on. Trust me. Trust me.

1374
01:47:36,379 --> 01:47:38,210
You just blew it, Friedrich.

1375
01:47:45,921 --> 01:47:47,582
Spin it.

1376
01:47:47,757 --> 01:47:48,781
Come on.

1377
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:57,765
Spin it.

1378
01:48:06,442 --> 01:48:07,636
Spin it.

1379
01:48:33,035 --> 01:48:36,232
Drink, Fink. Drink, Fink. Drink, Fink.

1380
01:48:36,405 --> 01:48:41,001
<i>Drink, Fink, drink! Drink, Fink, drink!
Drink, Fink, drink!</i>

1381
01:49:15,444 --> 01:49:17,105

01:49:37,533 --> 01:49:41,401
<i>U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.</i>

1383
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:19,765
A little R and R in Amsterdam.
Just what the doctor ordered.

1384
01:50:19,942 --> 01:50:23,400
You know, I came to a conference
here once. Hookerthon 2002.

1385
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:24,978
Fantastic seminars.

1386
01:50:25,147 --> 01:50:26,307
Sounds fun.

1387
01:50:26,482 --> 01:50:29,849
Nothing but the best for the executives
of von Wolfhausen brewery, right?

1388
01:50:30,019 --> 01:50:31,179
That's right.

1389
01:50:31,353 --> 01:50:34,652
Hey, guys, where are we?

1390
01:50:34,823 --> 01:50:39,192
I think the hotel is this way?

1391
01:50:39,361 --> 01:50:40,453
You gotta be kidding me.

1392
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:42,392
Hold on. Let me check.

1393
01:50:43,632 --> 01:50:45,361
No, I think it's that way.

1394
01:50:50,606 --> 01:50:52,267
Hey.

1395
01:50:52,441 --> 01:50:54,841
-Holy crap, Willie Nelson.
-What are you doing here?

1396
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:57,137
It's a funny story.
I was invited over here...

1397
01:50:57,313 --> 01:51:00,339
...for this big, secret, international,
pot-smoking competition.

1398
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:04,551
My teammates, Cheech and Chong,
chickened out on me.

1399
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,779
They wouldn't fly
in my biodiesel airplane...

1400
01:51:06,956 --> 01:51:10,483
...and the smoke-out's in 30 minutes
and I don't wanna get disqualified.

1401
01:51:10,659 --> 01:51:13,628
Now, you guys don't wanna
be my teammates, do you?

1402
01:51:13,796 --> 01:51:15,787
Yeah!

1403
01:51:17,433 --> 01:51:20,266
Let's do it. Did you hear one
about the guy that told his son:

1404
01:51:20,436 --> 01:51:22,427
"If you don't quit masturbating,
you'll go blind."

1405
01:51:22,605 --> 01:51:24,300
He said, "Dad, I'm over here."

1406
01:51:45,861 --> 01:51:47,886
Oh, you guys fancy yourselves
drinkers, huh?

1407
01:51:48,063 --> 01:51:50,827
Yeah, maybe a little bit.
I think we just won the--

1408
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,730
Yeah, I think we just--
Yeah, I think we just--

1409
01:51:53,902 --> 01:51:55,995
What the hell is going on? Yeah.

1410
01:52:01,076 --> 01:52:04,409
-Bastards.
-I was playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

1411
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,411
I was-- I saw that.

1412
01:52:06,582 --> 01:52:09,915
Turned out, the guys I was playing--
The guys-- Okay.

1413
01:52:10,085 --> 01:52:12,610
I was playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

1414
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:16,353
I mean, come on. Cut it.

1415
01:52:16,525 --> 01:52:18,720
This sweet nectar was my lifeblood.

1416
01:52:19,461 --> 01:52:21,588
Oh, yeah, Landfill.
Go for it, my friend.

1417
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:23,197
He's got it going on, this guy.

1418
01:52:23,365 --> 01:52:24,627
Are we playing or not?

1419
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,098
<i>Time to scheiße off the--</i>

1420
01:52:27,636 --> 01:52:28,796
Are we playing or not?

1421
01:52:28,971 --> 01:52:31,030
<i>Time to scheiße on our--</i>

1422
01:52:31,206 --> 01:52:32,764
Are we playing or not?

1423
01:52:32,941 --> 01:52:35,569
<i>Time to scheiße or get off the crap.</i>

1424
01:52:35,744 --> 01:52:37,371
Crapper.

1425
01:52:43,352 --> 01:52:44,876
Okay, come back in, do it again.

1426
01:52:45,054 --> 01:52:46,385
All right.

1427
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:48,918
Everybody's drunk.

1428
01:52:55,631 --> 01:52:58,156
And cut it. Cut.

1429
01:53:07,242 --> 01:53:10,109
One question. Who are we gonna get--?

1430
01:53:12,648 --> 01:53:14,081
Do I know you?

1431
01:53:14,983 --> 01:53:17,076
Me? No. No, I don't think so.

1432
01:53:17,252 --> 01:53:20,744
Well, you look familiar.
Didn't I pay you a dollar for something?

1433
01:53:21,523 --> 01:53:23,548
No, no. Wasn't me, no.

1434
01:53:23,726 --> 01:53:26,752
I remember now. I paid you a dollar
to touch your toes...

1435
01:53:26,929 --> 01:53:28,590
...and then touch your dick.

1436
01:53:30,566 --> 01:53:32,397
Yeah, that could have been me.

1437
01:53:33,602 --> 01:53:35,160
Good to see you again.

1438
01:53:36,605 --> 01:53:40,006
I wish it were winter. We could make it
into ice blocks and skate on it...

1439
01:53:40,175 --> 01:53:42,575
...and then melt it in the springtime
and drink it.

1440
01:53:49,351 --> 01:53:50,340
All right, cut it.

1441
01:53:50,519 --> 01:53:52,111
Cut.

1442
01:56:22,704 --> 01:56:24,695
