38

were left up to my dad.

she'd know exactly what to say.

163
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,529
(whimpers)

164
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,015
You better keep this.
You clearly need the practice!

165
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,016
(boy) Whoa, dude!

166
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,919
Come on, Dinks.

167
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,696
You do realize you just showed up
the school's tight end?

168
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,256
I hope he's second string.

169
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,529
Tyler Prince.
Beta president.

170
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:12,901
Sydney White.
No title.

171
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,437
Sorry.
This is Dinky.

172
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,176
But we're gonna be late
to ourfirst rush party, so if you'll excuse us...

173
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,947
Oh, um,
maybe he could help us find ourway.

174
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,921
We're going to Kappa.
Mm-hm.

175
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,484
All right, ladies.
Let me be your Greek guide.

176
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,854
Each house has a reputation.

177
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,989
There's the Gamma Phis.

178
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,864
They're, uh... perky.
(all squeal)

179
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:45,995
Very perky.
Lots of cheerleaders.

180
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,668
And here's Pi Beta Omega.

181
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:53,234
Those girls can out-party
any fraternity on campus.

182
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:57,506
What was the first house?
The one with the Junior Tiger Guide?

183
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,984
Uh, that would be the Vortex.
That's a weird name for a fraternity.

184
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:04,352
It's not a fraternity.
It started off as overflow student housing.

185
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:06,516
Now it's just kinda there.

186
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,092
Here's our stop.
Kappa Phi Nu.

187
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:23,769
Well, thank you for the tour, Tyler.
Yeah, th...

188
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:26,243
Sydney, you know what?
I'm gonna meet you inside.

189
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,870
Why?

190
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,380
(mouths words)

191
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:36,151
The illegally blondes...
You? Really?

192
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,248
Yeah.
I... Is it the shoes?

193
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:41,691
(chuckles) No.
I love the shoes.

194
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,128
The Kappas are just alittle... intense.

195
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:47,359
Oh, well,
it was actually my mother's house.

196
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:51,096
Ah. Legacy.
Is she all over you about rushing?

197
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,638
No.
She... died nine years ago.

198
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,902
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's OK.

199
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,676
Kappas could use a girl like you.
I should know - they're our sister sorority.

200
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,049
Oh!
So we'll be like brother and sister!

201
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,218
Not in, you know,
the related, familial way,

202
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,260
but, you know,
more in the fraternal, sororal...

203
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:19,765
Sororital? Is that a word?
Sorry. I kinda tend to overtalk when I'm nervous.

204
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:23,461
It's a disease, one without a cure.
So stop me any time, please.

205
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:25,970
You're nervous?
Oh... No.

206
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,563
No, it's not you.
Tyler, was it?

207
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,007
No, it's because of the whole rush,
you know?

208
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,308
The very term "rush" is an amper-upper.
It amps up the old nerves.

209
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,575
I have to go.

210
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,948
(chatter)

211
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,924
OK, ladies.
Listen up.

212
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,985
The doors are about to open.
Our objective is?

213
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:52,053
(all) Target cute pledges.

214
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,725
Exactly.
And what do we want to avoid?

215
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,825
(all) Fatlosers.

216
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,496
Now, now.
We all remember the code.

217
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,803
When I ask you to show a girl
to the "koi pond," ditch her.

218
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:08,344
We also have two legacies coming today -
Dinky Hodgekiss and Sydney White.

219
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:11,349
When you meet them,
find me immediately.

220
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,282
OK, girls.
Are we ready?

221
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,922
(all chant)
Here comes a Kappa, queen of the Row.

222
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,221
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.

223
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:24,286
She's got style, she's got class,

224
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:27,594
and from behind a kicking...

225
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,295
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

226
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:33,805
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

227
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,603
Excuse me, Amy.
Don't you remember?

228
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,338
You've been reassigned.
Kitchen duty.

229
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,403
Go on.

230
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:49,280
That's what happens when you gain 27 pounds
of breakup weight over the summer.

231
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,347
(all chant)
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

232
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,052
(screaming)

233
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,118
Kappa! (giggles)
Kappa! Kappa!

234
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:59,323
Hey.

235
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,889
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

236
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,958
(chanting continues)

237
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,436
Hey!

238
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,276
We've been dating for two years.
I love him so much!

239
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,507
And next week,
he's gonna pin me.

240
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,515
Pin you to what?

241
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,881
Hi.
Hi.

242
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,680
(girl) Hi there.
Oh, hi.

243
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm Katy and this is Christy.

244
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,451
I'm Sydney White.

245
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:02,756
You're one of ourlegacies.
Rachel's gonna be so excited!

246
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,564
Rachel, we'd like you
to meet someone.

247
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,032
Oh...

248
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,399
Hi.

249
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,631
Girls, why don't you show
this one the koi pond?

250
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:14,900
Ooh! I love koi ponds.

251
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:17,306
Great.
Off you go.

252
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,134
This is Sydney White.

253
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,113
Three words - Leg-a-cy

254
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,917
Sydney, so pleased to meet you.

255
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:30,319
I'm so excited.
My mom had a great experience here.

256
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:34,018
Katy, have you offered our guest a drink
from the refreshment table?

257
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm actually not that thirst...
No, no. Katy.

258
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,497
The refreshment table?

259
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:47,704
We have a situation.
That girl is not Kappa material.

260
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:50,571
(Christy) Really?
I didn't see anything wrong with her.

261
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,578
Christy, you know you're not
as perceptive as I am.

262
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,910
She wouldn't know
her Gucci from her Pucci.

263
00:18:55,981 --> 00:19:00,509
Not to mention, I saw her throwing herself
all over Tyler before she came in the house.

264
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:05,717
It was embarrassing. Trust me,
we do not want a Kappa who behaves that way.

265
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,684
See what I mean?

266
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,732
But we have to give her a bid.
She's alegacy.

267
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:20,728
Her mom gets her the bid,
but she has to survive pledging all on her own.

268
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:38,414
Oh, my gosh. I saw him outside,
and he is definitely the hottest guy on campus.

269
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,959
Who's the hottest guy on campus?

270
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,654
Tyler Prince,
the Beta president.

271
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,289
Oh, you know, I know that guy.
He was really nice.

272
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:48,356
He showed me around Greek Row.

273
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:52,234
Offlimits. He's Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh.

274
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,499
Yeah, they're off now,
but they'll be on again.

275
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,973
It's all part of
Rachel's 20-year plan.

276
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,510
He'll be a top litigator,
she'll be a senator.

277
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,741
It's so romantic.
Yeah, it does sound romantic.

278
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:06,842
Because there it nothing more romantic
than a 20-year plan. Am I right, ladies?

279
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,910
(laughs)

280
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,884
So, Sydney,
where does your dad work?

281
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,860
Oh, he works mostly on construction sites.
Oh.

282
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,889
My uncle's made a mint building malls.
So, your dad's a developer, too?

283
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:25,198
Yeah...
something like that.

284
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,600
(Rachel) Night, girls.
Get your beauty rest.

285
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,168
Now that you're Kappa pledges,
it's a requirement.

286
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:38,012
(all) ? Lay you down, dear sweet pledge

287
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,780
? Lay your head on the pillow

288
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:45,290
? May you have lovely dreams

289
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:48,554
? Just as lovely as you are

290
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,935
(Sydney)
Has anyone found the koi pond?

291
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,444
(airhorns blasting)

292
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:20,551
It's 12:01!
Welcome to hell, skanks!

293
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:25,689
Over the next week, we'll be conducting
what I like to call..."pledge enlightenment."

294
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:30,133
We're not allowed to call it "hazing,"
not afterwhat happened to Suzie.

295
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,737
We're gonna find out which of you
Prada princesses has what it takes to be a Kappa,

296
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,538
and which of you don't.

297
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:41,739
This is yourfirst pledge task -
the date dash.

298
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:46,183
You have until 12:15 to find a date
and meet me at the State Street Diner.

299
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:50,654
No changing clothes, no makeup,
no brushing your hair or teeth!

300
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,591
You have 15 minutes!
Let's go!

301
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,288
Go! Go!

302
00:21:57,363 --> 00:22:00,457
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

303
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,325
(girl) Come on!

304
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,566
Dinky! Dinky! What do we do?
Oh, you just grab a guy.

305
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:15,671
Excuse me, sugar.
Can I borrow you for a date dash?

306
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,875
(laughs) Hurry up, girl. Come on.
OK.

307
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,178
Come on!

308
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,652
(boy) Ah-choo!

309
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,488
Hello? Hello?!

310
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,585
Uh... Oh, uh, sorry.

311
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,324
I'm sorry. Uh...

312
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:35,765
Hi. Uh... I'm sorry I startled you.
Can you? Can you help me?

313
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,768
Ah-choo!
OK.

314
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,131
Thanks.
Sure.

315
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,675
Ah-choo! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, thanks.

316
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:46,973
What are you doing
in a, uh, bush?

317
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:51,483
I don't know what happened. I was walking home
and this crazed pack of girls came toward me.

318
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,450
So I dove for cover.

319
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,653
Yeah, vision not impaired.
Sense of balance restored.

320
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,055
Feeling in fingers and toes.
No visible...

321
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,322
Wait!
You're a guy, right?

322
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,625
(uncertainly) Yeah.

323
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:09,327
What are you doing now?
I'm waiting for an antihistamine to take effect.

324
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,392
I need you to be my date.

325
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,836
(laughs)
Your date?

326
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,931
Yeah.
Let's go.

327
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:19,307
Oh, um, watch out.
When I get this excited, I tend to throw up.

328
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,710
It's OK. Just tell me when to duck.
OK.

329
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:36,559
(Sydney) Let's go!
Oh, um, no. I... I...

330
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:39,062
(plates clatter)

331
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,294
What's good?

332
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,840
Wonderful. You just made it.

333
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,038
(Sydney) How's the BLT?

334
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,306
Mm!

335
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,883
Oh, my God.
Look at herwith that pie.

336
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,657
It's a so-rority, not a ho-rority.

337
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:16,394
So, tell me about the Vortex.

338
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,231
What's itlike?

339
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:21,033
Uh...

340
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:26,169
I guess you'd call it a, uh... haven,
uh, for people who don't have anywhere else to go.

341
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:31,945
Some of us didn't get along with our roommates,
some of us made others feel uncomfortable.

342
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,679
Some of us wet the bed.

343
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,721
Some of us wet the hallway.

344
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,724
Uh, all of us are outsiders.

345
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,891
Yeah, I know what that's like.

346
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,830
Uh, are you serious?
You're a Kappa pledge.

347
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,266
By definition, very much an insider.

348
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:53,202
Would all the Kappa pledges
join me over here for a moment?

349
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:56,469
OK. I guess I'll be right back.
Yes.

350
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:02,139
OK, girls.
It's time for your next pledge task.

351
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,614
The date-dash ditch.

352
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,743
This year's unsuitable date
belongs to...

353
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,721
Sydney.

354
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,553
Sorry, you're gonna
have to ditch him.

355
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,559
Ah-choo!

356
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,791
But my guy's really nice.
And I dragged him all the way down here.

357
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:23,198
And he has a sinus infection
and his athlete's foot is flaring up.

358
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:25,498
And he has glaucoma... he thinks.

359
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:28,438
I cannot just ditch him.
I don't make the rules, Sydney.

360
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:33,035
If being a Kappa is important to you,
then this is the price you pay.

361
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:45,485
Hey, "date."
Hey.

362
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,684
I ordered you
another cup of coffee.

363
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,158
Oh...

364
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,160
I need you to meet me
in the girls' bathroom.

365
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:55,393
Another pledge ritual.
Oh.

366
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,560
Oh. Oh.

367
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:01,333
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

368
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,444
OK.
I'll meet you there.

369
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:13,143
(dooropens)

370
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,188
Sydney?

371
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:20,282
(both scream)

372
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,327
Pervert!
Ow!

373
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,103
Looks like you
get stuck with the check.

374
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:50,353
We live in a country that's considered to be
the ultimate model of government.

375
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:55,485
By the people,
for the people, and of the people.

376
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,896
But most Americans would be surprised to find
how afraid the Founding Fathers were

377
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:04,732
of what a direct democracy could do to the country.

378
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:08,864
Can anyone tell me why?

379
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,636
(snoring)

380
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:13,468
(snores)

381
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:16,480
The young man snoring there, perhaps?

382
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,539
(chuckling)

383
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:20,775
(coughs)

384
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,616
The Founding Fathers were afraid
that direct democracy

385
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,419
would do to America
what it did to Rome.

386
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:30,757
Alexander Hamilton
even advocated a monarchy. (snores)

387
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,558
Exactly.

388
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:36,533
We are trained to think
the more power the people have, the better.

389
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:41,937
Can any of you tell me
some reasons why this isn't necessarily true?

390
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:48,168
Ah, Terrence.
Still here after eight years.

391
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:52,205
What do you say we give someone else
a chance to respond this time, huh?

392
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:55,685
Um... Ms. Witchburn?

393
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:59,417
Most Americans
don't educate themselves about the issues.

394
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:04,019
There are some valid arguments
for keeping things alittle bit more... elite.

395
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:08,260
You could even argue a case
for certain types of oligarchy.

396
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,631
Interesting.

397
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:16,072
Let's hearfrom someone else.
How about... you?

398
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,540
Ms?

399
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:18,735
White.

400
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,799
Ms. White.

401
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,645
Any thoughts?

402
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:24,779
Um...

403
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,314
I guess I think that's...

404
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,520
underestimating the masses a bit.

405
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:35,685
Not to mention
overestimating the elites.

406
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:41,324
Apartheid was an oligarchy,
and no one wants that again.

407
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,232
Excellent.

408
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,777
Alicia, what year
was Kappa Phi Nu founded?

409
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,376
1902.
Very good.

410
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:13,061
Mm!

411
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:16,225
Want some breakfast?
Yeah.

412
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,695
Help yourself.

413
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,898
Breakfast is good.

414
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:25,069
(Rachel) Ugh!

415
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,805
It's called moisturizer.
Try some.

416
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,506
Next.

417
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,243
Ugh.
Your pores are enormous.

418
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,013
They have a thing
called whitening toothpaste. Next.

419
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,215
Dinky.
Kappa founder Kitty Cooper's hometown?

420
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,359
Little Rock.

421
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:47,762
(giggles)

422
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,565
Lose the big hair.
This isn't Dallas.

423
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,695
Bye.

424
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,502
Eyebrows... meet tweezers.

425
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:59,510
Tweezers,
meet yourworst nightmare.

426
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,736
(chatter)
I know.

427
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:05,305
Next. Next.
Next. (sighs)

428
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,984
(Rachel) OK, future sisters.

429
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:12,046
Get yourlazy asses up.
You're gonna clean the bathroom.

430
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,592
(all groan)

431
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:17,753
At the Beta fraternity house.
(all groan louder)

432
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:20,491
Sydney, the Kappa Phi Nu colors?

433
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:23,261
Green and white.
Wrong. Emerald and pearl.

434
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,462
Sorry.
I'm still learning how to speak priss.

435
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,164
(all gasp)

436
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:43,078
(both yelp/scream)

437
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,064
You know what?
Don't change a thing.

438
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:07,134
You just keep walking around
looking justlike that.

439
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,549
You again.
Oh.

440
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,059
Morning.
Hi.

441
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,488
Sorry you had to do that.
Some of the girls are alittle traumatized.

442
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:28,533
(Sydney)
Yeah. It's OK. I, uh...

443
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,501
I spend alot of time in bathrooms.

444
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,238
No, no. I don't mean like that,
I just mean that, um...

445
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,004
I don't go to the bathroom alot, I...

446
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,308
Well, sometimes I do.
Kinda depends on what I eat.

447
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:48,779
Just to be clear, I spend
a normal amount of time in the bathroom.

448
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:52,721
Sydney. It's time to get back to the house.
OK.

449
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,782
Don't ask.
We had to take her.

450
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,690
I think she's cool.

451
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,752
And cute.

452
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,590
Just admit they're cooler.
You don't know

453
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,395
what the hell you're talking about.

454
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:06,995
There is no way that a pirate
is cooler than a ninja.

455
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:12,234
Ninja's live like monks.
Pirates get booty. End of discussion.

456
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:18,205
Hi. I need to return these
and I have a couple of poli sci books on reserve.

457
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:22,515
I'm impressed.
I don't get alot of pledges in here studying.

458
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,988
Well, they probably don't
have scholarships to maintain.

459
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:31,654
You and your drunken, whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society!

460
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,220
(chuckles) All right.

461
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:38,736
I think we can all agree that
a pirate-ninja would be the coolest thing ever.

462
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,703
Hi.

463
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,206
Oh, hi.

464
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,606
Hello.

465
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:48,669
I wanted to apologize
forwhat I did to you in the bathroom.

466
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:52,683
What did she do to you in the bathroom?
What did she do?

467
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:58,485
It was a stupid pledge prank
and I'm really, really sorry.

468
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:02,754
Hey, it wasn't exactly
surprising behaviorfor a Kappa.

469
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,396
Come on, uh, let's go.

470
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,329
Excuse me.

471
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:16,802
If it makes you feel any better, they threw baloney
at us while we sang Céline Dion songs!

472
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,433
(laughter)

473
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:27,277
Girls, it's been along journey,
but you're almost done.

474
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:34,024
Tomorrow night is our Presents Dance
where you will be introduced as official Kappa sisters.

475
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:42,558
It's tradition for the current sisters to pass down
their Presents gowns to the new pledges.

476
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,797
After all, we're all size two.
(all giggle)

477
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,338
Except you, Amy.

478
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,931
As president, I will draw the first name.

479
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:55,544
This lucky girl is getting one of Milan's finest.

480
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,942
Sydney White.

481
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:06,854
Yay!

482
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,663
Come, Sydney.

483
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,168
(coughs)

484
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,033
(computerbeeps)

485
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:25,267
Hey, Christy, why don't you check your standing?
I'm sure you've cracked the top 20 by now.

486
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,903
Uh, what's that?

487
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:31,278
Just the school's "Hot or Not" ranking
on MySpace.

488
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:35,649
It's just some dumb list.
Oh. That does sound dumb.

489
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,714
Really dumb. I betlame people
justlog on all day and vote for themselves.

490
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,488
No, we don't.
We're only allowed to vote once a day.

491
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:45,495
Right, Rachel?

492
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:49,089
Hey, Rach, you're still number one.

493
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,761
Am I? How cute.

494
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:54,862
It's been that way forforever.
You know how people are.

495
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:59,000
They just stick with the status quo.
That's why new people never make it on.

496
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:02,171
Oh, my God.
Sydney's on it - number 213.

497
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:04,807
I am?
Let me see that.

498
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:08,216
But I thought you said
new people never make it on the list.

499
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:12,279
Well, like you said,
it's just some dumb list.

500
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:16,418
But aren't we just so lucky
to have you as a pledge?

501
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:21,522
And I think you're gonnalook
just gorgeous in...

502
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:29,803
Perfect. Totally you.
Practically screams number 213.

503
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:32,434
(cellphone rings)

504
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:35,675
Hey, Tyler.

505
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:38,443
Oh, you're so bad!

506
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:40,643
I have to take this.

507
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,469
(Rachel) Jenny Robinson.
(applause)

508
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:07,437
Dinky Hodgekiss.

509
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,648
Alicia Fairchild.

510
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:16,313
Bunchie Hathaway.

511
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:20,488
And finally, Sydney White.

512
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:30,629
I present to you this fall's
Kappa Phi Nu pledge class.

513
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:40,400
You look... incredible.

514
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:43,470
Thank you.
Dance?

515
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,984
(? "When I See You Smile" by Gabriel Mann)

516
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,522
Who are you, Sydney White?

517
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:58,061
You throw a football like Matt Leinart,

518
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:00,620
fearlessly conquerfraternity bathrooms,

519
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,428
and clean up nice, to boot.

520
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,902
Well, I'm more of a Peyton Manning.
Leinart's alefty.

521
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:10,099
Marry me.
(giggles)

522
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:14,176
So, uh, they go all-out
for these shindigs, huh?

523
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,475
It's a weird word - "shindig."

524
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:19,676
You eat? Because there are some
hors d'oeuvres over there.

525
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:24,017
You know, I tried to eat a plastic flower once.
Kinda hurt. (laughs)

526
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:29,557
I'm rambling again, aren't I?
I'm starting to think I make you nervous.

527
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:31,356
(laughs)

528
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,420
No.

529
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,202
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

530
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:45,674
(applause)

531
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:52,075
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

532
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:57,017
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

533
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:59,554
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

534
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:02,454
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

535
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:05,257
You are now a Kappa sister.
You are now a Kappa sister.

536
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,730
Kappa sister...
(echoes) sister... sister...

537
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,131
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

538
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:23,440
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid we have a bit of a situation.

539
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:28,679
Every so often, it is the unfortunate duty
of the president to act as judge and jury.

540
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:32,917
Sydney White has exhibited
inappropriate Kappa behavior.

541
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,549
(audience gasps)

542
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:38,528
Is this a pledge prank?
It certainly is not.

543
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:41,087
You are guilty of the following infractions:

544
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:43,929
you brought an unsuitable date
to the date dash,

545
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:47,062
cheated during a pledge quiz,

546
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:50,471
revealed a secret pledge ritual
to the entire library,

547
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:54,477
and, finally, lied about your background.

548
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:58,606
We all know your dad
is actually a plumber.

549
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:02,813
As Kappa president,
according to statute 25A of the sorority charter,

550
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:07,187
I hereby dismiss Sydney White
from the Kappa pledge class.

551
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:15,996
I don't know what your mother got away with
when she was here,

552
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,627
but you will neverbe a Kappa.

553
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,746
You know what?
Thank you.

554
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:34,251
Because if this is what sisterhood's all about,
then I don't want any part of it.

555
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,786
I want that dress back.

556
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:40,017
Take it!
(all gasp)

557
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,502
(thunderclaps)

558
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:28,702
I will see your Cobra Commander,
and I will raise you a mint, unopened,

559
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:33,801
power of the Force,
Return ofthe Jedi Luke Skywalker in...

560
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:37,105
battle poncho.

561
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,778
Wow.

562
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,616
We fold.

563
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,924
Which is better?
Three A's or two of the cards with the ladies on them?

564
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:56,900
You dope.
What?

565
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,596
If you have both, it's a full house.

566
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,903
How is it you always win at cards, but you can't make
it from Junior Tiger Guide to Tiger Guide?

567
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:08,468
It's one badge, OK?
It's one badge.

568
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:11,276
Knots are hard.

569
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:15,547
Does anyone know anotherword for
"douchebaggery"? I don't want to use it a third time.

570
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,351
Gurkin, no one reads
yourwhiny blog anyway.

571
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:24,292
Peoplespunisher.com is not about being read.
It's about being written.

572
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,689
(electric crackling)

573
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,874
Good morning, Embele.

574
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:40,502
(laughs, speaks African language)

575
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:46,275
Where do you think he goes?

576
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,341
(rainfall)

577
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:54,288
Outside, alady waits.
She wears jean pants and looks very sad. (yawns)

578
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,287
There's a girl outside? Yes!

579
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:00,796
Am I looking good? Yes.

580
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,423
(yawns)

581
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:08,104
(gasps)
Oh, it's the bathroom babe!

582
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:12,933
I'm gonna go work the Spanky magic.

583
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,870
(sobs)

584
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:34,524
Ahem!

585
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,936
Sorry. You probably don't
want me sitting out here.

586
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,166
And I understand, especially you.

587
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:45,675
And you were right
about the whole Kappa thing.

588
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:50,073
I'll go.

589
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,984
Did they really make you
sing Céline Dion?

590
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,344
Yeah.

591
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:01,217
Do you need a place to stay?

592
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,529
Guys, this is Sydney.

593
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:16,596
Uh, she needs a place to stay.

594
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:20,110
She gave up her dorm room
to pledge Kappa.

595
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,643
Sydney, these are the guys.

596
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,011
Gurkin.

597
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,113
Terrence.

598
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:30,616
George.

599
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:34,319
Jeremy.

600
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,793
Don't forget me.
Oh, of course. Skoozer.

601
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:41,298
(whispers) Jeremy's shy.
He had several therapists as a kid.

602
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:44,823
One of them recommended a puppet.
He never stopped using it.

603
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:47,598
You'll get used to Skoozer.
Yeah, it's OK.

604
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:49,663
As long as he doesn't
hump my bunny slippers.

605
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,764
No promises.

606
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,308
(laughs)
(barks)

607
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,901
(small explosion)

608
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,544
Uh... Ah.

609
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:05,419
That's Embelackpo Akimbatunde.
We just call him Embele.

610
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:08,652
He's from Nigeria
and hasn't adjusted to the time change.

611
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:11,661
His days and nights
are actually reversed.

612
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:14,562
Jetlag, huh?
When did he get here?

613
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:17,726
Three years ago.

614
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,463
Thank you.

615
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:23,303
Of course!
I have to invert the ratio.

616
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,307
Come on, Bilbo.

617
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:33,506
And what exactly is he doing?
We have no idea.

618
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,010
Welcome to the Vortex.

619
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,126
(coughs)

620
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:08,377
(boy) Sydney?
Oh, hi. Come in.

621
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:10,920
Hi. Uh...

622
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:16,585
I'm sorry. I know it can be alittle spooky up here
at night, so I brought you this.

623
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,428
That nightlight has gotten me
through some pretty tough times.

624
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,799
Oh.
Thanks, that's really sweet.

625
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:30,037
Hey, is that Dark Fury numberfour?
Yeah.

626
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:34,305
The one with the first appearance of...
(both) The Emerald Mask.

627
00:45:34,378 --> 00:45:37,814
You know, you may be
more Vortex than Kappa after all.

628
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:41,750
So, uh, are you all set?
Do you need anything?

629
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:45,915
A hypoallergenic pillow?
Humidifier? Dehumidifier? Ionizer?

630
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,720
Nope. I think I'm all good
on the medical-supply front.

631
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:51,626
Are you sure?
There's alot of dust.

632
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:54,823
I've actually got loads of allergy medicine.

633
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:57,299
You? Allergies?
I neverwould've guessed.

634
00:45:57,368 --> 00:46:00,235
Just the usual -
dairy, wheat, peanuts.

635
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:02,602
Bee stings, cats...
Wow, that's alot of...

636
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,868
Pollen, wood...

637
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,706
Afew others.
Uh, but it's getting late. You're probably tired.

638
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:13,579
Well, yeah.
Public humiliation can be pretty tiring.

639
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:17,420
Yeah, I know.

640
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,582
Oh, um, I don't know
if you need any sort of special...

641
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,887
lady products.

642
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,726
No, no.
I'm good. Thanks, though.

643
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,697
Thanks for everything, Lenny.

644
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,358
Hey. (chuckles)

645
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:35,667
I don't know if you, uh...
need to do anything...

646
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,263
Spanky, go.

647
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:39,275
(groans)

648
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,471
Sorry about that. Um...
Let me know if he bothers you.

649
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:48,781
Spanky's kind of... Well, he really likes girls,
but he doesn't know many.

650
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:51,321
But he keeps himself happy.

651
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:56,917
You may find this hard to believe, but, um, most of
the guys here don't have alot of experience with girls.

652
00:46:56,994 --> 00:47:00,930
(? "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss)

653
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:09,801
Dudes... that thing has touched boobs.

654
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:13,836
Of course.

655
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:17,938
The sturdy, breathable fabric
is designed to maintain mammary elasticity.

656
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:22,748
Shut up, Terrence!
You're ruining the moment for me.

657
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:28,815
(phone rings)

658
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,900
Hello.
Oh, hey, Dad. Did I wake you?

659
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:42,496
What? Are you kidding?
How was the big dance?

660
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,103
That's actually why I was calling.

661
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:50,978
Well, come on.
I've been waiting up to hear. Tell me all about it.

662
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:55,075
It was great.
Yeah, it's all very exciting.

663
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:58,781
Sydney, I'm sure that your mom is right there
taking it all in with you.

664
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:02,315
I know.

665
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:05,260
(sighs) That's what I keep thinking.

666
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:09,932
Good night, sweetie.
Night, Dad.

667
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,647
Oh!

668
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:31,319
Um... this place is a deathtrap.

669
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:34,152
How about some repairs?

670
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,852
Sydney, don't start.

671
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:38,019
You know why we can't
get any damn repairs?

672
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:43,499
I'll tell you why.
Campuswide systematic Greek oppression.

673
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:48,027
Read peoplespunisher.com if you wanna know more.
I did a whole series on it.

674
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:52,166
I don't know what needing repairs
has to do with the Greek system. It isn't Greek.

675
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:56,976
Precisely! That's the problem. Rachel Witchburn
and the Greeks run the student council.

676
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,881
The student council dictates
all budget appropriations.

677
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:06,421
Over the past 14 semesters,
87.3% of all campus-event funding

678
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,357
has been devoted to the Greek system.

679
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:12,926
Are you kidding me?

680
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:14,988
I don't kid. (gurgling)

681
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:16,896
Ooh.

682
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:19,333
Won't be long now.

683
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:24,306
Why is everyone on this campus
willing to let Rachel Witchburn run theirlives?

684
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:29,141
'Cause she... she's kind of...

685
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:31,181
scary.

686
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:38,046
Hey, Rachel!

687
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:41,717
Check it out.
The diet's working. I lost 5 pounds.

688
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:48,057
I think your ass found it.

689
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:49,895
(Tyler) Hey!

690
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,094
Hey! Sydney.

691
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:56,102
Sydney.

692
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:59,373
Hi.
Listen, aboutlast night...

693
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:01,707
Last night?
Hm, wait, let me think.

694
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:05,146
Oh, yeah!
When your girlfriend humiliated me.

695
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:08,207
Good times.
Trust me, Rachel's not my girlfriend.

696
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,617
And not everyone in Greek Row
is like her.

697
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,089
Give me a chance to prove that to you.
(girl) Run for student council!

698
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:19,255
You know, I'm actually kinda busy...
juggling seven guys at the moment.

699
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,558
So...
Whoa.

700
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,156
I gotta go.

701
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,898
Hey, can I have a sign-up sheet?
Yeah.

702
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,494
Actually, can I have seven?

703
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:37,544
Oh!

704
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:40,314
Don't worry, ladies.

705
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:45,412
We won't have to deal with the public once
the Vortex is torn down and my Greek Center's built.

706
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:47,480
(cellphone beeps)
Oh.

707
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:50,118
Is it four o'clock already?

708
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:51,991
Loser, loser,

709
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:53,996
Kappa, Kappa,

710
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:56,225
Kappa, lose...

711
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,195
What?!

712
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,137
This isn't happening.

713
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:07,303
Wow. I guess herlittle
striptease act got some attention.

714
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,181
(hyperventilates)

715
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,217
(Christy) Rachel? Rachel.

716
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:16,809
Use your soothing words.

717
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,821
Prada, Gucci,

718
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,450
Chanel...

719
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:25,290
Sydney, Sydney, Sydney!
Ugh!

720
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:26,659
Whoa!

721
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:35,268
(Lenny) Hey.
Hey, guys.

722
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:40,777
There you go.

723
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:43,938
I've found a way for you
to get the Vortex repaired.

724
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:49,117
We're signing you up
to run for student council, all seven of you.

725
00:51:51,088 --> 00:51:52,953
(all laugh)

726
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:59,057
Very funny, Sydney.
Next you'll tell us Admiral Adama's a Cylon.

727
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:05,064
I have no idea what you just said.
But I'm serious.

728
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:09,572
You'll all run on a ticket
and you'll take over the entire student council.

729
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,509
No non-Greek has won
a student-council office since 1992.

730
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:16,637
And look where that's gotten us.

731
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:20,510
Ow.
Yes, George, ow.

732
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:22,609
We've taken enough of their abuse.

733
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:26,247
I'll be your campaign manager
and I'll be with you every step of the way.

734
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:28,018
I am in.

735
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:31,117
Good. Who else is with me?
Come on, guys.

736
00:52:32,362 --> 00:52:37,925
Do you really wanna spend the rest of college locked
up in this crap hole, disenfranchised and powerless?

737
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,366
OK.

738
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:40,869
No! George, no.

739
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:43,338
You don't wanna be powerless.
No.

740
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:45,841
Please don't give up.

741
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:52,544
Did the Avengers give up when the Black Knight
sprayed New York with that foam?

742
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:54,106
No.
No.

743
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:58,814
With the help of a criminal glue specialist,
they freed everyone.

744
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:02,120
I'm your criminal glue specialist!
Yeah!

745
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:04,786
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

746
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,830
Who's running for president?
Not it.

747
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:08,455
Not it.
Not it.

748
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:11,092
(speaks African language)
(sighs)

749
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:20,168
Oh. I neverwin at that game.

750
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:22,940
Terrence it is.
Let's get started!

751
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:26,005
(? "Revolution" by The Veronicas)

752
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,362
So?

753
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,027
Hm...

754
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:50,473
Mm-hm...

755
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:57,380
Mm. Nice.

756
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,540
Loop in, and then you've got a bow.

757
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:31,346
I did it!
Oh, you did it, yes!

758
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:38,177
Hey, Terrence.

759
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:47,022
Bye, Terrence.

760
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:19,061
This is the gym.

761
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,256
Alot of people hang out here.

762
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:26,098
We can work off some of those doughnuts
and maybe even talk to a few people.

763
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,433
I... I don't know.

764
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:31,872
Come on. It's a Saturday afternoon.
What else would you be doing?

765
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:36,276
Oh, we always do play fantasy video games
and then reenact them.

766
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:40,574
(incantation)

767
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,846
Are you not entertained?

768
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:49,950
Mm, tempting.
But I think we're gonna stick with this.

769
00:55:57,834 --> 00:56:02,328
Oh, l-I can't do it. My arms ache.
I think I may have muscular dystrophy.

770
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:05,671
Muscular dystrophy is a birth defect.

771
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,937
Lenny, they're 2 pounds.

772
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,380
Each.

773
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:14,450
You got it?
(muffled grunt)

774
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:17,817
What?
I said yeah, I got... Ow!

775
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:27,859
Damn, Embele, you're going to town.
Where'd you get all that energy?

776
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:30,229
I just awaken an hour ago.

777
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,961
(laughs)

778
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:46,648
It's OK. You'll be fine.
It fell on my foot.

779
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:52,053
(man) Rachel Witchburn has led the student council
to great heights overthe past two years.

780
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:54,283
In addition to repaving Greek Row,

781
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:59,818
Rachel beautified Greek Row's grounds
and expanded parking privileges forGreek Row.

782
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:04,890
Re-elect Rachel Witchburn.
Vision. Leadership. Progress.

783
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:08,734
I'm Rachel Witchburn
and I approved this message.

784
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:11,205
Can you believe that?
Who would fall for that?

785
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,265

I don't think we're making much of an impression.
Yeah. I was worried about that.

799

Yes, Lenny. The greenish one
is your gluten-free soy patty.

Excellent.
Do you have any extra of those?

812

Are you allergic to gluten too?
Oh, all my life.

813
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:34,510
And it is so hard to find
a decent gluten-free soy patty.

814
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:38,145
Well, today's yourlucky day
because these are sensational.

815

Lenny, this is my friend Dinky.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

816
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:44,849
Dinky. Right? Nice to meet you, Dinky.

Hi, Sydney. It's nice you found
some people you fit in with.

820
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:59,900
Mm, it is nice, isn't it? If only there were a place
where a superficial, materialistic bitch could fit in.

821
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:01,603
Oh, wait, there is.
(laughs)

822
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:07,582
Whatever. It's so cute making
yourlittle friends run for student council.

823

It is cute, and it'll be
even cuterwhen we win.

Yeah, justlike you said new people never
make it on your "Hot or Not" list, right?

826
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,928
Let me give you one tip, Sydney.

827
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:25,497
I'm the last person you wanna mess with.

828
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:28,594
No. You're the first.

829
01:00:30,674 --> 01:00:32,869
Come on, let's go.

830

You too, Lenny.

(stutters)

832
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:47,322
You realize she was
flirting with you?

833
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,051
Yeah.
No!

834
01:00:50,226 --> 01:00:54,219
Who's gonna win today?
Sharks gonna win today!

835
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:57,562
Who, who, who?
Sharks, sharks, sharks!

837

Who's gonna win today?

838
01:01:08,745 --> 01:01:12,579
Well, when the temperature drops below 60
and there's a headwind,

839
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:16,380
the forces on the ball create
an unfavorable magnitude and direction.

840
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:21,288
The resulting spatial vectorleads
to an increase in the Sharks fumble ratio.

841
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:23,349
I anticipate a double-digitloss.

842

843

I don't know about you,
but I gotta change my bet.

844
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:38,031
Wait a minute.
I think we graduated with that dude.

845
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,983
The election's coming up
and we could really use you. Do you think?

and throw it on back.

your mind?

No, but I will keep singing
unless you agree to go out with me.

so I thought it would be, you know,
a nice first-date outfit.

872

No, it's terrible.
You looklike Barbara Walters.

873
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:49,290
And you said this wasn't a date.
It is not a date.

874
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:53,597
We're just friends and, you know,
I don'tlike him like that.

875
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:57,572
Only alittle. You know, occasionally.
When his shirt's off.

876
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,801
I have no idea.
That's how it always starts.

877
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:04,972
You never plan these things.
First you're friends.

878
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:07,676
Then you're all, " Hi!
Are you here to fix the copier?"

Argh! You are no help.

880

Why are you so nervous?
You must have been on plenty of dates before.

881

I don't know if you have figured this out,
but I'm not exactly the prom-queen type.

Yeah, but you're pretty, Sydney.
Thanks, George.

dating experience as you guys.

You need something sexy.

887

But warm.

end in disappointment

studies show.

892

I hope you beat the odds.
Me, too.

If you try any funny stuff I will unleash
the power of the internet on you.

That's nothing. You should see the plumbing.

01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:13,384
Well, I do, even if there was
no bathroom attendant.

940
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,488
I had to turn the faucet myself.
(laughs)

941
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:21,929
(Tyler) Here we are.

942
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:25,434
All right. Well...

943
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,339
Thank you.

944
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,571
I had a great time.

945
01:09:32,715 --> 01:09:37,846
(laughs) You're trying not to overtalk
right now, aren't you?

946
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:53,129
Whoa-a!

947
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:58,004
I'm OK. My spleen broke my fall.

948
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,011
Hi, guys.
Hey.

949
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:10,712
Sydney. What a surprise.
Um, we were just watching the...

950
01:10:14,357 --> 01:10:16,848
The game?
Mm-hm.

951
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:19,986
Yeah, who's playing?
Um, the...

952
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,794
St Louis Gorillas.

953
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,361
You guys were spying on me. And just for that,
I'm not gonna tell you about my date.

954
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,803
Oh, come on, Sydney.
Nope.

955
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:34,339
Good night, boys.

956
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,708
(groans)
Oh, man.

957
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:39,745
I should probably
see a doctor.

958
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,385
Hey, sexy.

959
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,425
Rachel, what the hell
are you doing here?

960
01:10:50,493 --> 01:10:53,826
Besides reading
your boring emails, nothing.

961
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:57,263
Tell me what you were
doing out with her.

962
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:02,234
You know what, Rachel?
I like Sydney. Deal with it.

963
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:07,075
I don't care if you like her or not.
All I care about is our Greek Life Center.

964
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:10,135
Sydney and her band of goobers
are screwing with our plans.

965
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:13,272
It's notlike they have a shot
at winning the election.

966
01:11:13,349 --> 01:11:15,408
I think we should
justleave them alone.

967
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,920
I mean, that dump is obviously
really important to them.

968
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:23,322
I don't know why anyone would wannalive there.
That firetrap should be condemned.

969
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:27,294
Look, we can find anotherlocation.
Now, get outta here already.

970
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:32,092
One date and you're ready
to blow the whole deal?

971
01:11:32,168 --> 01:11:34,466
It was a hell of a date.

972
01:11:35,338 --> 01:11:38,774
Normally I'd be reporting that Rachel Witchburn...
Guys, look!

973
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,833
...once again has a lock
on the student council presidency.

974
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:48,282
But now there's a new playeron the scene - Terrence
Lubinecki and his Freedom to the 7th Powerparty.

975
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:52,287
Do they have a shot?
Can they even make a dent? Stay tuned.

976
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:55,222
(laughter, cheering)
You're a good-Iooking guy.

977
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:59,194
Check it out.
Maybe I'll actually vote this year.

978
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:01,252
Yeah, cool.

979
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,670
Hey, Rach. Which of these should I wear?
I don't care.

980
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:14,710
But I have a date.
I don't care.

981
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:18,611
Come to my room and help me get dressed.
What is wrong with you?

982
01:12:19,448 --> 01:12:21,973
Rachel, you can't come in here.
I just farted.

983
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:24,576
Ew, Katy. You're disgusting.

984
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:34,592
(slow motion) No!

985
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:36,188
(Rachel screams)

986
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:38,631
Get off me, you freaks!
No!

987
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:41,192
Rach...

988
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,033
What?

989
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,475
No.

990
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:55,484
No!

991
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:59,681
Rachel, do you wanna try
your soothing words?

992
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:06,518
I don't need my soothing words.
It's all become very clear to me.

993
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:10,497
Sydney White must die a social death

994
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:13,501
and take her seven dorks with her.

995
01:13:16,806 --> 01:13:19,604
(knock at door)

996
01:13:19,675 --> 01:13:23,475
Great. Here comes
Prince Charming.

997
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:27,004
Guys, please. Just give him a chance.
(gun clicks)

998
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,575
That means you, Gurkin.
Put the paintball gun away.

999
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,084
Hi. Come on in.
Hi.

1000
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:43,262
Hi.

1001
01:13:44,266 --> 01:13:46,257
Hi.

1002
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:51,269
Are you ready?
I have a better idea.

1003
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,740
We all hang here at the Vortex
and order pizza.

1004
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:56,300
What?

1005
01:13:56,378 --> 01:13:57,675
(whimpers)

1006
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,443
Sounds good to me.

1007
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:06,683
Hey, is that Medal of Honor?
(Gurkin) No, it's not Medal of Honor.

1008
01:14:06,756 --> 01:14:11,716
Medal of Honoris forwusses.
It's Gurkin of Honor. I made it.

1009
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:16,788
It pays tribute to Medal of Honor,
God of War, Halo and Viva Piñata.

1010
01:14:16,866 --> 01:14:21,633
I'm pretty good at all those games.
You mind if I give it a shot?

1011
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:23,194
OK.

1012
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:25,331
(laughter)

1013
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,237
Shh!

1014
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,414
(growls)

1015
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:47,193
Oh!

1016
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:49,231
Eatlead, sucker.

1017
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:52,461
Gurkin, damn,
he just kicked your ass. Nice.

1018
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:57,472
I have to say, I'm impressed. None of these freaks
have come close to winning Gurkin of Honor.

1019
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,873
We Betas play video games, too.
You do?

1020
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:06,108
Yeah. What did you think we do?
Just have sex with girls all the time.

1021
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:09,413
I hate to break it to you, Spanky,
but we're really just regular guys.

1022
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:14,788
Aw. He's like a kid who just found out
there's no Santa Claus.

1023
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:17,121
What?

1024
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:20,856
I mean, hypothetically, you know,
if there weren't a Santa Claus,

1025
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,830
which, of course, there is.

1026
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:29,997
You guys should come hang out sometime.
Bring Gurkin of Honor.

1027
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:34,566
You know, actually, we're having a party
tomorrow night. You guys wanna come?

1028
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:36,873
(? "Breakin'Dishes" by Rihanna)

1029
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:55,796
You made it. Uh, the bar's over there

1030
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,026
and the DJ's taking requests.

1031
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,263
Do you think he has
the Dr. Who theme song?

1032
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:03,828
I'm thinking not.
That's OK.

1033
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:05,840
I brought my own.

1034
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:09,640
As for you,
the dance floor is this way.

1035
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:20,951
...25, 26,

(cheering)

1040
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:35,265
All right, all right, who's next?
Anybody think they can beat that?

1041
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,805
Yes, I do.

1042
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:40,706
(laughs) He thinks...

1043
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:44,007
The dork thinks he can beat it.
All right, good luck, buddy.

1044
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,343
Whatever you say, man.
Come on.

1045
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:47,939
Uh.

1046
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:49,951
No, no. No, no.

1047

1048
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:09,667
Start counting.

1049
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:11,899
One, two,

1050
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:14,101
three, four,

1051
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:17,270
five, six, seven, eight...

1052
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:24,150
I hope the guys are OK. I haven't heard
any girlish screams, so I'm thinking we're good.

1053
01:17:24,219 --> 01:17:26,016
Sure looks like it.

That was badass!

1059
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:43,969
That was awesome.

1060
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:45,267
Lenny.

1061
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,774
Ah...

1062
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:48,207
Hey.

Oh, wow, I love your new hairstyle.

I... I, um... Yeah. Uh...

1065

Dinky, Rachel needs you
right away.

1066

Oh, but I just...
It's an emergency.

1067
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,754
Oh, no, OK. Bye.
Bye.

1068
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,997
How come you haven't come out
to party before?

1069
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,967
You guys are so cool.

1070
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:15,230
Really?

1071
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:18,967
Oh, yeah. We've been watching you.
Where have you studs been hiding?

1072
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:24,001
The building at the end of the road.
It's called the Vortex 'cause it sucks in losers.

1073
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,707
That's sexy.

1074
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:31,014
Well, boys, there's seven of us
and seven of you.

1075
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:33,145
What's that sound like to you?

1076
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:36,749
14?
Sounds like a party to me.

1077
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:40,488
You know, there's a hot tub out back.

1078
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:43,463
Through that door there's a study
thatleads right to it.

1079
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:48,026
You can leave your clothes there.
But we... we don't have any swimming trunks.

1080
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:52,199
Neither do we.
(? "Oh, Boy" by Boomish)

Oh, no.
Thanks for putting on a show, guys.

1091

This is low, even for you, Rachel.

1092

Aw, Sydney, so nice of you
to care about them.

their adorable little student council campaign,

1094
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:58,831
let me be the first to break the news.

1095
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:01,933
Terrence is disqualified
from running for president.

1096
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,910
What are you talking about?

1097
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:07,244
Terrence Lubinecki is not a student
at Southern Atlantic.

1098
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,944
He graduated six years ago.

1099
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:14,953
I had to stay. There was
just so much more learning to do.

1100
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:19,593
Terrence, maybe you should
put on some clothes. OK.

1101
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:24,529
Rachel, why don't you get the hell outta here?
Ooh, I love it when you get rough.

1102
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,196
And, Ty, thanks for playing your part so well.
That's the other good news.

1103
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,536
The Witchburn-Prince Greek Life Center
is now a reality.

1104
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:35,736
Witchburn-Prince? What the hell?
You didn't tell her?

1105
01:20:35,811 --> 01:20:39,747
I thought you guys were so close.
It's alittle joint project of ours

1106
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,409
and the only thing standing in ourway
was the Vortex.

1107
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,543
So, like you suggested, Tyler,

1108
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:47,589
I went ahead
and had it condemned.

1109
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:51,490
Now you can eat
with the homeless every night.

1110
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,960
You had something
to do with this?

1111
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,494
No. I mean, I said the place
was a dump, but I didn't...

1112
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:02,265
Witchburn-Prince, huh?
So you wanted to tear down the Vortex.

1113
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:05,936
Yeah, I did, but...
I don't wanna hear it.

1114
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:07,600
Sydney!
No.

1115
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,804
Don't grovel, Tyler.

1116
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,871
You're above it.

1117
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:24,450
Things are looking grim,
brothers.

1118
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:28,155
I am so sorry about this,
you guys.

1119
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,791
You should've justleft us alone.

1120
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:34,529
We were fine until you came along
and made us your guinea pigs.

1121
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:38,198
You guys... It's so important
for us to stand up to the Greeks

1122
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:41,970
and show them that
they can't trample all over us.

1123
01:21:42,044 --> 01:21:46,481
Well, it's also important for us
to have a place to live.

1124
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,692
(phone rings)

1125
01:22:04,766 --> 01:22:06,393
Hello?
Dad?

1126
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:11,667
(laughs) Got you. You've reached Royal Plumbing
at the White House. No, not that one.

1127
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:15,801
This is Paul and Sydney's. Leave a message.
(beep)

1128
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,368
Hi, Dad. I was just calling

1129
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:21,280
to say... I miss you.

1130
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:26,117
And that's it. Um...

1131
01:22:26,188 --> 01:22:30,284
Everything's great here. Really great.

1132
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:32,350
I love you.

1133
01:23:19,641 --> 01:23:24,578
It was that message last night. I could tell something
wasn't right. I could hear it in your voice.

1134
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:28,138
So I got in the van
and I drove all through the night.

1135
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:32,175
I was alittle surprised to find
you weren't at the Kappa house, though.

1136
01:23:32,254 --> 01:23:35,917
I wanted to tell you
so many times but...

1137
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:40,860
I kept thinking about Mom
and I feltlike I'd failed her.

1138
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:44,194
And you always sounded
so proud of me on the phone.

1139
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:49,932
Sweetheart, following in your mother's footsteps
is not about reliving herlife.

1140
01:23:50,005 --> 01:23:53,566
It's about being
the same kind of person she was.

1141
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:55,473
Hey.

1142
01:23:55,544 --> 01:23:58,809
Your mom was much more
than just a Kappa.

1143
01:24:00,148 --> 01:24:04,517
She was a woman who always fought
forwhat she believed in, and so are you.

1144
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:07,555
Nothing could make me
prouder than that.

1145
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:12,491
Not even when I installed
that waterfiltration system in under an hour?

1146
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,052
That was pretty great.

1147
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:17,161
(laughs)

1148
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,902
(knock at door)

1149
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,170
(grunts)

1150
01:24:34,249 --> 01:24:36,843
But it says, "Do not disturb."

1151
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:38,909
(knocking continues)

1152
01:24:45,227 --> 01:24:47,752
Up and at 'em, guys.

1153
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,957
It's time to make some plans.

1154
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:56,497
I know you're still pissed at me, but come on.
Are you gonna wallow here in this fleabag motel

1155
01:24:56,571 --> 01:25:02,908
because some prissy girly-girl who probably
doesn't know who Gandalf is screwed us over?

1156
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:10,617
You're right.
I bet she doesn't know who Gandalf is.

1157
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:14,248
(laughter)

1158
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,924
We're still mad at you, though.
That's OK. I want you to be mad.

1159
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:23,556
I want you to get fired up
so we can win this election,

1160
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:26,601
because the Freedom to the 7th Power
party will prevail.

1161
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:29,535
Yeah!
With our new candidate for president.

1162
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:37,272
Me. I'm gonna run against Rachel.

1163
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:41,109
And we're gonna take her down.

1164
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,678
(? "Stand Up" by Mêlée)

1165
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:47,210
I'm Sydney White
and I'm running forstudent council president...

1166
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:52,693
I'm Sydney White and I'm running forstudent council
president on the Freedom to the 7th Powerticket.

1167
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:57,994
Your papers count for three quarters of
yourfinal grade and no late papers will be accepted.

1168
01:25:58,066 --> 01:26:02,935
As you're writing these papers, I want you to think
about the mechanics of modern campaigning.

1169
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:06,565
You may be wondering why you should even care.
Why bothervoting?

1170
01:26:06,641 --> 01:26:10,077
The Greeks win every year
and it's one more way they run the school.

1171
01:26:10,145 --> 01:26:14,377
There's a whole lot of talk today
about the need to cater to your base,

1172
01:26:14,449 --> 01:26:17,816
but there's something to be said
for thinking outside of that box.

1173
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:22,379
(Sydney) Freedom to the 7th Power!

1174
01:26:22,457 --> 01:26:25,517
Whoo-hoo!
Freedom to the 7th Power!

1175
01:26:27,696 --> 01:26:29,687
(man) Good job.

1176
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:35,428
(groans)

1177
01:26:35,504 --> 01:26:41,636
The fact is that 80% ofthe student body
at Southern Atlantic is not Greek. 80%.

1178
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:46,238
Take the Kennedy campaign in 1960.
He was inherently an outsider -

1179
01:26:46,314 --> 01:26:51,411
a Catholic had never been elected as president -
who reached out to other outsiders.

1180
01:26:51,486 --> 01:26:53,681
(students chant in Hebrew)

1181
01:26:57,659 --> 01:26:59,820
L'chaim.
L'chaim.

1182
01:26:59,895 --> 01:27:04,059
(Sydney) To those students I say,
it's time foryou to be heard.

1183
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:11,205
(Carlton) Minorities, women, the poor -

1184
01:27:12,073 --> 01:27:16,908
the disenfranchised won
that election for John Kennedy.

1185
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:26,418
"Naked Pain."
An epic poem in 12 parts.

1186
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:33,157
It's time foryou to be heard,
and we are here to listen.

1187
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,152
(cheering)

1188
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:42,092
(chanting in Hebrew)

1189
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:48,604
It's alesson worth remembering.

1190
01:27:54,616 --> 01:27:55,548
Whoo-hoo!

1191
01:28:16,805 --> 01:28:18,432
(cheering)

1192
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,848
(Rachel) Here you go.
Don't vote for Sydney White.

1193
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,550
Let's keep it Greek, all right?
Does this looklike your next president?

1194
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,616
Vote Rachel Witchburn.

1195
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:42,019
Hi, ho.

1196
01:28:42,897 --> 01:28:44,660
Bye, ho.

1197
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:50,163
Don't vote for Sydney White.
Vote Rachel Witchburn. Rachel Witchburn.

1198
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,211
No way. You read
peoplespunisher too?

1199
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:09,119
I write it.

1200
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:12,318
Oh, my God.
It's the most genius thing ever.

1201
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:16,160
Did you know that the Brew House has
a spoken-word night devoted to that blog?

1202
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:18,699
Really?
Yeah.

1203
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,759
And I know
this is really embarrassing,

1204
01:29:21,836 --> 01:29:27,103
but I swore that if I ever met
the peoplespunisher guy,

1205
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:30,042
well, I'd hook up with him.

1206
01:29:32,981 --> 01:29:35,677
Dammit!

1207
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:44,989
Need some help?

1208
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:47,060
Oh. Hi.

1209
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,129
Listen, I'm really...

1210
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,727
Is that a Stanley 22 ounce
AntiVibe framing hammer?

1211
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:59,331
Yes, it is.
Can I touch it?

1212
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:03,203
You can have it.

1213
01:30:04,245 --> 01:30:08,375
I saw you guys with the signs.
I thought I could help.

1214
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:13,315
And I'm really sorry about
what happened the other night.

1215
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:15,583
I had nothing to do with
what Rachel pulled.

1216
01:30:15,657 --> 01:30:19,923
Yeah, I was involved in the Greek Center,
but Rachel twisted everything around.

1217
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:22,394
Yeah. I know what that's like.

1218
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,463
You're gonna do great
at the debate tomorrow.

1219
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:33,106
(heavy rock music)

1220
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:58,461
I thought we might
do alittle business.

1221
01:30:59,801 --> 01:31:00,859
Huh.

1222
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:12,669
I thought you finished Carlton's paperlast week.
I did.

1223
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:16,114
I wanted to add some of the ideas
from our campaign.

1224
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,550
You really are a dork.

1225
01:31:28,596 --> 01:31:31,588
What just happened? Make it come back.
I don't...

1226
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:36,163
She just opened it.

1227
01:31:36,237 --> 01:31:39,229
Voilà. One poisoned Apple.

1228
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:44,100
(groans)

1229
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:46,010
(computervoice) Self-destruct.

1230
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,344
(Lenny) Oh, my God.

1231
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:50,577
Oh, no.

1232
01:31:55,824 --> 01:31:57,985
All right, pay up.

1233
01:32:01,796 --> 01:32:02,956
Yes!

1234
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:10,099
She's gone catatonic.

1235
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:13,868
It's no use.
Even I can't fix this.

1236
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:16,934
My paper, due tomorrow.

1237
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:19,138
The debate, tomorrow.

1238
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:21,512
The guy definitely
knew what he was doing.

1239
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:24,313
(Terrence) What about? Ow.

1240
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:26,844
I can'tlet herwin like this.

1241
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,287
But the debate starts in 12 hours.

1242
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:33,555
I'm just gonna have to pull an all-nighter.

1243
01:33:32,253 --> 01:33:38,214

Candidates, please report to the stage.

We couldn't find her anywhere.
She should be done with her paper by now.

Sydney.

1247
01:34:08,022 --> 01:34:10,354
Sydney, you gotta wake up.

1248
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:23,998
I know you're tired, but you can't give up now.
You mean alot to those guys out there.

1249

any longerfor Ms. White.

Ms. Witchburn,
if you win another term as president,

1256
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:21,793
what will you do differently?
Why fix what isn't broken?

1257
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:27,298
This has been a great yearfor the university
and I am proud

1258
01:35:27,368 --> 01:35:31,566
to be breaking ground
on the Greek Life Center very soon.

1259
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:40,174
Ms. White, your rebuttal?

1260
01:35:40,248 --> 01:35:42,239
(crowd boos)

1261
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:48,753
I guess your people couldn't make it.
It's just you and your dorks.

1266
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:15,514
I vote for Sydney!

1267
01:36:36,003 --> 01:36:37,698
Go!

1268
01:36:39,073 --> 01:36:41,268
You've been oppressed by the Greek elite

1269
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:44,834
who take everything for themselves
and leave nothing for us.

(crowd boos)

1271
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:51,381
It's time for the rest of the school
to take back the school.

1272
01:36:51,452 --> 01:36:53,477
Yeah!

1273
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:59,257
I bet most of you have no idea how great
the campus a cappella group is, and why would you?

1274
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:03,286
The social and cultural landscape
is entirely run by the Greeks.

1275
01:37:03,364 --> 01:37:07,698
Those guys are forced to practice
in a dank basement that's hard on their vocal cords.

1276
01:37:07,768 --> 01:37:08,928
(man) Yeah!

1277
01:37:09,003 --> 01:37:12,370
Professor Carlton...
Let herfinish.

1278
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,204
I have met so many great
and interesting people here

1279
01:37:15,276 --> 01:37:18,734
that I neverwould have met
if I didn't step out of my own little world.

1280
01:37:18,813 --> 01:37:21,907
Before, all I wanted was to fit in.

1281
01:37:22,717 --> 01:37:25,982
But I've learned that
we're all searching to fit in

1282
01:37:26,053 --> 01:37:28,283
and we... we all feel like outsiders

1283
01:37:28,356 --> 01:37:31,189
and we all do things and feel things

1284
01:37:31,259 --> 01:37:35,457
that are bizarre
and unconventional and dorky.

1285
01:37:36,497 --> 01:37:39,489
We're all dorks.
Yeah!

1286
01:37:41,335 --> 01:37:44,236
My name is Sydney White.
My dad's a plumber.

1287
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:48,571
I collect comic books
and I'm secretly terrified of balloon animals.

Yeah!

1290
01:37:56,417 --> 01:38:01,719
I'm Tyler Prince. I'm the current
high scorer in Gurkin of Honor.

1291
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:05,815
I'm a dork.

1292

My name is...
Well, it's really Sanford

1293
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:19,804
and I've never had sex
with a girl before.

1294

I'm a dork!

1301

My name's Moose. When I was 13

1302
01:39:00,648 --> 01:39:04,015
I was the top-ranked male figure skater
in the state of New Jersey.

1303
01:39:04,085 --> 01:39:08,249
(man) Dude!
So I guess that makes me a dork.

1304
01:39:13,361 --> 01:39:16,387
I've hated Rachel Witchburn

1305
01:39:16,464 --> 01:39:20,093
ever since she told me I had mom arms
freshman year,

1306
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:24,866
and I have a voodoo doll of her
in my underwear drawer and I stick pins in it.

1307
01:39:28,609 --> 01:39:30,941
Oh, and I'm a dork.

1308

Hi. My name is Dinky Hodgekiss

1309
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:42,346
and I think I'm in love with a dork.

(cheering)

1311

Let's hear it for the dorks!

1312
01:40:10,384 --> 01:40:15,378
Rachel Witchburn, you've exhibited
behavior unsuitable for a Kappa.

1313
01:40:15,456 --> 01:40:21,190
You've lied, manipulated and verbally abused
your sisters and fellow students.

1314
01:40:21,962 --> 01:40:24,453
And you are just such a...

1315
01:40:24,532 --> 01:40:27,194
a bitch.

1316
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:31,972
We, all of us,

1317
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:36,203
hereby strip you of the privileges
of the Kappa sisterhood.

1318
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:40,611
But you can't! You can't just...

1319
01:40:41,048 --> 01:40:43,539
We just did.

1320
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:49,847
Here comes a Kappa, queen of the row.

1321
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:52,916
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.

1322
01:40:52,993 --> 01:40:55,587
She's got style, she's got class.
Prada...

Nah. It's just the mulch.

Hey, we're from Southeast State and we're lost.
Can you help us?

1331
01:42:20,648 --> 01:42:24,015
I will be your guide.

1332
01:42:24,084 --> 01:42:26,314
Give me five minutes.

1333
01:42:26,387 --> 01:42:28,582
Take all the time you need.

1334

Terrence! What happened?

1336
01:42:45,973 --> 01:42:51,502
Hey, guys. I finally perfected
my predictive analytic probability theory.

1337
01:42:53,314 --> 01:42:58,411
It can predict anything from the behavior
of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond

1338
01:42:58,486 --> 01:43:01,478
to the outcome of sporting events.

1339
