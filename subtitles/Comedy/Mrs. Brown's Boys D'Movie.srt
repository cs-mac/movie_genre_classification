00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,950
<font color="#8080ff">Shit! Feck it.</font>

10
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,620
<font color="#8080ff">Hello. I can't stop, I slept late.</font>

11
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,458
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, for God's sake!</font>

12
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,899
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus. Feck it.</font>

13
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,532
<font color="#8080ff">Shit!</font>

14
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,903
<font color="#8080ff">Feck it. Get in!</font>

15
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,850
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, that's me now back on time.</font>

16
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,365
<font color="#8080ff">Wait a minute.</font>

17
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,707
<font color="#8080ff">This shouldn't be here.</font>

18
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,875
<font color="#8080ff">That's better.</font>

19
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,378
<font color="#8080ff">This is the movie!</font>

20
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,447
<font color="#8080ff">Winnie!
Hiya.</font>

21
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,284
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Fat Annie.
Good morning, Agnes.</font>

22
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,057
<font color="#8080ff">Do you think the carrots will be
as expensive today as they were yesterday?</font>

23
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,225
<font color="#8080ff">If they are, I hope they're small ones,</font>

24
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,133
<font color="#8080ff">‘cause the wholesaler
can shove them up his arse.</font>

25
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,771
<font color="#8080ff">Cathy starts her new job today. An ofﬁcejob.</font>

26
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,613
<font color="#8080ff">Imagine being stuck in an ofﬁoe all day.</font>

27
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,156
<font color="#8080ff">Not me, Annie. I'm an independent trader.
Born to it and Iovin' it.</font>

28
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,920
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Father Damien.</font>

29
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,088
<font color="#8080ff">Morning.
This is the life.</font>

30
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,992
<font color="#8080ff">Morning'!
-Ooh, thank you.</font>

31
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,231
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, girls!</font>

32
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,157
<font color="#8080ff">Good morning!</font>

33
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,062
<font color="#8080ff">Good morning, Dublin!</font>

34
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,899
<font color="#8080ff">Get the ﬁnest of fruit and vegetables
from all over the world right here!</font>

35
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,904

36
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,575
<font color="#8080ff">And the friendliest of service!</font>

37
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,908
<font color="#8080ff">Tom, if you're not buying, fuck off.</font>

38
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,078
<font color="#8080ff">There goes Perry Mason.</font>

39
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,247
<font color="#8080ff">Yeah. He wouldn't get a
prison guard out of prison.</font>

40
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,083
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Agnes.
HeIIo, Jasper. What have you got for me?</font>

41
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,788
<font color="#8080ff">That'll be the Revenue Ofﬁce.</font>

42
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,956
<font color="#8080ff">Just as well it's brown, so
they won't see me wiping my arse with it.</font>

43
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,434
<font color="#8080ff">Beautiful kumquats, Brussels sprouts
and prickly pears!</font>

44
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,665
<font color="#8080ff">How are you, love?
Do you want to squeeze my prickly pears?</font>

45
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,604
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Mammy.
Hello, Dermot son.</font>

46
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,339
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Maria.
Hello, Mrs Brown.</font>

47
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,438
<font color="#8080ff">And how's my lovely triplets today?</font>

48
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,415
<font color="#8080ff">George has a touch of wind.</font>

49
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,418
<font color="#8080ff">What's the matter?</font>

50
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,147
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, that's Ringo.</font>

51
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,752
<font color="#8080ff">Hey. you big lizard!</font>

52
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,260
<font color="#8080ff">It's a frog, you blind bastard. Ribbit, ribbit!</font>

53
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,288
<font color="#8080ff">No, Dermot, you're a gecko.</font>

54
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,491
<font color="#8080ff">I've been saying "ribbit, ribbit" all week.</font>

55
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,494
<font color="#8080ff">I'll be off. I have to meet Buster.</font>

56
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,297
<font color="#8080ff">How is Buster, love?
He's fine.</font>

57
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,302
<font color="#8080ff">Are we "not guilty" again today, Buster?</font>

58
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,036
<font color="#8080ff">We are.</font>

59
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:36,042
<font color="#8080ff">So, Mr Cunningham, will you tell the court
how many horses do you own?</font>

60
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,142
<font color="#8080ff">Seven.
But six now, since that bastard stole one.</font>

61
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,313
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, I object.</font>

62
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,823
<font color="#8080ff">He is pointing at my client.</font>

63
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,189
<font color="#8080ff">That is prejudicial.</font>

64
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:51,320
<font color="#8080ff">That, Mr Crews,
is because your client is on trial here.</font>

65
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,229
<font color="#8080ff">That's fair enough, I suppose, isn't it?</font>

66
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,563
<font color="#8080ff">He's good, isn't he?</font>

67
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,200
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Ma.</font>

68
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,173
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Mark. Hello, Betty.</font>

69
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,176
<font color="#8080ff">Great news, Ma.
You're pregnant?</font>

70
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,910
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, thank God. A brother for Bono.
I'll start knitting.</font>

71
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,746
<font color="#8080ff">It's not a brother for Bono.</font>

72
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,150
<font color="#8080ff">A sister for Bono. I'll start knitting.</font>

73
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,349
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not pregnant.
Are you sure?</font>

74
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,588
<font color="#8080ff">It's a job, Ma.
For Bono? He's only six, love.</font>

75
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,592
<font color="#8080ff">Mark's got a new carpentry contract.
A big one.</font>

76
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,559
<font color="#8080ff">Congratulations, love.</font>

77
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,830
<font color="#8080ff">Poor Bono. Growing up an only child.</font>

78
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,832
<font color="#8080ff">See you later, Ma.</font>

79
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,735
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Evelyn.</font>

80
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,209
<font color="#8080ff">She's looking great. Hope she paid for that...</font>

81
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,180
<font color="#8080ff">Morning, Agnes.
My fuckin' foot!</font>

82
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,376
<font color="#8080ff">Will you two feckin' talk to each other,
and don't be texting.</font>

83
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,181
<font color="#8080ff">I see you, Laura, I see you.</font>

84
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,756
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Braden. Look at you.</font>

85
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,223
<font color="#8080ff">He's getting hairy like his father.</font>

86
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,887
<font color="#8080ff">A very good morning to you, Agnes.
Hello, Rab.</font>

87
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,227
<font color="#8080ff">Out last night doing a bit of reggae?
I am not from Jamaica.</font>

88
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,961
<font color="#8080ff">Lie down girl
Let me push it up, push it up #</font>

89
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,105
<font color="#8080ff">Here, Rasta man... Take the air out of that.</font>

90
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,277
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Cunningham...</font>

91
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,748
<font color="#8080ff">Is it true that you starve your animals?</font>

92
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,878
<font color="#8080ff">Tom Crews, solicitor. C-R-E-W-S.</font>

93
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,819
<font color="#8080ff">In fact, were you not found guilty
of the mistreatment of your horses</font>

94
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:30,259
<font color="#8080ff">on four occasions over the past 12 months?</font>

95
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,230
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, if I may...</font>

96
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,596
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Cunningham is not on trial here.</font>

97
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,101
<font color="#8080ff">Go somewhere else, please, Mr Crews.</font>

98
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,468
<font color="#8080ff">With, with, with the questions.</font>

99
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,101
<font color="#8080ff">Yeah, the...</font>

100
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,008
<font color="#8080ff">He...</font>

101
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,505
<font color="#8080ff">A horse. He...
Psst!</font>

102
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,744
<font color="#8080ff">Come.</font>

103
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,114
<font color="#8080ff">Do we have a question, Mr Crews?</font>

104
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,620
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Cunningham,</font>

105
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,131
<font color="#8080ff">what is the name of this horse
that you allege my client stole?</font>

106
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,327
<font color="#8080ff">ljust called him "horsey".
Like, "Come here, horsey, horsey'.</font>

107
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,303
<font color="#8080ff">No, not what you called it.
The name—name of this horse.</font>

108
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,139
<font color="#8080ff">I mean, it would be on the papers
that you have for this horse.</font>

109
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,680
<font color="#8080ff">I don't have papers.
He didn't come with papers.</font>

110
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,143
<font color="#8080ff">You have a photograph of this horse?</font>

111
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,144
<font color="#8080ff">What the fuck would I be doing
taking a photograph of a horse for?</font>

112
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,990
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, without any evidence
of the existence of this horse,</font>

113
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:40,055
<font color="#8080ff">how can my client be accused of stealing it?</font>

114
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,159
<font color="#8080ff">To all intents and purposes,
this horse does not even exist.</font>

115
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,707
<font color="#8080ff">I have a very busy day ahead of me.</font>

116
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,710
<font color="#8080ff">I can't spend time on the theft
of an invisible horse.</font>

117
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,473
<font color="#8080ff">Case dismissed.</font>

118
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,349
<font color="#8080ff">How can a one-pound box of chocolates
put on five pounds?</font>

119
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,085
<font color="#8080ff">It's beyond my apprehension.</font>

120
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,089
<font color="#8080ff">Cathy's talking about getting me
something nice for my birthday.</font>

121
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,993
<font color="#8080ff">Really? What?</font>

122
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,158
<font color="#8080ff">Tickets to go to Placido Dodominigo.</font>

123
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,101
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, lovely. For a week or 10 days?</font>

124
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,399
<font color="#8080ff">Speaking of birthdays, I don't know what
to get my Sharon for hers next week.</font>

125
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,104
<font color="#8080ff">Get her a book.
No, she has one.</font>

126
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,518
<font color="#8080ff">You know, Winnie,
I live for these little chats of ours.</font>

127
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,349
<font color="#8080ff">Me, too, Agnes.
Here, come on.</font>

128
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,355
<font color="#8080ff">Off with you. I have work to do.</font>

129
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,084
<font color="#8080ff">OK.</font>

130
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,853
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, love?</font>

131
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,054
<font color="#8080ff">What's the difference between
those apples for 50 cents</font>

132
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,960
<font color="#8080ff">and those for apples for 75?</font>

133
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,465
<font color="#8080ff">Well these ones are low fat.
They're called Granny Smith Lite.</font>

134
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,930
<font color="#8080ff">I'll take of the low fat 75 cent ones.</font>

135
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,434
<font color="#8080ff">That's 1.50, love, please.</font>

136
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,202
<font color="#8080ff">There you go.</font>

137
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,972
<font color="#8080ff">Have a nice day.</font>

138
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,741
<font color="#8080ff">You're a gas, Agnes.
The low fat ones should be cheaper.</font>

139
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,908
<font color="#8080ff">Winnie, off with you. Go on, go.
Right.</font>

140
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,621
<font color="#8080ff">Farm fresh eggs!</font>

141
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,815
<font color="#8080ff">So fresh the hen doesn't
even know they're missing yet!</font>

142
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,422
<font color="#8080ff">Are you all right there, Maggie?
Can you manage, love?</font>

143
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,903
<font color="#8080ff">That's 15 stalls in six months.</font>

144
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,272
<font color="#8080ff">Bastards.</font>

145
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,801
<font color="#8080ff">They won't be happy
till they close us all down.</font>

146
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,403
<font color="#8080ff">Then there won't be a Moore Street Market.</font>

147
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,177
<font color="#8080ff">Well, they won't take me without a fight,
Fat Annie.</font>

148
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,679
<font color="#8080ff">Whoever they are.</font>

149
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,030
<font color="#8080ff">Another one gone, Ivan.</font>

150
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:10,712
<font color="#8080ff">Now all we need are four more,
and we can start building.</font>

151
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,979
<font color="#8080ff">And once we have started building,</font>

152
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,114
<font color="#8080ff">all of the other stall holders
will just shut up shop.</font>

153
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,331
<font color="#8080ff">He says get building shopping centre,
or he will rip off your fucking head</font>

154
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,061
<font color="#8080ff">and sheet down your neck.</font>

155
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,307
<font color="#8080ff">The working class can fuck my ass.
(LAUGHING)</font>

156
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,139
<font color="#8080ff">"Kiss my arse".
What?</font>

157
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,875
<font color="#8080ff">The words are "kiss my arse".
"Fuck my arse" is an entirely...</font>

158
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,414
<font color="#8080ff">Calm down, Ivan.</font>

159
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,083
<font color="#8080ff">Your money is safe. No need to worry.</font>

160
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,818
<font color="#8080ff">We've started on planning
permission already.</font>

161
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,926
<font color="#8080ff">Now...</font>

162
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:04,935
<font color="#8080ff">Let's see which stall will be
the next one to go, shall we?</font>

163
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,335
<font color="#8080ff">This one.</font>

164
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,336
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus.
Are you all right, Agnes?</font>

165
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,904
<font color="#8080ff">I got a shiver,
like somebodyjust walked over me grave.</font>

166
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,214
<font color="#8080ff">Annie.</font>

167
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,747
<font color="#8080ff">Keep an eye here, will you?
I want to run this up to Cathy at her newjob.</font>

168
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,520
<font color="#8080ff">No bother, Agnes.</font>

169
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,358
<font color="#8080ff">To Cathy.
Good luck in your new job.</font>

170
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,298
<font color="#8080ff">I believe in you. Mammy.</font>

171
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,631
<font color="#8080ff">Settling in OK there, little lady?</font>

172
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,468
<font color="#8080ff">Well, sort of, Mr Bullwhip.</font>

173
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,707
<font color="#8080ff">Calm down.
We don't stand on ceremony here, honey.</font>

174
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,872
<font color="#8080ff">And it's Cathy. Not "honey" or "little lady‘.</font>

175
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,609
<font color="#8080ff">Very good.</font>

176
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,980
<font color="#8080ff">Yoo-hoo!</font>

177
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,250
<font color="#8080ff">I'm at the window.</font>

178
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
<font color="#8080ff">I'm still not sure of my role here.
AGNES: I have fruit.</font>

179
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,394
<font color="#8080ff">Look, Cathy...
Bananas.</font>

180
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,661
<font color="#8080ff">People buy something
not because they need it...</font>

181
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,266
<font color="#8080ff">...but because we, the advertising geniuses,</font>

182
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,297
<font color="#8080ff">try to ﬁnd a way to convince them
that they want it.</font>

183
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,770
<font color="#8080ff">Do you?
You mean, "Do we", babe.</font>

184
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,507
<font color="#8080ff">Who the fuck is he?</font>

185
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,177
<font color="#8080ff">Right, well...</font>

186
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,181
<font color="#8080ff">Settle in, sweetheart.</font>

187
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,990
<font color="#8080ff">Madam.
Fuckface.</font>

188
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,189
<font color="#8080ff">I beg your pardon?</font>

189
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,663
<font color="#8080ff">Nice... Nice place, I said. Good place.</font>

190
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,427
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy! Get in here.</font>

191
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,968
<font color="#8080ff">''settle in, sweetheart."</font>

192
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,975
<font color="#8080ff">I know. I heard.</font>

193
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,809
<font color="#8080ff">You wouldn't have to put up with that shit
if you worked for yourself.</font>

194
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,842
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not taking over the stall!</font>

195
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,043
<font color="#8080ff">I'm just saying, that's all I did...</font>

196
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,481
<font color="#8080ff">I'mjust... I...</font>

197
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,017
<font color="#8080ff">I'm just saying!</font>

198
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,716
<font color="#8080ff">Didn't hurt.</font>

199
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,025
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, Winnie. While it's warm.</font>

200
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,468
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes. . .
What?</font>

201
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:26,001
<font color="#8080ff">How come Father Damien always gives you
more penance than he gives me?</font>

202
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,807
<font color="#8080ff">Because I've a lot more sins.</font>

203
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,541
<font color="#8080ff">No, you don't.</font>

204
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,344
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, Ido.</font>

205
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,888
<font color="#8080ff">Bless me, Father, for! have sinned.</font>

206
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,563
<font color="#8080ff">This box is already in use.
Winnie, get out.</font>

207
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,004
<font color="#8080ff">Not until I've heard your sins.
Father, I'm much more sinful than her.</font>

208
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,407
<font color="#8080ff">What?
will you get out, for Jesus‘ sake?</font>

209
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,275
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, do not take
the Lord's name in vain.</font>

210
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,942
<font color="#8080ff">Sorry, Father, I'll add it on
to my list in a minute.</font>

211
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,711
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy?</font>

212
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:09,084
<font color="#8080ff">Father, is that my Cathy?
I had impure thoughts, Father.</font>

213
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,883
<font color="#8080ff">Shut up, Winnie.</font>

214
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,951
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Father Damien.</font>

215
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,890
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Cathy.</font>

216
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,622
<font color="#8080ff">Look, if you need to talk...</font>

217
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,630
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy, what is this?
I can't see.</font>

218
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,862
<font color="#8080ff">It's an envelope.</font>

219
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,062
<font color="#8080ff">I robbed a bank.
A bank?</font>

220
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,105
<font color="#8080ff">You did not, Winnie. Shut up!</font>

221
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,869
<font color="#8080ff">It's a letter from the tax ofﬁce.
"FinaI Notice" it says.</font>

222
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,570
<font color="#8080ff">Why haven't you done something about it?</font>

223
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,046
<font color="#8080ff">I don't pay tax. I changed my name to Google.</font>

224
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,084
<font color="#8080ff">Look ladies, if you wanna chat,
why don't you go somewhere else?</font>

225
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,812
<font color="#8080ff">Shush, Father.</font>

226
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,718
<font color="#8080ff">That is a letter about my business,
about my stall,</font>

227
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,484
<font color="#8080ff">and you have made it perfectly clear...</font>

228
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,491
<font color="#8080ff">It's a demand for a payment.</font>

229
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,322
<font color="#8080ff">This is not the place.</font>

230
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,089
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, it is.</font>

231
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,791
<font color="#8080ff">Apparently my grandmother
owes them £96.</font>

232
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,925
<font color="#8080ff">And as the current owner
of the business, I'm liable.</font>

233
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,335
<font color="#8080ff">I had sex with a farm animal.
What?</font>

234
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,099
<font color="#8080ff">A goat.</font>

235
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,632
<font color="#8080ff">No, you did not.</font>

236
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,177
<font color="#8080ff">Not even a goat would give her a snag, Father.</font>

237
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,270
<font color="#8080ff">That's it! That's it, ladies. Out!</font>

238
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,009
<font color="#8080ff">Come on! Out now!</font>

239
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,016
<font color="#8080ff">Give me penance. Come on, lay it on me.</font>

240
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,816
<font color="#8080ff">Do your worst!</font>

241
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,660
<font color="#8080ff">You better take this serious.</font>

242
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,127
<font color="#8080ff">Fine. I'll go to the tax ofﬁce in the morning.</font>

243
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,994
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs McGoogan, are you licking my shoes?</font>

244
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,362
<font color="#8080ff">£96.</font>

245
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,165
<font color="#8080ff">Even with interest and penalties,
it can't be that bad.</font>

246
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,767
<font color="#8080ff">Are you feckin' mad? How much?</font>

247
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,311
<font color="#8080ff">Four million Euro.</font>

248
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,808
<font color="#8080ff">Four million Euro?</font>

249
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,049
<font color="#8080ff">Ah, listen, love, there must be some mistake.</font>

250
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,884
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus, now you've killed her.</font>

251
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,516
<font color="#8080ff">How much?</font>

252
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,390
<font color="#8080ff">So, I've had quite a large tax bill.</font>

253
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,891
<font color="#8080ff">Four million Euro.</font>

254
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,060
<font color="#8080ff">But you mustn't worry.</font>

255
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,416
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not worrying. It's not my problem.</font>

256
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,889
<font color="#8080ff">Your mummy's right.
There's nothing to worry about.</font>

257
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,425
<font color="#8080ff">The man in the Revenue Office
said it was probably a mistake.</font>

258
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,689
<font color="#8080ff">When did he say that?
Just after you passed out.</font>

259
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,755
<font color="#8080ff">But why didn't you tell me?
You were passed out.</font>

260
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,160
<font color="#8080ff">For God's sake, sometimes you're
as useless as a knitted condom.</font>

261
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,371
<font color="#8080ff">Well, he said he'd ring you.</font>

262
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,370
<font color="#8080ff">Wish me luck.</font>

263
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,742
<font color="#8080ff">Hello?</font>

264
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,910
<font color="#8080ff">Wish me luck.</font>

265
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,011
<font color="#8080ff">Hello? How do you do?</font>

266
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,053
<font color="#8080ff">Speaking.</font>

267
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,389
<font color="#8080ff">It's him. It is a mistake?</font>

268
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,958
<font color="#8080ff">I only owe 3.8 million?</font>

269
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,201
<font color="#8080ff">Well, that's a relief.
I won't have to sell the feckin' yacht.</font>

270
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,099
<font color="#8080ff">I think you will have to sell the yacht.</font>

271
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,573
<font color="#8080ff">How long have you had a yacht?
How much is a yacht worth?</font>

272
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,134
<font color="#8080ff">I don't have a feckin' yacht!</font>

273
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,207
<font color="#8080ff">I know. You go on hunger strike.
Refuse to eat until they cancel the bill.</font>

274
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,218
<font color="#8080ff">They'd have to cancel it in 20 minutes.
I'm fuckin' starvin'.</font>

275
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,720
<font color="#8080ff">I have a better idea.</font>

276
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,892
<font color="#8080ff">I get the old unit together.
We blow up the Revenue Ofﬁce,</font>

277
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,451
<font color="#8080ff">then we barricade ourselves in here,</font>

278
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,793
<font color="#8080ff">prime the place with booby traps</font>

279
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,595
<font color="#8080ff">and take out the first tax man that comes near.</font>

281
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,768
<font color="#8080ff">They'll never take you alive.</font>

282
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,743
<font color="#8080ff">Somebody get his feckin' tablets.</font>

283
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,940
<font color="#8080ff">What we need is a lawyer, Mammy.</font>

284
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,005
<font color="#8080ff">All right, but a cheap one.</font>

285
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,580
<font color="#8080ff">Now, I can't make head nor tails of this.</font>

286
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:09,822
<font color="#8080ff">According to this reference number,
you need a licence to import cobra snakes.</font>

287
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,962
<font color="#8080ff">That's not a reference number. It's a date.</font>

288
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,635
<font color="#8080ff">I said cheap. I didn't mean this fucking cheap.</font>

289
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,497
<font color="#8080ff">Offer the tax people a euro a week.</font>

290
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,303
<font color="#8080ff">Winnie, don't be ridiculous.</font>

291
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,671
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not, Agnes.</font>

292
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,474
<font color="#8080ff">They might not accept it</font>

293
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:32,381
<font color="#8080ff">but once you make an offer
the courts have to consider it.</font>

294
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,145
<font color="#8080ff">She's right.</font>

295
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,381
<font color="#8080ff">How do you know all this, Mrs McGoogan?</font>

296
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,719
<font color="#8080ff">Iworked in the Revenue Ofﬁce.</font>

297
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,485
<font color="#8080ff">You were a tax collector?</font>

298
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,791
<font color="#8080ff">Cleaner. But I heard things.</font>

299
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,730
<font color="#8080ff">If that's the case,
it'll give us time to set up a fund.</font>

300
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,204
<font color="#8080ff">A fund?
The Mrs Brown Defence Fund."</font>

301
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,637
<font color="#8080ff">I'm liking this. Who'll be treasurer?</font>

302
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,369
<font color="#8080ff">Not you.</font>

303
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,484
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Mrs Brown.</font>

304
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,319
<font color="#8080ff">Hello. Can I help you?</font>

305
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,189
<font color="#8080ff">Actually, it's me who's here
to help you, madam.</font>

306
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:21,726
<font color="#8080ff">I don't get it. Why would you want
to buy my mother's stall and licence?</font>

307
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,097
<font color="#8080ff">My client is a well-known retailer.</font>

308
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:28,230
<font color="#8080ff">Who, I'm sure you'll appreciate,
I'm not at liberty to reveal at this time.</font>

309
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,106
<font color="#8080ff">And he sees this as an opportunity
to invest in the community.</font>

310
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,940
<font color="#8080ff">30,000 is a lot of money.</font>

311
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,446
<font color="#8080ff">Over 200 years is a lot of heritage.</font>

312
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,610
<font color="#8080ff">It was my great, great grandmother
that started the stall.</font>

313
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,688
<font color="#8080ff">It's been handed down to the eldest girl
in the family ever since.</font>

314
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,555
<font color="#8080ff">Since 1802.</font>

315
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,757
<font color="#8080ff">The times they are a-changing.</font>

316
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,564
<font color="#8080ff">There's one problem.
And that is?</font>

317
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,730
<font color="#8080ff">Show him the tax letter.</font>

318
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,070
<font color="#8080ff">Not a problem.</font>

319
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,975
<font color="#8080ff">It's now 3.8 million.</font>

320
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:11,877
<font color="#8080ff">My client brings a lot of investment
and employment to Ireland.</font>

321
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,977
<font color="#8080ff">Once we agree the sale,
we can make this go away.</font>

322
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,553
<font color="#8080ff">Really? Just like that?
Just like that.</font>

323
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,825
<font color="#8080ff">Right then. I'll leave that with you.</font>

324
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,420
<font color="#8080ff">You have my card.</font>

325
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,159
<font color="#8080ff">I'll see you out.</font>

326
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,776
<font color="#8080ff">I'm sorry, Granny.</font>

327
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,144
<font color="#8080ff">I've let you down.</font>

328
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,519
<font color="#8080ff">There's my grandmother.</font>

329
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,119
<font color="#8080ff">They were false teeth.</font>

330
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,790
<font color="#8080ff">They were a wedding present.</font>

331
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,633
<font color="#8080ff">Only If we are united can
we save Moore Street Market.</font>

332
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,466
<font color="#8080ff">So, does anyone have a question
for our political representative, Mr Inuin?</font>

333
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,342
<font color="#8080ff">Silence!</font>

334
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:14,310
<font color="#8080ff">Now, look, I am here to assure you</font>

335
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,010
<font color="#8080ff">that as long as I am the representative
for this constituency,</font>

336
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,548
<font color="#8080ff">Moore Street Market is here to stay!</font>

337
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,617
<font color="#8080ff">And now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will excuse me,</font>

338
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,786
<font color="#8080ff">I have some government
business to attend to.</font>

339
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,796
<font color="#8080ff">Very good. Thank you.</font>

340
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,533
<font color="#8080ff">Lots of shite about nothing.
Living the dream, what?</font>

341
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,831
<font color="#8080ff">Living the dream.</font>

342
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,175
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown. You came.</font>

343
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,476
<font color="#8080ff">I forgot this was even on.
We'rejust here for a drink, that's all.</font>

344
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,176
<font color="#8080ff">But, Agnes, you are the most important
of all the stallholders in Moore Street.</font>

345
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,344
<font color="#8080ff">Well...
Not for long.</font>

346
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,821
<font color="#8080ff">What? What does she mean?
Nothing, nothing.</font>

347
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,051
<font color="#8080ff">She's selling her stall.
Winnie, move.</font>

348
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,023
<font color="#8080ff">Can I have your attention, please?
Show us your cock!</font>

349
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,762
<font color="#8080ff">Shh!</font>

350
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:15,037
<font color="#8080ff">I have an important announcement
concerning Mrs Agnes Brown.</font>

351
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,536
<font color="#8080ff">What's he feckin' saying?</font>

352
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,271
<font color="#8080ff">They have won again.</font>

353
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:26,181
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown is selling her stall
and leaving Moore Street.</font>

354
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,957
<font color="#8080ff">Shit, do something.</font>

355
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,893
<font color="#8080ff">Stop it.</font>

356
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,363
<font color="#8080ff">I'm thinking about it.
I haven't made a decision yet.</font>

357
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,234
<font color="#8080ff">Don't look at me like that!</font>

358
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,407
<font color="#8080ff">It's nothing to do
with Rab's imaginary "them".</font>

359
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,916
<font color="#8080ff">I have a tax bill.
I can't afford to pay it. That's it.</font>

360
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,076
<font color="#8080ff">But we all love you, Mrs Brown.</font>

361
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,918
<font color="#8080ff">If you cannot pay it, we will all
chip in and help you pay it.</font>

362
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,321
<font color="#8080ff">We are family.
Yes.</font>

363
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,416
<font color="#8080ff">I've no fucking family in Jamaica.</font>

364
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,553
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not Jamaican.</font>

365
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,263
<font color="#8080ff">Hands up those that will chip in
to help Mrs Brown.</font>

366
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,667
<font color="#8080ff">The tax bill's about four million Euro.</font>

367
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:27,674
<font color="#8080ff">There you are, Rab. Look, Mr Patel...
I don't know, maybe you're right.</font>

368
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,680
<font color="#8080ff">Maybe there is a "them",
but it makes no difference.</font>

369
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,977
<font color="#8080ff">Exactly. No difference.</font>

370
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,850
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes doesn't care who it is.
She'll not leave Moore Street without a fight.</font>

371
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,617
<font color="#8080ff">Exactly.</font>

372
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:43,486
<font color="#8080ff">No, wait, wait. Winnie, what the fuck are you...
Winnie, get back here!</font>

373
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,161
<font color="#8080ff">Did you think for one minute Agnes Brown
would go without a ﬁght?</font>

374
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,961
<font color="#8080ff">No!</font>

375
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,628
<font color="#8080ff">When they tried to double the price
of the licence, who beat them down?</font>

376
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,364
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes.</font>

377
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,635
<font color="#8080ff">When the Corporation tried to reduce
the stall spaoe, who told them to...</font>

378
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,539
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes!</font>

379
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,773
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus Christ.</font>

380
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:07,148
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, Winnie. What have you feckin' started?</font>

381
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,517
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, we're going to Jamaica</font>

382
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,182
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, back to the palm trees.</font>

383
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,540
<font color="#8080ff">Rip off heads!</font>

384
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,932
<font color="#8080ff">Not yet.</font>

385
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,508
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Bogmonovitch
doesn't like public meetings.</font>

386
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,380
<font color="#8080ff">This Mrs Brown, she has a mouth on her.</font>

387
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,511
<font color="#8080ff">I was there, remember?</font>

388
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,783
<font color="#8080ff">Now I wouldn't be getting too worried
about a little local public meeting.</font>

389
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:25,226
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Bogmonovitch says that we should
rip off her head and sheet down her neck.</font>

390
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,596
<font color="#8080ff">Well, yes, Gregor, if the need arises.</font>

391
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,761
<font color="#8080ff">But for now, let's keep the whole thing
under the radar.</font>

392
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,739
<font color="#8080ff">Let's keep this quiet, hmm?</font>

393
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,260
<font color="#8080ff">Mummy, they're talking
about Granny on the TV.</font>

394
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,599
<font color="#8080ff">But what we know is Agnes Brown
is a mother of six children</font>

395
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,501
<font color="#8080ff">whom she reared alone.</font>

396
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,768
<font color="#8080ff">Her only income
is from her Moore Street stall</font>

397
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,106
<font color="#8080ff">which has been handed down from
mother to daughter for generations</font>

398
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,443
<font color="#8080ff">And which, I believe, is now under threat.
Yes, Eamonn,</font>

399
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,507
<font color="#8080ff">I'm here on Moore Street with Rab Patel...</font>

400
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,314
<font color="#8080ff">A shop owner originally from Jamaica.</font>

401
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,084
<font color="#8080ff">Tell me, Mr Patel,
what exactly is the threat facing this market?</font>

402
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,785
<font color="#8080ff">This is not new.</font>

403
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,625
<font color="#8080ff">There is someone trying to drive us
all out of Moore Street Market.</font>

404
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,597
<font color="#8080ff">A developer. And he knows who he is!</font>

405
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,310
<font color="#8080ff">OK, enough now. Move on.</font>

406
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,716
<font color="#8080ff">Seriously, go now. I have work to do.</font>

407
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,779
<font color="#8080ff">Hey! Fuck off!</font>

408
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,721
<font color="#8080ff">Move it! Shoo!</font>

409
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,820
<font color="#8080ff">Well, you've certainly made a splash.</font>

410
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,831
<font color="#8080ff">I've no time for that shite, Annie.</font>

411
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,462
<font color="#8080ff">Fresh fruit and vegetables!</font>

412
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,899
<font color="#8080ff">As seen on TV!</font>

413
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,973
<font color="#8080ff">Just the one, love? That'll be 75 cents.</font>

414
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,911
<font color="#8080ff">75 fucking cent.</font>

415
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,581
<font color="#8080ff">Now it's a smoothie. That's 2.50.</font>

416
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,151
<font color="#8080ff">Hey! You sell your stall, you stupid bitch!</font>

417
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,889
<font color="#8080ff">Excuse me a moment.</font>

418
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,933
<font color="#8080ff">Anything else, love?</font>

419
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,063
<font color="#8080ff">I'll be back.
Hasta la vista, Arnie.</font>

420
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,403
<font color="#8080ff">And you'll want to bring more
than the Blues Brothers.</font>

421
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,343
<font color="#8080ff">You'll fucking need them.</font>

422
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,443
<font color="#8080ff">Are you all right, Mammy?</font>

423
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,417
<font color="#8080ff">Rab Patel is right.
Somethings going on, Dermot.</font>

424
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,613
<font color="#8080ff">I've just been threatened by Russian thugs.</font>

425
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,290
<font color="#8080ff">Russian?
I think they'll be back.</font>

426
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,053
<font color="#8080ff">Why?</font>

427
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,254
<font color="#8080ff">‘Cause he said "l'Il be back“.</font>

428
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,261
<font color="#8080ff">Hiya, Gloria. I'm looking for Buster Brady.
Is he doing something here?</font>

429
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,966
<font color="#8080ff">That little shit. He's down the big hall.
Thank you.</font>

430
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,075
<font color="#8080ff">You Itiusi Use your senses.</font>

431
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,316
<font color="#8080ff">Trust them.</font>

432
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,819
<font color="#8080ff">They will tell you where the glass is.</font>

433
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,490
<font color="#8080ff">You're like a cheetah in the dark,</font>

434
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,259
<font color="#8080ff">but you'd know exactly
where to place your foot.</font>

435
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,602
<font color="#8080ff">You're invincible.</font>

436
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,331
<font color="#8080ff">A human radar.</font>

437
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,941
<font color="#8080ff">Hiya, Dermot. Here, I'll leave that with you.</font>

438
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,609
<font color="#8080ff">What the hell are you doing?</font>

439
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,307
<font color="#8080ff">Just helping Mr Wang.</font>

440
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,577
<font color="#8080ff">Ah, you dope.</font>

441
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,847
<font color="#8080ff">Medic!
On my way.</font>

442
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,622
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Wang hurt his leg,
so I just said I'd help out.</font>

443
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,425
<font color="#8080ff">Ninja, for the blind?</font>

444
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,794
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, friend of Misser Busser.</font>

445
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:25,997
<font color="#8080ff">You're very welcome to Mr Wang
number one Ninja School for the Brind.</font>

446
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,038
<font color="#8080ff">He's not even Chinese!</font>

447
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,201
<font color="#8080ff">Herro, Mr Taliban! I'm from Sichuan Province.</font>

448
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,506
<font color="#8080ff">He's from Finglas.</font>

449
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,276
<font color="#8080ff">Everybody look at me and say
"What you doing in my country?"</font>

450
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,979
<font color="#8080ff">I say “Ha, Chinese". They go...</font>

451
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,117
<font color="#8080ff">-Keep going.
-(IN NORMAL VOICE) I'm sorry.</font>

452
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,059
<font color="#8080ff">Your spit went past me.</font>

453
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,329
<font color="#8080ff">You only see brind people.</font>

454
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,889
<font color="#8080ff">You do not see that
they see more than you see.</font>

455
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,832
<font color="#8080ff">Please, show some respect.</font>

456
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,071
<font color="#8080ff">You brind fucker. I kill you!</font>

457
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,301
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, let's get out of here.
I need to talk to you.</font>

458
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,137
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy has a problem,
and I think the Russians are involved.</font>

459
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,048
<font color="#8080ff">The Russians?
I'm not getting involved in that.</font>

460
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,176
<font color="#8080ff">Marie is thinking about setting up a fund.</font>

461
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,982
<font color="#8080ff">A fund? I'm in.</font>

462
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,587
<font color="#8080ff">I kill you! You can't run, you can't hide!
I kill you!</font>

463
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,998
<font color="#8080ff">A quiz night.
That should raise at least 200 Euro.</font>

464
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,261
<font color="#8080ff">This lawyer and the barrister
could cost up to 25,000.</font>

465
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,039
<font color="#8080ff">I've a sponsor here who'll pay 5,000 Euro</font>

466
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,575
<font color="#8080ff">If somebody agrees
to swim across the Channel.</font>

467
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,407
<font color="#8080ff">No.
wait, I'll do that.</font>

468
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,539
<font color="#8080ff">Really?
Oh, Maria, he's a great swimmer.</font>

469
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,779
<font color="#8080ff">Are you sure?
Yeah. How hard can it be?</font>

470
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:51,117
<font color="#8080ff">We could make it really big.
It could be the launch of the whole thing.</font>

471
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,081
<font color="#8080ff">Right, then, let's do it. This weekend.</font>

472
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,059
<font color="#8080ff">What? Do you not need
to train for a few weeks?</font>

473
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,188
<font color="#8080ff">Not at all.
A wonderful swimmer.</font>

474
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,627
<font color="#8080ff">A dolphin.</font>

475
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,904
<font color="#8080ff">I thought she said the canal.</font>

476
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,703
<font color="#8080ff">Shh.</font>

477
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,736
<font color="#8080ff">Nowjust do your best.
Just go as far as you can.</font>

478
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,544
<font color="#8080ff">You're very brave.</font>

479
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,045
<font color="#8080ff">I have this, thank you, Barbara.</font>

480
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,310
<font color="#8080ff">Fine.</font>

481
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,912
<font color="#8080ff">This is an injustice
of mammoth proportions.</font>

482
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:29,791
<font color="#8080ff">A widow being persecuted
while the bankers and developer barons</font>

483
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,589
<font color="#8080ff">ride roughshod over the law!</font>

484
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,104
<font color="#8080ff">Five, four, three, two, one.</font>

485
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,174
<font color="#8080ff">Go!</font>

486
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,931
<font color="#8080ff">It's freezing!</font>

487
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,842
<font color="#8080ff">Rory! Rory!</font>

488
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,175
<font color="#8080ff">Barbara, towel.</font>

489
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,643
<font color="#8080ff">Rory!</font>

490
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,781
<font color="#8080ff">Rory!</font>

491
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,023
<font color="#8080ff">Rory, come back!</font>

492
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,396
<font color="#8080ff">OK, when we get in here,
let me do the talking.</font>

493
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,695
<font color="#8080ff">These Russians don't scare too easy,
so let's try and sort this diplomatically.</font>

494
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,463
<font color="#8080ff">OK.</font>

495
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,631
<font color="#8080ff">And you know the drill. If it looks like
it's gonna kick off, what do we do?</font>

496
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,368
<font color="#8080ff">Run like fuck.
ExactIy.</font>

497
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,211
<font color="#8080ff">Excuse me.</font>

498
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,821
<font color="#8080ff">We don't want any bad blood between us,</font>

499
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,194
<font color="#8080ff">but one of you lot threatened my
mother, and I'm not having that.</font>

500
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,368
<font color="#8080ff">What the fuck?</font>

501
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,878
<font color="#8080ff">I think he said everybody can be friends.</font>

502
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,675
<font color="#8080ff">How do you know?</font>

503
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,114
<font color="#8080ff">I used to have a Russian girlfriend.</font>

504
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:35,380
<font color="#8080ff">Well, "girlfriend's" a bit strong.
She gave me a discount.</font>

505
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,018
<font color="#8080ff">Well, tell him that we want to be friends.</font>

506
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,949
<font color="#8080ff">Way to go, Buster. Well done.</font>

507
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,389
<font color="#8080ff">I will not kill your mother
because her name is Agnes.</font>

508
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,332
<font color="#8080ff">It was my grandmother's name.</font>

509
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,564
<font color="#8080ff">He said...
I heard him.</font>

510
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,467
<font color="#8080ff">And what is your name?
Buster.</font>

511
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,937
<font color="#8080ff">But all my friends call me Agnes.</font>

512
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,021
<font color="#8080ff">These are a serious bunch.</font>

513
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,851
<font color="#8080ff">Maybe. But they don't have what we have.</font>

514
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,957
<font color="#8080ff">Ninjas.</font>

515
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,689
<font color="#8080ff">Shut up, Buster.</font>

516
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,460
<font color="#8080ff">Give me that phone here.</font>

517
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,340
<font color="#8080ff">Hello?</font>

518
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:47,916
<font color="#8080ff">This is Red Dog.
We need to get the unit together.</font>

519
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,848
<font color="#8080ff">I have a little job.</font>

520
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,566
<font color="#8080ff">So that's them?
Yeah.</font>

521
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,210
<font color="#8080ff">Time we sent them a little message.</font>

522
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,043
<font color="#8080ff">A bomb?
Yeah.</font>

523
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:21,017
<font color="#8080ff">Just enough to turn that
coffee bar into a car park.</font>

524
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,053
<font color="#8080ff">And who's making the device?</font>

525
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,850
<font color="#8080ff">He should be here any minute.</font>

526
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,453
<font color="#8080ff">Here he is now, right on time.</font>

527
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:43,798
<font color="#8080ff">He's priming the device.
Then he'll drive it up to the target.</font>

528
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,969
<font color="#8080ff">That looks likes "The Hammer" Murphy.</font>

529
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,741
<font color="#8080ff">It is. The best in the business.</font>

530
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,210
<font color="#8080ff">Ah... And I thought he had Parkinson's.</font>

531
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,561
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, shit. Scatter.</font>

532
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:20,770
<font color="#8080ff">Eileen, did you see somebody blew up
the Parkinson's charity shop last night?</font>

533
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,279
<font color="#8080ff">I did. Disgraceful.</font>

534
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,077
<font color="#8080ff">Should be ashamed of themselves.</font>

535
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,145
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes Brown.</font>

536
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,115
<font color="#8080ff">Philomena Nine Warts.
There you are.</font>

537
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,521
<font color="#8080ff">I was looking for you everywhere.</font>

538
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,285
<font color="#8080ff">Well Iwasn't feckin' hiding.</font>

539
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,623
<font color="#8080ff">I wanted to tell you something.</font>

540
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,356
<font color="#8080ff">This is all very dramatic.</font>

541
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:44,663
<font color="#8080ff">ljust didn't want to be discussing your
private business in front of everybody.</font>

542
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,034
<font color="#8080ff">My private business.</font>

543
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:57,143
<font color="#8080ff">I was at the bingo last night and I was
talking to the girls about your tax thing.</font>

544
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,012
<font color="#8080ff">My private tax thing?
Yeah.</font>

545
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,778
<font color="#8080ff">Go on.</font>

546
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,150
<font color="#8080ff">The next thing, my granny...
Mary Moccasin.</font>

547
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:08,022
<font color="#8080ff">She said she was in the Revenue Office
paying her tax</font>

548
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,390
<font color="#8080ff">the same day your granny was there</font>

549
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:14,329
<font color="#8080ff">and she saw your granny paying the bill.</font>

550
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,128
<font color="#8080ff">-So my granny paid it?
—Yep.</font>

551
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,135
<font color="#8080ff">-I'd love to talk to your granny.
—No problem.</font>

552
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,896
<font color="#8080ff">MAN: Droopy drawers. 44.</font>

553
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,400
<font color="#8080ff">Two fat ladies, 88.</font>

554
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,739
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Mary.</font>

555
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:35,343
<font color="#8080ff">Now Mary, can you tell us what you remember
about that morning in the Revenue Office?</font>

556
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,083
<font color="#8080ff">She's a bit deaf.</font>

557
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,350
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, right. Sorry, right.</font>

558
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:45,195
<font color="#8080ff">(LOUDLY) Mary! Can you tell me...</font>

559
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,096
<font color="#8080ff">Excuse me. She said "deaf" not "retarded“.</font>

560
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,527
<font color="#8080ff">Gran, can you tell the man</font>

561
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,003
<font color="#8080ff">about the Revenue Office</font>

562
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,735
<font color="#8080ff">with Mrs Brown's granny.</font>

563
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,606
<font color="#8080ff">Um, yeah. Hmm—mmm.</font>

564
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,107
<font color="#8080ff">That's fantastic.</font>

565
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,672
<font color="#8080ff">Now can you get Mary to the law library
on Friday morning?</font>

566
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:11,245
<font color="#8080ff">We'll get a sworn affidavit
and submit it to the court. This is fantastic.</font>

567
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,188
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, the... Um...
What?</font>

568
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,385
<font color="#8080ff">No, no, no... We'll need a barrister.</font>

569
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,861
<font color="#8080ff">And I knowjust the man.</font>

570
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,471
<font color="#8080ff">I was born and raised in a cottage
on the banks of the Royal Canal.</font>

571
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,072
<font color="#8080ff">Bluebell Cottage, it was called.</font>

572
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:35,078
<font color="#8080ff">My father and mother lived there
all their married life.</font>

573
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:40,147
<font color="#8080ff">When my father died in 1999, my mother,
of course, was brokenhearted.</font>

574
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,979
<font color="#8080ff">But that cottage had so much
of my father in it, in every corner.</font>

575
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,151
<font color="#8080ff">It kept her strong.</font>

576
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,620
<font color="#8080ff">That's nice.</font>

577
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,923
<font color="#8080ff">Can we get on to my case, please?</font>

578
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,556
<font color="#8080ff">Agnes. Give the lad a chance.</font>

579
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,060
<font color="#8080ff">Go on, son.</font>

580
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,263
<font color="#8080ff">Well, in 1999 the PR lrvvin Company</font>

581
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,430
<font color="#8080ff">bought most of the canal bank cottages.</font>

582
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,972
<font color="#8080ff">They wanted to build apartments,
but my mother wouldn't sell.</font>

583
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:14,250
<font color="#8080ff">Then one day she went out to buy some
brake pads for her Honda Gold Wing...</font>

584
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:20,150
<font color="#8080ff">And when she returned,
the cottage had been levelled.</font>

585
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,952
<font color="#8080ff">Everything that made up her 73 years of life,</font>

586
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,165
<font color="#8080ff">all in one big pile of rubble.</font>

587
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,261
<font color="#8080ff">Can they do that?</font>

588
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,301
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, it was a mistake, they claimed.</font>

589
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,705
<font color="#8080ff">The contractor had bulldozed
the wrong house, they said.</font>

590
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:43,004
<font color="#8080ff">The contractor was fined, my mother got
quite a large sum in compensation,</font>

591
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,548
<font color="#8080ff">but within months she was dead.</font>

592
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,682
<font color="#8080ff">Died of a broken heart?</font>

593
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,777
<font color="#8080ff">No, it was a paragliding accident.</font>

594
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:56,619
<font color="#8080ff">lrvvin is the local representative.
I mean, it may not be him.</font>

595
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,855
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, lnnin is behind this all right.</font>

596
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,062
<font color="#8080ff">I checked the records out of curiosity.
He's up to his old tricks again.</font>

597
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:08,502
<font color="#8080ff">The land around your market is owned by
Harbour Master Investments.</font>

598
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,040
<font color="#8080ff">And Harbour Master Investments
is owned by...</font>

599
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,804
<font color="#8080ff">PR Innin.</font>

600
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,575
<font color="#8080ff">No, another company. Tiny Tool Limited.</font>

601
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,181
<font color="#8080ff">Whose shares are in the name of...</font>

602
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,981
<font color="#8080ff">PR Innin.</font>

603
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,352
<font color="#8080ff">No.
Feck's sake.</font>

604
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:29,416
<font color="#8080ff">Three shareholders
who all are connected to...</font>

605
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,655
<font color="#8080ff">PR Innin.
Feck it!</font>

606
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,692
<font color="#8080ff">So if we beat the Revenue, we beat Innin.</font>

607
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,536
<font color="#8080ff">Are you on board, Mr Maydo Archer?</font>

608
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,404
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, has Mr Crews here
informed you about my condition?</font>

609
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,771
<font color="#8080ff">Condition? What condition?</font>

610
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,914
<font color="#8080ff">When under pressure,
I am prone to bouts of Tourette's.</font>

611
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,247
<font color="#8080ff">For fuck's sake. What the fuck is that?</font>

612
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,447
<font color="#8080ff">Nothing that might bother you. I'm in.</font>

613
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,897
<font color="#8080ff">I've got myself a lovely barrister.</font>

614
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,764
<font color="#8080ff">A very handsome—Iooking man.</font>

615
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,631
<font color="#8080ff">Well, you know, you're never too old.
Ha!</font>

616
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:23,070
<font color="#8080ff">Now Mary, when we get in here,
all you have to do is sign an afﬁdavit,</font>

617
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,411
<font color="#8080ff">just to say that my granny paid her tax.</font>

618
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,047
<font color="#8080ff">That way my stall will be safe.</font>

619
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,947
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, for fuck's sake.</font>

620
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:44,401
<font color="#8080ff">You'd think in 102 years she'd have
learned to cross the fucking road.</font>

621
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,427
<font color="#8080ff">And so we lay to rest our dearly departed,</font>

622
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:51,168
<font color="#8080ff">Mary Moccasin, mother of seven...</font>

623
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,505
<font color="#8080ff">Mother of sorrows, look at her.</font>

624
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,781
<font color="#8080ff">Philomena, God love you,
you must be devastated.</font>

625
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,111
<font color="#8080ff">Not really.</font>

626
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,120
<font color="#8080ff">What a pity. Now we have to ﬁnd that receipt.</font>

627
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,815
<font color="#8080ff">Receipt?</font>

628
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,017
<font color="#8080ff">Well, if your grandmother paid it,
they'll have a receipt in the Revenue Ofﬁce.</font>

629
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,687
<font color="#8080ff">She sold second hand
shoes and illegal fireworks from her stall.</font>

630
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:15,960
<font color="#8080ff">Let us all take a silent moment
now to recall...</font>

631
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,968
<font color="#8080ff">Father, move it. Faster, faster!</font>

632
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,095
<font color="#8080ff">Lord hear us.
Lord graciously hear us.</font>

633
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,969
<font color="#8080ff">As it is now and shall it always be,
world without end.</font>

634
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,667
<font color="#8080ff">Amen.</font>

635
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,436
<font color="#8080ff">In the name of the Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit. Amen.</font>

636
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,171
<font color="#8080ff">Go, go, 90, 9°» 9°-</font>

637
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,052
<font color="#8080ff">How do you do?
Hello?</font>

638
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,986
<font color="#8080ff">Fuck.</font>

639
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,023
<font color="#8080ff">Two chips, one small cod.</font>

640
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,995
<font color="#8080ff">Do you want salt and vinegar?
Yeah.</font>

641

642
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,175
<font color="#8080ff">How do you do?</font>

643
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,741
<font color="#8080ff">We're looking to get a receipt
and we were told we could get it here.</font>

<font color="#8080ff">National Records Service.</font>

645
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,747

National Records Service, then?</font>

646
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,825
<font color="#8080ff">No, you're through to the wrong building.
Oh.</font>

647
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,019
<font color="#8080ff">What's this, then?
Hello?</font>

648
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,523
<font color="#8080ff">Hello.</font>

650
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,363

651
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:28,895
<font color="#8080ff">Listen very carefully.
Is this the National Records Service?</font>

652
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,440
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, this is the National Record Service.</font>

653
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,375
<font color="#8080ff">Shall we get a receipt here then?
Hold on, please.</font>

654
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,072
<font color="#8080ff">OK.
OK what?</font>

655
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,841
<font color="#8080ff">We're holding on.
For what?</font>

656
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,542
<font color="#8080ff">You're going to show us
where to get the receipt.</font>

657

<font color="#8080ff">National Records Service.</font>

658
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:45,621

<font color="#8080ff">Get your feckin' hands off me!
On yourway, ladies.</font>

660
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,188
<font color="#8080ff">I have four sons.</font>

661
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,123
<font color="#8080ff">Now what?</font>

662
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,858
<font color="#8080ff">I don't know. We have to get in there.</font>

663
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,596
<font color="#8080ff">Maybe if you disguise yourself.</font>

664
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,797
<font color="#8080ff">Disguise?
Yeah.</font>

665
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,306
<font color="#8080ff">You could disguise yourself as a man.</font>

666
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:08,574
<font color="#8080ff">No, Winnie, I'd never get away with it.</font>

667
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,409
<font color="#8080ff">I know who'll get in there for us.</font>

668
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
<font color="#8080ff">It's all up to you now, son.</font>

669
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,766
<font color="#8080ff">So, what's the plan, Dermot?</font>

670
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,998
<font color="#8080ff">See that restricted area over there?</font>

671
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,102
<font color="#8080ff">Over there?</font>

672
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,836
<font color="#8080ff">Don't point!</font>

673
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,672
<font color="#8080ff">Sorry, Dermot.</font>

674
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,010
<font color="#8080ff">You walk over with me,
and when we get there,</font>

675
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,243
<font color="#8080ff">you do something to
distract the security guard.</font>

676
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,787
<font color="#8080ff">I'll slip past him.
You have it, Dermot.</font>

677
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,515
<font color="#8080ff">Can I help you?</font>

678
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,991
<font color="#8080ff">Yeah... No. I'm grand.</font>

679
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,462
<font color="#8080ff">You said a distraction.</font>

680
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,233
<font color="#8080ff">I know what I said.</font>

681
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,839
<font color="#8080ff">Dermot, I'll get that receipt foryour mammy.</font>

682
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,570
<font color="#8080ff">I have a plan. Do you want to hear it?</font>

683
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,344
<font color="#8080ff">Does it involve blind ninjas?</font>

684
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,752
<font color="#8080ff">Maybe.
Nope.</font>

685
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,169
<font color="#8080ff">OK, come on. Hully, hully.</font>

686
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,368
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, you squeezed my scrotum. Don't do that.</font>

687
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:22,037
<font color="#8080ff">OK, follow me. Come on. Come on.</font>

688
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,205
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, hurry.</font>

689
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:29,275
<font color="#8080ff">OK, men, the camera and the
spotlight scans the area every 20 seconds.</font>

690
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,786
<font color="#8080ff">Once it passes, we have to get to that door.</font>

691
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:36,758
<font color="#8080ff">We scale the railings ﬁrst, and then
everybody wait for my "Go" before moving.</font>

692
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,794
<font color="#8080ff">Excellent plan.</font>

693
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,091
<font color="#8080ff">OK? So the word is "Go“.</font>

694
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,963
<font color="#8080ff">What the fuck?
You said "Go"!</font>

695
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,095
<font color="#8080ff">I think he's dead. I can't feel a pulse.</font>

696
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,070
<font color="#8080ff">That's because you're holding his torch.</font>

697
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,806
<font color="#8080ff">Pick him up and put him in the van.
Right you are.</font>

698
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:57,403
<font color="#8080ff">Right, we still have four.
We can still make this ago.</font>

699
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,551
<font color="#8080ff">What the fuck?
Stop saying it.</font>

700
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,486
<font color="#8080ff">Saying what? "Go“?</font>

701
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,822
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, for fuck's sake.</font>

702
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:17,264
<font color="#8080ff">And you can callus on 0890107-252.</font>

703
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,997
<font color="#8080ff">Now In the studio with me today,

to bring up six children all alone.</font>

714
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,133

seen their children taken into care.</font>

717
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:14,786
<font color="#8080ff">What do you mean? What?</font>

718
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,122
<font color="#8080ff">I mean, I know they were different times,</font>

719
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,528
<font color="#8080ff">but if a parent passed away, their children
would have been taken into care.</font>

720
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,294
<font color="#8080ff">And yours were all babies, weren't they?</font>

721
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,213
<font color="#8080ff">Cheer up, Agnes, that receipt will turn up.</font>

<font color="#8080ff">Well, you see, when Redser died...</font>

725
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:54,325
<font color="#8080ff">Well, I was living in London with Jacko then,
but I remember the telegram.</font>

726
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,530
<font color="#8080ff">I put the kids into care.</font>

727
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,263
<font color="#8080ff">What?</font>

728
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,565
<font color="#8080ff">They never mentioned it,
so I presumed they'd forgotten.</font>

729
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:10,045
<font color="#8080ff">But with all this talk about me being
the best mother in the world, and...</font>

<font color="#8080ff">I couldn't cope.</font>

731
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,880
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus, if they find out.</font>

732
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,617
<font color="#8080ff">Stop it now.</font>

733
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:25,391
<font color="#8080ff">Shush. There's no need for anyone to know.</font>

734
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,028
<font color="#8080ff">Good morning, Mrs Brown.</font>

735
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,729
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, Father Damien. How are you?</font>

736
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,069
<font color="#8080ff">Grand, thanks. Sad about Mary, isn't it?</font>

737
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,599
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, very, very sad, Father.
Here, two euro, please.</font>

738
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,609
<font color="#8080ff">Father, are you doing confessions today?</font>

739
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:47,743
<font color="#8080ff">I'm heading there right now.
I'II follow you over in about ﬁve minutes.</font>

740
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,479
<font color="#8080ff">Grand.</font>

741
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,262
<font color="#8080ff">Annie, I have to go on an errand.
Keep an eye on the stall for me, will you?</font>

742
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,159
<font color="#8080ff">Do you need me to?</font>

743
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,302
<font color="#8080ff">Cathy, what are you doing?</font>

744
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,004
<font color="#8080ff">I came down to see you.
Can you hang on a few minutes?</font>

745
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,941
<font color="#8080ff">Sure.</font>

746
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,676
<font color="#8080ff">Thanks, love.</font>

747
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,001
<font color="#8080ff">Are you there, Father?
I am.</font>

748
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,477
<font color="#8080ff">Bless me, Father, for! have sinned.</font>

749
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,645
<font color="#8080ff">Go ahead.</font>

750
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:01,623
<font color="#8080ff">Father, everybody's talking about me
in the newspaper, the radio,</font>

751
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,660
<font color="#8080ff">as being the perfect mother.</font>

752
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,223
<font color="#8080ff">But I'm not.</font>

753
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,726
<font color="#8080ff">I've done a terrible thing.</font>

754
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,494
<font color="#8080ff">Just a second, Mrs Brown.</font>

755
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,060
<font color="#8080ff">What you've done, is it a sin?</font>

756
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,701
<font color="#8080ff">What?</font>

757
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:20,242
<font color="#8080ff">You don't have to tell me
anything unless it's a sin.</font>

758
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,508
<font color="#8080ff">Really think, now.</font>

759
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,508
<font color="#8080ff">Well, I don't know if it's a sin, but</font>

760
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,076
<font color="#8080ff">I put my children into care</font>

761
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:34,089
<font color="#8080ff">when they were babies,
when my husband died.</font>

762
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,419
<font color="#8080ff">I see.</font>

763
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:39,518
<font color="#8080ff">Well, that's no harm and no sin,</font>

764
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,223
<font color="#8080ff">so don't tell me any more.</font>

765
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,731
<font color="#8080ff">There is one sinful bit about it.</font>

766
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:48,230
<font color="#8080ff">I carried on collecting the children's
allowance while they were in care.</font>

767
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,451
<font color="#8080ff">Thank you very much, Father.
I feel much better.</font>

768
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,860
<font color="#8080ff">This is day one of the
court case that the country is dubbing</font>

<font color="#8080ff">Molly Malone versus Big Business,</font>

anybody small who doesn't box.</font>

772
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,267
<font color="#8080ff">This could be the shortest
court battle on record,</font>

773
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,741
<font color="#8080ff">as it seems that once the trader in question,</font>

<font color="#8080ff">mother of six, Mrs Agnes Brown,</font>

778
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,057
<font color="#8080ff">You may be seated.</font>

779
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:49,826
<font color="#8080ff">Do we have all the parties here?</font>

780
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:54,501
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, I am the
solicitor for the defendant, Tom Crews.</font>

781
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,236
<font color="#8080ff">And, Justice, I am Seniorcounsel.</font>

<font color="#8080ff">Let me guess. Tom Hanks?</font>

783
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:04,441
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Maydo Archer.
Mr Maydo Archer.</font>

784
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,347
<font color="#8080ff">I have not seen you in a
courtroom for a very long time.</font>

785
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:11,319
<font color="#8080ff">Indeed, Justice.
Do we still have that Tourette's thing?</font>

786
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,822
<font color="#8080ff">Not nearly as much, Justice.
And I do not anticipate it affecting this case.</font>

787
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:18,691
<font color="#8080ff">Ah, well, welcome back.
Who have we here for the State?</font>

788
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,628
<font color="#8080ff">Michael Gibney, solicitor, Justice. I...</font>

789
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,600
<font color="#8080ff">Await Senior Counsel.</font>

790
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,698
<font color="#8080ff">Here, Justice.</font>

<font color="#8080ff">Wank, wank.</font>

792
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
<font color="#8080ff">What did
you say, Mr Maydo Archer?</font>

793
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:36,373
<font color="#8080ff">He said "wank, wank".
Nothing, Justice. Just clearing my throat.</font>

794
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,881
<font color="#8080ff">A wank won't clear your throat, son.
Agnes, shut up, please.</font>

795
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,681
<font color="#8080ff">Good morning, Mrs Brown.
Morning.</font>

796
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:47,052
<font color="#8080ff">I won't keep you very long.</font>

797
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:51,992
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, can you show the
court the receipt in question?</font>

798
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,326
<font color="#8080ff">No.</font>

799
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:00,165
<font color="#8080ff">The receipt is in the National Records.</font>

800
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:04,003
<font color="#8080ff">But I was told by Philomena Nine WaIts's
granny, Mary Moccasin,</font>

801
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,872
<font color="#8080ff">that she stood beside my
grandmother when she paid it.</font>

802
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:11,908
<font color="#8080ff">Well then, let's have Mrs Moccasin
up here to tell us that.</font>

803
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:14,177
<font color="#8080ff">She's dead.</font>

804
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,414
<font color="#8080ff">How unfortunate.</font>

805
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:23,189
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, with no receipt in
existence and no witness,</font>

806
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,490
<font color="#8080ff">well, I believe we're in
a position forjudgement.</font>

807
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,223
<font color="#8080ff">Justice...</font>

808
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,891
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown is a well-regarded member
of the community of traders in Moore Street.</font>

809
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:36,536
<font color="#8080ff">Her integrity as a stallholder
and as a mother is beyond reproach.</font>

810
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,509
<font color="#8080ff">Beyond reproach"?</font>

811
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:46,446
<font color="#8080ff">Let's examine that, then, shall we?</font>

812
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,883
<font color="#8080ff">You don't mind a little examination,
Mrs Brown, do you?</font>

813
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,618
<font color="#8080ff">Not as long as I can leave my clothes on.</font>

814
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:02,629
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, this isn't the ﬁrst time you have
defrauded the State of money, is it?</font>

815
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,799
<font color="#8080ff">Silence in court, please!</font>

816
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,899
<font color="#8080ff">I beg your pardon.</font>

817
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,309
<font color="#8080ff">I am referring to the weeks
after your husband's death,</font>

818
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,442
<font color="#8080ff">and the children's allowance you collected.</font>

819
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,412
<font color="#8080ff">Justice...</font>

820
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:21,474
<font color="#8080ff">This woman had just become a widow.</font>

821
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:24,713
<font color="#8080ff">She had six children at home to feed.</font>

822
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,154
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown was only collecting
what was rightfully hers.</font>

823
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,755
<font color="#8080ff">Silence, please! Silence!</font>

824
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,654
<font color="#8080ff">Did you, Mrs Brown...</font>

825
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:42,098
<font color="#8080ff">Did you have six children at home to feed?</font>

826
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,619
<font color="#8080ff">Please answer the question, Mrs Brown.</font>

827
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:02,350
<font color="#8080ff">Did you have six children at home to feed?</font>

828
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,457
<font color="#8080ff">No.</font>

829
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,595
<font color="#8080ff">That's correct.</font>

830
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:16,996
<font color="#8080ff">Because, in fact, you had put
your children into care!</font>

831
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:20,270
<font color="#8080ff">Will you be quiet, please!</font>

832
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,473
<font color="#8080ff">Isn't that correct?</font>

833
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,009
<font color="#8080ff">Yes, Idid.</font>

834
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,554
<font color="#8080ff">I'm so sorry.</font>

835
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,955
<font color="#8080ff">Order! Order! Order!</font>

836
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:42,154
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, I presume you are ready
to passjudgement on this.</font>

837
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,894
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Maydo Archer?</font>

838
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,835
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, at the preliminary, fuck, hearing,</font>

839
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,396
<font color="#8080ff">you asked Us to produce, shit...</font>

840
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,567
<font color="#8080ff">Produce the receipt in two weeks, wanks.</font>

841
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,572
<font color="#8080ff">Those two weeks end tomorrow.</font>

842
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:01,515
<font color="#8080ff">Gobble, gobble, nice, nice, give it a rub.</font>

843
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,182
<font color="#8080ff">Reconvene tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m.</font>

844
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,907
<font color="#8080ff">What do you think of that?</font>

845
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,941
<font color="#8080ff">Think of what?
Forget it.</font>

846
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:36,711
<font color="#8080ff">Right, lads, who wants to join me
in a real ninja mission?</font>

847
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,515
<font color="#8080ff">Yes!</font>

848
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,216
<font color="#8080ff">Yeah!</font>

849
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,952
<font color="#8080ff">Over here, lads.</font>

850
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,941
<font color="#8080ff">It's too short.</font>

851
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:02,739
<font color="#8080ff">Pull me up.</font>

852
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,314
<font color="#8080ff">Guys, you've got to see this.</font>

853
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,782
<font color="#8080ff">You gonna call the cops?</font>

854
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,586
<font color="#8080ff">No, the Russians said to wait
till they were leaving.</font>

855
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,494
<font color="#8080ff">Nice one, lads.
Oh yeah, brilliant.</font>

856
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,093
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, sorry.</font>

857
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,896
<font color="#8080ff">Excuse me.</font>

858
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,899
<font color="#8080ff">I hope you're recording this, mate.</font>

859
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,463
<font color="#8080ff">This would get a million hits before midnight.</font>

860
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,235
<font color="#8080ff">That's it.</font>

861
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,772
<font color="#8080ff">Right, lads, I'm down.</font>

862
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:40,244
<font color="#8080ff">How do we get down?
It's not that high. Just drop.</font>

863
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,362
<font color="#8080ff">You were all just babies,
and it was only for a couple of weeks.</font>

864
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:06,970
<font color="#8080ff">I kinda remember.</font>

865
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:09,702
<font color="#8080ff">I just thought we were on a holiday.</font>

866
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,841
<font color="#8080ff">Has Mammy come home, then?</font>

867
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,714
<font color="#8080ff">Then we need to get out there and find her.</font>

868
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,092
<font color="#8080ff">Mark, I have her. Tell the others.</font>

869
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,727
<font color="#8080ff">See you at home.</font>

870
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,931
<font color="#8080ff">Everybody's looking for you.</font>

871
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,033
<font color="#8080ff">Are they?</font>

872
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,010
<font color="#8080ff">You'd wonder why.</font>

873
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,047
<font color="#8080ff">Because they're worried.</font>

874
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,541
<font color="#8080ff">We want you home safe.</font>

875
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:23,779
<font color="#8080ff">I wanted all youse home safe.</font>

876
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,052
<font color="#8080ff">I just couldn't cope.</font>

877
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,720
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy, it was what it was.</font>

878
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,055
<font color="#8080ff">Nobody blames you.</font>

879
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,796
<font color="#8080ff">I do.</font>

880
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,917
<font color="#8080ff">You know, they asked me...</font>

881
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:10,893
<font color="#8080ff">The nuns.</font>

882
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:16,438
<font color="#8080ff">They asked me if I could manage
with any of youse.</font>

883
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,502
<font color="#8080ff">I said, "Maybe two."</font>

884
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,772
<font color="#8080ff">So they lined youse all up.</font>

885
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,315
<font color="#8080ff">And she said, "Pick two."</font>

886
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,352
<font color="#8080ff">I couldn't.</font>

887
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,761
<font color="#8080ff">Sophie's choice.</font>

888
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,937
<font color="#8080ff">Come on...</font>

889
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,803
<font color="#8080ff">Let's get you home.</font>

890
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,875
<font color="#8080ff">Who the fuck is Sophie?</font>

891
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:03,013
<font color="#8080ff">OK, lads, now we're in,
how do we ﬁnd the receipt?</font>

892
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,847
<font color="#8080ff">It will be in a box.</font>

893
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,492
<font color="#8080ff">This is like walking in a maze.</font>

894
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:19,034
<font color="#8080ff">If Mary Moccasin's receipt is 4-5-8,</font>

895
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,830
<font color="#8080ff">then it has to be 4-5-9.</font>

896
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,735
<font color="#8080ff">Hmm.</font>

897
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,068
<font color="#8080ff">4-5-5.</font>

898
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:29,304

01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:59,808
<font color="#8080ff">Cops!</font>

1028
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,616
<font color="#8080ff">Left, left, for feck's sake!</font>

1029
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:06,279
<font color="#8080ff">Keep her going. Keep her going.
Go on, son, go on. We're in the clear.</font>

1030
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:11,091
<font color="#8080ff">Wait, Russians. Stop.
Turn around, turn around.</font>

1031
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,656
<font color="#8080ff">Take it back.</font>

1032
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,225
<font color="#8080ff">Go, go!</font>

1033
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,563
<font color="#8080ff">Hold it! More cops.</font>

1034
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:30,337
<font color="#8080ff">Now what do we do?
I dunno.</font>

1035
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,678
<font color="#8080ff">Where's that music coming from?</font>

1036
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:41,984
<font color="#8080ff">Granddad!</font>

1037
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:43,987
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, Granddad.</font>

1038
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,324
<font color="#8080ff">Oh...</font>

1039
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,535
<font color="#8080ff">Jump!</font>

1040
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:03,311
<font color="#8080ff">On three. Three!</font>

1041
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:06,538
<font color="#8080ff">Ah! Mammy, mammy, mammy...</font>

1042
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,154
<font color="#8080ff">lam a swan.</font>

1043
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,883
<font color="#8080ff">Timber!</font>

1044
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,959
<font color="#8080ff">Shit! Every man for himself!</font>

1045
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,033
<font color="#8080ff">Leading us to where we are today.</font>

1046
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,204
<font color="#8080ff">Thank you for that, Mr Maydo Archer.</font>

1047
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:43,251
<font color="#8080ff">Do we have anything judicial to present?</font>

1048
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,877
<font color="#8080ff">I... Indeed I do, Justice.</font>

1049
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,691
<font color="#8080ff">Perhaps I should call a witness?</font>

1050
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,489
<font color="#8080ff">Perhaps you should.</font>

1051
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,591
<font color="#8080ff">Come on, Mammy.</font>

1052
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:58,758
<font color="#8080ff">Dermot, Ithink I have crabs.</font>

1053
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,364
<font color="#8080ff">Move it, son. Move it.
Oh, God.</font>

1054
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,105
<font color="#8080ff">Shit! Russians!</font>

1055
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,543
<font color="#8080ff">Russians, Russians.
Where?</font>

1056
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,275
<font color="#8080ff">Come on.</font>

1057
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,879
<font color="#8080ff">Now what?</font>

1058
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,186
<font color="#8080ff">Get in here, boys!
No. Wait.</font>

1059
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,187
<font color="#8080ff">Buster, give me the receipt.
We need to split up.</font>

1060
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,923
<font color="#8080ff">You get them to chase you out of town.</font>

1061
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,294
<font color="#8080ff">I'll get the receipt to the courts. Go!</font>

1062
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,795
<font color="#8080ff">Go, go, go.</font>

1063
01:19:45,648 --> 01:19:48,139
<font color="#8080ff">I'm dry!</font>

1064
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:50,979
<font color="#8080ff">I love the movies.</font>

1065
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:40,193
<font color="#8080ff">I would like to call, uh, Mr Rory Brown.</font>

1066
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,167
<font color="#8080ff">I didn't do anything, Justice, I swear.</font>

1067
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,674
<font color="#8080ff">I think I'm going to be sick.</font>

1068
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,772
<font color="#8080ff">Hold tight.</font>

1069
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,352
<font color="#8080ff">Betty, you can just drop us at the bus stop.</font>

1070
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:02,119
<font color="#8080ff">Seriously, Betty.
We don't mind taking a bus, do we, Buster?</font>

1071
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:04,387
<font color="#8080ff">Buster. Buster!</font>

1072
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:10,123
<font color="#8080ff">Where is he?
Cops.</font>

1073
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:12,894
<font color="#8080ff">Russians.</font>

1074
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:24,072
<font color="#8080ff">Get back in the fucking car.</font>

1075
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,248
<font color="#8080ff">Receipt?</font>

1076
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,016
<font color="#8080ff">Big Issue.
Receipt?</font>

1077
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,751
<font color="#8080ff">Cash only.</font>

1078
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,838
<font color="#8080ff">Shit!</font>

1079
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,549
<font color="#8080ff">And I said, "Oh, there's an
awful smell off that."</font>

1080
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,380
<font color="#8080ff">And he said, "If you think that's bad..."</font>

1081
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:09,857
<font color="#8080ff">Look what I have here in my hand!
Yeah. Or something like that.</font>

1082
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,053
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, I believe that the evidence
we've been waiting for has arrived.</font>

1083
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,231
<font color="#8080ff">20 euro each way Mia's Twin,</font>

1084
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,967
<font color="#8080ff">At 5 to 1.</font>

1085
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,070
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, this is a betting slip.</font>

1086
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,473
<font color="#8080ff">No. It can't be.</font>

1087
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:38,309
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, Nelly, spank my monkey,
lick my love pump, fuck, fuck!</font>

1088
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,648
<font color="#8080ff">Call Mark.</font>

1089
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,788
<font color="#8080ff">Well done, Betty.
Now how do we keep this chase going?</font>

1090
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,229
<font color="#8080ff">Piece of crap.</font>

1091
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,403
<font color="#8080ff">Buster gave my ma a betting slip.</font>

1092
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:02,668
<font color="#8080ff">Shit! Now we have to find Buster
and get the receipt to the court.</font>

1093
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:06,471
<font color="#8080ff">Not by car. The cops have every road blocked.</font>

1094
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:08,910
<font color="#8080ff">Now what will we do?</font>

1095
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,953
<font color="#8080ff">Dermo'!</font>

1096
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,454
<font color="#8080ff">Hi-ho, Silver! Away!</font>

1097
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,286
<font color="#8080ff">It's a horse!</font>

1098
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:23,131
<font color="#8080ff">Mrs Brown, will you please tell the court
what you believe is going on here?</font>

1099
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,167
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, this is irrelevant.</font>

1100
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:30,295
<font color="#8080ff">There is no receipt, so the woman
should simply sell the stall</font>

1101
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:33,364
<font color="#8080ff">For the 30,000 and let that be the end of it.</font>

1102
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,371
<font color="#8080ff">How do you know how much I was offered?</font>

1103
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,871
<font color="#8080ff">Mr Inrrin, do we have
a conﬂict of interest here?</font>

1104
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,315
<font color="#8080ff">Certainly not.</font>

1105
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:46,047
<font color="#8080ff">I was told by one of my researchers.</font>

1106
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,815
<font color="#8080ff">Whatever.</font>

1107
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,552
<font color="#8080ff">Anyway, that is not the point here.</font>

1108
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,660
<font color="#8080ff">Then we will hear what Mrs Brown has to say.</font>

1109
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:02,962
<font color="#8080ff">Buster, would this be the horse
you didn't steal?</font>

1110
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,733
<font color="#8080ff">Maybe.</font>

1111
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,306
<font color="#8080ff">It's a tough life</font>

1112
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:13,647
<font color="#8080ff">standing at that stall, day in, day out.</font>

1113
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,718
<font color="#8080ff">Oh, it's beautiful on a sunny day.</font>

1114
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,322
<font color="#8080ff">The market is buzzing and</font>

1115
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,824
<font color="#8080ff">you stand there with a smile on your face,</font>

1116
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,827
<font color="#8080ff">and the sun beating down on your back.</font>

1117
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,090
<font color="#8080ff">But you try that in January,</font>

1118
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:32,025
<font color="#8080ff">when the wind is whipping around your f...</font>

1119
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,761
<font color="#8080ff">Legs.</font>

1120
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:37,201
<font color="#8080ff">And your hands are so cold</font>

1121
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,365
<font color="#8080ff">you can't even make change.</font>

1122
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,438
<font color="#8080ff">And why do I do it?</font>

1123
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:46,878
<font color="#8080ff">Because my mother did it.</font>

1124
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:49,577
<font color="#8080ff">And her mother before her, and so on.</font>

1125
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,684
<font color="#8080ff">It's notjust about the stall.</font>

1126
01:24:57,626 --> 01:25:00,459
<font color="#8080ff">It's about being part of something bigger.</font>

1127
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,792
<font color="#8080ff">It, it's about...</font>

1128
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,431
<font color="#8080ff">Dublin.</font>

1129
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,610
<font color="#8080ff">It's about being a part of Dublin.</font>

1130
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:23,084
<font color="#8080ff">You won't find the real Dublin
in the financial centre,</font>

1131
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,984
<font color="#8080ff">or the banks, ortrendy nightclubs.</font>

1132
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,215
<font color="#8080ff">Or even here in this court.</font>

1133
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:32,085
<font color="#8080ff">The heart,</font>

1134
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,424
<font color="#8080ff">the pulse of real Dublin</font>

1135
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:36,761
<font color="#8080ff">is in Moore Street.</font>

1136
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:41,659
<font color="#8080ff">Look in the gallery here.</font>

1137
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:45,430
<font color="#8080ff">Immigrants from India, Nigeria, Pakistan,</font>

1138
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,270
<font color="#8080ff">Iraq, Jamaica...</font>

1139
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,333
<font color="#8080ff">I'm not fucking Jamaican!</font>

1140
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:54,338
<font color="#8080ff">They've all blended
seamlessly into Dublin culture.</font>

1141
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,679
<font color="#8080ff">The new Dublin, they call it.</font>

1142
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,485
<font color="#8080ff">But there isn't any new Dublin.</font>

1143
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:05,790
<font color="#8080ff">Moore Street has always welcomed the needy,</font>

1144
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:09,922
<font color="#8080ff">The lonely, the lost of this city's people,</font>

1145
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,364
<font color="#8080ff">And did so with an open heart.</font>

1146
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:16,001
<font color="#8080ff">It doesn't matter who you are,</font>

1147
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,698
<font color="#8080ff">you will be welcomed in Moore Street.</font>

1148
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:22,541
<font color="#8080ff">It's something my mother is very proud of</font>

1149
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,969
<font color="#8080ff">and something Iwill be proud of</font>

1150
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:28,713
<font color="#8080ff">when it's my turn.</font>

1151
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:32,353
<font color="#8080ff">When I take over the family stall
from my mother.</font>

1152
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:40,388
<font color="#8080ff">There are those who would clear it out,</font>

1153
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:45,523
<font color="#8080ff">put Moore Street away and morph this city
into a faceless copy of any other city.</font>

1154
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:49,399
<font color="#8080ff">But they can't,</font>

1155
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,996
<font color="#8080ff">and they won't.</font>

1156
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:54,237
<font color="#8080ff">Because we won't let them.</font>

1157
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:02,013
<font color="#8080ff">We are Moore Street
and we are going nowhere.</font>

1158
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,931
<font color="#8080ff">So, then, no more evidence,
Mr Maydo Archer?</font>

1159
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,331
<font color="#8080ff">Um...</font>

1160
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,272
<font color="#8080ff">No, Justice.</font>

1161
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:40,844
<font color="#8080ff">We're screwed.
No, we're not. Hold on, Dermo‘.</font>

1162
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:48,890
<font color="#8080ff">Yeah!</font>

1163
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:51,393
<font color="#8080ff">No!</font>

1164
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,065
<font color="#8080ff">I knew! could do it.</font>

1165
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,074
<font color="#8080ff">You bastard. Don't ever try
anything like that again.</font>

1166
01:28:00,142 --> 01:28:03,043
<font color="#8080ff">Please, not the stairs.
Hold on, Dermo. Come on, giddy up!</font>

1167
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:08,076
<font color="#8080ff">We have it!</font>

1168
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,888
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Buster.</font>

1169
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,158
<font color="#8080ff">Justice Dickie.</font>

1170
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:23,390
<font color="#8080ff">Back down the stairs on the right.</font>

1171
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:25,794
<font color="#8080ff">Thank you.</font>

1172
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:32,733
<font color="#8080ff">Despite the assertion of Mrs Brown
that this debt has been settled,</font>

1173
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,641
<font color="#8080ff">There is no evidence to prove this.</font>

1174
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:41,411
<font color="#8080ff">So then, in the matter of The Revenue
Department v. Mrs Agnes Brown...</font>

1175
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:51,415
<font color="#8080ff">What is this?
It's the cavalry.</font>

1176
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,129
<font color="#8080ff">Or clowns.</font>

1177
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,361
<font color="#8080ff">Justice, here's the receipt.</font>

1178
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,961
<font color="#8080ff">It's in Braille.</font>

1179
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:06,599
<font color="#8080ff">Is there anyone in courtwho reads Braille?</font>

1180
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:10,467
<font color="#8080ff">Don't fucking look at me.</font>

1181
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,340
<font color="#8080ff">I read Braille.</font>

1182
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:28,894
<font color="#8080ff">The court finds in favour of Mrs Brown.</font>

1183
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:10,861
<font color="#8080ff">You see, it all works out
the way it's supposed to.</font>

1184
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,117
<font color="#8080ff">Lovely kumquats, Brussels sprouts
and prickly pears!</font>

1185
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,559
<font color="#8080ff">How are you, love?
You wanna feel my prickly pears?</font>

1186
01:31:10,332 --> 01:31:12,664
<font color="#8080ff">Come back quick, I'll give you a gobble.</font>

1187
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,471
<font color="#8080ff">We won't use that last bit.
We won't use that last bit.</font>

1188
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:21,006
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus, look, now you've killed her!</font>

1189
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:22,770
<font color="#8080ff">How much?</font>

1190
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:29,510
<font color="#8080ff">Release me.</font>

1191
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,956
<font color="#8080ff">It was my great, great grandmother
that started the stall.</font>

1192
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:39,858
<font color="#8080ff">And it's been handed down ever since to
the eldest girl in the family.</font>

1193
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,026
<font color="#8080ff">Since 1802.</font>

1194
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:52,432
<font color="#8080ff">Somebody has a line, and it's not me.</font>

1195
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:01,440
<font color="#8080ff">And action.</font>

1196
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,211
<font color="#8080ff">How much?</font>

1197
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:06,619
<font color="#8080ff">Four... Fucking shitbags.</font>

1198
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:09,516
<font color="#8080ff">It's a lot to remember, take your time.</font>

1199
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:18,826
<font color="#8080ff">Whoa.</font>

1200
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:21,329
<font color="#8080ff">Hello, Buster.</font>

1201
01:32:22,137 --> 01:32:23,968
<font color="#8080ff">Sorry</font>

1202
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,735
<font color="#8080ff">Goodbye, Buster.</font>

1203
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:30,174
<font color="#8080ff">Well, you've certainly made a splash.</font>

1204
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,406
<font color="#8080ff">I've no time for that shite, Annie.</font>

1205
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:36,243
<font color="#8080ff">Fresh fruit and vegetables!</font>

1206
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,853
<font color="#8080ff">As seen on TV.</font>

1207
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:52,059
<font color="#8080ff">Look, now you've killed her.
How much?</font>

1208
01:33:00,008 --> 01:33:02,602
<font color="#8080ff">Ladies and gentlemen, Ben Kellett.
Yeah!</font>

1209
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:06,546
<font color="#8080ff">Jesus Christ, if they ﬁnd out.</font>

1210
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:09,043
<font color="#8080ff">Stop it now.</font>

1211
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:14,787
<font color="#8080ff">Shush, there's no need for
anyone to find... To know.</font>

1212
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,550
<font color="#8080ff">To ﬁnd to know?
To ﬁnd to know.</font>

1213
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,124
<font color="#8080ff">Mammy, shut up.</font>

1214
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:27,867
<font color="#8080ff">I'm getting an itch around my anus.</font>

1215
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,268
<font color="#8080ff">You should see someone about that.</font>

1216
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,236
<font color="#8080ff">Would it be thrush?</font>

1217
01:33:34,876 --> 01:33:37,436
<font color="#8080ff">Set and action.</font>

1218
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:39,206
<font color="#8080ff">How much?</font>

1219
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:45,079
<font color="#8080ff">Keep rolling, keep rolling.</font>

1220
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:48,247
<font color="#8080ff">Why does she keep repeating herself?
It's the phone thing.</font>

1221
01:33:48,323 --> 01:33:50,587
<font color="#8080ff">National Records Service.</font>

1222
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:53,252
<font color="#8080ff">Excuse me, fucker-face.</font>

1223
01:33:53,328 --> 01:33:56,058
<font color="#8080ff">How do I get to see the actual receipts?</font>

1224
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:04,600
<font color="#8080ff">I landed right on my cock.</font>
