00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,322
NEW YORK SHAKESPEARE
FESTIVAL

2
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,234
- Jack Noah.
- For "Richard ll" or "All's Well"?

3
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,635
- "Richard".
- For...

4
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,045
- The King.
- Jack? Jack?

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,375
- Jack?
- Toby.

6
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,386
Where the hell have you been, man?
I saw Phyllis last week.

7
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,789
She said you disappeared. She thought
you were the victim of foul play.

8
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,659
I was, I was.
You got a lozenge or something?

9
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:43,429
I expected to see you at the Neil Simon.
Perfect part for you.

10
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,365
The neurotic nephew who
never leaves his room.

11
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,766
- Who got the part?
- Mandy Patinkin.

12
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,200
- Fuck him.
- Here's a lozenge. Swiss.

13
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,870
- Great, thanks.
- You know Desmond Feree, don't you?

14
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:51,996
Yeah, yeah. Desmond, Desmond.

15
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,542
I saw you in "Endgame",
last year. You were incredible.

16
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:58,170
- Thank you.
- No, I'm serious. You're incredible.

17
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,336
I saw you in "Evita", and on TV and stuff.

18
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,672
I like your work,
Jack Noah.

19
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,552
- We oughta hire each other.
- Hey, man.

20
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,654
Didn't you go out of the country
to do a movie?

21
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,356
Yeah. Hey, the Shepherd play.
How'd it go?

22
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,380
Shit. Fake art.

23
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,391
- How long were you gone?
- A year.

24
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,962
- A year? What a gig!
- Weird job. Weird job.

25
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:16,796
So what else is new?

26
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:19,098
I was a nubian space slave last week...

27
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,191
with na aluminum foil jockstrap.

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,039
Remember when I played a sperm
and I begged for that part?

29
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,006
It was your best work.

30
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,343
I had the look of the sperm,
tought like a sperm...

31
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,779
And you still look like a sperm
and think like a sperm.

32
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,247
- They wouldn't hire me.
- No black sperm.

33
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,048
- So what was the part?
- Well...

34
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,850
- it's really hard to talk about.
- Porno?

35
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:42,914
No!

36
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,394
It's just you're not gonna
believe it, that's all.

37
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,261
Come on, I'm trained to believe
and understand.

38
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,429
Well, if you ever see
the moon over Parador...

39
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,406
if you ever see it floating over
the Gulf of Sorrows...

40
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,601
or smell the gardenias in the air...

41
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,502
see the sunlight...

42
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,976
on the red tiles of the rooftops...

43
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,584
and you happen to be
with a warm woman...

44
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,418
you'll never forget it.

45
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,088
Never.

46
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,759
- You gotta go now.
- No. I won't leave you.

47
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,731
It's our only hope.

48
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,427
Okay. I'll leave. But I'll wait.

49
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,496
Get outta here.

50
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,435
Cut the playback.
Okay, folks, that's a cut! Wrap!

51
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,876
Don't forget the wrap party at
the Hotel Parador.

52
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,646
- "Blood on the Plaza" is now a wrap.
- Could I do it one more time? A quick one.

53
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:50,249
It was mechanically okay,
but inside it's not very good.

54
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,617
Look, before the light goes.

55
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,983
No more light. The light is gone. Jack, great.
See you in the screening room.

56
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,257
Your stunt was great, Clint.

57
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,852
It was pretty smooth.
Looks like the dictator loved it.

58
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,593
He's very good.

59
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,400
I could've done it a lot better, you know?
You know?

60
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,731
Relax. You're great.

61
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,376
- Could I do it one more time?
- Please, Jack. Forget it.

62
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:19,479
One quick one! There's light!
I can see you!

63
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:20,741
So sweet.

64
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,217
- Very realistic.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

65
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,412
- Excellent directing.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

66
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,020
Wonderful actor.

67
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,889
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, sir.

68
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,756
Wonderful.
You're a wonderful actress.

69
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,022
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you.

70
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,692
- Thank you very much.
- Wonderful.

71
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,629
You know, you should see him do you.

72
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,066
Do me?

73
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,538
- He does the greatest impersonation of you.
- No, no, no, no.

74
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,807
- Come on, Jack. You can do it.
- It's not very good.

75
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:48,141
- He's being modest.
- Come on, Jack. Go for it.

76
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:51,110
- Please, I would really not...
- Let me be the judge. Please.

77
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,048
Can I speak to you for a moment, please?
I'm gonna kill you.

78
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,184
I had to do something.
He's gonna pinch my ass.

79
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:58,918
Or worse!

80
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,886
You've slept with every guy on this crew.
Why not the dictator of the country?

81
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,221
He's a foreigner.

82
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,219
Could I borrow your cap, sir?

83
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,230
Certainly.

84
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,566
Thank you. Thank you.

85
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,482
Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to know, by the way...

86
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,152
I'm doing this with the greatest respect.
I've got a great admiration for you.

87
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,483
I've seen you a lot on TV.

88
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,155
I'm gonna kill you slowly.

89
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,823
I'm gonna break every bone in your body.

90
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,059
People of Parador, I love you.

91
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:55,105
I love you as a man
loves a beautiful woman.

92
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:04,005
You're a wonderful country!
I love your mountains...

93
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:10,383
And your valleys.
I wanna to swim in your rivers.

94
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,691
He's very funny.

95
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,725
He's very funny.

96
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,098
He's a hell of na actor.

97
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,097
- You're good, kid.
- All right, Jack.

98
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:28,866
Thank you.

99
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,138
I'm going to vote blue.

100
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,750
Vote for who you want.
It's a free dictatorship.

101
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,656
Can I get five of these, in large?

102
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,399
Hey, Jackie? Jackie!

103
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,703
Hey, Ralph!

104
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,343
What's the deal? When are you headed back?
What's happening? Where're you off to?

105
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,673
I got a flight out tomorrow.

106
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,479
Listen. Just cool it. Stick around.
You don't wanna miss that carnival.

107
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,821
- It's a fun sucke.
- You've been down here a long time.

108
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,483
When I retired from the military,
I went over to Ocala, Florida...

109
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:24,263
And bought a trailer. And it gotta kinda close.
It got expensive, crowded.

110
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:29,166
So Midge and I, the little woman,
we sold out everything...

111
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,060
and moved down here to Parador.
Bought a little bungalow up in the heights...

112
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,834
Some fruit trees, full-time maid.

113
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,805
It's kind of a secret paradise.

114
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,813
I'd like to stay, but I think it's best that
I get back to NY...

115
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:41,541
and start hustling.

116
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,583
Do yourself a favor.

117
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:46,143
Take time out to smell the roses.

118
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,849
So you're retired, is that it?

119
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,181
Hell, no. Are you kidding?
I got a couple of businesses.

120
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,351
One, I'm into hammocks.
A whole bunch of hammocks.

121
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,826
Here you go. Thought I was gonna
stiff you. Here, take it all.

122
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:00,623
"Salud".

123
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,737
I'm in a couple of businesses.
Hammocks, as I told you.

124
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,638
They can make the best hemp
hammocks in the world down here.

125
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,443
Let's shoot in here,
get a couple of tall ones, okay?

126
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,240
- Hi, Captain, how are you?
- How ae you?

127
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,315
<i>Por favor, is it safe
to eat the lettuce here?</i>

128
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,441
Yes. Yes, madam, sir.

129
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,119
I import fungicides
for the coffee boys...

130
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:23,723
and I import air conditioning parts...

131
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:24,857
Keeps me alert.

132
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,021
Keeps me on the go.
This isn't a bad place...

133
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,521
For broads, and the chow's outta sight.

134
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:32,987
See the chick in red?

135
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,167
Not a pro. You can crack
walnuts on her ass.

136
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,466
This clown is gay. Look at him.

137
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,606
Looks like he's na army dude.
He isn't. It's a cover up.

138
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,498
Samuel?

139
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,607
A couple poonas and a lot of ice.
Lots of ice, you understand?

140
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,847
Yes, sir!

141
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:51,112
Don't say, "Yes, sir". I mean
a lot of ice, and I mean it this time.

142
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,875
Okay.

143
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,755
I'll tell you something.
You gotta really kick ass around here.

144
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,316
I don't know what it is, but these
people just don't catch on, understand?

145
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,016
Midge?

146
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,889
I want you to meet somebody.

147
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,932
Honey? Midge?
Remember Jack Noah, the actor?

148
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:11,369
Remember that daytime soap opera
you used to watch? "Life's Patch".

149
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,471
It's Lance Farrington!

150
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't know if I should
shake that hand or not.

151
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,407
He raped five women on that show.

152
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,317
You need to do your nails.

153
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,579
Shut up, Ralph.

154
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,987
Shall we sit down?

155
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,288
- Thank you.
- Sure.

156
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,746
- You are a real fan.
- You're much handsomer in person.

157
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,094
- A little sauced.
- Thank you.

158
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,188
- She drinks in the morning.
- Your "poonas", gentlemen.

159
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,594
I love that they all speak English.

160
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,072
Thanks to Saint Reggie.
Wasn't a real saint.

161
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:50,042
This place actually
was founded by the Spaniards.

162
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,745
Slaves from the lvory Coast and Indians.

163
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,374
Na English pirate came
and really took over.

164
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,085
In order to keep the peace,
he took 3 wives...

165
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,554
<i>a senorita, a black and an indian.</i>

166
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,356
<i>You see a lot of
people here named Simms...</i>

167
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,793
including His Excellency, the dictator.

168
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,590
Look here. Right up here.

169
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,329
You know who that is?

170
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,737
That's Madonna Mendez,
The Dictator's girlfriend.

171
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,295
Is that not a piece of ass?

172
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,769
Look at the hooters.
Hard as little rocks.

173
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,727
I met the Dictator. He visited the set.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,662
He's got a lot of charisma.
That dude is heavy.

175
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,334
Good looking.

176
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,572
The people love him.

177
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,030
And I'm gonna tell you something.
As long as Alphonse Simms is alive...

178
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,640
Those goddamn guerrillas
don't stand a chance.

179
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,447
I'd better go pack.

180
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,218
These things are quite a wallop,
don't they?

181
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,517
Now I see what you're doing.

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,616
- I'm just a phone call away.
- Thanks a lot.

183
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,353
I'm just a horny old broad.

184
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,895
It's nice to meet you, Midge.

185
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,261
You lush. You wanted to hump him.

186
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,306
Blow it out your ear, Ralph.

187
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,438
All those poonas
are paralyzing your mind.

188
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,519
What time leaves the bus from Parador?

189
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,422
Tomorrow at 9 A.M.

190
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,858
I might to go to the Stern Agency.

191
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,194
Stern? It's too big. You'll get lost.

192
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,856
- Peter Mishkan is there.
- Mishkan's out.

193
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,388
Mishkan's out?

194
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,267
I'll see you in the city, doll.
Bye, Clint.

195
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,030
- See you, Jenny.
- Mishkan is out?

196
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,307
We had fun.

197
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,276
We really did, Clint.
How many times have you killed me?

198
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,107
This is number four.
You die good, Jack.

199
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,247
When are you leaving?

200
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,817
My flight is tomorrow,
but I may stay for Carnival.

201
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:12,545
And you?

202
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,254
I got a Burt Reynolds shoot in New Mexico.

203
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,456
- It starts Tuesday.
- Anything in it for me?

204
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,686
You know Burt.
It's all stunts and broads.

205
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,061
What are you talking about?
I just fell off a building!

206
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:25,464
He loved me in "Evita".

207
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,633
- I'll tell him hi for you.
- Listen to me.

208
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,501
I'm out of work 3 minutes...

209
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,971
And I'm already going crazy.
I need a psychiatrist.

210
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,039
Stick around. Have a good time.

211
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,674
I'll relax, read a book.

212
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,610
If you're in L.A., call me.
I'm in the book.

213
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,778
L.A. is better for work, right?

214
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:43,043
- Lots of TV.
- And TV is better than it was, right?

215
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,384
- You were fabulous, Jack.
- Thank you, thank you.

216
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,286
Did you hear Peter Mishkan
left the Stern Agency?

217
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,618
- Who?
- Forget it. Nothing.

218
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,250
Did you hear Peter Mishkan
left the Stern Agency?

219
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,486
- Do you know him?
- Anybody here?

220
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,649
I love you.

221
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,146
I love you, Sammy!

222
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,686
I love you!
Thank you.

223
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,360
Hey, Sammy!
Jack Noah, from the Big Apple!

224
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,011
Jack, what do you know!
Look who's here!

225
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,987
I thought you would decide to stay.

226
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,689
Isn't it festive?

227
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:13,358
Let's go to the red zone,
where the real partying is.

228
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,484
Over there! Over there!

229
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,035
I don't care if the bastard is dictator.

230
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,377
- I hate road hog.
- Watch your language, Ralph.

231
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,241
Shut up!

232
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,607
- They really love me.
- Without question.

233
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,858
I think I need a steak.
A nice, big, juicy steak.

234
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,257
Carlo, Poona Beach Club.

235
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,626
After that... I think I need my Madonna.

236
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,391
I'll send a car.

237
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,634
Roberto, I've been thinking.

238
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,094
Perhaps I ought to marry her.

239
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,634
It would be the
greatest carnival of them all.

240
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,236
Impossible.

241
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,510
That makes it more desirable.

242
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,713
We've know each other a long time.

243
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,552
A very long time. I tell you
with all respect that this girl...

244
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,890
we have to be careful.

245
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,002
The people love her
because she's one of them.

246
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,994
- They see the romance.
- That's right.

247
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:38,043
Marriage is another matter.
The 14 Families would never approve.

248
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:42,446
It's all your fault.
I met her in your damn club!

249
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,052
You must admit,
she's a hell of a dancer.

250
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,317
She's almost a prostitute!
It's what she is!

251
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,959
Think about other things!
You're meeting with the archbishop...

252
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:56,655
as well as the new Russian ambassador
is presenting his credentials!

253
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,953
Your speech...

254
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:02,131
On Saint Reginald's day must be
strong, confident!

255
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,993
Your Excellency? Alphonse!

256
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,864
Drunken bastard!

257
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,338
I wanna make love with you.

258
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,776
Come here.

259
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,846
- Carlo, take the feet.
- He's so heavy.

260
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,384
He can't drink anymore.
His liver is totally damaged.

261
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,222
Excuse me, excuse me.
Sorry.

262
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,019
Where is the Hotel Parador?

263
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,622
- Straight on, man. Straight on.
- Thank you.

264
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,397
- Got some silver?
- I don't got snit.

265
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,228
<i>Don't be hostile, Americano!</i>

266
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,007
No, please!

267
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,210
I've been mugged already! No, no.
You don't understand!

268
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,075
- Get in there! Get in!
- Please! Please!

269
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,181
Please! I'm just na actor!
My name is Jack Noah.

270
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,616
I swear, I'm just na actor!

271
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,253
Come!

272
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,593
Come in, please. Sit down.

273
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,974
- What's going on?
- Do you want something to eat?

274
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,737
I want out of here, pal.

275
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,642
Did you understand what I said?

276
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:06,411
Call the American Embassy.

277
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,854
I'm a well-known American actor.

278
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,551
- Not that well-known.
- What are you, a critic?

279
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,222
But you're very talented.

280
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,322
Look...

281
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,730
I happen to be late
for some appointments...

282
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,733
back in Nova York.
I'm up for the lead in "Anna Christie".

283
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,136
I read that play when
I was at Harvard.

284
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,070
I didn't like it.
Besides, you're not right for it.

285
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,293
You went to Harvard?

286
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,763
Really?

287
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,197
Boston College.

288
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
I like Boston.
Modern, but old.

289
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,447
You went to Harvard...

290
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,574
you must know
you got the wrong guy.

291
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,045
I'm na actor.
My name is Jack Noah.

292
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,952
- I got the right guy.
- Do you?

293
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,515
Okay.

294
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,196
- What's going on?
- Can you dance?

295
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:53,756
Absolutely. I'm terrific.
First rate.

296
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,532
Good.
I got a part for you to play.

297
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,102
A part for me?

298
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,931
Who are you casting agents,
the Gestapo?

299
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,009
You!
You're a funny guy!

300
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,784
No. This is a very serious part.

301
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,350
Every part is serious.

302
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,446
No matter how small the role...

303
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,521
every part is serious.

304
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,391
You know Wayne Newton?

305
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,994
Yeah. I think he's great.

306
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,065
I feel a little better.

307
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,710
You know, I was a little nervous.
I didn't understand.

308
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,310
I didn't know if I was getting a
cattle prod in the balls or what.

309
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,077
Come on.

310
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,586
Come on, come on.

311
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,557
Funny, funny.

312
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,532
It's just like a scene in a movie...

313
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:03,268
where they're torturing
you for information...

314
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,793
you just don't have!

315
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,437
So what's your name?

316
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,140
- Roberto. Roberto Straussmann.
- Roberto Straussmann. Right.

317
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,541
So, what's the part, Sr. Straussmann?

318
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,676
I hope you're not a vegetarian.

319
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,142
Japonese beef.

320
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,976
Omaha beef.

321
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,823
Alphonse Simms.

322
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,196
That's... that's the Dictator.

323
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,495
- Is he dead?
- Very dead.

324
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,672
What happened?

325
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,597
Heart attack.
Too many damn poonas.

326
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,674
What's going on here?

327
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,446
Is this some kind of Paradorian funeral?

328
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,745
No, no.

329
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,385
- Don't say what you're thinking.
- Aren't you na actor?

330
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,560
- This is a real guy!
- So was Richard III. Henry V.

331
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:38,463
Olivier played them convincingly.

332
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:39,794
This is a real man!

333
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,696
You did a good impersonation on the set.

334
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,104
It was a 2-minute bit. You're crazy.

335
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,571
I want out.

336
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,773
Have some confidence!
New York Times!

337
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:52,140
"Jack Noah gave a
fresh dimension to Richard II."

338
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,576
I was good.

339
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,078
Can I see?

340
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,550
- Thank you.
- But then...

341
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,924
"Newcomer Jack Noah
seemed utterly lost as Bradley".

342
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,222
Bad play. And the director was on coke.

343
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,484
This is a great play.

344
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,934
You have the review when I played Biff?

345
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,602
- No, I'm sorry.
- The City Center Production...

346
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,092
it's not important.

347
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,299
It said I was "resonant and ferocious".

348
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,200
That I "devoured the stage".

349
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,782
Let me ask you a question.
Why are you doing this?

350
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,884
Why not have a cremation...

351
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,653
And a day of mourning?

352
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:37,055
Parador's at a
delicate moment in it's history.

353
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,682
For the dictator to die...

354
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,061
Is a shock. It would be chaos.

355
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,763
He can't live forever.

356
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,032
We need time to plan the transition.

357
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:52,436
You would save lives.
This is the part of a lifetime.

358
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,830
Besides, it's only for a day or two.

359
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,143
- You want me to be na impostor.
- The essence of the stage!

360
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,115
Isn't your real name
Noah Blumburg?

361
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,879
Haven't you assumed a new identity?

362
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,083
But Simms was so much taller than me.

363
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,191
No problem. He wore four-inch lifts.

364
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,167
He had darker hair.

365
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,431
Fortunately, our dictator was vain.

366
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,105
- I'd need some dark makeup.
- This...

367
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,645
is the makeup case of
Parador's greatest actor...

368
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:39,709
Liano Boule.
He died about 20 minutes ago.

369
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,054
What about his voice?
It was much lower than mine.

370
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,166
- When do I start?
- Now.

371
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,866
- It won't work, Straussmann.
- Why...

372
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,396
are the actors so much like children?

373
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,306
They need the caress...
the compliments.

374
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:11,106
Then they need the whip,
the scolding, the orders:

375
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,942
You will do it!

376
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm going to mingle with my customers.
It's important that I show myself.

377
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,026
When I come back,
I expect to see my president.

378
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,134
Why didn't you get De Niro?
Or Hoffman?

379
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,396
<i>Not available!</i>

380
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:38,504
<i>I'd cut off my arms to work with
Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman!</i>

381
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,535
They always say that
about De Niro and Hoffman.

382
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,456
- Good evening.
- Where if His Excellency?

383
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,185
Delayed.

384
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,992
Who is it tonight?

385
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,490
State secrets.

386
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,651
I want you to take this
and go to the back office.

387
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:57,883
And you see this, you tear it off like that
and you come out screaming, all right?

388
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:58,978
Listen to me!

389
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,790
You will do it, all right?

390
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,259
- All right?
- Okay.

391
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,396
What happened?
I'm freezing!

392
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,762
I think I fell asleep
in the meat locker.

393
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,731
Bravo.

394
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,837
On Bobby De Niro

395
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,092
- Good evening, my Presidente.
- Good evening, old friend.

396
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:51,033
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!

397
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,650
To the airport! Hurry!

398
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,976
To the palace, Carlo.
Please, don't joke.

399
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,719
These boots are killing me.

400
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,757
- I almost fainted in there.
- Did you see them at the club? Did you hear them?

401
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,425
What? Two hundred drunks in the dark?
What about the personal staff?

402
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,966
What about the secretaries?

403
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,934
I would be amazed if they said anything.

404
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:28,728
- Somebody's gonna know.
- Knowing and saying are two different things.

405
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,943
Somebody's gonna know, and somebody's
gonna say something.

406
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:37,973
- Somebody'll sing like a canary!
- You know, we eat canaries in Parador.

407
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,051
We're coming to the palace. Practice the salute.

408
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,426
- With the right hand!
- I'm a lefty!

409
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,450
Not anymore!

410
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,398
Not like that. With a flip.

411
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,566
- With a flip, okay.
- That's right, that's right.

412
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,403
- You must learn it.
- I'm flipping!

413
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,633
Alphonse loved to salute! Perfect!

414
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,496
You have a big speech soon.

415
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,967
- When?
- Tomorrow.

416
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,908
That's impossible!
I need rehearsal time.

417
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,778
All up!

418
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,819
<i>Oy vay iz mir.</i>

419
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,938
Now we come to your entourage.

420
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,942
All up!

421
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,748
Alejandro is your valet.

422
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:18,407
Alejandro.

423
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,716
Madame Loop is your maid.

424
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,723
Dieter Lopez is your secretary.

425
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,433
Gunther Feldman is your barber...

426
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:38,197
And his daughter
Magda is your manicurist.

427
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,595
Should I draw your bath, sir?

428
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,301
No, thank you.

429
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,630
- Alejandro.
- Alejandro.

430
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,315
- Should I undress you?
- No.

431
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,397
No, thank you, Alejandro.
I think I need the exercise.

432
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:40,386
Your Excellency.

433
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,353
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

434
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,935
- I think he knew.
- No, you're very good.

435
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:31,775
When do I get the speech?

436
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,507
- Tomorrow. We can rehearse.
- Thank you.

437
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,547
It's been difficult,
but you seem more relaxed.

438
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,720
Well...

439
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,857
What the hell.

440
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,724
I'll get you some videotapes of Simms.

441
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,055
So, tomorrow...

442
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,859
I do the speech,
and that'll be that, right?

443
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,935
Precisely.
Good night, my President.

444
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,436
Good night, my Chief of Secret Police.

445
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,636
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

446
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,951
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

447
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:10,250
You're a funny guy.

448
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,192
<i>That's funny with the
Auf Wiedersehen thing.</i>

449
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,656
What a psychotic.

450
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,077
I must get outta here.
Call the American Embassy.

451
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,218
Helo? Hello?

452
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,947
Hello? This is your dictator speaking.

453
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,791
Your nightcap, your Excellency.

454
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,527
Thank you.

455
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:59,862
- Good night, your Excellency.
- Good night, Alejandro.

456
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:26,952
To Alphonse.

457
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,460
Poor bastard.

458
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,495
Breakfast, your Excellency.

459
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,828
A delicious breakfast, your Excellency.

460
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,964
We have your favorite
blood sausages this morning.

461
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,268
Enjoy.

462
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,875
Your Excellency. Your morning bath,
Your Excellency.

463
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,049
Beautiful bath today, sir.

464
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,650
This way.

465
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,359
Mr. Lopez would like to see
you this morning if he may.

466
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:03,121
Who's that?

467
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,993
- Who's that?
- Dieter Lopez.

468
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,592
Your bath.

469
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:13,927
Over there.

470
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:14,594
Thank you.

471
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,380
Look at this stuff.

472
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,612
Butter and cream cheese.
No wonder he's dead.

473
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,190
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- What did you put in my drink?

474
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,919
- You mickeyed it, right?
- I forgot to tell you.

475
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,565
Alphonse had
a sleeping potion every night.

476
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,033
He had insomnia.
He's a nervous man.

477
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,592
I wonder why.
When do I get my sides?

478
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,137
- Sides?
- The script.

479
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,943
The speech, goddamn it!

480
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,912
Don't curse.
Alphose never cursed.

481
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,375
He's elegant, charming.
Sit up straight.

482
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,609
Laught.

483
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:02,852
Wrong!

484
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,114
More. Fuller. Fuller.

485
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,093
Alphonse loved to laught.
That's better.

486
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:10,394
- I love to laught. Love it!
- Like that.

487
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,862
- Your Excellency.
- Who sent for you?

488
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,626
- His Excellency.
- Mr. Lopez...

489
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,367
Dieter.

490
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:18,202
These documents need your signature.

491
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:20,104
- He must read them.
- But of course.

492
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:20,763
Leave us!

493
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,308
But they're urgent. It's for
the new dam.

494
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:25,639
Damn the dam! Get out!

495
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,478
<i>Maricon.</i>

496
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,876
I've videotapes of Simms'
speeches for you to study.

497
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,721
I'll rehearse with you later.

498
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:44,320
- Mr. Straussmann.
- Please, call me Roberto.

499
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,623
Roberto.

500
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,634
Yes, Roberto, thank you so much.

501
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,125
I'll, Roberto.
I think...

502
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,028
I'm giving a very
superficial performance.

503
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,764
It's very shallow.
You know what I mean?

504
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,574
It's very cardboard.

505
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:05,049
It's what we call in N.Y.
a result-oriented performance.

506
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,151
And...

507
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:10,450
- I just can't do it.
- Get me through today.

508
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,145
- Roberto!
- Or I'll kill you.

509
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,753
- You'd make a good director.
- Thank you.

510
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,200
<i>My fellow Paradorians...</i>

511
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,604
<i>I come to you...</i>

512
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,910
<i>in an hour of great national mouring.</i>

513
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,281
<i>Let me assure you...</i>

514
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:40,375
<i>that the cowardly murder
of Felix Carbone...</i>

515
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,777
<i>Parador's greatest athete...</i>

516
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,023
<i>- and my trusted advisor...
- My trusted advisor.</i>

517
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:49,186
<i>- won't go unrevenged.
- My trusted advisor.</i>

518
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,328
<i>Not only was he
a great tennis player...</i>

519
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,894
Great tennis player.

520
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,693
<i>he was a man
of great charm and loyalty.</i>

521
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,802
<i>And who're his murderers?</i>

522
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>The same nest of radical
poets and toothless bohemians.</i>

523
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,338
I hope he makes
a short speech today.

524
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,542
- Good day, your Excellency.
- Beautiful day.

525
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,848
Wonderful day for a good speech.
Clear sky, happy people.

526
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,650
Reminds me of Nuremberg.

527
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,761
I don't want hot towels today.

528
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,128
<i>Jawohl, mein Führer.</i>

529
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:32,995
My fellow Paradorians...

530
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,406
my brothers and sisters...

531
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,775
- you're my sons and daughters...
- Your Excellency.

532
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,477
- What!? What!? What's it!?
- Can I help you?

533
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,213
Can't you see I'm trying to prepare?

534
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,475
- But your Excellency...
- To get ready.

535
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,177
I beg your forgiveness
for the intrusion.

536
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,220
It's all right, Alejandro.

537
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,297
I think that the sleeping potion you're
giving me is making me a little irritable.

538
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:02,800
- I'll reduce it.
- Eliminate it.

539
00:45:02,835 --> 00:45:03,562
Yes, sir.

540
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,698
That'll be all, Alejandro.

541
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,180
My fellow Paradorians,
you're my brothers and sisters...

542
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,413
my sons and daughters...
my sons and daughters...

543
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,779
- It's not him.
- Of course it's not.

544
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,721
The walk's different.

545
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:31,118
- The eyes, too innocent.
- The hands of a peasant.

546
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,190
- Say it. A Jew.
- You think, Papa?

547
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,334
- It's a trick.
- We should tell someone.

548
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:40,471
- Why?
- Roberto's involved.

549
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:41,335
Absolutely.

550
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,234
So opening your mouth's
a good way to get killed.

551
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,345
I don't care who I serve.

552
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,582
When they say
he's a dictator and he acts it...

553
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:53,846
who cares?
Why rock the boat?

554
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,476
I don't wanna lose my job.

555
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,490
Papa doesn't wanna
be in an Israeli court.

556
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:03,586
In two years, I retire and
go to my farm in Chile.

557
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,126
Let us play out the charade.

558
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,757
Where ignorance's bliss,
'tis folly to be wise.

559
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,930
The Dictator is the Dictator...
Is the Dictator.

560
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,865
All up!

561
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,477
Archbishop Aurelio Lopez.
Old, but cunning.

562
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,947
General Kurtzinaldo.
tough, dependable, psychotic.

563
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:37,058
Umberto Soler. President of the
General Assembly. A moron.

564
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,793
He suspendes the General Assembly

565
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,468
two years ago and ruled by decree
under a state of siege.

566
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:47,232
- Why did they do that?
- National security matters.

567
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,573
I don't feel well.

568
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,442
Do you get stage fright?

569
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,376
Always. Don't talk about it.

570
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,206
- What's he drill?
- First the orchestra plays the national anthem.

571
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,013
- How does that go?
- You have to know. You have to sing it.

572
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,949
I only know "God Bless America", pal!

573
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,850
Too late.

574
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:37,111
Paradorians.

575
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,948
We are a family...

576
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,123
of the same soul

577
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,491
You are my brothers...

578
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,496
and... and... my sisters.
You are my sons...

579
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,096
and my daughters.

580
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,837
You are my nieces...

581
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,172
and my nephews.

582
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,543
We have struggle in the past together...

583
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,714
and we have struggle
in the future to overcome.

584
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,177
But as your father...

585
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:25,057
I promise to be faithful to your trust.

586
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,563
and as your son...

587
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,941
I promise to learn from you advice...

588
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,712
and from your tears.

589
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,053
The unity...

590
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,461
of this family...

591
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:02,722
is sacred.

592
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:08,262
And those... who would destroy
Such unity...

593
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,904
I say: beware.

594
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,579
You will be crushed.

595
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,189
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!

596
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:31,991
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!

597
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,731
We must dream...

598
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,538
the impossible dream.

599
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,270
We must fight...

600
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,247
the unbeatable foe.

601
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,277
We must reach...

602
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,689
the unreachable star...

603
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:09,097
until the days dwindle
down to a precious few.

604
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,799
God bless you.
Long live Parador!

605
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,545
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!

606
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,744
Simms! Simms! Simms! Simms!

607
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,848
lt'a hit!

608
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,290
All hup!

609
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,397
- You were magnificent.
- I went for it.

610
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:42,599
<i>Thank you.
You're si kind...</i>

611
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:43,733
Thank you!

612
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,435
The last part,
"Man of La Mancha", right?

613
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,038
Yeah, I hope you didn't mind.
I touht the speech needed a close.

614
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:49,473
Like a solid...
Do you think I should take another bow?

615
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:51,374
No! Always leave them wanting more.

616
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:54,544
You're right. You're absolutely right.
You'd make a very good director.

617
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,880
I always hate it when they
take too many curtains calls.

618
00:51:56,915 --> 00:52:01,476
Thanks you so much. Thank you
thanks you very much,

619
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,647
Thank you, thank you.

620
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,257
- Boy! Was it always like that?
- You surpassed it!

621
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,793
Boy, you know, I could do better,
but as long as I'm little more relaxed.

622
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:11,461
Your greates speech, Your Excellency.

623
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,196
Do you really think so, Alejandro?

624
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:16,266
Yes, sir!
Would you like a refreshment?

625
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,359
I would like a diet coke,

626
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,200
- Whatever you wish, Your Excellency.
- Thank you. Thank you.

627
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,576
Alphonse never drank sodas.
Only "poonas".

628
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:29,773
Really? Really?
I'm putting Alphonse on a diet.

629
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,148
For his health.

630
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:33,981
Great idea! I like it!
lmprovisation, huh?

631
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,354
- Yes! Make him thinner!
- We make a great team!

632
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:42,792
Your drink Your Excellency.
Diet Pepsi. No Coke.

633
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:47,422
Thank you. I think we should
stock up on some lo-cal yogurt.

634
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,126
- Plain or flavored?
- The kind with the fruit on the bottom.

635
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,902
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- Thank you.

636
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,709
To Alphonse.

637
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,987
I took a chance, and it worked.
The cameras didn't come too close.

638
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:14,218
Soon, everyone will have
forgotten the old Alphonse...

639
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,088
that miserable alcoholic.

640
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,156
He could be better than Alphonse.

641
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,721
More energy, less family bullshit.

642
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,230
Precisely.
We write his part and he plays it.

643
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,338
- How's the steak?
- Very good.

644
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,377
What about Madonna?
She could ruin everything.

645
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,882
I've already suggested to her that
she leave the country. Go to Miami.

646
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,583
With her ass, she could
make a good living in Miami.

647
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,624
If she refuses?

648
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,624
- Parador. For profit and Christ.
- For profit and Christ.

649
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:58,595
May we rot in hell if
these secrets leave this chamber.

650
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:03,398
Saint Reggie, help us.
To the 14 families. Amen.

651
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:05,861
Hello, darling. I had to bribe
Alejandro to let me in.

652
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,164
Don't tell Roberto,
that bastard!

653
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,004
But you know me.
I had to find out the truth.

654
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:19,805
Do you know what Roberto told me?
He said I had to leave.

655
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,711
He'd send me to Miami and put me
in a condo there.

656
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,281
Me, in Miami?

657
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,625
I said I wouldn't go.
I asked if he talked to you.

658
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,721
He says, "of course".

659
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:40,498
And it's your wish that I
leave for my own safety, blah, blah.

660
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,464
So I said to myself...

661
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:48,406
"Madonna, you and Phonse have
a good relationship. More...

662
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,510
it's a friendship".

663
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,441
<i>So if you want me
to leave for some reason...</i>

664
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:58,713
tell me yourself!
Don't send that fucking rat!

665
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,016
If you tell me to go, I'll go...

666
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:07,327
and ask no questions. It must be
something political I don't understand.

667
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,598
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I didn't!

668
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,599
I knew it!

669
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:14,799
Honey?

670
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,609
You're gonna have to be
a little tougher with him.

671
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,574
Despite whatever he tells you...

672
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,841
and the other jackasses,
he needs you.

673
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:32,187
Without you,
they're totally exposed.

674
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,221
Really. So, honey...

675
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,530
you gave
a wonderful speech today.

676
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:47,168
Very, very emotional. That's
why Roberto needs you.

677
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,334
We Paradorians are so romantic.

678
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:03,242
It make us fools and drives me crazy.

679
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,245
We're more than lovers.
Let's face it, honey.

680
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,921
You're so decadent.

681
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:17,196
You really love me
because I dance good.

682
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,268
Sexx you can get anywhere.

683
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,805
But a friend who can dance...

684
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:56,596
Who are you?

685
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,002
My name is Jack Noah.

686
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,513
- I'm na actor.
- You're na actor?

687
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:10,719
You should get an Oscar for tonight.
Very good.

688
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,618
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

689
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,196
What are you doing here?
Where's Phonse?

690
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,893
I'm playing the Dictator.

691
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:25,833
Phonse's dead.

692
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,335
Phonse's dead?

693
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:31,835
Poor bastard.

694
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,906
- Who did it? Roberto?
- No. Well, I don't...

695
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,579
they said he had a heart attack.

696
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:45,114
Heart attack!
Too many poonas.

697
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:49,988
You loved him.

698
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,931
In a fashion. We're friends.

699
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,357
He's so dumb and so sweet.

700
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:01,998
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,238
So...

702
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:10,835
when're you...

703
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,345
gonna leave for Miami?

704
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:15,479
I'm not.

705
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,351
Isn't that dangerous?

706
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,148
To be alive's dangerous.

707
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,289
I can help you play the part.

708
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,161
I knew Phonse better than anyone.

709
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,526
You tell that to Roberto.

710
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,869
Why would you
want to help me?

711
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,631
Why should I go to Miami...

712
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,837
and work in a cocktail bar
or sell cosmetics in Saks?

713
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,507
I'd rather be the Dictator's mistress.

714
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,578
- But the Dictator's dead.
- I don't think so.

715
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:53,786
You hardly know me.

716
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,691
I know a dictator when I see one.

717
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,524
<i>Madonna helped me
with the character.</i>

718
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,769
<i>She gave me specific
expressions and gestures.</i>

719
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,302
<i>What's a pochooto?</i>

720
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,438
Pork and guacamole.

721
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,508
My "pochooto" is
beginning to hurt.

722
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,255
<i>Mostly, I did ceremonial things.</i>

723
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,591
<i>I learned real fast
how sweet power was.</i>

724
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,404
<i>They exposed me to the press.</i>

725
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:43,706
<i>But they never let
them get too close.</i>

726
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,105
Do you know anything about the loan,
Mr. President?

727
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,736
Are you gonna help with the Contras,
Mr. President?

728
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,678
How do you feel about Panama?

729
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,109
<i>I made speeches on TV
signifying absolutely nothing.</i>

730
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,546
You know...

731
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,144
I've recently lost...

732
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,720
20 unneeded and
unwanted pounds.

733
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,357
So, as your leader...

734
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,689
I have been inspired
to lead this nation...

735
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,062
to a happier and healthier existence.

736
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,674
Now our Paradorian diet is tasty...

737
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:19,733
<i>yes, but it's dangerous.</i>

738
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,878
<i>Wich's why Parador leads
the world...</i>

739
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,407
<i>in heart disease
and amoebic dysentery.</i>

740
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,013
<i>This food can kill you.</i>

741
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:33,680
So, let's warm up and do some aerobics.

742
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,925
1 and 2 and 3 and 4.

743
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,660
<i>1 and 2 and 3 and 4.</i>

744
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,429
<i>That's it, that's it,
that's it, that's it.</i>

745
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:41,124
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

746
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,397
<i>1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
Everybody.</i>

747
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,703
<i>1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
Down and stretch. Down...</i>

748
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,040
<i>1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
1 and 2 and 3 and 4.</i>

749
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:54,711
<i>1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
1 and 2 and 3 and 4.</i>

750
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:55,735
<i>It's good, yes?</i>

751
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,940
<i>It's easy, yes?</i>

752
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,353
<i>- So I was dancing through it.
- Good.</i>

753
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:08,257
<i>Literally. And falling
for Madonna each day.</i>

754
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,248
Hips now. The hips.

755
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,556
<i>The hips.
Very good gringo hips.</i>

756
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,425
Hands. Good.

757
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,098
Hands. Great. Beautiful.

758
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:21,492
Great.

759
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:26,135
Perfect.

760
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:28,939
Hold me.

761
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,778
My back.

762
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,144
- You said you could dance.
- I lied. Anything to get a job.

763
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,613
Very good.

764
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:05,608
- Was Alphonse really such a good dancer?
- It's his best talent.

765
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,907
- He really loved you?
- He said so.

766
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,652
You're getting to me, too.

767
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,280
Don't overact.

768
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:24,490
So why haven't you called?
It's been months.

769
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,067
Forgive me.

770
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:30,566
I've been busy.

771
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,766
Not too busy for Madonna Mendez.

772
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,145
Don't look surprised.

773
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,649
I'm surprised you're jealous.

774
01:03:39,684 --> 01:03:42,709
I'm not jealous. I'm disgusted.

775
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,552
She's not worthy of you.

776
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,422
You're blushing.

777
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,753
You said you loved me.
You adored me.

778
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:56,732
- And I do.
- You wanted to be with me forever.

779
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,223
You're always in my dreams.

780
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,633
- You deceived me.
- How did I do that?

781
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,498
You've done it with all the others...

782
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,538
but it won't work with me.

783
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,579
No. No.

784
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,315
You...

785
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,686
- You're divine.
- Yes, I am.

786
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,882
But I know as many tricks...

787
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,026
as your low-class whore.

788
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,661
You're lovely when you're angry.

789
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,161
<i>Senorita...</i>

790
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:38,441
- Your Excellency.
- Thank you so much.

791
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:41,274
It's time for you to get married.

792
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:46,272
- Your mother loves me.
- So she tells me.

793
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,041
You're can't play Casanova forever.

794
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,582
People are talking.

795
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,130
Call me when you're serious...

796
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,829
your Excellency.

797
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,367
Thank you for the dance.

798
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:12,642
Roberto.

799
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:14,310
- I wanna go home now.
- Whatever you say.

800
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:16,744
The alcoholic wants to be first lady.

801
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,538
Lulu?

802
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:23,774
Not a bad choice.
An engagement would divert the public...

803
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,055
with a festive wedding later.

804
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,454
No way.

805
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,559
By the way, do I have a mother?

806
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:35,558
Of course. And consequently,
I must inform you...

807
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,634
she arrives from her Paris shopping trip...

808
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:39,692
tomorrow at three.

809
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,739
- She'll know I'm not her son.
- Don't worry.

810
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:46,435
She has cataracts and some memory loss.

811
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,609
You've never been friendly.

812
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,736
What do I call this lady?

813
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:52,739
Momma.

814
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,624
- Momma.
- Don't "Momma" me!

815
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:14,225
You do look thinner. Everyone said
you had lost weight.

816
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:20,106
I thought you'd contract sypnillis
like your uncle Orlando.

817
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,068
How was your trip?

818
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:27,776
Everything's ruined by repetition.
Even Paris.

819
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,308
I bought some excellent caviar...

820
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,850
On the Rue de Rivoli.

821
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,393
Don't worry.
I'm not staying long.

822
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:42,330
- You're welcome here, dear momma.
- I know you don't like me. Who cares?

823
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,225
Your father and I had a child and
we hated each other.

824
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:50,833
Please, listen to me.

825
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:55,407
I love you. No matter what
has happened before...

826
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:59,013
I love you as only a son
can love a mother.

827
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,518
You're my mother and I love you.

828
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:03,644
<i>Merde to love!</i>

829
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,117
Come, Antonio.
Watch those fox furs, you swine!

830
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:08,452
Love!

831
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,896
How long will the President swim?

832
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,475
Maybe 10 minutes, maybe all day.

833
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:29,011
We came from Mt. Pochooto to swim.

834
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,445
Who cares?
I don't care where you came from!

835
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,549
No swimming until the President's done.
Understand?

836
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,347
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

837
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,455
Look at this.
It's the Sunday New York Times.

838
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,955
The New York Times. God.

839
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,869
One day in N.Y. is
a little year in Parador.

840
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:56,429
The Long Wharf is doing "All my Sons".

841
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,040
Bill King is directing.

842
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,743
He loves my work.

843
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:02,344
I could be brilliant in it.

844
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:05,108
Will I be there? Will I show up?
I have no idea.

845
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:06,842
You're doing well here.

846
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,482
It's going okay.

847
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,986
Actually, it's getting pretty easy.

848
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,252
Actually, it's getting boring.

849
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,352
Why don't you do
something good for the country?

850
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,364
I started the beautification program
for the airport.

851
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,601
I was thinking about something
more profound.

852
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,565
I replaced the national anthem.

853
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,367
You're getting crazier than Phonse.

854
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,971
<i>Parador,
Parador, I love you.</i>

855
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,379
<i>Your mountains,
Your valleys, your rivers.</i>

856
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,413
<i>Beckon to me.</i>

857
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,358
Better than the old one.

858
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,326
I wanna kiss you so bad I could spit.

859
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,559
How would it look?

860
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,902
Paradorians are hot-blooded.
I don't think they would mind.

861
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,269
You don't think it
demeans the presidency?

862
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:12,541
Torture and hunger demeans
the presidency, not kissing.

863
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,630
In Sulla, there've been two incidents.

864
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,171
A kidnapping and
a power line destroyed.

865
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,072
Action was taken.

866
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,736
At Mt. Pochooto,
there've been dangerous battles...

867
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,940
but we've destroyed the rebel forces.

868
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,455
<i>I'm sorry to see it...</i>

869
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,559
<i>especially
during tourist season.</i>

870
01:09:56,594 --> 01:10:00,120
<i>It could scare people away
from what's a real nice country.</i>

871
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,757
In Ochito, there's been...

872
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,797
no incidents for 6 months.

873
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:14,169
This was shot secretly
at guerrilla headquarters.

874
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,838
Here you can see their leader,
Danta Guzman...

875
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,442
being visited by an American liberal.

876
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,315
<i>Dante! Hombre!</i>

877
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,750
<i>You son-of-a-bitch, you did it.</i>

878
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,454
That's Ed Asner.

879
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,222
I love "Lou Grant".

880
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,610
The guerrillas aren't
very fond of me.

881
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,343
Communist bastards.

882
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,950
Why am I in this?
Where's my limo?

883
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:56,819
We've a secret meeting.

884
01:10:56,854 --> 01:10:58,387
We've to dedicate the dog track.

885
01:10:58,422 --> 01:10:59,752
This is more important.

886
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,758
- Who's the meeting with.
- C.I.A.

887
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,191
You're blocking the way!

888
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,794
Come on, move!

889
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,674
You're late.

890
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,486
I have a very bad cold.

891
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:32,852
And I've the shits
for the last 3 days.

892
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,091
We've been work together...

893
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:39,492
for 8 or 9 years.
Have I ever beat around the bush?

894
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,266
I told you 6 months ago...

895
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,967
that the natives are restless.

896
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:49,834
They're more than that.
They're ready to flip out.

897
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,332
You and your people
better put a capper on it.

898
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,072
Don't you and your tinhorn bastards...

899
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,612
let this thing go to the Commies.

900
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,779
That's what I've been telling you.

901
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,913
It's bullshit about Parador
and it's sovereignty.

902
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,346
<i>If it wasn't for the U.S. A...</i>

903
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,153
handing it to your forebears in 1890...

904
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,828
there wouldn't be any Parador.

905
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,259
I agree with aeverything he says.

906
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,097
And stop listening those faggots
in the State Department.

907
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:27,341
And get this. I'm sick to death
of backing bad horses.

908
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,834
This is a stakes race and...

909
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:31,745
I want a winner.

910
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,672
Now you just holster your dick.

911
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,819
Otherwise your ass goes in
a hammock to Miami.

912
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,412
If we let you into Miami.

913
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,054
Holster my dick. Okay.

914
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,155
Pull over. I got to take a dump.

915
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:03,234
We'll say good-bye to old,
hello to the new.

916
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:05,879
And so, my friends...

917
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,948
Parador nor march proudly...

918
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,821
into the 21st century.

919
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,715
I promise the people of Parador...

920
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:18,724
new housing...

921
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:24,498
good condos, modern plumbing...

922
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,094
hot water, tennis courts...

923
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,469
saunas.

924
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,567
God bless you.

925
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,272
What a lie.

926
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,116
This is the worst slum
I've ever seen in my life.

927
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:43,744
- This is the good neighborhood.
- Why did you bring her?

928
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,284
- I wanted company.
- You're going too far.

929
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:49,353
- I'm the Dictator.
- I can always recast the part.

930
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:50,951
I should live so long.

931
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:03,129
Here.

932
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:10,379
- What's your name?
- Alice Gianni.

933
01:14:10,414 --> 01:14:11,368
How old are you?

934
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:17,116
You're so sweet.
Thank you for the flowers.

935
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,685
Take her! Follow me.

936
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,429
Over there. Run!

937
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,890
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Run! Run!

938
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,249
Communist bastards!

939
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,837
Up the hill! Up the hill!

940
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:26,752
Carmen!

941
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,750
- It's, Madonna!
- Madonna!

942
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,190
Here, come on.

943
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:36,660
Carmen!

944
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,267
This is my friend, Carmen.
I grew up here.

945
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:44,967
Carmen!

946
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:48,439
Madonna...

947
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,310
he can't stay here.
They'll kill him.

948
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,740
They'll kill us.

949
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,650
- Any sigh of the President?
- They both disappeared.

950
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,989
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

951
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,559
Burn it.

952
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,882
They'll think I did this.
They'll think I'm a monster.

953
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,304
Free the people!

954
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,842
Round up the usual suspects.
I'll interrogate.

955
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:27,706
Immediately, sir.

956
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,839
- When did he arrive?
- Moments ago.

957
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,409
- Is she with him?
- No, sir.

958
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,985
Where did you and Madonna go to?

959
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,132
We wnt shopping.

960
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,157
Don't fool with me, Jack Noah.

961
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:56,704
Why are you packing?

962
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,208
I'm weekending in the Hamptons.

963
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:01,334
You're not going anywhere.

964
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,771
I didn't sign on for this shit.

965
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,749
You're burning those people's homes.

966
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:09,051
Relax, my President...

967
01:18:09,086 --> 01:18:12,316
I'm not your President,
you low-life bastard.

968
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,546
I'm just na actor.

969
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,727
This is getting too real for me.

970
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:22,493
You're going on TV tomorrow
to show you're all right...

971
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,599
and that the government
is in control...

972
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:27,302
and that the murderers
will be caught and dealt with.

973
01:18:27,337 --> 01:18:28,570
I don't do TV.

974
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:32,374
- You'll go on tomorrow or
I'll cut your balls off!

975
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:33,102
I know.

976
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,274
You know...

977
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:41,908
I hate actors.

978
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:44,842
Good afternoon, my countrymen.

979
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,383
I'm very grateful
to be here with you today.

980
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,484
I would like to begin...

981
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:56,198
by extending my deepest sympathies
to the families of...

982
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,928
the innocent people killed
in yesterday's attack.

983
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,837
<i>They made the supreme sacrifice.
This attack was meant for me...</i>

984
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,404
<i>and they suffered the injury.</i>

985
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,273
<i>After this attack...</i>

986
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,973
<i>I asked myself,
why would someone wanna kill me?</i>

987
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,340
Being close to death...

988
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,716
has made me review my life...

989
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:21,611
and my rule.

990
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,124
<i>And so today...</i>

991
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,526
We got your friend.

992
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:28,553
<i>I ask the forgiveness of the
poor people of this country.</i>

993
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,422
And I pledge from this moment...

994
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,164
to make their liberation...

995
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:38,028
the first concern of my government.

996
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:43,103
And those of the privileged classes...

997
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,678
must not resist this liberation.

998
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,282
I would also like to make
a personal announcement...

999
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:56,152
wich will indicate how serious I am.

1000
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,919
<i>I take great pleasure
in announcing my engagement...</i>

1001
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,086
<i>to my long-time companion...</i>

1002
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,328
<i>Miss Madonna Mendez.</i>

1003
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,534
There're those of my advisors...

1004
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,603
who tell me this is a mistake.

1005
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:15,174
That Madonna's one
of the common people.

1006
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,470
<i>To me, this is her greatest virtue</i>

1007
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,580
That swine!

1008
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:22,816
It's only through her that...

1009
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,177
I understand the sufferings and hopes...

1010
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,012
of the people of Parador.

1011
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,792
And so, my fellows citizens...

1012
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,866
we must work together
to triumph over evil.

1013
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,899
To make Parador truly...

1014
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,833
a land of the free...

1015
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,203
and the home of the brave.

1016
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:58,844
Out.

1017
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:04,515
Want a Valium?

1018
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,596
- You think this is amusing?
- It was a good speech.

1019
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:11,123
- It was suicide. Yours.
- You're hiperventilating.

1020
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,537
I'll make you suffer.

1021
01:21:15,572 --> 01:21:18,740
You're a Harvard man.
Think. You can't kill me.

1022
01:21:18,775 --> 01:21:22,010
- You've payed your last role.
- You need me, I'm the dictator.

1023
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:25,411
- Actors are a dime a dozen.
- Not this good.

1024
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:30,418
You think you're my dictator?
You're as good as dead.

1025
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:32,886
Dick Carvett is
interviewing me tomorrow.

1026
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:34,917
Dick Cavett?

1027
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,523
Network TV.

1028
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,525
Brilliant, your Excellency!

1029
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,798
It totally castrates the Commies.

1030
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,197
You're a genius.

1031
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:49,534
He's a total genius,
isn't he, Roberto?

1032
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:54,674
Yes, perhaps.
Perhaps he's a genius.

1033
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,450
You Excellency,
could I use your bathroom?

1034
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,356
Certainly, certainly.

1035
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,583
One left, one right, two more lefts.

1036
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,232
What would you say
brought the change about?

1037
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:27,438
I could give you many reasons,
but the main reason...

1038
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,636
is my lovely Madonna here.

1039
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,070
The woman behind the throne.

1040
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:36,282
Can you tell me, Miss Mendez...

1041
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,587
what changes have
you seen in him...

1042
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:40,713
from your point of view?

1043
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:46,319
He's not the same man
I first met, that's for sure.

1044
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:51,799
Would you tell us, Excellency,
how you see the future of Parador?

1045
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,492
I would like to see...

1046
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,965
elections to the General Assembly
very, very soon.

1047
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,772
To begin work on land reform...

1048
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:07,070
and, I want to begin a dialogue
with the guerrillas...

1049
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,541
to put an end
to this terrible violence.

1050
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,946
That's extraordinary.

1051
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:15,448
To extend hope to the people...

1052
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,650
who tried to assassinate you.

1053
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,423
We all have to live with critics.

1054
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,961
- Even you.
- Well...

1055
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,324
Well, mine use words
instead of bullets.

1056
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,738
I hope this isn't a rude question...

1057
01:23:29,773 --> 01:23:32,263
but what do you see as your epitaph?

1058
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,670
"He played his part well."

1059
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:41,338
Recently, we have heard rumors...

1060
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,275
about a government program of
birth control?

1061
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,152
I'm certain that's an
unfortunate rumor, Excellency.

1062
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,721
Speaking of rumors...

1063
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:54,061
they say there're priests
who help the rebels.

1064
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:57,493
Renegades. Antichrists.

1065
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,339
What's this beautiful stone,
Eminence?

1066
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:06,773
It's a Paradorian sapphire, Excellency.

1067
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,444
Your Eminence, may I speak frankly?

1068
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,535
Certainly.

1069
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:18,580
I think the Church would
make a beautiful gesture...

1070
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,750
by donating this priceless ring...

1071
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:26,851
to the poorer members of the flock.

1072
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,391
God bless you, your Eminence.

1073
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,700
<i>The people loved me...</i>

1074
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:38,694
<i>well, except for him.</i>

1075
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,474
<i>We're a hit.
We're a smash.</i>

1076
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,448
<i>We're standing room only.</i>

1077
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,748
<i>Madonna was my best friend.</i>

1078
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,621
<i>She was sexy, she was smart
she was funny.</i>

1079
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,885
<i>She was Marilyn Monroe
and Eleanor Roosevelt in one.</i>

1080
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:05,329
<i>And I loved her.</i>

1081
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,033
<i>I only had one problem.</i>

1082
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:11,304
<i>I'd been playing the same damn part
for a year.</i>

1083
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,542
I'm so bored I can't see straight.

1084
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:16,669
I don't wanna play
this bastard anymore.

1085
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,476
I wanna go home.

1086
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,075
I wanna watch the Knicks on TV.

1087
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,385
I'd pay big money to see
"Hollywood Squares".

1088
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:32,856
I hate Alphonse Simms.

1089
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:38,199
Don't fade on me now.
These people believe in you.

1090
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:41,269
They believe in him, not me.

1091
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:44,796
Do you really wanna abandon
these people to Roberto?

1092
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,474
Sanctuary!

1093
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,649
Listen to my little friends.

1094
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,381
That one's François.

1095
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:05,553
And this one's Big Bertha.
She made me deaf.

1096
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:13,331
Were I not made of stone, like them?

1097
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:31,641
I used to think it was...

1098
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,051
the part, you know?

1099
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,352
Brando had the part
when he did "Streetcar".

1100
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:42,259
And De Niro had the part
when he did "Raging Bull".

1101
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:43,691
"Raging Bull".

1102
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,464
But I got the part.

1103
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,007
It's not enought.

1104
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,135
You know what I think?

1105
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,308
You're playing your best role.

1106
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:03,577
There's no audience to see it.

1107
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,081
I'm na actor.

1108
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:13,194
I'm just a goddamn actor.

1109
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:17,324
I forget to tell you. Another movie
company has come to Parador.

1110
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,990
You think everything is cast?

1111
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,277
Okay. Five-six all cameras.

1112
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:31,336
We've got 20 minutes of good light.
Let's go.

1113
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:35,343
Quiet, please!
This is a take! And roll it!

1114
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:36,873
132, take one!

1115
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,352
- Background action!
- Action, Liz!

1116
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:40,583
Energy!

1117
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,419
Are you Geoff?

1118
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:47,953
- No one else wants to be.
- I'm Liz.

1119
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,126
- What're you drinking?
- Got something dietetic?

1120
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:56,292
Yeah, water. They make
marvelous dry martinis here.

1121
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,344
Some friends of yours?

1122
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:05,676
I was going to ask you the same thing.

1123
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,286
- Cut! That was fine!
- First of all, I was freezing.

1124
01:28:11,321 --> 01:28:14,322
- Fine.
- Murray, that was good for me.

1125
01:28:14,357 --> 01:28:14,956
- That was good for me.
- I'd like to do it again.

1126
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:17,117
- That was good for me.
- I felt flat.

1127
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:18,883
My director, Edgar Low.

1128
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,430
- Very efficient.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

1129
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:25,991
- My leading actor.
- You're very good looking.

1130
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,626
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- My leading actress.

1131
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,807
- You're a marvelous actress.
- Thank you.

1132
01:28:32,842 --> 01:28:35,401
- Simply marvelous.
- Thank you.

1133
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:40,014
This is Clint Adler. He does
all our gunshots, explosives...

1134
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:45,884
<i>- and special effects...
- Congratulations. Very realistic.</i>

1135
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:49,457
- Thank you.
- Are you enjoying your stay in Parador?

1136
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:52,727
Yes, your Excellency.
You may not remember...

1137
01:28:52,762 --> 01:28:54,888
but I was here last year
on another film.

1138
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,996
You came to the set?
We shook hands?

1139
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:05,731
Yes, I do remember! It's so
very good to see you've returned.

1140
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,201
I love it here.
I'm going to stay for Carnival.

1141
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:13,280
You must! Carnival.
Spetaular.

1142
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:19,810
- Nice to see you again.
- Thank you, sir. I love it here.

1143
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,455
- Mr. President.
- Menachem, thank you.

1144
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,602
Did you see that?
Clint looked right in my eyes.

1145
01:29:34,637 --> 01:29:37,469
I waited for any glint of recognition.

1146
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:41,272
There's nothing!
I must be pretty good.

1147
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,972
They're doing "Streetcar"
at Lincoln Center. Son-of-a-bitch!

1148
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,175
I'd love to read for Mitch!

1149
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,062
Get him!

1150
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:49,729
Roberto...

1151
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:53,730
Assassin! Assassin!

1152
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:55,941
Roberto!

1153
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:59,169
- Assassin! Assassin!
- He's na actor!

1154
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,782
- Assassin!
- He's na actor!

1155
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,951
- Assassin!
- He's na actor!

1156
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:12,290
Assassin! Assassin!
Assassin! Assassin!

1157
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,356
Good-bye...

1158
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,926
my Madonna.

1159
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:29,266
Good-bye...

1160
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:33,106
my beloved Parador.

1161
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,357
Good-bye, my peop...

1162
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,236
Good-bye, my President.

1163
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:07,939
I hate actors.

1164
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:39,046
What a night! Is that amazing?

1165
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:41,983
- You were fabuilous! What a performance!
- I was terrible.

1166
01:33:42,018 --> 01:33:44,318
- It was great!
- I could have been better.

1167
01:33:44,353 --> 01:33:46,420
No, no. I was there.

1168
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:47,785
You're not a good judge.

1169
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,366
He's defrosting.

1170
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:05,705
This is lke Pappas
in Parador City.

1171
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:10,741
I'll tell you what I know right now,
as the situation's extremely confused.

1172
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:13,106
The President was shot as he...

1173
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,614
stood on the reviewing stand.

1174
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,942
The wounds were fatal.

1175
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,746
Roberto Strausmann,
Secretary of the Interior...

1176
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:23,948
and head of the police
was killed by the crowd.

1177
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,260
Dante Guzman, leader of the
revolutionary front...

1178
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,226
denied any involvement.

1179
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:32,058
Labor leaders called
for a general strike...

1180
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,155
tomorrow.

1181
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,699
Parador city is in chaos and mourning.

1182
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:39,774
Singer Sammy Davis, Jr.
was present.

1183
01:34:39,809 --> 01:34:40,672
Sammy, what happened?

1184
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:45,813
Well, lke, that was the scarriest
thing that I've ever saw.

1185
01:34:45,848 --> 01:34:48,983
I was side by side with
President when he died.

1186
01:34:49,018 --> 01:34:50,746
And I...

1187
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:57,256
<i>I just wanna give to
Parador people my solidarity...</i>

1188
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:02,163
Forgive me, lke.
There's...

1189
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:03,425
Thank you. Thank you, Sammy.

1190
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,632
Back to Nova York.
Ike Pappas, from Parador.

1191
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:37,865
Took a lot of balls, Clint.

1192
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,730
Special effects men are nuts.

1193
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:41,992
- Hurry.
- Move it, Jack.

1194
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:46,138
- Madonna, come with me.
- How can I?

1195
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:51,907
I'm going to miss you!
lpm gonna miss this moon.

1196
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:57,150
- I don't wanna go.
- Go. There's no time.

1197
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,152
Come on, Jack! Let's roll!

1198
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:01,712
Why do these feelings happen
when you leave?

1199
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:04,791
I love you.

1200
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:09,390
I love this place.
This has been the greatest time.

1201
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:14,668
- I'll never forget you.
- I love you, too. I'll call you.

1202
01:36:14,703 --> 01:36:17,505
You know how to get me in Nova York?
I've na answering machine.

1203
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:20,007
- I'll call your agent.
- I'm changing agents.

1204
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:23,204
- Why?
- The bastard hasn't called me in a year.

1205
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,511
I love you!

1206
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:36,950
- Jack! Let's roll!
- I love you!

1207
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:45,365
What a moment!
Right out of "Casablanca"!

1208
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:21,869
Fantastic!
It's right out of "Casablanca".

1209
01:37:21,904 --> 01:37:23,804
More like "Dynasty".

1210
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,601
The hardest thing I ever did.

1211
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,073
But I'll tell you something.

1212
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:31,267
It proves to me
how much I love acting.

1213
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:37,811
No matter what else happens
I'm never gonna have...

1214
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:39,741
that doubt, you know?

1215
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:42,081
That I should have
done something else.

1216
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:45,719
- Bravo.
- Mr. Allen? Mr. Papp can see you now.

1217
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:50,424
I'm sorry. I just don't buy it.

1218
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,162
But it's a great story.

1219
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:58,399
- It's a great story, Jack.
- Got a light?

1220
01:37:59,106 --> 01:37:59,731
Sure.

1221
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:02,036
<i>We now bring you a special report.</i>

1222
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,707
<i>Here's lke Pappas,
in Parador City.</i>

1223
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:07,781
<i>Two days of strikes and
protests have ended...</i>

1224
01:38:07,816 --> 01:38:11,552
<i>with the presiding council
fleeing the country...</i>

1225
01:38:11,587 --> 01:38:14,646
<i>and the revolutionary council
naming a new president.</i>

1226
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:18,224
<i>This has been a fairly
bloodless revolution.</i>

1227
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:22,123
<i>The President's body
is laying in the state.</i>

1228
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:25,461
<i>Thousands of mourners wait
to pay their respects.</i>

1229
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:44,311
<i>This ceremony has led
to this remarkable moment.</i>

1230
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,386
<i>Parador has a new leader...</i>

1231
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,583
<i>a woman with a chance
to change history.</i>

1232
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:54,556
<i>Madonna! Madonna!
Madonna! Madonna!</i>

1233
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,826
<i>My fellows Paradorians.</i>

1234
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:04,170
<i>I come here to dedicate myself...</i>

1235
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:07,238
<i>to the memory
of our beloved leader...</i>

1236
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:11,105
<i>whose dreams
we must keep alive.</i>

1237
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,207
<i>My first act is to
declare amnesty...</i>

1238
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,743
<i>for all political prisoners.</i>

1239
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:22,356
<i>Madonna! Madonna!
Madonna! Madonna!</i>

1240
01:39:22,391 --> 01:39:26,759
<i>We'll dream
the impossible dream.</i>

1241
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:37,435
- Mr. Noah, Mr. Papp will see you now.
- Thank you.

1242
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,567
Thank you so much.
