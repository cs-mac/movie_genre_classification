1
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,136
# And here's a hand, my trusty fiere

2
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,130
# And gie's a hand o' thine

3
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,016
# We'll tak' a cup o' kindness now

4
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,533
# For auld lang syne

5
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,539
Brothers, Sons of the Desert.

6
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,618
We are all familiar with the business of
this special meeting.

7
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,813
This oasis must meet the situation
with determination.

8
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,932
Oooh!

9
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,055
Thank you.

10
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,731
I repeat. This oasis must face
the situation with determination.

11
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,056
Every man must be accounted for.

12
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,459
Every man must do his part.
There must be no weaklings in our midst.

13
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,256
We must put our very hearts and souls
into this great undertaking.

14
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,853
There must be no thought of failure.
We must stand shoulder to shoulder.

15
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,254
We must work, we must sacrifice.

16
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,691
The weak must be helped by the strong.

17
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,130
For gentlemen, this, the oldest lodge
in the Great Order of the Sons of the Desert

18
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,290
must be represented 100%
at our annual convention in Chicago next week.

19
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,011
We will now take the oath.

20
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,695
And remember: once taken,
this oath has never been broken by any man,

21
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,020
down through the centuries of time,
in the history of this fraternal organisation.

22
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,213
If any member is doubtful of his strength
to keep this solemn pledge,

23
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,934
he will please be seated.

24
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,770
Get up!

25
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,611
- I don't want to...
- Shh!

26
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,698
Place yourself in position to receive the oath.

27
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,973
Do you all swear to be present
at our 87th annual convention in Chicago?

28
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,171
 I do!

29
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,376
Me, too.

30
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,417
Wholeheartedly unanimous.

31
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,817
# We are the Sons of the Desert

32
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,177
# Having the time of our lives

33
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,611
# Marching along 10,000 strong

34
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,017
# Ta ta, my sweetheart and wife,
God bless them

35
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,337
# Tramp, tramp, tramp
the boys are marching

36
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,737
# As a unit melody

37
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,820
# The Sons of the Desert are we.

38
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,572
- Why didn't you want to take the oath?
- I was afraid.

39
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,418
Afraid of what?

40
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,411
I was afraid that if I took the oath to go to the
convention, maybe my wife wouldn't let me go.

41
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,896
Of course she'll let you go.
Why, she'll have to let you go.

42
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,888
- You took an oath!
- I know. That's what I'm worrying about.

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,410
The Exhausted Ruler said that if you took an oath,

44
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,729
it would have to be broken for generations
of centuries of hundreds of years.

45
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,775
- My wife wouldn't...
- Do you have to ask your wife everything?

46
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,052
If I didn't ask her,
I wouldn't know what she wanted me to do.

47
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,693
- Hm!
- I didn't want...

48
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,293
I never realised that
such a deplorable condition existed in your home.

49
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,898
Why don't you pattern your life after mine?

50
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,059
<i>I go places and do things and then tell my wife.</i>

51
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,258
Every man should be the king in his own castle!

52
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,488
Now, buck up. Go in
and tell her that you're going to the convention.

53
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,931
Be a man. I'll see you in the morning.

54
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,092
- Good night.
-  Good night.

55
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,372
- Ollie, dear.
- Yes, sugar?

56
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,253
- Is Stanley with you?
- He just went in the house.

57
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,817
You'd better tell him that Betty went
duck-hunting and won't get back until late.

58
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,136
Alrighty.

59
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,210
<i>-  Oliver?
- Yes, baby?</i>

60
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,651
Please close the door.
There's an awful draught in here.

61
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,889
What do you want?

62
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,777
How did you get in there?

63
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,699
I was looking for Betty
and came in the back way. I thought...

64
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,778
Betty has gone duck-hunting
and won't be home until late.

65
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,211
- Oh. Well, good night.
- Good night.

66
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,091
What?

67
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,372
Do you realise that you have locked me out?

68
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,014
Why don't you ring the bell?
She'll let you in.

69
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,368
Don't get nervous. She'll be here in a minute.

70
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,253
Where do you think I live?

71
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,088
What do you think this is? Halloween?
Come in here, you bad boy.

72
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,813
Come on!

73
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,012
- What do you want?
- I've locked myself out.

74
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,572
- Oh, sugar?
- Yes?

75
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,171
Do you mind if Stanley
stays with us until Betty comes home?

76
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,417
- He's locked out.
- Oh, alright.

77
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,691
What are you eating?

78
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,770
- An apple.
- Where did you get it?

79
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,849
- In there.
- Why, that's not real fruit! It's imitation!

80
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,971
It's made of wax!

81
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,819
What has he been doing now?

82
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,739
He's been eating that phoney fruit.

83
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,614
<i>Oh, so that'swhere it's been going!
That's the third apple I've missed this week!</i>

84
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,735
- What's new, sugar?
- Oh, nothing much. What's new with you?

85
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,898
- Oh, nothing to speak of.
- Yes, there is.

86
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,091
You didn't tell her about going to the convention.

87
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,530
What convention?

88
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,892
That's right. I'm glad you reminded me.

89
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,852
The Sons of the Desert are giving
their annual convention in Chicago next week

90
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,698
and Stan and I are going.

91
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,210
- Oh, you are?
- We thought that the trip would do us good.

92
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,537
Besides being good for us in a business way.

93
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,530
You see, we'll meet new friends
and... see a lot of new faces

94
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,131
and the change of climate will be good for us
in a good many ways.

95
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,219
And besides, all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

96
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,217
Jack who?

97
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,212
I hope you have a nice time, dear.

98
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,218
- Thank you, sugar.
- Ha, Ha!

99
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,099
- What's that for?
- Just this: you are not going.

100
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,451
- What do you mean I'm not going?
- Just that!

101
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,448
You're not going to the convention.
You're going to the mountains with me.

102
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,419
But he can't go to the mountains.
He took an oath.

103
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,819
- The Exhausted Ruler said that...
- Now, listen, dodo! You keep out of this!

104
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,614
Wait a minute, sugar.
There's no use getting excited.

105
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,209
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

106
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,730
Certainly, life isn't short enough.

107
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,737
- Are you going?
- Huh?

108
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,377
- I said, ''Are you going?''
- Yes, sugar... Mrs Hardy.

109
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,333
- Who said so?
- Him.

110
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,577
Oh... Well, you can do as you please,

111
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,340
but you're going to the mountains with me!

112
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,735
Now, wait a minute! You listen to this.

113
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,411
I want this understood once and for all!

114
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,056
I'm not going to the convention,
I'm going to the mountains.

115
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,411
That's just what I said: that
you're not going to the mountains,

116
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,612
that you're going to the...
that you're going to the mountains!

117
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,290
- Why don't you compromise?
- What do you mean, ''compromise''?

118
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,138
- He means...
- Shut up!

119
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,013
If you think you're gallivanting off
with a lot of hoodlums,

120
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,337
to any convention whenever you want to...
Not for a minute, you're not!

121
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,374
Here I am, slaving day after day,
washing and ironing 'til my fingers bleed.

122
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,174
- Do you appreciate it? Do you?
- Well, you don't...

123
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,336
Oh, shut up! Don't talk back to me!

124
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,374
Just because I'm an unselfish, what does it
get me? Working for you and your interests!

125
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,219
I've planned a vacation for you
in the mountains, at a nice resort

126
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,854
where they play bridge
and have lectures on art.

127
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,574
I fight crowds in department stores,
dying of the heat,

128
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,092
killing myself trying to get
a nice mountain outfit together! Why? Why?!

129
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,655
- Why?
- You keep out of this!

130
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,613
I'll tell you why.
So you won't be ashamed of me.

131
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,732
And do you appreciate it? Do you? Ha, ha!

132
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,374
You want to run off to the convention.

133
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,538
Convention! You'll go to the convention
over my dead body.

134
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,379
I'll put you in jail first. And you, too!

135
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,812
With the rest of the Sons of the...
oh, the Sons of the Desert!

136
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,811
Ooohh!

137
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,898
Oh...

138
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,699
- What do you think?
- Oh, don't pay any attention to her.

139
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,131
She's only clowning. She'll snap out of it.

140
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,932
Ohh!

141
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,172
- Are you going to stand for that?
- You're darned right I won't stand for it.

142
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,896
I'm the boss in this house, and when I say
I'm going to the convention, I'm going...

143
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,691
- Oh, Lottie!
- Hello, Betty. Come on in.

144
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,734
- I didn't have very good luck. Here's a couple.
- Thanks, Betty.

145
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,456
- What's the matter, Lottie? You look worried.
- I just had a run-in with my barnacle.

146
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,333
- Stanley's in there, too.
- Oh...

147
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,850
And furthermore, you're making a big mistake.

148
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,373
What do you mean?

149
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,131
If you're not careful she'll get
the upper hand of you, mark my words.

150
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,935
The upper hand of me? Hm, impossible!

151
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,529
Alright, have it your own way.

152
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:23,088
I may not be king of my castle, but I certainly
wouldn't allow my wife to wear any pants.

153
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,613
I'd like to see my old woman
throwing things around.

154
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:33,213
It's disgraceful.
I never heard of such goings-off... on.

155
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,250
If my ball and chain ever talked to me...
If she even dared to raise her...

156
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,020
- Do you know what I would say?
- What?

157
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,534
I'd say... Hello, honey.

158
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,571
I...

159
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,971
Well, you think it over.
I'll see you in the morning.

160
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,732
Ooohh, ooohh...

161
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,256
There, now. There. That's better.

162
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,928
I wonder what could be the matter with me.

163
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,291
It looks to me like a severe nervous breakdown.

164
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,015
You've gone all to pieces!
And it happened so suddenly.

165
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,498
Probably that terrible argument
we had the other night caused it all.

166
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,009
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

167
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,576
- Where's Stanley?
- He's gone out.

168
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,340
Where did he go?

169
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,532
He didn't want me to tell you,
but he's awfully worried about you

170
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,935
and he thought you ought to have a doctor.

171
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,815
Why did you let him do that?
You know I don't like doctors.

172
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,730
Now, now. Don't get all upset.
I know what's good for you.

173
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,092
You're going to have a doctor,
and you're going to do just what the doctor says.

174
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,532
Alright, sweetheart. You always know what's best.

175
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,459
Uuhh! Uuhh!

176
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,290
Listen, darling. I'll get you some aspirin.
Oh, and I'll get you some more hot water.

177
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,576
Hey.

178
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,419
- Did you get the doctor?
- He'll be here in a few minutes.

179
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,410
Good. Did you fix it with him to tell me
that I have to go to Honolulu for my nerves?

180
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,698
- Our plan is working out great.
- It sure is. I've got it all fixed.

181
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,937
But why do you want to go to Honolulu?

182
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,609
Don't you understand
that this is only a subterfuge?

183
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,375
To throw the wives off the track
so that we can go to the convention.

184
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,412
Oh, then you're not going to the mountains?

185
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,850
Of course not.

186
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,937
We're supposed to go there
so that the wives will think that we...

187
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,293
Not you!

188
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,617
- Stan, did you get a doctor?
- Yes, ma'am. The best in town.

189
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,929
Oh, fine. Here, darling. Here's your aspirin.
Now, take your feet out.

190
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,890
There. Now try that.

191
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,019
Aaargh!

192
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,697
Oh, you poor dear! I'll get you some cold water.

193
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,539
- What are you doing?
- I've lost the aspirin. Can you move over a bit?

194
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,610
Move over a bit more, I can't find it.

195
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,136
Aargh!

196
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,539
Up, out you go!
Oh, you poor thing! Oh, my goodness!

197
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,892
- Oh, you poor darling.
- Get that thing out of there!

198
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,809
Come here, dear. Sit down there.

199
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,818
Why... Aargh!

200
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,455
Get me out of here!

201
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,458
 Oh, my boiled little sugar bunny!

202
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,851
I'm so sorry, darling. I'm so sorry.

203
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,972
Ooh!

204
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,659
Get that thing out of here!
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

205
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,416
- Oh, darling. You sit down.
- Alright.

206
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,374
I think I'd better go and get some dry clothes on.

207
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,969
Will you get out of my way?

208
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,489
You wax-eater!

209
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,818
Oh...

210
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,256
<i>You're perspiring. Maybe you have got a fever.</i>

211
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,498
I do feel hot.
You'd better take my temperature.

212
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,816
Get that thermometer.

213
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,808
- The what?
- Thermometer. You'll find it on the shelf.

214
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,538
Oh...

215
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,611
What does it say?

216
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,850
''Wet and windy.''

217
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,856
That's a barometer!

218
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,096
Why did you get a veterinarian?

219
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,416
I didn't think his religion
would make any difference.

220
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,536
This way, Doctor.

221
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,058
- This is Mr Hardy.
- Hello, Doctor.

222
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,457
Doctor, I'm so glad you're here.
My husband's been suffering terribly.

223
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,696
What seems to be the trouble?

224
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,289
I think he's suffering from a nervous shakedown.

225
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,536
Oh.

226
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,857
O-ho...

227
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,857
Aha...

228
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,617
Aha...

229
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,452
My, my, my...

230
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,256
<i>- What is it, Doctor?
- It looks like a bad case of canis deliris.</i>

231
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,974
- As bad as that?
- Even worse.

232
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,331
<i>It might be double canis deliris.</i>

233
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,568
- If it's that bad, you should give him something.
- Oh, Doctor! You must give him something.

234
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,773
Now there, darling, you be quiet.
Oh, my poor little lambkin.

235
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,450
He's going to be alright. Yes, he is.

236
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,858
Sit up, sit up.

237
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,490
Open up your mouth.

238
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,533
There, darling. Everything is going to be alright.

239
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,652
- Do you think I'd better put him to bed?
- No, no.

240
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,093
What he really needs is a long ocean voyage
with plenty of tropical air and sun.

241
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,213
I suggest a trip to... a trip to...

242
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,574
..Honolulu.

243
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,453
But Doctor, wouldn't the mountains do as well?

244
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,697
I'm a very bad sailor and I can't stand the water.

245
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,619
No. I'm sorry, Mrs Hardy.

246
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,257
A voyage to Honolulu
is the only cure for your husband.

247
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,372
I won't go to Honolulu.

248
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,731
If you can't go, sugar,
I'lljust stay at home and suffer.

249
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,455
You'll do nothing of the kind.
If the doctor says you must go to Honolulu,

250
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,730
you'll do just as the doctor says.

251
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,809
But I can't go to Honolulu alone.
I've got to have someone to take care of me.

252
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,092
Maybe Stanley will be kind enough to go with you.

253
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,373
Well, I never thought of that.
Will you go, Stanley?

254
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,969
- Where?
- To Honolulu!

255
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,648
- I can't go to Honolulu.
- Why?

256
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,578
I'm going to the convention.

257
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,010
What do you mean you're going to the convention?

258
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,769
I forgot to tell you.
I asked Betty and she said that I could go.

259
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,540
That settles it. I'm not going to Honolulu.

260
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,177
Oh, yes, you are. You're going to Honolulu
if you have to go alone!

261
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,579
If I have to go to Honolulu alone,
he's going with me!

262
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,492
Hey! Kitty, kitty, kitty!
Boo, boo, boo, boo!

263
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,651
Hey! Isn't she a ''Dob''?

264
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,295
- Texas 97!
- Texas 93!

265
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,015
<i>-  New York 43!
-  Washington 27!</i>

266
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,218
Texas 97!

267
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,777
Hey! Oh, no, no, no...
That's still going to go on the floor.

268
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,770
- Well, well, well... California, eh?
- 19.

269
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,973
Hey, I bet you don't grow flowers there
that smell like this.

270
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,412
That's a ''Dob'', isn't it, boy?

271
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,972
Can you take it?
Say, boys, come on!

272
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,853
Come over to my table and have a drink.

273
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,815
Oh boy, oh boy! Right, sit down.

274
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,098
Sit down!

275
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,812
Hey, waiter! A bottle of champagne!

276
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,576
Oh, boy! Ha, ha, ha!

277
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,498
Have a cigarette.

278
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,496
Have a cigarette.

279
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,774
You guys are killing me!

280
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,175
Great gag, huh? Great gag.

281
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,573
# Down on a South Sea island

282
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,419
# Underneath the beauty of the stars

283
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,172
# I strayed upon some maidens
who were strumming on their guitars

284
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,852
# A hula maid was dancing
and I knew I'd found my paradise

285
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,770
# So this is what I told her
as I gazed into her eyes

286
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,418
# Honolulu Baby
where did you get those eyes

287
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,853
# And the dark complexion
I just idolise?

288
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,612
# Honolulu baby
where did you get that style

289
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:01,339
# And those pretty red lips
and that sunny smile?

290
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,259
# When you start to dance
your hula hooping dance

291
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,974
# Then you shake it up and down

292
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,569
# You shake a little here
you shake a little there

293
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,736
# When you've got the boys going to town

294
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,458
# Honolulu Baby
you know your stuff

295
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,814
# Honolulu Baby
gonna call your bluff

296
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,051
# Di, di, di...

297
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,494
You see? We're killing two birds with one stone.

298
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,932
We're seeing as much here
as we could've seen in Honolulu.

299
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,018
Hey, what's the laugh? I don't get it.

300
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,176
Shall we tell him?

301
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,293
Our wives think that
we're in Honolulu for my health.

302
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,060
You're pulling a fast one, huh?

303
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,609
<i> Oh, boy!</i>

304
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,689
What did I tell you?
We've been to the convention, had a swell time,

305
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,736
we're going home in the morning
and nobody's any the wiser.

306
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,659
By the way, what part of California
are you fellows from?

307
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,976
Los Angeles.

308
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,253
Los Angeles? What a small world,
what a small world!

309
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,337
I've got a sister who lives out there.

310
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,897
No kidding. I haven't laid eyes on her
since I got out of reform school!

311
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,214
I've got a great idea for a gag. Know what I'll do?

312
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:24,175
I'm going to call her up long-distance and
disguise my voice so she won't know who it is!

313
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,416
Oh, that's a ''Dob''!

314
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,533
Hey, waiter! Another bottle of bubble water.
I'll be right back!

315
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,215
Hello? Hello?

316
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,332
- Here's your long-distance call.
- Oh, swell!

317
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,059
Hello? Hello? Hello?

318
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,491
I'll bet you can't guess who this is!

319
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,930
Alright, who is it?

320
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,051
It's your little brother Charlie.

321
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,491
Well, for goodness' sake!
It's my brother Charlie.

322
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,213
Where are you?

323
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,095
I'm in Chicago.
They're throwing a convention for me.

324
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:15,459
Well, fancy hearing from you after all these years.
I haven't seen you since you sang in the choir.

325
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,415
And you used to pump the organ, remember?
You little organ pumper, you!

326
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,329
Listen, I want you to talk to a fellow
from Los Angeles. A swell guy.

327
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,496
Wait a minute. Here, go ahead.

328
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,496
Hello? So this is Charlie's sweet little sister.

329
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,934
I feel just like I know you.

330
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,093
Charlie tells me you're from Los Angeles.
What part?

331
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,370
All of me!

332
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,094
What did she say?

333
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,053
She asked me if I was from Los Angeles
and I said, ''Yes''.

334
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,457
Then she said, ''What part?''
and I said, ''All of me!''

335
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,254
Wasn't that a ''Dob''?

336
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,329
You little jokester.
When you get back to town, drop in and see me.

337
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,337
I'd just love to have you meet my husband.

338
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,532
I sure will! What's the address?

339
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,058
Write this down.

340
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,254
2-2-2-2 Fairview Avenue.

341
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,650
2-2...

342
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,730
Eh... Goodbye, sugar.

343
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,850
- What did you hang up for?
- We had a bad connection.

344
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,416
- But isn't she a swell gal?
- She sure is.

345
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,692
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter, Lottie?

346
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,371
If I didn't know that Oliver was in Honolulu,
I'd swear that was him on the phone.

347
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,813
They're in Honolulu, alright.
But Stanley wouldn't dare lie to me.

348
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,212
I'd hate to think what would happen
if he ever did.

349
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,173
Let these fellows have a chance. Come on!

350
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,379
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

351
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,094
- Jack, how are you?
- Glad to see you.

352
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,655
- Am I glad to see you!
- Aahh!

353
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,212
Do you know that's my wife?

354
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,899
Texas 97!

355
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,136
New York 43!

356
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,450
New York 47!

357
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,179
<i> Extra paper!
Get your evening paper!</i>

358
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,655
<i>Honolulu liner sinking! Extra!</i>

359
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,300
Lottie, Lottie! Look!

360
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,970
I just read it. What are we going to do?

361
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,855
I'll telephone the steamship company
and ask if they've got a list of survivors.

362
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,450
No! No, we go down there.
Go on, get your hat!

363
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,696
Alright, I'll meet you outside.

364
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,059
 Quiet, please!
Mr Ruthbert has a radiogram he wishes to read.

365
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,093
This is the latest wireless report.

366
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,768
''Honolulu Steamship Company, Los Angeles.''

367
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,815
''The survivors of the ill-fated liner
have been transferred to the rescue ship.''

368
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,935
''A list of the casualties will be made known
as soon as a complete check-up is made.''

369
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:43,737
''Expect to arrive in port in 36 hours.''
Signed, Captain John Zilo.

370
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,219
Oh, Betty. I do hope the boys are safe.
The suspense is just killing me!

371
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,059
Have courage, Lottie.
Let's not think of the worst.

372
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,219
Well, I try not to, but...
I'm so worried about Oliver.

373
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,059
You know how unselfish he always was.

374
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,855
He wouldn't leave that ship
until everybody was saved.

375
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,370
Well, if they're safe,
Oliver certainly deserves a medal.

376
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,653
- You know, Stanley can't swim a stroke.
- Oh, I never thought of that!

377
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,210
Here you are, old man. Just keep the change.

378
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,816
 # Honolulu Baby

379
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,817
# Where did you get those eyes

380
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,979
# And your dark complexion
that I idolise?

381
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,014
# Honolulu Baby

# and your dark complexion that I idolise?

385
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,170
Maybe they're in Betty's house.

386
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,129
 # Honolulu Baby

387

391
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,731

392
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,330
Aloha! Baby's here!

393
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,929
Aloha! Baby's here!

394
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,096
Aloha!

395
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,690
Get that thing out of the way!

396
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,050
Aloha!

397
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,931
 Aloha!

398
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,536
Baby's home, sugar!

399
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,529
Get out of my way!

400
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,377
Aahh!

401
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,736
- I wonder where she is.
- Maybe she went out.

402
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:49,593
I know she went out,
but what I'd like to know is where did she went!

403
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:54,984
- Maybe she went to the mountains with Betty.
- That's probably just where she is.

404
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:56,979
She makes me sick!

405
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,561
She knew we were coming today.
Why did she go to the mountains?

406
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,989
Well, if she didn't go to the mountains,
Mohammed would have to come here.

407
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:12,091
What has Mohammed got to do with my wife?

408
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:16,514
 ''Notes from the clubs''.

409
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:18,547
- Ooohh!
- What's the matter?

410
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:21,739
''Honolulu liner sinking.
Foundering in typhoon.''

411
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:25,530
''Passengers and crew on SS Muana

412
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:30,000
''Sister ship Leuana reaches
scene of disaster in 90 mile gale.''

413
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,104
''Rescue ship due back
in Los Angeles harbour tomorrow.''

414
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:34,582
- Oh...
- Oh!

415
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:38,734
Can you beat that?
I'm sure glad we didn't go.

416
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,568
If we had...

417
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,476
Ooohh! What are we going to do?

418
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:45,711
We've got to get out of here.
We'll spend the night in a hotel.

419
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:48,500
Put that paper down and let's go!

420
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:50,372
Get that!

421
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:55,480
Pick that up so they won't know
that we've been here.

422
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,421
-  Betty, let me...
-  No, I'll pay.

423
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:01,379
Take everything!

424
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,975
 Aaahhh!

425
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:09,440
We'll hide. No, not there! Get up!

426
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,939
- Come on, get...
- Ooohh!

427
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:20,561
Oh! Get...

428
00:43:24,683 --> 00:43:29,232
- Betty, did you hear that?
- I certainly did.

429
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:40,713
There's no one in there.

430
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:46,586
Betty, I could have sworn
I heard that door close.

431
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:50,470
It's probably our imagination.
We're both so nervous and upset.

432
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:54,304
Oh, Betty! Do you really think that they're safe?

433
00:43:54,514 --> 00:43:58,222
Don't worry, dear. Let's think for the best.

434
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:00,185
Oh...

435
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,424
Alright. Ooh!

436
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:06,861
I have the strangest feeling. I...

437
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,786
I feel as if they were hovering right over me!

438
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:14,298
Don't talk that way! You give me the jitters!

439
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,306
I'm just going all to pieces!

440
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:22,660
- If you're going to act that way, I'm going.
- Don't leave me, Betty! Don't leave me here!

441
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:25,255
We've got to
face this situation with determination.

442
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:28,616
 I know, I'm doing the best I can.

443
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:31,463
- Do you think they saw us?
- Of course not!

444
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:38,056
If they had, they'd be up here. To catch a Hardy
they have to get up very early in the morning.

445
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:41,571
- What time?
- About half past... What time!

446
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,731
Shh!

447
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,453
Be careful! Do you want them to hear us?

448
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:51,653
How are we going to get to a hotel?

449
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:55,814
Simple. We'll go down through Betty's house.

450
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:03,371
Locked.

451
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:07,613
- It looks like we're here for the night.
- We can't sit up here all night.

452
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:09,849
We are not going to sit up all night.

453
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:15,046
We'll fix ourselves a nice bed and
be just as comfortable as two peas in a pod.

454
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:17,729
Ooh!

455
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:19,522
Oh...

456
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,361
Give me a hand with the spring.

457
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,448
- Shh!
- Don't shush me!

458
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,320
- Shh!
- Shh!

459
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:52,991
Hold this while I get some rope.

460
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:06,588
Don't sit there looking at me. Do something
to help me! Get me some rope.

461
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:10,755
- What are you going to do with it?
- None of your business. Do as I tell you!

462
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:15,187
- Shh!
- It serves you right!

463
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:01,817
No, Betty. Now I wish
I'd let him go to the convention.

464
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:06,936
He could be having such a good time
instead of being in that awful shipwreck.

465
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,135
It's all my fault!

466
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:15,774
Don't worry, Lottie.
Maybe they're not as bad off as we think.

467
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:20,573
Oh, Betty. If I could only see him once more.

468
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,003
I can't believe it!

469
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,407
Just wait 'til you get back home,
you inflated tadpole.

470
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,601
- Sit down!
- Shut up!

471
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:54,005
- Lottie!
- So Stan wouldn't dare lie to you?

472
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,960
 Don't you worry about it.

473
00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:14,832
- Can you imagine them going to that convention?
- I don't mind that so much.

474
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:19,556
It's the idea of them making a sucker out of me.
That's what burns me up.

475
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,193
- Sit down, Lottie. You make me nervous.
- Oh, shut up!

476
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,152
Stanley wouldn't dare lie to you...
Ha, ha, ha!

477
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,033
It's the first time he ever did,
and if it wasn't for your husband's bad influence

478
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:31,989
this wouldn't have happened.

479
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:34,152
Oh, is that so?

480
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:37,665
Are you trying to infer
that my husband alone was the cause of this?

481
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:42,152
- I certainly am.
- That wax-eater of yours is no different.

482
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:44,469
He had just as much
to do with it as my Oliver did.

483
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:48,142
I admit that he lied,
but there is one thing that I do know.

484
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:53,220
When he gets back home and I ask him,
he'll confess and tell me everything.

485
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,866
- Ha, ha, ha.
- That's more than that blimp of yours will do.

486
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:03,256
<i>Just wait 'til I get back home
and I'll show youwho the truthful one is.</i>

487
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:06,664
- I'll show you that my Oliver is upright.
- Oh, skip it.

488
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:10,905
There you are. Fit for a king!

489
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:13,778
We'll have a good night's sleep,
go down in the morning,

490
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:19,058
tell them about the shipwreck,
and nobody will be any the wiser.

491
00:49:19,263 --> 00:49:21,572
- I've got to hand it to you.
- For what?

492
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:27,458
For the meticulous care with which you have
executed your finely formulated machinations

493
00:49:27,662 --> 00:49:31,336
in extricating us from this devastating dilemma.

494
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:37,733
Then, on the other hand...

495
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:40,007
- Get in bed.
- Huh?

496
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:45,167
''Meticulous''...

497
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:50,570
Now hold it for me.

498
00:49:56,253 --> 00:49:59,528
- Now, isn't this nice?
- It sure is.

499
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:02,087
We're just like two peas in a pot.

500
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,286
Not ''pot''. ''Pod''.

501
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:10,847
Po-d!

502
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:20,878
Po-d.

503
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:26,353
Good night, I'll run along.
If they come here first, give me a call.

504
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,520
<i>I'm dyingto hear Oliver's story.</i>

505
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:40,399
- Oh, Betty! What was that?
- I'll find out.

506
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,875
 Wait!

507
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,191
They are probably asleep and didn't hear it.

508
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:51,350
We sure were lucky.

509
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,906
Oh, Betty! Do be careful.
It might be a burglar.

510
00:50:56,117 --> 00:51:00,075
Don't worry about me. I've got my gun
and I've never missed yet.

511
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:03,232
- Ohh!
- Quick! Let's get on the roof! Come on!

512
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:40,060
There's something very strange going on.

513
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,097
- I'll call the police.
- That's a fine idea.

514
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:52,453
- Now what are we going to do?
- What do you think?

515
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:55,777
I'm not going to sit here all night
and catch pneumonia.

516
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,973
We'll ride down the drainpipe, put our clothes on
in the garage and go to a hotel.

517
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:03,817
You can do what you like,
but I'm going home.

518
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:07,646
- What are you going to tell Betty?
- I'll tell her everything.

519
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:10,290
- So, you're turning yellow.
- Huh?

520
00:52:10,496 --> 00:52:12,725
You're yellow.

521
00:52:16,054 --> 00:52:19,524
- It must be the lightning.
- You little double-crosser!

522
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,803
If you go downstairs and spill the beans,

523
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:25,368
I'll tell Betty
that I caught you smoking a cigarette.

524
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:29,688
Alright, go ahead and tell her.
What do you think..?

525
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,405
- Would you tell her that?
- I certainly would.

526
00:52:35,649 --> 00:52:37,798
- Would you?
- I would.

527
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:45,997
You know what we'll do? We'll climb down the
garage and change our clothes in the drainpipe.

528
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:52,154
Then we'll go to a hotel and we'll be
just as comfortable as two peas in a po-d.

529
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:57,073
Go on. Get down. Go on.

530
00:52:57,283 --> 00:52:59,318
You'll have me catching ammonia...
pneumonia!

531
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:19,752
Spread your legs!

532
00:53:29,153 --> 00:53:35,148
- Why did you tell me to spread my legs?
- I didn't want you to get your feet wet.

533
00:53:35,352 --> 00:53:37,467
Help me get out of here!

534
00:53:49,668 --> 00:53:51,737
Don't tell him anything.

535
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:54,665
-  What's going on here?
- Nothing, Officer.

536
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:57,175
- Where do you live?
- I'd rather not say.

537
00:53:57,386 --> 00:53:59,899
- So you don't want to talk?
- Well, it's just...

538
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,617
- Where do you live?
- Huh?

539
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:05,180
- Where do you live?
- Next door to him.

540
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,897
- Where does he live?
- In there.

541
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,252
Quit your kidding! Where does he live?

542
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:13,294
I'm not kidding! If you don't believe me,
go in and ask them.

543
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,456
Such a good idea! Come on!

544
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,452
Come on! Get going! Hurry up!

545
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:22,610
-  Is this the house?
- Yes, sir.

546
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:28,290
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

547
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,010
What do we tell them?

548
00:54:30,217 --> 00:54:33,731
- You think up your story, I've got mine.
- I can't think of any.

549
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,846
Hey, here they are now! Where's that gun?

550
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:39,604
Wait a minute, calm yourself!
Let's hear their story first.

551
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:44,329
Don't forget, you and I have a little argument
to settle. After that, you can do as you please.

552
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:47,000
Alright, I'll show you.

553
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:51,443
 Thank you, Officer.

554
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:54,528
Oh, Oliver! What's happened,
where are your clothes?

555
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:58,119
- Wait 'til I get my second wind.
-  Stanley, whatever happened?

556
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:01,001
You tell your story, Ollie.

557
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,995
On our way back from Honolulu
we were in a terrible shipwreck.

558
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:07,402
You see. If you'd let me go to the convention,

559
00:55:07,606 --> 00:55:09,755
I wouldn't have gone through
this horrible experience.

560
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:13,196
Oh, tell us all about it, please!

561
00:55:13,404 --> 00:55:15,156
Alright, alright.

562
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:20,676
We were sailing along in clear weather
when all of a sudden a terrible storm came up.

563
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:24,841
- Didn't it, Stanley?
- Yeah, and then we floundered in a typhoid.

564
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:29,158
Not ''typhoid''. He means ''typhoon'', sugar.

565
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,954
The ship started to sink
and we both dived overboard.

566
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:37,071
- Didn't we, Stanley?
- Just as the boat went down for the third time.

567
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:42,476
- And here we are.
- Aren't you glad we got back home safe?

568
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,473
Well, what's new, sugar?

569
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:48,826
Well, the rescue ship with the survivors
doesn't get in until tomorrow.

570
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:50,945
- The rescue...
- Oh.

571
00:55:51,154 --> 00:55:56,510
- It must have got there after we left.
- Yes, it must have got there after we left.

572
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,304
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

573
00:55:58,512 --> 00:56:00,582
Well, how did you get here?

574
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:05,508
- Why... Err...
- Oh, we ship-hiked.

575
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,666
That's right, we...

576
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,188
We ship-hiked.

577
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:12,460
- Ship-hiked?
- Yes, we thumbed our way.

578
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:14,545
What do you mean, thumbed your way?

579
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:18,978
Well... Stan and I would be swimming along,
we'd see a boat coming our way,

580
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:21,575
we'd go like that, and they'd pick us up.

581
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,138
- Wouldn't they?
- Yeah.

582
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:26,416
- That is, if they were going our way.
- Certainly.

583
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:30,173
You see, Betty? He's no different from the rest!

584
00:56:30,383 --> 00:56:33,215
They're both like two peas in a pod.

585
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:36,136
- Po-d.
- Shut up!

586
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:40,299
- Have you anything else to say?
- Why, no.

587
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,289
That's all there is. There isn't any more.
Is there, Stanley?

588
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:49,537
No, that's our story and we're stuck with it...
in it.

589
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:55,848
- Oliver.
- What, sugar?

590
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:02,729
Oliver, I want you to be big.
Bigger than you've ever been before.

591
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:06,565
Are you telling me the truth?

592
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:09,526
What do you mean, am I telling you the truth?

593
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:17,318
Do you think a story like that could come from
my mind if it wasn't the truth? It's ridiculous!

594
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,166
- It's absurd!
- It's the silliest thing I've ever heard.

595
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:25,838
Well, it certainly is.
It's too far-fetched not to be the truth.

596
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:28,766
- Isn't it, Stanley?
- It's imposterous.

597
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:36,400
- Stanley?
- What?

598
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:39,276
Stanley?

599
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:48,159
Honest confession is good for the soul.
Is Oliver telling the truth?

600
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,754
Go ahead and tell her.

601
00:58:04,557 --> 00:58:06,274
Is he?

602
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:11,666
No! We went to the convention.
We didn't go to Honolulu at all!

603
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:15,105
He told me to tell you
we were sinking in that shipwreck.

604
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:18,544
We were up on the roof.

605
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:21,903
We slept in the attic.

606
00:58:23,072 --> 00:58:26,347
Come on, Stanley.

607
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,622
Come on, Stanley.

608
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:14,371
How about you and me going to the mountains?

609
00:59:27,774 --> 00:59:29,843
You're not moving out tonight are you, sugar?

610
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:37,329
Why don't you wait 'til tomorrow morning
so that we can talk it over?

611
01:00:04,123 --> 01:00:07,876
See, Stanley? Honesty is the best policy.

612
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:40,390
Help, help, help!

613
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:45,268
 I'll show you, you Son of the Desert.
Go to a convention, will you? Ha, ha!

614
01:01:05,426 --> 01:01:07,178
Come in.

615
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:17,938
- What did she say?
- Never mind what she said. What did Betty say?

616
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:21,452
Betty said that honesty was the best politics.

617
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:27,534
Look.

618
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:37,933
# Honolulu Baby
won't you close those eyes...
