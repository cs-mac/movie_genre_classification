00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:36,863
<i>What?
Just straight up.</i>

613
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:37,896
<i>S.A.T. Question.</i>

614
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:42,568
<i>Um, white people
are to loving their daughters.</i>

615
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:47,040
<i>As Asian people are to...</i>

616
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,008
<i>Um... I don't know.</i>

617
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,077
<i>Blank their daughters.</i>

618
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,480
<i>White people love... daughters.</i>

619
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:58,251
<i>When Asian people
have daughters, they...</i>

620
00:27:58,284 --> 00:27:59,686
<i>Can only have one?</i>

621
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,921
<i>They kill them.
They bury them alive.</i>

622
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,389
<i>So that they can have a boy.</i>

623
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:05,158
<i>Look, look, oh, my god.
Please be careful.</i>

624
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:06,693
<i>Hey, my cell phone's
not working right now.</i>

625
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,429
<i>Can you take a look at it
and see what's wrong with it?</i>

626
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:10,930
<i>No!</i>

627
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:12,832
<i>Can I take this tape off now?</i>

628
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,101
<i>Do you think you're...
are you going to open your eyes?</i>

629
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:16,134
<i>Yes.</i>

630
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,438
<i>I think that's super unsafe.</i>

631
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:20,807
<i>I feel like it's not really
helping that much, but...</i>

632
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:23,676
<i>Ohh!
That hurt?</i>

633
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,011
<i>When you came
to this country, like...</i>

634
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,613
<i>I was born in this country, ok?
Fuck you.</i>

635
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:30,783
<i>Oh, ok. By that,
so when do you...</i>

636
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:31,816
<i>So who ordered you?</i>

637
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:33,786
<i>Is there some sort
of crate situation?</i>

638
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:34,686
<i>No, there's no crate situation!</i>

639
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,289
<i>I'm more American
than you are, Jew.</i>

640
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,224
<i>First of all,
that's uncalled for.</i>

641
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:40,526
<i>You're uncalled for.</i>

642
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,660
<i>Oh, that's a dog.
There's a dog right up there.</i>

643
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:43,563
<i>You want to pull over and get
it? You want to grab it?</i>

644
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,996
<i>We'll fry it up for later, dude.
We'll fry it up for later.</i>

645
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:48,368
<i>Dude, that's a giant one.
That's a German shepherd, bro.</i>

646
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:50,069
<i>Pull over, we'll just get this.</i>

647
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:51,223
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

648
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:53,573
<i>Fuck it! It's gone now.</i>

649
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,727
<i>This is fucking ridiculous.</i>

650
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,142
<i>I can't believe I paid
money for this class.</i>

651
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:57,777
<i>Listen, listen, I don't...</i>

652
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,970
<i>Some ugly ass old white guy.</i>

653
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:01,314
<i>I don't... I want this
to end well, ok?</i>

654
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:03,916
<i>I want everyone to be happy.
I want it to end happy.</i>

655
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,618
<i>- I just want a happy ending.
- Shut the fuck up.</i>

656
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:07,787
<i>And if I can just get
that happy ending,</i>

657
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,422
<i>- That would be...
- What happy ending?</i>

658
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,224
<i>- $20 worth...
- Are you fucking serious?!</i>

659
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:14,160
<i>Oh, money! No! Oh, my god!</i>

660
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:16,062
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

661
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,164
<i>I've been a little hard on you.</i>

662
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:20,299
<i>And I so sorry.
I so, so sorry.</i>

663
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:23,002
<i>Really? Really?</i>

664
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,304
<i>[LAUGHS]</i>

665
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:28,007
<i>You probably don't
even have a dick.</i>

666
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,343
<i>Do you watch child pornography?</i>

667
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:33,179
<i>You look like a pervert. You
look like a fucking pervert.</i>

668
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:36,449
<i>You are getting me
so horny right now.</i>

669
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,817
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

670
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:40,686
<i>I thought you were
supposed to be my teacher.</i>

671
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,789
<i>I can barely see you. Is this
what it's like to be you?</i>

672
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,091
<i>How do you get through life
like this, man?</i>

673
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:47,026
<i>This is crazy.
I so sorry.</i>

674
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,059
<i>I so sorry.</i>

675
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:50,263
<i>How does this help me drive?
I so sorry.</i>

676
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:51,998
<i>Just calm down, it's...</i>

677
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:54,100
<i>Ok, listen,
this is going to seem weird,</i>

678
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,035
<i>But I just want to know.</i>

679
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,304
<i>Is your pussy
like slanted, or...</i>

680
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:02,409
<i>Oww!
Shut the fuck up!</i>

681
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,311
<i>Just... no hitting!</i>

682
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,880
<i>And if you're going to hit,
use proper form.</i>

683
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:11,651
<i>It's a karate chop,
and you say hyah.</i>

684
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,724
<i>You didn't say hyah. Oww!</i>

685
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:22,228
<i>What kind of karate
do you know?</i>

686
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,030
<i>Um...</i>

687
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,064
<i>What happens if I would
strike you? What would happen?</i>

688
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:27,233
<i>I'm not going to. Hyah!</i>

689
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,836
<i>[LAUGHS] Karate!</i>

690
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:30,835
<i>Are you sure this is...</i>

691
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:32,305
<i>All right, Hong Kong fooey,</i>

692
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:33,338
<i>Just please be careful.</i>

693
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,841
<i>You're going to fail.
You're going to fail.</i>

694
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,343
<i>'Cause I'm going to
sue your fucking ass.</i>

695
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:38,878
<i>You're not going to sue me.
Yes, I am.</i>

696
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,246
<i>No, you're not.
Yes, I am.</i>

697
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,414
<i>What are you going
to sue me for?</i>

698
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:42,882
<i>I'm going to sue you
for sexual harassment.</i>

699
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,817
<i>Oh, it wasn't harassment
if you were asking for it.</i>

700
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,252
<i>I was not asking for it!
You're fucking crazy!</i>

701
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:48,087
<i>Oh, yeah, sitting there
looking all Asian.</i>

702
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,555
<i>And of course I'm not
going to want to fuck?</i>

703
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,891
<i>Fucking asshole! Just because you
can't get anything? Oh, my god!</i>

704
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:53,259
<i>Of course I'm going
to want to fuck.</i>

705
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,728
<i>Careful, careful,
careful, careful!</i>

706
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:57,763
<i>Sorry, Asian driver,
Asian driver.</i>

707
00:30:57,796 --> 00:31:01,033
<i>They're really terrible
at driving. And lovemaking.</i>

708
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,902
<i>Dude, what is
your problem, man?</i>

709
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:04,175
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry to get on you.</i>

710
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:06,539
<i>But it's important that you
learn how to drive safely.</i>

711
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:07,940
<i>It's the only reason
I'm hard on you.</i>

712
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:09,742
<i>Because you need to learn
how to deliver food on time,</i>

713
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:12,245
<i>Otherwise people like me
are angry.</i>

714
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,113
<i>That it's past 40 minutes.</i>

715
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:17,750
<i>Dude, that's not even Chinese
food, that's domino's.</i>

716
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:18,783
<i>So fucking ridiculous!</i>

717
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,052
<i>All right, then $40!
Would $40 do it?</i>

718
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,520
<i>$20, $40, what the fuck
do you think I am?!</i>

719
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,856
<i>First of all, you already broke that 10.
You're eating half of that.</i>

720
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:25,625
<i>That... oh, my god, you are
the cheapest fucking...</i>

721
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:28,427
<i>I'm not cheap, I'm not going to
waste money getting a hand job.</i>

722
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,196
<i>When I can go to some other
place and get one for cheaper!</i>

723
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:34,400
<i>Oh, my god. You couldn't get a hand
job if someone fucking paid you.</i>

724
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,202
<i>Your own hand doesn't
even want to give you.</i>

725
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:37,503
<i>A fucking hand job, you creep.</i>

726
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:40,439
<i>I'm done with this. I'm through with this.
You're an asshole!</i>

727
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:43,209
<i>Watch out!
Somebody's going to hit you!</i>

728
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:45,745
<i>Fuck you!</i>

729
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:48,314
<i>Ok, I cut off
for cutting people off,</i>

730
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:51,284
<i>Didn't look before turning,</i>

731
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,752
<i>Being a filthy Asian,</i>

732
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,455
<i>Cannot pronounce his Is,
that's minus 7.</i>

733
00:31:56,488 --> 00:31:58,157
<i>41%.
Hey, asshole,</i>

734
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,271
<i>One more thing...
fuck you.</i>

735
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,960
<i>Yeah, that's right,
you better be scared.</i>

736
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:04,263
<i>I'll fucking karate punch
you in the face. Asshole.</i>

737
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,464
<i>Oh, my.</i>

738
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:08,000
<i>That's going to be a 41,
for the attitude,</i>

739
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,803
<i>I'm taking it down to a 38%.</i>

740
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:13,105
<i>38%.</i>

741
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:14,240
<i>Fuck this.
Fuck this.</i>

742
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,575
<i>Don't pull over!
We're in the... we're...</i>

743
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:17,843
<i>We're driving now. You are
so fucking ridiculous.</i>

744
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:20,112
<i>So is it... is it horizontal...</i>

745
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:22,081
<i>Ow, fuck! Ow! Fuck!</i>

746
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,317
<i>Asians fighting back!
Please! Ow! Ow!</i>

747
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,286
<i>Get out of the fucking car!
Get back to your country.</i>

748
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,189
<i>Fuck you!</i>

749
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:34,694
<i>Oh... my... god.</i>

750
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:53,012
<i>Well, they love their job.
They're great sitters.</i>

751
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:54,213
<i>I know. [CHUCKLES]</i>

752
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:57,283
<i>All right, sir, you, too.
All right, bye.</i>

753
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,385
<i>Hi. How can I help you?</i>

754
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:00,418
<i>Hi, I'm just looking.</i>

755
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,689
<i>Well, welcome. We are new in town.
New to Beverly Hills.</i>

756
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:06,792
<i>And we obviously offer
everything baby-Related.</i>

757
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:10,229
<i>Stuffed animals, blocks,
goobery gadgets.</i>

758

sign our petition?</i>

1209
00:50:14,285 --> 00:50:15,685
<i>We're just trying
to get some, uh,</i>

jerk, you know that?</i>

<i>Well, doctor, I just, you know,</i>

<i>Find that I'm having trouble.</i>

1321

<i>Opening up in my relationships,</i>

1322
00:53:44,128 --> 00:53:45,168
<i>Really being vulnerable.</i>

1323
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,599
<i>The thing is is that I think
this comes from my childhood.</i>

1324
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:50,435
<i>My... my parents got
divorced at a young age,</i>

<i>And I feel like
my father leaving.</i>

1326
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:55,473
<i>Has really, you know, taken a... a
chunk out of my self-Esteem.</i>

1327
00:53:55,506 --> 00:53:57,075
<i>Mm-Hmm.
That's a shame.</i>

1328
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:02,146
<i>You know, I feel like there's
a good girl inside of me,</i>

1329
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,949
<i>And a raunchy raven
that comes out.</i>

1330
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:07,318
<i>When I have sex
with some stranger.</i>

1331
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:09,921
<i>Hmm? You know, my... my
self-Esteem issues.</i>

1332
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:11,389
<i>Let's get back to the sex.</i>

1333
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:14,259
<i>Uh, what kind of sex
are you talking about?</i>

1334
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,295
<i>Sex with... with, um,
many, many men.</i>

1335
00:54:17,328 --> 00:54:18,997
<i>Sometimes in groups
as, you know...</i>

1336
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,332
<i>You're with a doctor.
You can be specific.</i>

1337
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:24,435
<i>Well, hand jobs,
blow jobs, gagging,</i>

1338
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:27,505
<i>Double penetration, facials,</i>

1339
00:54:27,538 --> 00:54:29,140
<i>Dry humping,</i>

1340
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:31,409
<i>Sex with toys,
role play, whips,</i>

1341
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,577
<i>Chains, the whole gamut.</i>

1342
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,514
<i>I've... I've just spent
years drowned in a...</i>

1343
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:38,483
<i>In a pool of semen.</i>

1344
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:39,984
<i>You know?</i>

1345
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:40,884
<i>That's interesting.
Drowning.</i>

1346
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:42,587
<i>Trying to get out
and be myself,</i>

1347
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,624
<i>But just being covered
in... in nameless...</i>

1348
00:54:46,657 --> 00:54:48,793
<i>Mm-Hmm.
Faceless...</i>

1349
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:49,827
<i>Semen.</i>

1350
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,029
<i>[CRYING] Then I...</i>

1351
00:54:51,062 --> 00:54:52,597
<i>Then I started doing the drugs.</i>

1352
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,699
<i>What do the drugs make you do?</i>

1353
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:57,702
<i>They would take me
to a whole new level.</i>

1354
00:54:57,735 --> 00:54:59,003
<i>With... with this sex,</i>

1355

<i>I'm not gonna beat your ass
fuckin' senseless.</i>

1651
01:04:25,402 --> 01:04:27,771
<i>Civilized people don't
even think about it.</i>

1652
01:04:27,804 --> 01:04:29,940
<i>How much shit

1653
01:04:29,973 --> 01:04:31,242
<i>What the fuck, dude?</i>

<i>We have everything
you'd need for the trip.</i>

1655

<i>That's what I'm trying to say!</i>

1658

<i>See, this is the problem.</i>

1676
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:08,579
<i>You guys should be on the boat.</i>

1677

1702
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:48,852
<i>All what?
Just black people.</i>

1703
01:05:48,885 --> 01:05:50,287
<i>We're trying to get them
to go back to Africa.</i>

1704
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,323
<i>Because, um, well, one,
that's where you're from.</i>

1705
01:05:52,356 --> 01:05:54,525
<i>And two, a lot of people
don't want you here.</i>

1706

<i>Are you black?
Just to make sure.</i>

1707

<i>Third from the right.</i>

1720
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:21,484
<i>That's really, yeah.</i>

1721
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:23,020
<i>Let's show her where
she could go.</i>

1722
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:24,134
<i>You'd be in, like, Liberia.</i>

1723
01:06:24,154 --> 01:06:25,556
<i>Or one of the outer...
outer nations.</i>

01:06:28,393 --> 01:06:29,392
<i>In this area.</i>

1726
01:06:29,393 --> 01:06:30,561
<i>You don't need to put up
with this bullshit.</i>

1727
01:06:30,594 --> 01:06:33,297
<i>You guys are both fucking racists.
Just so you know.</i>

1728
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,865
<i>- Uh, I'm racist?
- Yes.</i>

1729
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:36,400
<i>Uh, who's the one trying to
hang out with a black girl.</i>

<i>Guess what?
Nailed it.</i>

1734
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:42,738
<i>You wanna hang out
with minorities.</i>

1735
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:43,706
<i>So people like you better.</i>

1736
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:45,342
<i>But you're a minority.
You're a Jew.</i>

1737
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,677
<i>[SHOUTING] I am not a Jew!</i>

1738

<i>Yeah, well, you look like it.</i>

1739
01:06:47,744 --> 01:06:48,979
<i>They're the grossest
of the gross.</i>

1740
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:51,382
<i>Listen, Africa's
an amazing place.</i>

1741
01:06:51,415 --> 01:06:53,017
<i>The movies start
10 minutes late,</i>

<i>And you can talk all
the way through them.</i>

1743
01:06:55,153 --> 01:06:55,985
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

1744
01:06:55,986 --> 01:06:56,987
<i>There's acres of watermelon,</i>

1745
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,589
<i>If you're interested
at all in that.</i>

1746
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,324
<i>We don't need to...
a watermelon?</i>

1747

<i>Yeah. You wanna eat it?</i>

1748
01:07:01,425 --> 01:07:02,826
<i>It's delicious and refreshing.</i>

<i>I can't even believe
you would do this.</i>

1753
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:11,035
<i>Yeah, you don't even know her.</i>

1754
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,069
<i>Do you hate watermelon?</i>

1755
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:13,262
<i>I don't even like watermelon.</i>

<i>Come on, Brandi.
You know you wanna go.</i>

1757

<i>Is that fried chicken?
Come on.</i>
