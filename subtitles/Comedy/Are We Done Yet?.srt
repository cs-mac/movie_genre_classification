1
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,170
<i>You know, a lot has changed
in my life in the past year.</i>

2
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,933
<i>Suzanne and I got married...</i>

3
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,980
<i>...and her and the kids moved
into my apartment.</i>

4
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,018
<i>My very small apartment.</i>

5
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,492
<i>But that ain't all.</i>

6
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,663
<i>I decided to pursue my dream.</i>

7
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>So I sold my sports shop
and started up a magazine.</i>

8
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:16,609
<i>You know what it is.
A sports magazine.</i>

9
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:19,258
<i>And these are the moments
that I cherish.</i>

10
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:23,526
<i>When everybody's asleep,
I got the whole place to myself...</i>

11
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,468
<i>...and now it's time to get to work.</i>

12
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,210
So, Magic, how was it when you...?

13
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,721
How's your magazine coming?

14
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:54,954
Come here.

15
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,962
Kevin, what you doing up?
Trying to write.

16
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:59,570
I'm hungry.
Do you got Pop-Tarts?

17
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,631
You're always hungry.

18
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,940
And it's, "Do we got Pop-Tarts?"
We family now.

19
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,814
So, what's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

20
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:11,085
- Understand?
- I understand I want Pop-Tarts.

21
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,168
Thanks, Nick.

22
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,939
Did you take my cellphone?

23
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,550
Mom, Kevin's stealing
my stuff again.

24
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,785
Nick, Coco's hungry.

25
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:31,798
Hey, you guys wanted the dog,
you gonna have to feed him.

26
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:32,993
Coco, breakfast!

27
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,871
- Good morning.
- Hey.

28
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,846
How's your writing
going this morning?

29
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:42,419
- Not too good.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,892
Nick, there's something
we really need to talk about.

31
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,124
Hold that thought.
Hey! No! Wait a minute.

32
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,361
No! No! No!

33
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:51,833
Open this door.

34
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,533
I have to put on my makeup, Nick.

35
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,806
You're too young to wear makeup.

36
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,679
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

37
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,047
One.

38
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:00,520
Two.

39
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm almost 14, Nick.
You can't keep treating me like a child.

40
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,706
No, no. You're only 13.

41
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,346
And as your stepfather,
I have the God-given right...

42
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,949
...to treat you like a child.

43
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,883
Suzanne, do you see
what this girl got on?

44
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:18,422
I'm not in it.

45
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:22,294
Okay, okay, I am not dressing
like somebody's grandma.

46
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:26,031
After school, Ashley and I are going to
the mall for the Nordstrom sale.

47
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,604
No. No. Veto.
That ain't gonna happen.

48
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,943
I don't like that one bit.

49
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,178
You're too young
to be hanging out at the mall.

50
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,120
So go get dressed, granny.

51
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,194
Too young for the mall?

52
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,834
You're like a prison guard.

53
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,766
Yeah, well, welcome to Alcatraz.

54
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,290
So, Nick, you know,
the Lutskys are moving.

55
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,327
- So?
- Well, it's a three-bedroom.

56
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:58,129
Yeah, it's probably three times
as expensive too.

57
00:07:58,305 --> 00:07:59,500
Hey!

58
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:06,580
Oh, you wanna be treated like a adult?
You can't even wrap a piece of pizza.

59
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,121
You said I was a child.

60
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:12,189
Nick, there's something that we really
need to talk about this morning.

61
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,894
I can't talk right now.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

62
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,332
Kevin.

63
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,677
Okay. Out. Both you guys. Out.

64
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,979
I got a presentation today
with my publisher.

65
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:28,152
- Let's go. I need to talk to your mother.
- You too, Coco. Get out. Go.

66
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:29,559
This place.

67
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,534
Coco, get down before
you knock something over.

68
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,552
And what were you trying to say?

69
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,464
Honey, I'm pregnant.

70
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,035
By who?

71
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,747
So you sold your half
of the shop to Marty?

72
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,648
He's gotta be happy
about that, huh?

73
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,848
Yeah, he is. But I am too, you know?

74
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,093
I'm starting a new chapter
in my life, my man.

75
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:04,632
I'm launching a magazine.

76
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,432
That's great. You took a risk,
and you made it happen.

77
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:09,167
You got Magic. I'm proud of you.

78
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,378
Whoa, hey!

79
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:14,316
Who said anything about Magic?

80
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,780
You don't have him?

81
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,289
Officially, no.

82
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,862
But it's looking good.
It's looking real good.

83
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,830
Matter of fact, it's looking so good...

84
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:27,070
...pour me a shot, pour yourself a shot
and then pour one for my man Magic.

85
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,612
Let me ask you something, Nick.

86
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,843
If you don't have him,
why'd you sell the shop?

87
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,583
I need the money, Jimmy.

88
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:36,055
It's been cool, but it's kind of hard
having Suzanne and the kids...

89
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,496
...just crammed up
into my small place.

90
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,727
It's just time to move on up, man.

91
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,341
Plus, I didn't tell you,
I'm having a baby.

92
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,378
All right. My man's having a baby.

93
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:48,075
- Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
- Hey, baby.

94
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,724
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I thought I'd find you here. Hi, Jimmy.

95
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:54,058
- How'd it go?
- It went great.

96
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:55,861
Check it out.

97
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,138
Hey.

98
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,307
This baby got two heads.

99
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:07,719
And four arms and four legs.
Nick, we're having twins.

100
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,926
Twins?

101
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,606
- Honey.
- Cut off, Nick.

102
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,611
Thanks, Jimmy.

103
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,265
<i>I can't believe you're making us
move to the country.</i>

104
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,031
<i>This is like child abuse
of the worst kind.</i>

105
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:35,371
Where's the mall?

106
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,743
What you need a mall for?
That's your problem now.

107
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:40,753
You need to get a little fresh air
and open spaces. Try that.

108
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:44,556
Lindsey, please. Okay?
Everybody, just relax.

109
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,724
Yeah, just relax.

110
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:48,864
Here, sweetie. Have a juice.

111
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,974
- Oh, God-
- Kevin!

112
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,221
What's that smell?

113
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,223
Smells like oxygen.

114
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,697
Mom, please tell me you're joking.

115
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,032
- Enough.
- I hope it's the right place.

116
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,611
Of course it's not.
Our old house is the right house.

117
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,807
This is the place, guys. Come on.

118
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:15,423
Let's have a positive
mental attitude, okay?

119
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,432
Nice floors.

120
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,308
I smell cookies.

121
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:32,389
Kevin, Kevin, you cannot just walk
around these people's house like that.

122
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,497
Oh, this the culprit right here.

123
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:41,031
God!

124
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:46,241
Oh, baby. Oh, honey.
Okay, cold water. Go. Cold water.

125
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:51,327
Oh, goodness gracious!
What happened in here?

126
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,092
Did you touch the stove?
Was it the stove?

127
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,830
I'll tell you what, gonna put
Tunisian hemp root on there.

128
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,099
Make it as good as new.

129
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:01,878
It's true, actually.
I'm so sorry about that.

130
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,386
It's fine. He's just being a big baby.

131
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,720
Name's Chuck Mitchell Jr.

132
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,595
I'm the local real-estate guy
here in Newburg County and...

133
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,795
You...

134
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:16,570
I know just exactly who you are.

135
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,245
You're Nick.

136
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,177
There we go.

137
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,757
Note to self, the hand still hurts.

138
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,600
- And the radiant...
- Suzanne.

139
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,333
Oh, my G-O-D.

140
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:34,246
Suzanne's with child.

141
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:40,315
You old dog, you!

142
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,928
- Oh, well-
- Hold up.

143
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,727
It's okay. I'm a part-time midwife.

144
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,234
I actually studied...

145
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,434
...at the Natural Childbirth Center
in Lucerne, Switzerland.

146
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,650
They're twins, aren't they?

147
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,657
Yes, they are.
How did you know that?

148
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:03,202
Would you like to know the sexes?

149
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,405
No.

150
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:10,106
Matter of fact, we wanna
keep it a surprise, Chuck.

151
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:12,880
Oh, fair enough. Isn't that
every parent's prerogative?

152
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:19,661
But if I were you, I wouldn't be in any
big hurry to paint the nursery pink.

153
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:24,337
Oh, gosh. It's just a special time,
being in that delivery room.

154
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,549
Right. The man almost fainted
when our guppy had babies.

155
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,814
Now, you know that
that was a hard delivery for me.

156
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:35,455
All that cloudy water and then those
little things popping out one by one.

157
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,063
Honey?

158
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,709
Babe.

159
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,608
Honey.

160
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:49,960
Now, the place was built in 1889
by H. Van Hackett himself...

161
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,155
...legendary architect
and perfectionist.

162
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,326
I'd like to tell you something
right up front:

163
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:59,036
In all my years in "the business"-
And there have been more than a few.

164
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,580
- I have never seen
a more sound home.

165
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,679
Structurally speaking.

166
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,791
Wait till you get a load
of the second floor.

167
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,330
Baby, do you see this?

168
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,436
- It's okay, we'll fix it.
- Did you see this?

169
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:15,941
Now, she's got five bedrooms
and four bathrooms...

170
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:19,985
...so needless to say, there's plenty
of room for the whole fam.

171
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:25,358
I think we're gonna go ahead and put
Mom and Dad in the master bedroom.

172
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,797
- Five bedrooms, right?
- Five, baby. You feeling me?

173
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,959
I'm feeling you.

174
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,935
- This big enough for you, baby?
- It's beautiful.

175
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,413
And, of course, the master bathroom.

176
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,148
Oh, my God, baby, a claw-foot tub.

177
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:41,989
- I've always wanted one of these.
- Me too.

178
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,633
Pretty awesome, right?

179
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:48,401
- I like it.
- It's beautiful. And the double sinks!

180
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:53,112
Oh, my God.
Baby, look at the shower.

181
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:57,291
Oh, my God, honey, this is bigger
than our entire apartment.

182
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,328
I know.

183
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,731
What's in there, Chuck?

184
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,204
That is a private toilet.

185
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:11,486
Baby.

186
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:14,057
- Did you say private?
- Yes, sir.

187
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,698
Oh, my God.

188
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,999
How I look?

189
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,671
How do you feel?

190
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,933
I feel good.

191
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,102
Feeling good's good enough.

192
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:30,891
You be okay in there, Nick?

193
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:34,157
Just give me one minute.

194
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:44,585
So, now, Suzanne here tells me
that you're in the publishing game?

195
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:47,748
Oh, yeah, I did sell a magazine
to OmniHouse.

196
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:48,917
An entrepreneur.

197
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:52,329
A budding William Randolph Hearst
right here in our midst.

198
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,736
I don't really know who that is,
Chuck, but, hey, I guess so.

199
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,810
Modest too? They broke the mold.

200
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,348
I'll tell you what, Suze,
I'd hang on to this one.

201
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:03,148
Oh, yeah, he's a keeper, Chuck.

202
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:07,158
Oh, way to stick the landing, Kev-o.

203
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:17,344
The Hacketts, of course,
used this as a guest cottage.

204
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:20,751
But with just a "scootcharino" of work,
it could be easily converted...

205
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:23,953
...into the perfect creative nook for,
you know, a...

206
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,958
A publisher.

207
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,735
You know, I was thinking about
writing in that bathroom up there.

208
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,900
Oh, yeah?

209
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:36,177
- Oh, honey, this is so charming.
- This'll work too.

210
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,517
Just for a second, Nick,
just for a second, imagine...

211
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,029
Imagine watching
a blue-throated hummingbird...

212
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,365
...suckle the nectar from a fresh
hydrangea blossom...

213
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,010
...while you free your mind...

214
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,810
...to the creative impulses that have
made every publishing empire great.

215
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:55,254
This is not a dress rehearsal, Nick.

216
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:59,730
Live the dream, baby,
live the dream.

217
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:04,134
Would you guys like
to see a tremendous view?

218
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,108
Would you? Come on. Come on.

219
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,582
- It's the coup de grâce. You'll love it.
- Come on, baby.

220
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,887
You're gonna wanna get low
coming through this door.

221
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,055
The roof- Think you'll find the roof
needs a little bit of work...

222
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,931
...so please be careful.

223
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:26,113
The property includes
an apple orchard.

224
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:30,123
There's some wild blackberries
over here, some cedars.

225
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:33,960
And I don't even wanna tell you
about the view of the lake from here.

226
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:35,125
Breathe.

227
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:40,507
Breathe, breathe in that rich,
fresh air, Mr. Publisher.

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,547
How about it?

229
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:46,818
Oh, not so incidentally, they just built
a brand-new school down the road.

230
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,019
Really?

231
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,362
Newburg is a really amazing place
to raise a family.

232
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,665
Oh, it's just so beautiful, Chuck.

233
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, you should see it
in the middle of the winter...

234
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:00,208
...with a blanket of snow covering it.
It's pretty as a postcard.

235
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:03,424
Personally, I like to power-walk
through these woods.

236
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:08,224
Never mind the fact that, of course,
I used to do the walk competitively.

237
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:09,597
Really?

238
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:14,213
Yeah, I was an alternate
to the '94 Goodwill Games in Russia.

239
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:21,450
Like I say, she is a fixer-upper...

240
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:24,759
...but I happen to know the finest
contractor in these parts.

241
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,462
You give that gentleman
a call and...

242
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,837
One way to make your life
a whole lot easier.

243
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,046
So, now, where do
we stand there, Nickster?

244
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,681
I don't know, Chuck.

245
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:38,452
I'm not really sure if this is
the right place for us, you know.

246
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,327
It's a little high-priced
and you're a little weird.

247
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,734
Oh, gosh, I actually scheduled
a couple back-to-back with you guys.

248
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,478
Larry, Bernice. Hello! Come in.
Please, make yourself at home.

249
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,086
- Okay, Chuck. Thanks.
- Thank you.

250
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,454
I gotta go.

251
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:01,427
So, what you think?

252
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,102
I don't know. I don't know.
Can we really afford this house?

253
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,304
Of course.

254
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:09,352
Baby, with the advance,
plus the money we saved on rent...

255
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,959
...we can buy this place
two times over.

256
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,959
And have money to fix it up.

257
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,633
And guess what.

258
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,236
I can do the fixing.

259
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,467
I can barely get you to change
a light bulb at the apartment.

260
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:23,548
So what? Look, look.
Take a look at this.

261
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,310
- A house is like a painting.
- Yeah.

262
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:28,948
You can't really buy with your head,
you gotta buy with your heart.

263
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,163
Yeah, honey, but we have to think
with our heads right now.

264
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,699
We gotta think about the kids.

265
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,773
We gotta think about
it's the middle of the school year...

266
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:42,284
...Lindsey has her friends and she just
met that nice boy in her math class.

267
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,057
There's plenty of stuff
around here for Lindsey to do...

268
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,922
...that have nothing to do with boys.

269
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,564
And Kevin, this is perfect!

270
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,927
Look at the nature.
Look at the wilderness.

271
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,039
We got a blueberry tree, baby.

272
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:56,703
Are we talking about the same kid?
Kevin doesn't go outside for recess.

273
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:00,616
That's why he needs a place like this,
to toughen him up.

274
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,691
Plus, I can take him fishing.

275
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,257
Who's going fishing?

276
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,366
- Me.
- You fish?

277
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,832
Oh, I can fish, baby.

278
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,973
Oh, when's the last time
you went fishing?

279
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,645
Last time- Matter of fact,
it was before I met you...

280
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:15,113
...last time I went fishing.

281
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,446
And...

282
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,952
I don't know how to fish,
but I can learn.

283
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,588
And then I could teach him,
and we can bond.

284
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,734
- "We can bond. "
- We'll become a true family.

285
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,371
- "A true family. "
- Picture it.

286
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,538
What you think?

287
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:34,481
I think there are a lot
of rooms in this house...

288
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,853
...that are gonna need breaking in.

289
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,195
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the roof?

290
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,205
The roof isn't a bad place to start.

291
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,210
Well, come over here,
drop it like it's hot, girl.

292
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,206
Baby!

293
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,828
We'll take it.

294
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,060
Good boy.

295
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,797
Good boy.

296
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:22,614
- Where'd she go?
- She was just... I don't know.

297
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,516
There.

298
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,361
What you doing?

299
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,184
Stop! Coco, stop!

300
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,386
Help!

301
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:10,019
Hey, honey, do you know
how this garbage disposal works?

302
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:13,827
Because I've tried every single one
of these switches.

303
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,264
What about this one?

304
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:21,010
See? Everything is working out
just like I promised, huh?

305
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:26,318
I can fix that.

306
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,688
Oh, you can fix that?

307
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:34,073
Hey, I hope we're not disturbing you.
I'm Mr. Rooney, this is Mrs. Rooney.

308
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:37,442
Oh, so formal.
Please, call me Mrs. Rooney.

309
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:39,808
We wanted to be the first
to welcome you.

310
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,649
Oh, we sure did.

311
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,656
We are the first, aren't we?

312
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,117
You're the first.

313
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,555
Yes.

314
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:49,033
- That looks gross.
- Kevin.

315
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,504
That fish put this town on the map.

316
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:55,479
Oh, yeah. Sturgeon tastes
a lot like chicken, only fishy.

317
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,448
- Nice.
- I think you're gonna enjoy it.

318
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,523
And even if you don't, it's dead.

319
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:02,355
Did you wanna come inside
for something to drink?

320
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:04,633
Oh, that's so sweet.

321
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:07,967
But we don't really drink so early
in the day around these parts, but-

322
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:13,642
- Right. No.
- No, no, I meant, like, just a lemonade.

323
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,061
Boy, get them fish.

324
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,167
Thank you. Close the door.

325
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,807
- Welcome.
- For you.

326
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,111
Tastes like chicken.

327
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,899
Sturgeon, right?
Give me the fish, man.

328
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,698
Y'all get out of here
before I call the cops.

329
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:47,149
Hey, Nick.
I can't find Coco anywhere.

330
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,581
Give me that.

331
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,190
Don't worry about Coco,
he'll show up sooner or later.

332
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,957
There's a lot of trees
to pee on out there.

333
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,840
What you want me to do?

334
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,872
Coco!

335
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:06,113
Where's that dog?

336
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:09,887
Maybe we should go back.
It's kind of scary out here.

337
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,124
Scary? Boy, it's beautiful out here.

338
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,670
Look, you with the man. I was the man
in the city, and I'm the man out here.

339
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,870
Trust me, when you're with me,
there's nothing to be scared of.

340
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:22,848
But that.

341
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,258
Run! Go! Go!

342
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:30,700
Can you hear me now?

343
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,535
Hello? Can you hear me now?

344
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,682
Off the phone, please. Here we are.

345
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,244
Oh, look at this.

346
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,958
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

347
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,619
And look at us.
One big, happy family.

348
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,268
Yes, one big, happy family.

349
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,967
Lindsey, would you like
to give thanks?

350
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,011
Why, are we going home?

351
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,909
This is our home.

352
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,107
Our real home, Mom.

353
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,485
Where my friends are.
Where I can get cellphone reception.

354
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,026
Lindsey,
put away the phone, please.

355
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:02,994
Kevin?

356
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,568
- I don't like this fish.
- Me neither.

357
00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:09,073
But we're gonna be eating this
every day for the next six months...

358
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,714
...so get used to it.

359
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,117
Now, Lindsey. Grace.

360
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:18,024
Dear Lord, thank you for all the
blessings that you gave us.

361
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:20,398
Before they were taken away.

362
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,036
Like my friends,
cellphone reception-

363
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,472
Time-out, I got this.

364
00:26:25,678 --> 00:26:27,146
Please, honey.

365
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:30,218
Oh, patient and heavenly Father...

366
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:34,052
...who's probably 10 times
more patient and heavenly...

367
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,460
...than any stepfather
should have to be-

368
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:37,657
Baby.

369
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,134
- we give thanks.

370
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:41,307
I know at times it seems like...

371
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,208
...we're nothing but a bunch of
back-talking sass mouths...

372
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:48,116
...who don't know when we got it good
in a nice, beautiful home.

373
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:54,524
At least the table's strong.

374
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:00,870
I can fix that.

375
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,048
Honey, I think you should
just call the contractor.

376
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,320
Suzanne, the electrical parts
alone is a 30 percent markup.

377
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,431
And a contractor?

378
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,070
You're talking about
125 bucks a hour.

379
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:24,582
Now do you want the number?

380
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,168
Contractor's here!

381
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:41,189
Coco! Oh, Coco.

382
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,120
Coco, sit.

383
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,319
How did you do that?

384
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:57,890
That's German.
It's the language of discipline.

385
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,758
I was fortunate a couple of years back
to spend some time...

386
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,425
...and study with the friars
of New Skete.

387
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:05,266
Nick!

388
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,706
I found Coco by the highway,
but it's no problem...

389
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:11,374
- ... because he had his tags on.
- Chuck, what you doing here?

390
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:15,219
I got a message down at the office
that you were looking for a contractor?

391
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,199
But you're the local real-estate guy.

392
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,302
Yes, I am.

393
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:22,838
And I'm also the local contractor.

394
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,306
Do you love it?

395
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:32,559
- What's that smell?
- Fifty pounds of fish.

396
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,698
Do you know the power
went out last night?

397
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:36,231
On it.

398
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:40,200
What you mean, "ruh-roh"?

399
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:44,373
Nick, when exactly
did you buy this home?

400
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,018
Are you serious?

401
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:48,054
You know exactly
when I bought this dump...

402
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,921
...because you the one sold it to us.

403
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,430
And that's what makes it
so very unpleasant for me...

404
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,629
...to have to tell you that your home's
electrical system is shot.

405
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,772
All right, all right, all right.
Flag on the play.

406
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,679
Why didn't you tell us this
when you showed us the house?

407
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:06,086
Nick, in all fairness,
I did have my Realtor's cap on.

408
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,494
You know, might remember
that great blue blazer and the khakis.

409
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,035
My contractor's hat was safely
at home in the closet.

410
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:14,334
They're two distinctly
different chapeaus...

411
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:17,743
...but they should have told you
when you had the place inspected.

412
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,449
How's it going, guys?

413
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,590
Nick didn't have
this dump inspected.

414
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:24,752
I had it inspected. It was inspected.

415
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:31,603
It was just inspected by me.

416
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:33,838
Honey, how could you not
hire an inspector?

417
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,542
We talked about this.
How could you be so irresponsible?

418
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,348
I trusted you on this.

419
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,791
- Don't blame me, it's his fault.
- Well, how is it Chuck's fault?

420
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:42,953
He lied!

421
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:46,195
No, he didn't. You was just too cheap
to hire an inspector.

422
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,704
That's besides the point.

423
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:51,071
They're kicking, aren't they?

424
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,012
Feels like they're playing soccer.

425
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,677
You okay?

426
00:29:56,593 --> 00:30:00,966
They say that the move
was very traumatic for them...

427
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,833
...and that you shouldn't sleep
on your right side.

428
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:05,407
How do you know, Chuck?

429
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:07,478
I'm a baby whisperer.

430
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:08,979
A baby what?

431
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:15,294
Also, they'd love it if you could lay off
the Indian food. Curry is a no-no.

432
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:17,159
Oh, brother.

433
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,601
Unfortunately, you gotta upgrade
the main panel and pull all the wires.

434
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:22,298
That just sound like a bigger job.

435
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:24,173
Oh, crap.

436
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:30,157
You got raccoons.

437
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,299
Oh, yeah. Raccoons
that like Corn Nuts.

438
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:39,075
Word to the wise, careful with those
raccoons. They're vicious.

439
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:40,468
Hey, hey, Chuck.

440
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:42,982
When it comes
to this electrical stuff...

441
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,187
How much this gonna cost me?

442
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:48,223
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
A home this size...

443
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:50,363
...you're looking at 8, 9.

444
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,364
- Hundred?
- Thousand.

445
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,370
Get off my property.

446
00:30:57,511 --> 00:30:58,706
I might fixed.

447
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:00,747
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

448
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,290
Perfect.
That's what I'm talking about.

449
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,722
I'm professional.

450
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,989
Thanks. Appreciate it, Serge.

451
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,896
Come again.

452
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:17,907
Did you see that? Look and learn,
little girl. 150 bucks. Painless.

453
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,816
Are you sure it's safe?

454
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:21,788
Of course it's safe.

455
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,223
He said all we gotta do...

456
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:26,767
...is not use the microwave
and the toaster at the same time.

457
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,568
That's just common sense.

458
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,952
Eight thousand dollars.

459
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:38,683
I knew that dude Chuck
was a crook the minute I met him.

460
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,262
Oh, honey, I think
you're a little bit stressed out...

461
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,700
...with the move and everything and,
you know...

462
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,741
...there's one thing
that we haven't been able to do...

463
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:49,540
...in this big old drafty mansion.

464
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:52,210
Insulation. That'll be perfect.

465
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:55,586
If we do that, we'll save
a lot of money on heating bills.

466
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,096
Baby, I was actually thinking of
something else we could do...

467
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,600
...to stay nice and warm.

468
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:04,102
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

469
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:08,079
Honey, what was that?

470
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:09,685
The raccoon.

471
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,517
- He's on the roof?
- Yeah.

472
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:13,388
You gotta show him who's boss.

473
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:16,361
If you don't do that,
you'll never get rid of him.

474
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,435
Baby, but Chuck says they're vicious.

475
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,166
Yeah, if you're a baby whisperer.

476
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:25,379
But me, I'm the man.

477
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:28,015
You are the man.

478
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,456
- You got my back?
- I got your back.

479
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,063
Watch this.

480
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,757
Is that my Corn Nuts?

481
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:51,194
You should know
not to mess with a man's nuts.

482
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,497
Be prepared
to pay the ultimate price.

483
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:56,008
Honey. Honey, what are you
doing out there?

484
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:57,407
Step back, baby.

485
00:32:58,382 --> 00:32:59,372
What you wanna do?

486
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,786
Look, he ain't even running.

487
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,319
He think he bad. You think you bad?

488
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:08,960
I've dealt with rats in the city
bigger than you, boy.

489
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:13,543
Kids, go to bed. I got this.

490
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:17,716
- Baby!
- I got him!

491
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,693
Did I get him?

492
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,374
- No.
- No.

493
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:33,479
Sucker.

494
00:33:57,665 --> 00:33:59,567
Nicholas J. Persons?

495
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:03,738
- Chuck?
- Charles Mitchell. City inspector.

496
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,275
We got a problem. Let's go.

497
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,918
What's with the badge, Chuck?

498
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,723
Look, I don't have time for
none of this, okay? So make it quick.

499
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,962
Sir, you can't just go around tapping
into other people's power supplies.

500
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,132
It's dangerous, it's against the law...

501
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,146
...and quite frankly, Mr. Persons,
it's rude.

502
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:25,277
What are you talking about?

503
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:26,819
I'm gonna go ahead and guess...

504
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,961
...that that work wasn't done
by a licensed contractor.

505
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:32,930
You know, I didn't even know
they was gonna leave it like that.

506
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:36,335
You went ahead and availed yourself
to the cheap, unskilled labor pool...

507
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:38,638
...that congregates outside
the hardware store?

508
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,948
I know. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

509
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:45,387
For reference, I'm gonna
provide you with a list...

510
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,722
...of all the licensed,
bonded contractors...

511
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:50,562
...we have here in the local vicinity.

512
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:56,914
I am also going to fine you $1000
for breaking the law.

513
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,176
What? A thousand bucks?

514
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:00,878
If you knew what you were doing...

515
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:04,256
...you'd be facing jail time,
so consider yourself lucky.

516
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,532
We're shutting your power down
till further notice.

517
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:12,207
What am I supposed to do?
Build a windmill?

518
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:16,045
Well, that's not a bad idea, so long as
you contact the city zoning officer first.

519
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,213
Quality guy.
Would you like his card?

520
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,551
- No.
- I'm out of here.

521
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:23,188
Hey, wait a minute, Chuck.
Chuck, come on, man. It's me. Nick.

522
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:26,563
Help me get my power back on.

523
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm the city inspector, Mr. Persons.

524
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,973
Restoring power's
a little beyond my purview.

525
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:36,650
Okay, I know what this is. And I seen
this one before. What's it gonna take?

526
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:40,561
You realize if I accepted that,
I'd have to arrest myself on the spot...

527
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:42,101
...and I'm not that guy.

528
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:44,137
But you're a contractor.

529
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,973
But I'm not wearing
that hat right now.

530
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:51,247
Well, you can put it on.

531
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:57,256
It's your lucky day.
It happens to be in the car.

532
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:05,271
Oh, God. Oh, what,
they shut you down?

533
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:09,014
The heartless bureaucrats.
They're the worst.

534
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,550
Can you help me?

535
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:14,632
Well, restoring power's
not as easy as it sounds.

536
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,566
It just might take a couple days.

537
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:20,178
A couple of days?
Man, I'm trying to launch a magazine.

538
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,976
All right? What am I supposed to do
without a computer?

539
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:24,977
We're gonna get your power
back on.

540
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,292
It's not even gonna be an issue.

541
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,985
Trust me.

542
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:37,207
Here you go, honey.

543
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:39,883
Your sandwich.

544
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:43,414
- What?
- Okay.

545
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,895
- Hey, Suzanne.
- Hey, Chuck. Come on in.

546
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:48,761
What smells good?
Are those sandwiches?

547
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:51,063
Oh, yeah, sturgeon salad.
Would you like one?

548
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,269
- I hate to impose.
- Oh, no, Chuck, anything for you.

549
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,418
Hey, hey, hey, man. What's with
all the racket? I'm trying to work.

550
00:36:57,585 --> 00:37:00,614
We had to saw off the breaker box.
I'd like some mustard on there.

551
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:01,953
I'm a big mustard guy.

552
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:05,497
But you should be good now.
We'll have you up and running in a jiff.

553
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:11,270
That's Magic Johnson. That's my guy.
That's my main man.

554
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,746
Did I tell you
I was on the '86 Lakers?

555
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:16,184
- No.
- Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

556
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:19,119
I had 38 seconds of playing time.

557
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:21,629
It was game two of the final
and "Big Game" James...

558
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:25,705
...went down with a bad wheel,
so we're up by 20 and they put me in.

559
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:27,308
Check it out, Nicker.

560
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,573
Get ahold of the purple and gold.

561
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,117
That's commitment, right?

562
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,729
When you do talk to the Magic Man,
tell him Chuck-dog said:

563
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,959
"Holler. That's what's up. "

564
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,806
- "Holler. "
- Thank you so much.

565
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:46,812
Anyway, the good news is we're
getting the power up and running.

566
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:53,057
The bad news is you got dry rot.

567
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,026
Dry what?

568
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:58,034
Can I tell you something?
This is the most incredible sandwich.

569
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:00,231
You know your way
around a sturgeon.

570
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,175
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Back to the dry rot.

571
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,337
How big is this?

572
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:08,047
Well, it could be considerable,
but y'all don't worry about a thing.

573
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:10,592
I know the best dry-rot guys
in Newburg County.

574
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,793
<i>How's the guy situation out there?</i>

575
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:16,799
Nothing at all.
No cuties, no nothing.

576
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:19,946
<i>Girl, I feel sorry for you.</i>

577
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:27,385
<i>- I didn't wanna move here.
- I don't blame you.</i>

578
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:31,391
Push. Push.

579
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,618
<i>You should try
and get back here somehow.</i>

580
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,622
<i>At least there are boys here.</i>

581
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:46,629
<i>Are you still there? Linds? Hello?</i>

582
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,498
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

583
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:52,074
Yeah. I gotta go.

584
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:59,851
Yup. You got the rot, brah.

585
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:05,628
- How you know?
- Nick.

586
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,999
- What?
- He's not aware.

587
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:12,081
Nick, the Pulu family has been in the
dry-rot business for three generations.

588
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,777
Hawaiians know the dry rot
better than the rest of us...

589
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,821
...because the island is so darn wet.

590
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,486
Well, then why do they call it dry rot?

591
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:22,100
That's a misnomer. Listen carefully.

592
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:25,834
Billy and George here,
they're highly skilled craftsmen...

593
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,576
...very much in demand,
but Danny, gosh, he's got a gift.

594
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:36,560
He's an artist, and if he says you've
got the rot, you've got the rot, brah.

595
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:42,972
Okay, say I got "the rot," brah.
I mean, can't we live with it?

596
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:46,275
Can you live with a wood-rotting
fungi that colonizes and spreads...

597
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,080
...to every timber in your home,
leading to a mold...

598
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,384
...which can produce
airborne pathogens...

599
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,826
...that might infect every member
of your family...

600
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:56,799
...causing conjunctivitis,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis...

601
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,804
...and I'm not gonna lie to you here...

602
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:01,879
...allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis.

603
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,907
Oh, yeah. No problem.

604
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,849
No.

605
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:08,014
I think they should fix it now.

606
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:12,494
You know, that is, because we don't
want it to spread and kill us all, right?

607
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:14,831
Don't you got clothes
to go put on or something?

608
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:16,600
- Ma.
- Go.

609
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,343
Right here, right here.

610
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,753
All right, how much
is it gonna cost me?

611
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:27,128
- Tough to predict.
- It's like that.

612
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:31,632
Do what you gotta do, all right?
Do what you gotta do.

613
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,240
But you gotta put on these...

614
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:36,848
...because you're kind of fat and
I don't want you scuffing up my floors.

615
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,416
Don't be a hick, Nick.

616
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,879
These guys are professionals.

617
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,719
Nice bootie.

618
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:47,501
- Talking about this.
- Give it up.

619
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:52,511
Yes, ma'am. I understand you guys
need all the questions.

620
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,707
I have them right here
in front of me...

621
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,255
...but I'm in the process of
relocating offices...

622
00:40:58,424 --> 00:41:00,394
Maybe I can fax them
to you later on today?

623
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:02,794
Or tomorrow, the next day,
or the day after that.

624
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:06,599
<i>- As long as we make our deadline.
- Okay, thanks. Tell Magic I said hey.</i>

625
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:07,764
<i>- Will do.
- All right.</i>

626
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

627
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,583
Peek-a-brah.

628
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,214
What up, man?

629
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,796
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. P.
We just need you to look...

630
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:21,128
...sign off on phase one
of the dry-rot repair.

631
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:23,398
Oh, okay. No problem.

632
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,339
Nice. Georgie, go long!

633
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:29,383
No, no, no. Georgie,
you don't have to go long.

634
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,989
I'll just meet y'all out front.

635
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,287
So how many phases is it?

636
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,125
Just two.

637
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,830
So you guys are halfway through.

638
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:41,635
Oh, man, that's painless.

639
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:00,709
What is this?

640
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,543
Phase one.

641
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:03,946
Phase one?

642
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,214
Hey, Nickeroo.

643
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,025
You.

644
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,219
Where you been, man?

645
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:11,766
Suzanne was feeling tired,
so I picked up Kev-o...

646
00:42:11,935 --> 00:42:12,960
...and shot some hoop.

647
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:14,539
What is wrong with you?

648
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,612
Man, you know this boy got asthma.
He can't shoot no hoops.

649
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:21,915
He cured it, just like that.
With something called the go...?

650
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,583
Goji berries.

651
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,991
- Listen.
- Check it out.

652
00:42:28,568 --> 00:42:29,558
Inhale love.

653
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,967
Exhale inclusion.

654
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:36,913
It's a little trick I picked up during a
fast with His Holiness in Dharamsala.

655
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:38,645
And finish.

656
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,658
Yeah, well, His Holiness
doesn't have to deal with his mother.

657
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:43,562
You keep your inhaler.

658
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:44,961
It was no bother.

659
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:47,036
We had to stop
at Fred's hardware store...

660
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:50,075
...to pick up a new tankless
water heater. Your old one's shot.

661
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:54,309
Oh, so now you going out and buying
things without even asking me first.

662
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:59,184
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a tankless job.

663
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:02,631
- I did not-
- Yes, he did.

664
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,142
- Good one, Chuck.
- Good one, Chuck.

665
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:13,188
Oh, what a great kid. Holy moly,
does he have a terrific jump shot.

666
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:15,657
Honest to goodness,
if he grows another six feet...

667
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:17,194
...he's gonna be unstoppable.

668
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:19,300
Hey, Nick. Look what Chuck got me.

669
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:21,028
- Isn't it awesome?
- Oh, yeah.

670
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,111
- Wait. Give me that.
- Fire! Fire! Fire!

671
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:28,309
Give me this.

672
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,479
What'd be awesome
is if you was here...

673
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:33,059
...to keep these linebackers
from tearing up my house.

674
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:34,891
Dry rot is a tricky thing.

675
00:43:35,065 --> 00:43:38,094
You never really know
how much damage there is...

676
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:40,104
Till you get into it.

677
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:44,272
It's like I always say, it's gonna get
ugly before it gets pretty.

678
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,354
Let me tell you something.
We're gonna get your walls back up...

679
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:49,858
...and your home
is gonna be stronger for it.

680
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:53,797
It better be. If not, I'm holding you
personally responsible.

681
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,066
So I want you to be the one
to keep your eye on this whole project.

682
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,770
A very close eye.
Do you understand me?

683
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:01,746
Close eyes.

684
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:05,186
I hear you loud and clear...

685
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:08,053
...Nickeroo.

686
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,427
With the gun. What are you doing?

687
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:12,897
And put on some booties.

688
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:20,344
It's Sunday morning, Nick. Isn't it so
nice to have the house to ourselves?

689
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,013
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

690
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,462
What? What is this?

691
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:37,086
Hey, hey, hey.

692
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:39,190
- What's up, Nick?
- What you doing?

693
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,294
You said keep a close eye
on the project.

694
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,729
So you going camping?

695
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:47,203
That's crazy talk. I'm moving in.

696
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:51,046
Chuck, what about your wife?
Doesn't she want you home?

697
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:53,276
I don't even want him home.
I know she don't.

698
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:57,553
Don't worry about the missus. Ellie's
on tour over in China for three months.

699
00:44:59,565 --> 00:45:00,692
Three months?

700
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:03,064
Yeah. She's a country singer.

701
00:45:03,238 --> 00:45:06,541
You wouldn't believe the way
the Chinese love their country music.

702
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:08,711
But this ain't gonna take
three months.

703
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,410
You're right. Could take longer.

704
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:15,286
But don't worry about me.
You won't even know I'm here.

705
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:20,499
What do you say? Let's get
out there before the sun gets too hot.

706
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:23,740
- Get out where?
- Chuck's taking us fishing.

707
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:26,109
The sturgeon are running.
It's gonna be fantastic.

708
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:28,982
- You wanna come?
- Oh, Chuck, that is a great idea.

709
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:31,319
No, no, I can't go fishing.
That's a bad idea.

710
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:33,930
- Why?
- I got too much work to do.

711
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,367
I gotta set traps in case
that raccoon comes back.

712
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,806
You know those are
vicious animals, baby.

713
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:42,277
Oh, come on, Nick.
The water's not that deep.

714
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,842
I don't care about that.

715
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,421
Wait a minute, Nick,
are you afraid of the water?

716
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,084
- Honey.
- No. That's ridiculous.

717
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:52,757
By "no" he means yes, and by
"ridiculous" he means terrified.

718
00:45:52,936 --> 00:45:56,774
And he did promise
that he'd teach Kevin how to fish.

719
00:45:56,944 --> 00:46:00,577
Okay. All right. Fine.
I'll go fishing.

720
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:02,379
Fine.

721
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:03,921
- Yes!
- Thanks, Chuck.

722
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:05,218
- Yes!
- Don't mention it.

723
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:15,979
I hate this. I'm gonna let y'all
know right now, I hate this.

724
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:19,018
- Come on.
- You know what? I-

725
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,892
I think I just swallowed a bug.

726
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:33,871
Y'all see that?

727
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:36,043
Stop messing around, Nick.
Come on.

728
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:40,257
For real, I think we need a bigger boat.
I'm not playing.

729
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,729
No, come on. Just take your rod...

730
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:44,926
...and cast away.

731
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:47,702
Don't tell me nothing
about fishing, okay?

732
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:51,008
I was the king of Go Fish
in my neighborhood.

733
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,153
This shouldn't be hard, just-

734
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,484
I saw a shark down there.

735
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:16,963
Oh, Nick, nice barrel roll.
Just real nice.

736
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,901
That's it. I'm gone. I'm gone.

737
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:31,055
- Hey, Nick?
- What?

738
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:32,322
I'd be careful.

739
00:47:32,498 --> 00:47:36,438
Don't worry about me,
I'm on land now. I got this.

740
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:42,039
Help!

741
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:46,188
Help. Somebody.

742
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:52,927
I gotta fire Chuck.

743
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:54,938
Why, because he made you
go fishing?

744
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,645
No, because he's tearing up
our house.

745
00:47:57,815 --> 00:48:01,219
Well, it's gonna get ugly
before it gets pretty, Nick.

746
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:05,329
Don't you start quoting him
like he's some kind of oracle...

747
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:07,489
...because he's not. He's an idiot.

748
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,728
He's sweet.

749
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:13,702
What?

750
00:48:14,314 --> 00:48:15,475
Nothing.

751
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,159
Oh, Nick, I know, I know.
This has been so hard for everybody...

752
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:24,231
...with this house,
and you're used to being a bachelor...

753
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,568
...and now you've got me and the kids
and the responsibilities of this house.

754
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,212
I know you're under
a lot of pressure, honey.

755
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:34,845
Oh, my goodness.
Come here. Feel this.

756
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,116
Touch it, right here.

757
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,453
Do you feel him?

758
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,293
What is that, his butt?

759
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:43,767
I think so.

760
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,505
Isn't that the coolest thing?

761
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:49,672
Did you hear that?

762
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,045
- Boy.
- Did you hear that?

763
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,713
- Honey, is that the raccoon?
- No.

764
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:58,389
Raccoon made a scuffling sound.
That was more like a rustle.

765
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:05,680
I think it's in the chimney.

766
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:22,874
I guess I showed him.

767
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:24,277
Yeah.

768
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:27,115
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby.

769
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,957
That's right. You might
wanna close that flue, though.

770
00:49:41,117 --> 00:49:43,452
Leave me alone, man. Get back.

771
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,766
Looks like we better put a cap
on that chimney.

772
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,570
These guys will drive you batty.

773
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:14,281
Night, neighbor.

774
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,082
I'm sick of you.

775
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,638
Chuck!

776
00:50:34,622 --> 00:50:35,612
What?

777
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:39,826
- Hey, Chuck.
- Yeah?

778
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,525
What's going on
with my glass door?

779
00:50:41,703 --> 00:50:43,764
Frame rotted. Ripped it out,
ordered a new one.

780
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,741
Triple-pane xenon-filled.
Pricey, yes...

781
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:50,352
...but it'll probably pay for itself
in 15, 20 years max.

782
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,684
What's going on?
I need the water back.

783
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,325
I'm guessing you didn't get
the memo.

784
00:50:56,498 --> 00:51:01,202
I posted it on the fridge late
last night. "Water off, 8 a. m. sharp. "

785
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:05,713
And I don't want you to spiral into
a worry tizzy about the H20.

786
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:08,149
It turns out your water
is pure as driven snow.

787
00:51:08,322 --> 00:51:11,293
It's the pipes that are the problem.
They're completely corroded.

788
00:51:11,462 --> 00:51:12,452
You wanna show him?

789
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,905
I pulled this disgusting piece of pipe
from under your house.

790
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:18,803
Can you see through that?

791
00:51:20,212 --> 00:51:21,510
Yeah, I didn't think so.

792
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:23,879
If that was your artery,
you'd be dead by now.

793
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:27,025
Or one side of your body would be,
like, totally paralyzed.

794
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,663
Show him just exactly what
you plan to replace it with.

795
00:51:34,038 --> 00:51:35,439
This is 1-inch copper piping.

796
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:38,672
I'm gonna use this for the verticals,
half-inch for the horizontals.

797
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,014
Your water pressure's gonna be
hovering at around 150 psi...

798
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:43,349
...give or take a psi.

799
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,017
Is that good?

800
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,567
That is insane.

801
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,842
Insane, huh?
Insane sounds expensive.

802
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:00,348
Hey, Chuck, I like this guy.

803
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:02,892
- He's the best. The best.
- He's funny.

804
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:06,968
All right, fellas,
let's go lay some pipe.

805
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:16,151
Come on, fellas, this way.
Through the bedroom.

806
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,327
So Chuck thinks we should try
the Bradley Method.

807
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:23,162
What's the Bradley Method?

808
00:52:23,336 --> 00:52:25,465
It's natural childbirth.

809
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,234
You know what else
he was telling me?

810
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,573
We should actually consider
a home birth.

811
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:33,953
Home birth? With doctors coming
all in the house and stuff?

812
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:35,786
- Yeah.
- I'm not sure.

813
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,160
Okay. Well, you know,
we could always have a midwife.

814
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:41,232
You mean Chuck?

815
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:42,805
He studied in Switzerland.

816
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:45,001
- So?
- What do you mean, "so"?

817
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:47,648
I don't want him
coming nowhere near you.

818
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:52,087
The thought of Chuck
just makes my stomach hurt.

819
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:57,600
All right. Well, I guess
we'll just have to talk about it later.

820
00:52:58,772 --> 00:53:00,173
Good night.

821
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:03,473
- Chuck.
- Nick.

822
00:53:10,094 --> 00:53:11,620
Chuck.

823
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:19,668
Hey there, little buddy.

824
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:23,012
Chuck making
your stomach hurt too?

825
00:53:23,887 --> 00:53:26,518
Yeah, go ahead,
help yourself. It's okay.

826
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:29,529
You seem like a nice guy.

827
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:32,497
Come to me.

828
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,745
Hey there, little buddy.

829
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,488
You wanna be my friend, don't you?

830
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:44,684
Well, truth be told, I need a-

831
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:10,935
Where is she?

832
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,947
She went to a party
at Danny's house.

833
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,614
Dry-rot Danny?

834
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:30,936
Thanks for picking me up, man.

835
00:55:31,104 --> 00:55:33,701
I remember sneaking out of
my bedroom when I was that age.

836
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:37,983
Sweet, stolen kisses in the night.

837
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,918
- Sometimes more than kisses, right?
- Wrong.

838
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:44,257
- Right? Right?
- Wrong. Wrong.

839
00:55:46,268 --> 00:55:49,069
Whatever they're doing,
I'm sure it's perfectly innocent.

840
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,767
For goodness' sake,
she's almost grown up. She's 15.

841
00:55:51,945 --> 00:55:54,712
She's only 13.
Practically a baby, man.

842
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,856
I really don't wanna have this
conversation with you.

843
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:00,255
Enough of this.

844
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,430
Easy there, partner. That's my wife.

845
00:56:04,937 --> 00:56:06,964
- That's your wife?
- Yeah.

846
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:09,442
- This is your wife?
- Right there.

847
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:22,065
I love the way your family
treats you like an adult.

848
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:26,109
Ever since Mom married Nick,
I've been treated like a kid.

849
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,750
Well, you're way too
grown-up and pretty for that.

850
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,166
- Lindsey.
- Nick?

851
00:56:39,038 --> 00:56:42,272
You're busted. Now, get up,
because you're grounded.

852
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:43,639
And you, you fired.

853
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:47,412
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brah.
Hang loose.

854
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:54,733
Brah. You fired too. And your little
brother. So hang loose with that, brah.

855
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,302
I hate you.

856
00:56:56,472 --> 00:57:00,536
Well, I'm not exactly your biggest fan
right now either. Go wait in the car.

857
00:57:00,714 --> 00:57:02,148
Chuck, let's go.

858
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:09,291
Chuck!

859
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,501
Chuck!

860
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:14,634
Oh, Nick.

861
00:57:22,957 --> 00:57:25,451
That was quite a night last night,
huh, Nick?

862
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:27,291
Hey, Linds-o.

863
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:29,402
Good morning, Lindsey.

864
00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:32,038
Lindsey. Good morning.

865
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:34,076
Good morning.

866
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:36,941
Looks like she's still mad at you.

867
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:40,784
Yeah, well, this ain't
a popularity contest.

868
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:43,553
Nick?

869
00:57:46,002 --> 00:57:49,498
Chuck! Come here, man.

870
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:54,641
Need a hug?

871
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,290
No, I don't need a hug.
I need my floors back.

872
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,756
It's termites, Nick.
Straight up had to go.

873
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:10,749
Want that hug now?

874
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:13,548
I'm getting tired of this.

875
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,666
<i>You have one message.</i>

876
00:58:20,837 --> 00:58:23,809
<i>Mr. Persons,
love the magazine idea.</i>

877
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:27,040
<i>But you are one month late
with the cover.</i>

878
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:29,277
<i>I've stalled the board
as long as I can.</i>

879
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:31,048
<i>Now it's my job on the line.</i>

880
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:35,358
<i>So, Nick, if you can't get Magic,
we'll have to move on.</i>

881
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:38,699
<i>Of course, that means refunding
your substantial cash advance.</i>

882
00:58:38,872 --> 00:58:40,774
<i>I know you understand.</i>

883
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:43,710
<i>Thanks, doll. Call me.</i>

884
00:58:50,663 --> 00:58:55,400
<i>And, wives, let's inhale,
taking in another deep breath.</i>

885
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:57,941
And give it away on sound.

886
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:05,516
There we are.
And wives are now completely relaxed.

887
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:06,819
What's going on here?

888
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:08,586
Nick.

889
00:59:08,765 --> 00:59:10,894
We're doing a sympathetic
breathing and birth-

890
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:12,162
Shut up.

891
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:14,899
I can't believe you're doing this
with him.

892
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:16,944
I can't believe you forgot
about our class.

893
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:19,107
Inhaling and staying in the exercise.

894
00:59:19,285 --> 00:59:22,850
I'm trying to fix our house, which is
supposed to be Chuck's job.

895
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,223
Don't blame Chuck.
He's helping me right now.

896
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:28,426
Big breath. Big breath.

897
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:32,277
By rubbing all on you?

898
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,677
No, Nick, by supporting me.

899
00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:36,546
I support you.

900
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,155
I support her.

901
00:59:38,323 --> 00:59:42,092
I'm just trying to build our dream
house for us and the kids, that's all.

902
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:46,594
Y'all just get back to relaxing.
Rub on the belly or something.

903
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:51,579
You know, one of our mantras,
Nick, is that coupling is participation.

904
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,809
I know.

905
00:59:52,985 --> 00:59:54,978
What we're gonna do now
is take our hand...

906
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:59,996
...and go in a circular motion
around and around...

907
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:05,165
That's the baby's house,
be very gentle. Around.

908
01:00:05,343 --> 01:00:07,279
This may not be
the best time to tell you...

909
01:00:07,447 --> 01:00:09,075
...your house needs
a new foundation.

910
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:12,154
Don't let that interrupt the flow.

911
01:00:12,323 --> 01:00:16,194
- That's it! That's it!
- Nick!

912
01:00:18,301 --> 01:00:20,203
Come on, Nick.

913
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:23,711
Somebody's having a bad day.
Now, be careful with that.

914
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:27,249
That is New England mahogany trim!
I bent over backwards to get it for you.

915
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,446
- What is up, Nick?
- This is what's up.

916
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,853
- You played me!
- No.

917
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,025
You knew this was a piece of junk
the minute you sold it to me.

918
01:00:36,204 --> 01:00:37,832
I knew the minute I met you...

919
01:00:38,006 --> 01:00:41,035
...that this home was meant for you!
You just needed a little push.

920
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:42,648
Well, here's my push.

921
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:46,180
I should warn you, Nick.

922
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:50,023
I am trained in capoeira,
the Brazilian dance of war.

923
01:00:50,197 --> 01:00:53,533
Yeah, I don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

924
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:01,108
Oh, Nick!

925
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:05,415
No!

926
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:10,632
That was a close one. Once it gets
going, man, is it hard to stop.

927
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:14,135
Get off me. You are fired!

928
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:18,583
What? Nick. Nickelback. Come on,
you can't blame me for all this.

929
01:01:18,754 --> 01:01:22,352
No. I can. And I will. And I do!

930
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:25,989
I blame you for everything, Chuck.
It's all your fault.

931
01:01:26,168 --> 01:01:30,199
I'm blaming you for the ozone layer,
global warming, the price on gas.

932
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:31,742
It's all your fault.

933
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:36,718
So get off my property,
get out my face and get out my life.

934
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:41,763
No, no, no, Nick. The good news here
is that all we need is some therapy.

935
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:45,371
Nick, we can work our way
through this, and guess what.

936
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,842
I'm a licensed couples therapist.
I am.

937
01:01:49,013 --> 01:01:52,110
I see this tension happening
between contractors and clients...

938
01:01:52,286 --> 01:01:53,276
...all the time.

939
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:55,288
It's the bread and butter
of my practice.

940
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,520
But just admit this one thing to me.
One thing.

941
01:01:57,696 --> 01:01:59,028
What?

942
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:03,197
You never would've bought
this place if it hadn't been for me.

943
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:04,804
Exactly.

944
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:07,949
Why is that? I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why that is.

945
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:11,286
Because I knew what you didn't.

946
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:15,197
Yes, I knew there was
more work to be done here.

947
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,901
But I also knew the value
of this place.

948
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,698
I knew that when you were done...

949
01:02:19,874 --> 01:02:22,140
...that this was gonna
be a home for your family...

950
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:26,251
...not some stinking house. I got them
up to here, they're a dime a dozen.

951
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,084
But a home, a home, Nick.

952
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,589
This is it.

953
01:02:31,763 --> 01:02:33,323
Your home.

954
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:36,970
Does this look like a home to you?

955
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:42,213
This is a mess!

956
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:45,254
I need you out of here, right now.

957
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:47,559
Well, if you-

958
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:52,294
If you can't see the value of a home
as opposed to a house...

959
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,705
...maybe I'm not your guy.

960
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:06,121
Where y'all going?

961
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,593
It's called loyalty, Mr. Persons.

962
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:12,800
We work for Chuck.
And if he goes, we go.

963
01:03:12,978 --> 01:03:14,606
Well, then go.

964
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:18,345
I don't need none of you.
I can do it myself.

965
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,288
I don't know what you
were thinking, Nick.

966
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,025
You're gonna have to realize that
we're gonna have to hire Chuck back.

967
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:45,333
What? Oh, no, no.
That's never gonna happen, all right?

968
01:03:45,508 --> 01:03:46,875
Nobody takes me for a ride...

969
01:03:47,045 --> 01:03:49,641
...so he's never stepping foot
in this house again.

970
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:53,221
Chuck is caring, and he cares
about this family.

971
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:56,658
What he needs to do is move back
with his own family.

972
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:00,326
It's not normal for a contractor
to live with his clients, Suzanne.

973
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:03,533
I understand that, but it's been
fun having him around, Nick...

974
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:05,339
...and he's great with the kids.

975
01:04:05,514 --> 01:04:09,921
No, he's not. He's the one tearing this
family apart, that's what he's doing.

976
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,028
He's the one tearing
this family apart?

977
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,793
You're the one tearing
this family apart, Nick.

978
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,732
- Me?
- Yes, you.

979
01:04:18,906 --> 01:04:21,969
With your insane obsession
with this house.

980
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:24,515
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

981
01:04:24,685 --> 01:04:26,153
Got the perfect idea.

982
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:28,349
This house is driving
everybody crazy...

983
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:31,258
...so I say we just move on
and cut our losses.

984
01:04:31,432 --> 01:04:33,959
Oh, and where are we gonna go,
Nick, to your condo?

985
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,469
Anywhere but here.

986
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:42,581
Nick. Nick. We cannot keep
uprooting our family like this.

987
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,384
Who was the one crying
that we needed a bigger place?

988
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:47,893
All right? Now, I wouldn't
be stuck with this dump...

989
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:51,162
...if it wasn't for you
and these ungrateful kids.

990
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:53,835
Nick.

991
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:57,240
Suzanne, I didn't mean that. Come-

992
01:04:57,416 --> 01:05:00,479
- Hold on. I didn't mean that.
- No. No. Don't touch me right now.

993
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,251
I'm just under so much pressure.

994
01:05:03,427 --> 01:05:04,862
And I'm not under pressure?

995
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:08,766
I'm the one who's having babies
that I'm not even sure you want.

996
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:25,128
I really think you're overreacting.

997
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:29,442
I think we need to spend
some time apart, Nick.

998
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:32,608
Come on, now.

999
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:36,851
When we first got here, these kids
were not happy about being here...

1000
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:38,689
...but now they're vested in this.

1001
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:42,428
So, what are we gonna do? Just take
that all away because it's difficult?

1002
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:44,335
Is that the thing you
wanna teach Kevin?

1003
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:47,105
That when the going gets tough,
you just quit?

1004
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:51,653
You should try putting that
on the cover of your magazine.

1005
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:55,122
Look at you. I mean,
you quitting on me right now.

1006
01:05:55,296 --> 01:05:59,031
I am not quitting,
I just need time to think.

1007
01:06:01,141 --> 01:06:02,473
Suzanne.

1008
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:05,774
Where you gonna go?

1009
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:14,593
Oh, not you guys too?

1010
01:06:14,968 --> 01:06:16,494
Just cutting our losses.

1011
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,163
Kevin, I know you understand.

1012
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:19,742
Not now, Nick, I'm busy.

1013
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,379
Well, you're gonna thank me
when we out of here.

1014
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:25,583
You city kids and you know it.

1015
01:06:27,158 --> 01:06:29,857
Coco, get in the house.

1016
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:34,166
I said, get in the house,
you ignorant mutt.

1017
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:36,203
Coco!

1018
01:06:41,988 --> 01:06:43,286
Coco.

1019
01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:48,597
I'm sorry.

1020
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:06,796
What you doing?

1021
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:10,742
Jason Winchell caught an 8-pound
bass and brought it to school.

1022
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,712
Well, actually, just the head.

1023
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:16,579
But it was so big, you could fit
your whole hand in its mouth.

1024
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:19,391
Chuck was supposed
to take me fishing.

1025
01:09:19,564 --> 01:09:22,296
That is, until you fired him.

1026
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:25,339
You know what?
Why don't we just go now?

1027
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,710
Really?

1028
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:29,713
Come on. Let's try it.

1029
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:42,569
Hey. I know it's been kind of hard,
making the move and all.

1030
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,043
And I haven't actually been around.

1031
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:48,250
Well, I've been around,
but I haven't been around, around.

1032
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,821
Know what I mean?

1033
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,394
- Yeah.
- Well...

1034
01:09:53,563 --> 01:09:56,433
...I'm here to let you know
that all that's gonna change.

1035
01:09:57,605 --> 01:09:59,268
Because FYI...

1036
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:01,636
...I think you're a cool son.

1037
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:04,345
Thanks.

1038
01:10:05,387 --> 01:10:06,821
And you're a cool dad.

1039
01:10:09,696 --> 01:10:11,096
Kevin!

1040
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:24,449
What was that?

1041
01:10:24,624 --> 01:10:27,289
I don't know.
But he messed with the wrong kid.

1042
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,660
Get him, Nick!

1043
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,728
I got him! Stay back!

1044
01:10:48,906 --> 01:10:51,570
Yeah! You tell Jason Winchell
that the fish he caught...

1045
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:55,377
...wasn't nothing but bait, baby!
Yeah!

1046
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:01,288
Hey, hey. Hold up.

1047
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:03,126
Forgetting something.

1048
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,328
Lunch money.

1049
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:07,839
Thanks. Bye.

1050
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:13,117
- How's your mother?
- She's fine.

1051
01:11:13,988 --> 01:11:16,892
You're not gonna have
a heart attack out here, are you?

1052
01:11:17,428 --> 01:11:20,298
If I do, just pull my body
behind the shed.

1053
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:22,594
My pleasure.

1054
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,542
Lindsey.

1055
01:11:25,711 --> 01:11:28,842
I know you're still mad at me,
but I'm trying to get it right.

1056
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:32,980
It's a new family, a new house.
It's all new to me.

1057
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:35,960
But I'll try to be
more understanding.

1058
01:11:36,132 --> 01:11:40,095
Okay, okay, okay. I probably should've
handled the party a little differently.

1059
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:44,740
I'm sorry, Nick.
I should've asked you.

1060
01:11:45,617 --> 01:11:47,678
Does this mean
I can see Danny again?

1061
01:11:48,656 --> 01:11:50,455
Don't push it.

1062
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:53,528
Go ahead and make your bus.

1063
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:57,364
- Good morning, Mr. Rooney.
- Hey, hi, sweetie.

1064
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:03,548
Hey. This is for you.
Thought maybe you could use this.

1065
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:05,447
How's the house coming?

1066
01:12:05,757 --> 01:12:07,089
It's coming.

1067
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:08,785
Hey, how is Chuck doing?

1068
01:12:08,963 --> 01:12:10,226
Don't know and don't care.

1069
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:15,101
Boy, I hope he's okay.
This is a tough time of year for him.

1070
01:12:15,475 --> 01:12:16,808
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1071
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:20,349
His wife. He lost his wife a few years
back around this time of year.

1072
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,223
You didn't know, did you?

1073
01:12:24,026 --> 01:12:26,588
Oh, yeah, she was
really something special.

1074
01:12:26,965 --> 01:12:28,901
He's never been the same since.

1075
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:31,802
She was his entire world.

1076
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:53,242
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1077
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:55,280
I heard about Ellie.

1078
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:58,717
Come in.

1079
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:20,531
Hey, I got a little organic
herbal maté going here.

1080
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:22,298
Thanks.

1081
01:13:23,443 --> 01:13:26,938
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, shoot.

1082
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:30,389
When I was working on
your home with you...

1083
01:13:30,557 --> 01:13:32,150
...to me...

1084
01:13:32,928 --> 01:13:34,864
...it felt like family.

1085
01:13:35,032 --> 01:13:40,498
It felt like the special stuff,
you know? The stuff you hang on to.

1086
01:13:40,676 --> 01:13:43,739
Stuff that's gone missing
around here for quite some time.

1087
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:45,817
It's funny, I...

1088
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:49,583
I can't even go inside anymore.

1089
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:53,398
Look, Nick...

1090
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:56,403
...I know I screwed your life up.

1091
01:13:56,574 --> 01:14:01,140
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,
you got no idea.

1092
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,719
You didn't screw my life up.

1093
01:14:03,889 --> 01:14:05,620
I did.

1094
01:14:06,594 --> 01:14:09,121
And you'll always
be a part of my family.

1095
01:14:14,009 --> 01:14:16,741
I actually came over here
to make sure you was okay.

1096
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:21,453
I was so upset about how things
were going over at your place, I just...

1097
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:26,998
I went ahead and let Magic know that
you really, really need to speak to him.

1098
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:31,107
Man, that's great. That's great, man.
I really need it.

1099
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:34,372
While I was at it, I also happened
to have put my Realtor's cap on...

1100
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:36,484
...and I made a couple
of phone calls.

1101
01:14:36,653 --> 01:14:38,953
I got a Russian banker
coming out here next Friday.

1102
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:40,752
Just might be very motivated.

1103
01:14:40,928 --> 01:14:44,298
If you get the roof up on that place,
you might be able to flip it.

1104
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:48,272
Get out from underneath
the whole thing.

1105
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:51,075
Well, let me get the roof on.

1106
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:55,923
Do you have a nail gun with the
air compressor? The whole unit?

1107
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,220
No. I'm old-school with it.

1108
01:14:58,395 --> 01:15:02,564
Oh, you're doing it old-school
between now and next Friday?

1109
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:06,271
Maybe just borrow mine.
That'd be good.

1110
01:15:07,013 --> 01:15:10,417
Thanks, Chuck.
Thanks for everything.

1111
01:15:10,819 --> 01:15:12,311
You got it.

1112
01:15:42,582 --> 01:15:46,352
You can ground me later,
but right now, you need help.

1113
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:56,673
Mr. P, the little Pulu
has something to tell you.

1114
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:02,247
I'm sorry about the party.

1115
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:05,156
I should have never taken
Lindsey without asking you.

1116
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,187
You got that right.

1117
01:16:07,598 --> 01:16:09,830
And if it's all right with you...

1118
01:16:10,003 --> 01:16:12,667
...me and my brothers would
really like to finish this job.

1119
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,818
Hey, fellas! I got some great news.
Tremendous news.

1120
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,984
We are not just working
on a house anymore.

1121
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:26,430
From now on, we're committing
to finishing a home.

1122
01:16:27,036 --> 01:16:30,236
You heard it, baby.
We're gonna finish Nick's home.

1123
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:32,174
Check that for dry rot.

1124
01:16:32,815 --> 01:16:35,878
You. I'm so darn proud
of you right now.

1125
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:39,185
You're making me feel a little
"Nickeladocious," I'm not gonna lie.

1126
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,958
I just wanna give you a hug on your
Nickelback, my old "Nickabocker. "

1127
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,967
My Nick at Nite.

1128
01:16:45,573 --> 01:16:47,007
Enough!

1129
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,777
Well, you caught me just
in the "Nick o' time. "

1130
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:53,711
Is it a blessing or a curse?

1131
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:46,625
Go ahead, try it.

1132
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,161
Let's go. Hey, hey, hey.

1133
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:03,616
- Suzanne.
- Nick.

1134
01:18:03,792 --> 01:18:06,593
Now, before you say anything,
I need to get this out, okay?

1135
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:10,067
- Okay.
- Now, you was right, and I was a fool.

1136
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,140
The house is just a house...

1137
01:18:13,111 --> 01:18:15,674
...and it'd never be a home
without you and the kids and-

1138
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:19,311
- Yes, baby, I get it.
- I'm almost finished.

1139
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:23,123
Would you please consider forgiving
me and coming back home?

1140
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:24,624
Babies.

1141
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:27,567
Babies? You know, we can work
on that once you drop those two.

1142
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:29,299
I don't think it's
a good idea to-

1143
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,141
- Babies.
- Babies?

1144
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:35,113
- Babies, Nick!
- Oh, babies!

1145
01:18:35,288 --> 01:18:38,158
Okay. Let me get you to the car.
Come on. Come on.

1146
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:40,628
- Honey, how far is the hospital?
- About a half-hour.

1147
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,291
Nick, we can't wait that long!

1148
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:45,999
We gotta. That's where the doctors
and nurses and all the equipment-

1149
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:49,376
- You're hurting my hand now.
- Honey, it is happening now!

1150
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,916
- Now?
- Now!

1151
01:18:51,086 --> 01:18:53,579
Okay, kids, get them bags
in the house.

1152
01:18:53,758 --> 01:18:57,458
Look, your mom about to have what
she always wanted, a home birth.

1153
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,799
Oh, Nick. I love the floors. Teak?

1154
01:19:01,974 --> 01:19:04,274
Oh, no. That's bubinga.

1155
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:11,515
Nick, slow it down. I'm hot, honey.
I'm hot. Get it off.

1156
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:13,252
Well, what now?

1157
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,525
I don't know. I thought you knew.

1158
01:19:19,241 --> 01:19:20,972
What you trying to say, baby?

1159
01:19:21,145 --> 01:19:22,408
Chuck!

1160
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:26,145
Chuck? I'll go this way!
I'll go this way!

1161
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:28,484
Oh, Nick, I'm gonna kill you.

1162
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:31,358
- For what?
- You did this to me.

1163
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,665
Hello? Nickster, how we-?

1164
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,434
You what?

1165
01:19:40,282 --> 01:19:46,090
Okay. Keep this line open.
Chuck is in the truck.

1166
01:19:57,616 --> 01:19:59,916
Oh, come on!

1167
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,368
Okay.

1168
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:10,770
Baby, is he on his way?

1169
01:20:10,942 --> 01:20:12,844
That was him.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

1170
01:20:13,013 --> 01:20:14,880
- Everything gonna be fine.
- Are you sure?

1171
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,986
Go wait for Chuck downstairs.

1172
01:20:24,669 --> 01:20:28,268
Hello? Nick? Chuck had
a little trouble with the truck.

1173
01:20:28,443 --> 01:20:29,934
But don't worry, I'm on my way.

1174
01:20:30,114 --> 01:20:31,548
Man, just tell me what to do.

1175
01:20:31,716 --> 01:20:35,850
Okay, now, tell Suzanne to
stay calm, and to breathe.

1176
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:38,086
Okay, you got to stay
calm and breathe.

1177
01:20:38,262 --> 01:20:39,788
- I'm breathing.
- She's breathing.

1178
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:41,161
Now tell her to relax.

1179
01:20:41,335 --> 01:20:44,535
Maybe do the color imaging
we worked so very hard on.

1180
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:46,268
Baby, relax!

1181
01:20:46,445 --> 01:20:47,538
Honey, I'm relaxing.

1182
01:20:47,715 --> 01:20:50,185
- Don't yell at me!
- Honey, I'm not yelling!

1183
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:52,916
Keep her breathing, Nick.
Put Lindsey on the phone, please.

1184
01:20:53,259 --> 01:20:55,161
- He wants to talk to you.
- Why?

1185
01:20:56,532 --> 01:20:59,436
- Who knows? Here.
- Hey, Chuck.

1186
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,575
I want you to listen very carefully.

1187
01:21:01,742 --> 01:21:03,371
I need you to grab me some things.

1188
01:21:03,546 --> 01:21:05,982
<i>I need a bucket of hot water,
an oral thermometer...</i>

1189
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:10,147
...latex gloves, towels, a shoestring
and some jalapeño hot sauce.

1190
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:12,658
Hot sauce?

1191
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:14,767
Get that for me.
Put Nick on the phone.

1192
01:21:14,935 --> 01:21:16,802
<i>- Okay, Chuck.
- I am almost there.</i>

1193
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,944
I want you to go into the bathroom
and get some hand sanitizer.

1194
01:21:20,112 --> 01:21:21,273
Don't tell me what to do.

1195
01:21:21,447 --> 01:21:24,476
I'm gonna go in the bathroom
and find the hand sanitizer.

1196
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:26,987
Okay, got it. What now?

1197
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:29,322
We're gonna use that
to sterilize your hands.

1198
01:21:29,497 --> 01:21:30,863
Why? I'm not touching nothing.

1199
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:32,360
Nick, you are.

1200
01:21:32,536 --> 01:21:35,565
Oh, God, they're coming! Honey?

1201
01:21:37,312 --> 01:21:39,545
How far apart would you say
the contractions are?

1202
01:21:39,717 --> 01:21:42,187
Fast and furious, Chuck.
Fast and furious.

1203
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:44,382
Pillow! I need a pillow.

1204
01:21:44,559 --> 01:21:45,926
Okay, game time, baby.

1205
01:21:46,096 --> 01:21:50,002
Go down there and see if
the first baby is crowning.

1206
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,537
Come on, man, what that mean?

1207
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:53,904
Can you see the baby?

1208
01:22:00,324 --> 01:22:02,190
Oh, God.

1209
01:22:02,362 --> 01:22:04,160
It's like the guppies all over again.

1210
01:22:04,331 --> 01:22:06,062
- Honey?
- Chuck, he's down.

1211
01:22:06,235 --> 01:22:08,432
That's what the
jalapeño hot sauce is for.

1212
01:22:08,607 --> 01:22:10,770
Give him a little dash of that.

1213
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:13,582
Hold on.

1214
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:23,357
He's back.

1215
01:22:23,536 --> 01:22:26,804
<i>- Put your father back on the phone.
- Yeah.</i>

1216
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:30,711
I need you to go in there,
grab that baby's head, gently.

1217
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:32,581
For God's sake, gently.

1218
01:22:32,988 --> 01:22:37,122
Give it a pull. Then take the
shoestring and tie off the cord.

1219
01:22:37,697 --> 01:22:42,901
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello? Hello?

1220
01:22:44,677 --> 01:22:47,672
I lost him. Are you sure
you don't wanna try a hospital?

1221
01:22:49,387 --> 01:22:51,254
Guess that means no.

1222
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:54,988
Oh, so close. I just missed
the state record. Let's-

1223
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:57,328
- How's the patient doing here?
- Oh, Chuck.

1224
01:22:57,503 --> 01:22:58,937
Let's go into our fun breathing.

1225
01:22:59,105 --> 01:23:01,668
Let's go into a deep, warm place,
and a quiet place.

1226
01:23:01,845 --> 01:23:04,145
Okay, quiet and deep.

1227
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:10,785
Family, let's breathe together.

1228
01:23:12,365 --> 01:23:13,731
Now we're releasing on sound.

1229
01:23:16,907 --> 01:23:19,936
Nick, I can't take that noise.
I can't take that noise.

1230
01:23:20,114 --> 01:23:22,778
Hey, look, I'm having a baby.
I can't talk right now.

1231
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:26,722
- Yo, Nick, it's Earvin Johnson.
- Magic?

1232
01:23:26,894 --> 01:23:28,796
Chuck Mitchell said you need
to talk to me.

1233
01:23:28,964 --> 01:23:31,561
Look, my wife having a baby
right now. We can't talk.

1234
01:23:31,737 --> 01:23:34,573
I remember when I had mine.

1235
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:37,914
Yup. That's how I remembered it.

1236
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:42,956
Tell Magic Chuck-dog said,
"Holler. Much respect. You the man. "

1237
01:23:43,126 --> 01:23:46,587
Chuck-dog said,
"Much respect. You the man. "

1238
01:23:46,766 --> 01:23:49,101
Tell Chuck-dog he's the man.

1239
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,733
Yo, Chuck, he said you the man.

1240
01:23:51,909 --> 01:23:53,378
Oh, natch. That's so Magic.

1241
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:56,746
Hey, man, what's up with the
Lakers, man? Y'all need a center.

1242
01:23:56,919 --> 01:23:58,445
He wants to talk to you, Chuck.

1243
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:00,353
Roundy-round. Roundy-round.

1244
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:01,825
Hello?

1245
01:24:01,996 --> 01:24:03,932
You got your hands full over there.

1246
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,502
Ask Nick if he has
any more questions for me.

1247
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:09,142
You have any questions
for the greatest point guard...

1248
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,642
...in the history of the NBA?

1249
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:14,044
Oh, yeah. In that '85 series
against the Celtics...

1250
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,383
...was that a true crossover?
Because it looked-

1251
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:17,992
Knock it off!

1252
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:20,290
So gotta go. Bye, Buck.

1253
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:22,959
- I need you, baby.
- Look, it's showtime now, okay?

1254
01:24:23,137 --> 01:24:27,579
- We got this. We got this. All right?
- Okay. We got this. Okay.

1255
01:24:30,919 --> 01:24:33,116
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1256
01:24:36,765 --> 01:24:37,960
Told you it'd be beautiful.

1257
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:44,311
Oh, before I forget, I got you
kind of a homewarming gift.

1258
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,175
All the best.

1259
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:50,148
Yo, Chuck.

1260
01:24:52,395 --> 01:24:54,524
Thanks for coming back, man.

1261
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,368
You kidding me?
I'm stuck on you, Nick.

1262
01:25:16,976 --> 01:25:18,377
<i>And so it goes.</i>

1263
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:21,176
<i>You know, sometimes life
throws you a changeup...</i>

1264
01:25:21,352 --> 01:25:24,118
<i>...and you've just got to adjust.</i>

1265
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,097
<i>I never did finish
the sports magazine.</i>

1266
01:25:30,269 --> 01:25:33,366
<i>Instead, I started something
completely different.</i>

1267
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:36,673
<i>A different magazine,
a lot closer to my heart...</i>

1268
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:39,251
<i>...inspired by rebuilding this house.</i>

1269
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,483
<i>It's called Are We Done Yet?</i>

1270
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:46,361
And that's the story on how
we built our dream house.

1271
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:50,440
Thank you.

1272
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:57,518
So I want to thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the party.

1273
01:26:31,905 --> 01:26:41,318
THE END
