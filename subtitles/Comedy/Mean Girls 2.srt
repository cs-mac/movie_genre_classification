1
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:32,255
There are times in your Iife
when you find yourseIf

2
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,621
in very awkward situations.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,194
I mean, just look at that face, Jo.

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,092
Abby needs you.

5
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,698
We need you.

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,630
And we're willing to pay.

7
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,003
And this wouId
be one of those moments.

8
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:51,268
But I swear, it's not Iike I'm
seIIing my kidney or anything.

9
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,401
AIthough, that wouId
have been Iess painfuI.

10
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,240
But I'm getting ahead of myseIf.

11
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,246
Let me start at the beginning.

12
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:01,716
And it's the big day,
the qualifying race of the lndy 500.

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,718
- She takes her position...
- This is my dad.

14
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,016
...revs the motor
of her stock car, hoping...

15
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:09,354
To not crash and burn on
the last lap of adolescence.

16
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:13,863
- Oh, that's my girl.
- Dad buiIt engines for race cars.

17
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,364
And so did I.

18
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,868
Ignore the pigtaiIs.
I was more naïve back then.

19
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,905
Because of his work,
I changed schooIs

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,101
two times a year
for the past eight years.

21
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,270
This doesn't make me a Ioner

22
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:32,508
with a highIy evoIved
defense mechanism or anything.

23
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,016
OK, fine, it does.

24
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:38,881
Today, everything
was about to change.

25
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,514
It was my first day
at North Shore High,

26
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,856
the Iast stop before
Carnegie MeIIon University,

27
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,657
my dream schooI.

28
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:49,266
My ruIes of survivaI were simpIe:

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't stand out,
never raise your hand in cIass

30
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:55,999
and watch your back at aII times.

31
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:01,107
New town, same schooI,
same parking Iot.

32
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:04,612
Everyone obsessed
with the freedom of their first car.

33
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,742
It's an identity, Iike the muscIe cars
who think they own the road,

34
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:10,979
and check out every passing vehicIe.

35
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:16,349
Smart cars who don't fit in.

36
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,997
The ''I'm so perky I might
shake off my tube top'' cutesy cars.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,401
And then there's the most
dangerous vehicIe on the road,

38
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:30,064
the high-performance,
high-maintenance sports cars.

39
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,812
If they Iiked you,
your Iife was aII green Iights.

40
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,644
- Hi.
- Hi.

41
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,149
If they didn't,

42
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,345
you were nothing more than
a wreck on the side of the road.

43
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,294
At North Shore,
they were caIIed the PIastics,

44
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:00,063
and Mandi WeatherIy
was the number one PIastic.

45
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:03,867
She dotted her name with a
signature heart above the ''i.''

46
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:07,842
ProbabIy because she didn't
actuaIIy possess that organ.

47
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,539
Her two sidekicks were Chastity Meyer,

48
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:15,050
who was stupid enough to hit a home
run with any boy wiIIing to pIay,

49
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,780
and Hope PIotkin, uber-hypochondriac,

50
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,517
who beIieved that germs Ied to ugIiness,
and ugIiness Ied to death.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,763
And thus, my number one ruIe
for survivaI: no girI drama.

52
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:30,296
ActuaIIy, no drama, period.

53
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:33,164
Please, please, don't be ruined!

54
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,795
And in high schooI,
an aIready embarrassing moment

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,032
can go from bad...

56
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,373
...to worse.

57
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,811
- Are you OK?
- How bad do I look?

58
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,346
She couIdn't have Iooked worse.

59
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,713
- You look great.
- Really? Thanks.

60
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,047
I'm Abby Hanover.
Yeah, you must be new.

61
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:51,484
I'm part of the welcoming committee.

62
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:52,816
Well, there's only
two of us really and...

63
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,017
...and I'd... I'd love
to show you around.

64
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,158
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,302
Listen, I think I can find my way
to the front office, thanks.

66
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:09,532
So, Jo, I see your dad's big in NASCAR.

67
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,471
Well, let me set your mind at ease.

68
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,670
We know how to deal with
celebrities here at North Shore.

69
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,442
One of our lunch ladies was
on the first season of American IdoI.

70
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,485
- Good to know.
- Yeah, it was pretty hot.

71
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,554
And we're also aware
of your many moves.

72
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,020
OK.

73
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:28,421
'Cause we're aware that students
who move around a lot

74
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,461
often wind up as
serial killers or actors.

75
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:35,464
Hey, did I mention we have
an excellent drama department?

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,067
I'm not really into drama,

77
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,726
but I do know you have
an advanced shop class.

78
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,200
Menial laborer rather than intellectual.

79
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,207
I can respect that.

80
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,040
The cheerIeading squad

81
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,911
wiII be going to the pubIic Iibrary
for a fieId trip.

82
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,780
Now, Iast year,
we had some probIems with that,

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
where we had 1 2 girIs go,

84
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,614
and we had 1 5 girIs come back.

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,557
I know how much you aII Iove vampires,

86
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,993
but remember,
the schooI nurse wiII be

87
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:10,999
heading up the bIood drive,
so sign up for that now.

88
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,271
Home Ec's down the hall, miss.

89
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,376
Actually, as refreshingly sexist
as that is,

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,535
I'm here for Advanced Shop.

91
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,739
- Drafting class.
- Right.

92
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,180
Well, we lost Mike
to that circular saw incident,

93
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:30,082
so you can be Tyler's partner.

94
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,019
OK, everybody,
get started on your birdhouses.

95
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:35,788
Trusses or triangles, I don't care.

96
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:39,054
That's about all
I can deal with right now.

97
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,522
- Hey, Tyler, I'm Jo.
- Hey.

98
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,966
- What's his deal?
- Well, Mr. Giamatti

99
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:49,197
bleeds Texas A&M maroon and white,
and they lost Saturday.

100
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,207
lf they want to be taken seriously,
they better beat the Longhorns.

101
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:53,708
Don't let Giamatti hear you say that.

102
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:57,346
And just when a guy seems aII dreamy

103
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,972
and has eyes you can faII into...

104
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:02,711
So we have to build
a lame birdhouse.

105
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,514
I guess you could decorate it.

106
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:09,115
...he opens his mouth
and sounds Iike an ass.

107
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,195
Wow, thanks.

108
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,500
But I was thinking I could
carve the dovetail joint.

109
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:19,159
- I'm impressed.
- That makes one of us.

110
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,701
In every schooI,
students have their Iunch gang.

111
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:31,611
As my dad says, your racer
is onIy as good as your pit crew.

112
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:34,742
Cutest dog ever, Mandi!

113
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,286
Thanks! Coco Chanel really
sets off my new purse.

114
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,356
You had her checked for rabies, right?

115
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:42,755
Too bad you couldn't get
the new Prada bag with the fringe.

116
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,326
Would've totally matched her brown fur.

117
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,623
Hello! Fringe is so out.

118
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:50,359
And I'm at the top of the wait list for
the new patent leather Prada satchel.

119
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:53,265
But you've already waited,
like, six months for the fringe...

120
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:56,271
Of course, Mandi,
fringe is so past tense.

121
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,671
Vogue says crimson
is the new accessory,

122
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,174
and you're totally
gonna rock that look.

123
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,835
Oh, I know.

124
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,074
Lost much, little freshies? Scram.

125
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,048
Ten dogs in a minute. Let's do this!

126
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:10,210
You guys are goin' down.
We're gonna win, come on.

127
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:13,050
- Yeah. Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

128
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,851
- Nick, focus!
- Come on, man.

129
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,687
Chastity, stop drooling.

130
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,886
You know what Mandi
thinks about you and Tyler.

131
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,825
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,998
Do not play dumb with me.

133
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,036
I don't have to play dumb.

134
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,303
Besides, the cashier
totally sneezed on your salad.

135
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:40,047
Pay up, you two losers.

136
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,316
God, Nick is just so nasty.

137
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,448
I'm only dating him 'cause he's probably
getting a full ride to UCLA.

138
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:49,991
You know, one week in LA and I'll be

139
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:53,290
a bikini model-hyphen-reality star
hyphen-awesome!

140
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,297
- I heard Amy Hall is totally into him.
- Oh, she wouldn't dare.

141
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,301
Nickie, over here. I missed you.

142
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:05,600
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, have you been lifting weights?

143
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,208
Oh, dude, your rat-dog just tongued me.

144
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,144
Shut up, Nick.
You'll hurt Coco Chanel's feelings.

145
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,411
No groping south of the equator.

146
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:16,815
Or north, creep.

147
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,386
Wow, the hot chick can
really handle herself.

148
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,391
Wonder what else she can handle.

149
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,168
- Who the hell is she?
- Her name is Jo, Jo Mitchell.

150
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,896
She's in my bio class.

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,167
Somebody said she came somewhere,
from, like, Florida or Texas.

152
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,109
Then I also heard that she's
an exchange student from Russia.

153
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,339
Oh, what did they exchange her for?

154
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,709
She's kinda pretty, don't you think?

155
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:51,083
Well...

156
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:52,746
...if you're into pleather.

157
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,222
Hello, there. Hi, Coco Chanel.

158
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:59,693
Go back to Mandi, go on.
Go, go, go.

159
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,658
All right, just a little bit.

160
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,361
Where's Coco Chanel?

161
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,341
Bad little girl.

162
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,018
Oh, my God! Who did that?

163
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,521
- Who fed Coco Chanel?
- It was Abby.

164
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,525
- Abby did it.
- You? Again?

165
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,263
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I'm really sorry, Mandi!

166
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
I'll buy you another purse.

167
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,868
Or you can just have mine.

168
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,767
Is that what I think it is?

169
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,739
- Duck.
- I love ducks.

170
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,503
It's the Prada fringe purse.

171
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:50,205
My dad got it for me last month, but...

172
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:54,511
Last month? Just go!

173
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,849
Stay down there,
and don't ever look at me again.

174
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,695
Better yet,
don't even breathe the same air.

175
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,682
Hey. Well, how was it?

176
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,620
I saw a girl become
roadkill in the cafeteria.

177
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,655
Gotta love high school.

178
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,658
Speaking of my escape, has my
Carnegie Mellon application arrived?

179
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:38,557
Hey, you know, I was lookin' today,

180
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:42,325
and I saw that the University of Ohio
has a great architectural program.

181
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,331
You could stay close to home,

182
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:48,097
transform Toledo
into an architectural wonderland.

183
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:51,431
Dad, what's going on?

184
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,975
I'm applying early decision
at Carnegie Mellon.

185
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,942
What do you wanna go there for, huh?

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,413
They don't even have a good mascot.
I mean, a Scottish terrier.

187
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,246
Who's gonna be intimidated by that?
Plus, you...

188
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,045
You qualify for in-state tuition here.

189
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,949
Oh, my God.

190
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,958
What happened to my tuition?!

191
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:17,156
Jo... Look, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:20,298
I kept hoping that
the market would rebound,

193
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,029
but my investments are in the tank,

194
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:23,730
and now NASCAR sponsors
have cut spending...

195
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,104
Then make them un-cut spending!

196
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,540
Mom went to Carnegie Mellon,
I... I have to go there.

197
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,807
- She loved it!
- I know, I know.

198
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,716
I'm sorry I let you down.

199
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:41,214
I know you're disappointed,
Jo, and that's OK.

200
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,220
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong.

201
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,764
Strong? I was trying not to panic.

202
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,131
But when you've moved
as much as I have,

203
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,760
you kinda get attached to the idea

204
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:58,033
of settIing down in one pIace
for four years.

205
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,804
In this case, my mother's aIma mater.

206
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:05,972
My dad and I have been
on our own for a Iong time.

207
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,346
My mom died before I was one.

208
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:13,479
So Iife wasn't exactIy your typicaI
warm and fuzzy greeting card.

209
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,160
But I wasn't the onIy one
in my own personaI heII.

210
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:21,723
Abby was hoping
that her swoIIen, bIack ankIe

211
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:26,063
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

212
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:34,239
And it might have been...
if not for the two's Iong history.

213
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:38,213
JeaIousy is a funny thing.

214
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:41,010
They had Iived across
from each other for years.

215
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,483
And whiIe Mandi
seemingIy had everything...

216
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,080
...Abby had more.
She had two parents

217
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,284
who went a IittIe overboard
for their darIing Abby.

218
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:54,592
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

219
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,892
Mandi's was cooI,

220
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,702
but Abby's was three stories high.

221
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,532
Yay!

222
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:07,904
Then, the French RevoIution
HaIIoween meItdown at age 1 1.

223
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:11,412
Mandi fIaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

224
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:14,210
untiI she spotted Abby's
utterIy perfect,

225
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,878
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royaI gown.

226
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:25,560
And finaIIy, the great
bra incident of junior high.

227
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,596
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

228
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:31,326
WeII, that had more to do with nature.

229
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:34,631
StiII, Mandi might have
found someone eIse to hate,

230
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:38,263
if Abby hadn't done the unthinkabIe.

231
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:44,605
Mandi, oh, my God! Someone
has a better parking space than us.

232
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:48,240
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

233
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:50,250
I guess you're number two now.

234
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:53,185
Two? Two?

235
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:55,883
Mandi hated being number two.

236
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,556
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

237
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,662
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

238
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:09,794
Chastity.

239
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,640
- Hey.
- Anything.

240
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,508
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

241
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,741
Trained in Java and C++.

242
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,647
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

243
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:26,051
and I do a little salsa
for the ladies.

244
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:28,986
How can I be of service?

245
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,294
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross!

246
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:42,769
Abby Scabby's face looks as red and
pussy as it did in seventh grade.

247
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,840
Zit cream much?

248
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:49,173
Mandi was creative,
ruthIess, unreIenting.

249
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:53,272
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

250
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:02,623
And this was just the beginning.

251
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,463
Brutal.

252
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,026
You know, most girls
would have laughed,

253
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:16,639
texted back or posted a status update.

254
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,832
Do I look like most girls?

255
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,019
Oh, God.

256
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,255
What a paint job!

257
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,262
Need another one?

258
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,338
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

259
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:53,765
I don't bite.

260
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,391
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,629
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

262
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:39,586
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

263
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:43,159
I gave Abby a ride home from school,
and she dropped this.

264
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,557
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

265
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:47,857
She had an accident, didn't she?
Was she hurt?

266
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:51,627
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

267
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:55,204
Again? I knew we should
have sent her to St. Mary's.

268
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,537
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

269
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:05,676
She's a wreck.

270
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,842
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

271
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:11,579
I'll buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

272
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:14,088
Money's not gonna fix this, Sidney.

273
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:17,990
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

274
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:20,790
lf only she had some friends.

275
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,140
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

276
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:38,907
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

277
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,142
I mean, just look at that face.

278
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:43,275
She needs you. We need you.

279
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,115
And we're willing to pay.

280
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:48,019
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

281
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:52,094
Two, three, 4,000 to get you started.

282
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:54,595
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

283
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:57,131
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

284
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,827
And if I can't buy my daughter's
happiness, then what is it worth?

285
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,134
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

286
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:09,211
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

287
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,245
There must be something you want.

288
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,680
Some dream I can help come true.

289
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:18,811
A new car? A trip to Europe? College?

290
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,054
College.

291
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:26,026
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

292
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:29,963
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

293
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,559
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

294
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:35,136
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

295
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,433
I guarantee you'll be happy you did.

296
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,941
And just for trying, I'll buy your
college books for freshman year,

297
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:45,514
which are yours to keep, no questions
asked, as my little gift to you.

298
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,045
Sidney was pretty convincing,

299
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:52,212
and I shouId have reaIized why.

300
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,949
He was the king of infomerciaIs.

301
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,288
He couId seII anything
from meat juicers to cat toiIets

302
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,827
to my coIIege tuition.

303
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,088
I knew it was crazy.

304
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:04,359
But Abby'd have a good senior year,

305
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:08,403
and I'd get my dream
of Carnegie MeIIon University.

306
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:12,773
I figured, who wouId it hurt?

307
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,873
Four hundred people already viewed it.

308
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,344
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

309
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,781
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone comes through.

310
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,749
Especially fathers and doctors.

311
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,253
Not my legs, Chastity, my face.

312
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,084
Getting all red and splotchy.

313
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,493
- What?
- You're never gonna believe this.

314
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,893
What do you mean?

315
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:39,058
Someone posted a link
on your page to another video.

316
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:43,070
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

317
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:47,472
Who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

318
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,636
There's tons of comments.

319
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:55,274
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

320
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,349
So she's hot.

321
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,353
She's well-connected.

322
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,924
I mean, she's pretty much one of us.

323
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,186
So we'll just need
to make it very clear that,

324
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:08,855
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people that we like.

325
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,330
Agreed?

326
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:20,468
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

327
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,669
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

328
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:26,043
God, I am not up for
the paparazzi this morning.

329
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:32,046
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

330
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:35,180
I'm Mandi, with an ''i.''
And you're Jo, right?

331
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,226
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

332
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:41,626
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

333
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:43,596
- Us.
- The reaI weIcoming committee

334
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,757
had arrived.

335
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:48,098
- And who not to.
- Did I say ''weIcoming?''

336
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:53,968
Wow. Thanks.

337
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,578
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

338
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,945
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

339
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,712
- Excuse me?
- But I'm a benevolent dictator,

340
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:08,586
so why don't we discuss over a non-fat,
no-sugar raspberry Frappuccino

341
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,216
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

342
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,591
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

343
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,324
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

344
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:18,024
I'll have to pass.

345
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:21,103
Oh, it wasn't a question.

346
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:24,138
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

347
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,338
Oh, my God. Hi.

348
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:31,072
I'm Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

349
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:35,116
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

350
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:38,584
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

351
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:42,681
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

352
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,021
I wrote one article on school uniforms,

353
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,857
and she put strawberries in my yogurt.

354
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,727
How horrible for you?

355
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:52,562
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

356
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:56,729
swelled up like a big Arothron hispidus.
That's a blowfish.

357
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:59,467
Be careful, Jo.

358
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,635
Thanks, but I'm not that worried.

359
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,246
Hey, what's up?

360
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:15,187
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

361
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:18,192
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

362
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:22,424
Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

363
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:25,659
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

364
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,771
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

365
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:31,396
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

366
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,873
so you're off the hook.

367
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,672
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

368
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:44,285
Registration for AP test has closed.

369
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,979
Now...

370
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,887
Now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore

371
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:53,655
is to use the Homecoming Dance...

372
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:58,727
...to fund-raise for charity, OK?

373
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:03,570
'Cause otherwise you all
would just think

374
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:06,039
the world revolves around
you and football.

375
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,737
And it doesn't, OK?

376
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,244
I toId you not to waIk in front of...

377
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,941
Babe, I already chose your tuxedo,
rented the limo and...

378
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:17,110
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

379
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,914
Mandi, you are so
winning Homecoming Queen.

380
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:20,579
Totally winning.

381
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:24,122
...the schooI nurse wiII
be heading up the bIood drive,

382
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,285
- so sign up for that now.
- Please.

383
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,796
Like I'm letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

384
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,665
I know!
And no matter what I said...

385
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,203
Hey, do you know
where I could catch the bus?

386
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,068
I think it just left.

387
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,700
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

388
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:45,542
Do you know any good auto parts
shops? I've gotta get a new spark plug.

389
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:50,409
Well, I... I think there's Pete's Auto
right next to the coffee joint.

390
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:52,453
I could give you a ride if you want.

391
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,955
I mean, I really owe you one anyway.

392
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:57,082
Sweet, thanks.

393
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:06,796
Oh, look, it's Jo! Hey, Jo!

394
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,062
Hey.

395
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,734
She's with Abby Hanover!

396
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,399
Hi.

397
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:32,788
Thanks for the lift.

398
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,564
Do you wanna come inside?

399
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:40,601
I'll probably break something,
but... but sure.

400
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:51,739
- Who's that?
- My mom.

401
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:55,750
She's really pretty.

402
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:01,718
Yeah. She was.

403
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:06,995
What are these?

404
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:13,195
That's the Sydney Harbor Bridge
and a skyscraper I've been designing.

405
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:16,100
Kind of hard to tell,
I'm a crappy artist.

406
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,969
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

407
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:22,510
You're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

408
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:25,546
You should see my paintings sometime.

409
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,707
Actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

410
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:29,716
No, that'd be really cool.

411
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,857
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

412
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:46,057
My gosh, is that a friend?

413
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:50,298
Maybe you were right.
Girls aren't so bad after all.

414
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:54,701
Hello, Mr. Winkle!

415
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:59,440
Are those illegal parts? I'll bet you're
running a chop shop over there.

416
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:03,040
Well, I've installed security cameras,
and I'll be watching you.

417
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,881
You hear?

418
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,417
Goodbye, Mr. Winkle.

419
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:25,439
Jo Mitchell, you have
no idea how scary I can be.

420
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,014
Hey, Abby! How are you?

421
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:45,720
- I can't get up!
- Are you all right?

422
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:48,228
I don't know.
Pull me as hard as you can.

423
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:49,729
OK.

424
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:58,069
- Now what?
- Help me up.

425
00:26:58,207 --> 00:26:59,572
OK.

426
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:05,214
SeriousIy? Who wouId ever
think of something so chiIdish,

427
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:08,840
yet briIIiant,
except a bunch of mean girIs?

428
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:12,386
- Hey, Mandi.
- Hi.

429
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,081
Now, what do we do?

430
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,660
I wouId've strangIed her right there...

431
00:27:19,796 --> 00:27:21,229
Meet me in the bathroom.

432
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,730
Bring any spare clothes
that you have.

433
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:26,096
...if I couId get off the Vespa.

434
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:31,573
Wow. Bad-ass!

435
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,107
So cool.

436
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,073
Coming through!

437
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,238
Sorry!

438
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:42,707
Are you OK?

439
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:47,214
This is all my fault.
You should've never hung out with me.

440
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:49,052
Mandi's gonna make
your life a living hell.

441
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:50,955
Abby, you can't live in fear.

442
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:54,393
- Did you find me something to wear?
- Just my art smock.

443
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,862
That'll have to do. Thanks.

444
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:02,569
- Do you need my help?
- I think I got it.

445
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,533
- How do I look?
- Great.

446
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,247
- Hey, nice look.
- It's not funny.

447
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:16,113
- I'm not joking, it's hot.
- Thanks.

448
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,555
No unauthorized videos
of my students on the monitor.

449
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:27,720
By the next day, I hoped
everyone wouId have forgotten

450
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:31,698
about my wardrobe maIfunction,
but it wasn't what I was expecting.

451
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:36,362
ApparentIy, hoIding your head high after
a Mandi vendetta earned you points.

452
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:48,149
Oh, my gosh, this is so cool!

453
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,078
You started it.
It was your smock.

454
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,822
- It's cute.
- It's pathetic.

455
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:03,625
I could smear paint all over my Versace,
but I have taste, style.

456
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:04,858
They're just sheep.

457
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:08,130
Chastity, make out with the
student intern in the front office,

458
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:11,638
get Jo's file. Hope, stalk her.

459
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:13,742
I want to know everything.

460
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,989
Wow, this is amazing.

461
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,922
You shouldn't waste your talent
on sketches for me.

462
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,551
Oh, I don't mind.

463
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,027
All right,
what should we work on first?

464
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,792
Well, I love
building cars with my dad,

465
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:42,132
but I wanna... I wanna design something
more lasting and permanent.

466
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:45,934
I.M. Pei, for instance,
designs the most amazing buildings,

467
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,805
- and Joseph Strauss...
- Built the Golden Gate Bridge.

468
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:52,711
Yeah, my family went there last summer.
It's pretty awesome.

469
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,716
Well, then, why don't
we start with San Francisco?

470
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:57,285
All right, cool.

471
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,823
Oh, yeah, and if my dad asks,
this is a school project.

472
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,756
He thinks artists are,
like, homeless hippies, so...

473
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:07,385
- I don't wanna get you in trouble.
- Oh, no, no, no!

474
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,998
I need some more samples
for my portfolio anyway.

475
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,124
I'm applying to NYU Design School.

476
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,168
Or, as I tell my dad, Columbia Pre-Med.

477
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:21,273
These are...

478
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:23,902
They're incredible.

479
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,103
Thanks.

480
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:33,953
Tyler, late. Sit.

481
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,785
WhiIe I was breaking
aII my ruIes with Abby,

482
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,519
I figured I couId enjoy
a few other things

483
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:40,322
North Shore had to offer.

484
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:44,531
He couId waIk in Iate
any day he wanted.

485
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,351
Hey.

486
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,655
Oh. Hi.

487
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:16,390
OK, everybody, big day today.

488
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:21,060
A&M beat Arkansas
in overtime on Saturday. Yes!

489
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,838
Oh, and today, we commence
the great egg-drop project.

490
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:27,704
Young lady,
that is where we drop a boiled egg

491
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:32,212
in a parachute without it breaking.
You'll be judged on style and structure.

492
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,579
And if you'd just like to opt out and
bring in deviled eggs for the class...

493
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:37,845
Tempting, but doesn't
the top student have the option

494
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:40,979
to submit for the Thompson-Bird
Architecture scholarship?

495
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:45,389
Yes. Not that any of you slackers care.

496
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:50,124
Eligibility for the scholarship
requires a 4.5 GPA,

497
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:53,963
at least a 2300 on your SATs,
math and verbal,

498
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,968
top scores on all class projects

499
00:31:56,105 --> 00:32:01,168
and a glowing letter
of recommendation from me.

500
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,040
And as you know, I don't glow often.

501
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:10,685
Let me guess,
we're gonna have to win.

502
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,151
Pretty much.

503
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:16,213
Well, then maybe we should
get in some extra study time.

504
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,623
Go to a movie or something?

505
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:21,457
- Tomorrow night?
- Sounds good.

506
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:31,701
- Hey!
- Guess what?

507
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:33,809
Tyler just asked me out.

508
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:36,605
It was amazing,
having a friend to confide in.

509
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,907
Jo, you can't.
It'd be a big mistake.

510
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,777
- Or not.
- You don't know who he...

511
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:44,079
He's my shop partner,
and I've seen him without a shirt.

512
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,585
Good enough for me.

513
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,592
Oh, my God!
Tyler is a total traitor.

514
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:01,427
- She's so crossed the line.
- Who has?

515
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,630
That bitch, Jo.
God, Nick, keep up.

516
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,241
And give me your car keys.

517
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:11,873
Don't.

518
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:16,551
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere. Out with a friend.

519
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:20,178
Your friend's got a nice car.
And your friend is also a guy.

520
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:22,689
Goodbye, Dad.
I'll be home by ten.

521
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,856
- Nice wheels.
- Nick insisted I borrow his car.

522
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,260
I figured you take cars pretty
seriously, so I took him up on it.

523
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,923
Does that mean I get to drive?

524
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:33,399
Yes.

525
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,000
- Oh, thank you.
- After you.

526
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:38,800
Thank you very much.

527
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:04,628
I gotta admit, Jo,
you did pretty good.

528
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,997
No screaming on the roller coaster,

529
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:08,763
a solid stomach on the Gravitron.

530
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:11,168
And kicking your ass at bumper cars.

531
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,707
I like a guy who can take the heat.

532
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
Oh, really?

533
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:18,205
How many guys are you looking at?

534
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,339
Come on, Jo.

535
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,577
Four schools in three years?

536
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,052
How many? Six boyfriends? A dozen?

537
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,157
None.

538
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,317
But I'm sort of breaking
all my rules this year.

539
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,588
You've never had a boyfriend?

540
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,927
Shut up! So I never
played Spin the Bottle,

541
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,865
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

542
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:42,999
Never...

543
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:45,735
...kissed anyone?

544
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,724
...beginning of the bIood drive
this month, so sign up now.

545
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:12,595
That's it from me,
I'm your principaI.

546
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,635
You know me.
I'II see you in the haIIways.

547
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,102
Remember, stay Ieft, or right...

548
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,467
- How'd it go?
- Perfect,

549
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:22,043
- you had nothing to worry about.
- HeIIo, North Shore,

550
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:26,615
Iast night, our new girI, Jo MitcheII
had a first date, and more.

551
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:30,716
How many?
Six boyfriends? A dozen?

552
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:34,380
None. But I'm sort of breaking
aII my ruIes this year.

553
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:37,720
Oh, God. This isn't happening.

554
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,226
- You've never had a boyfriend?
- Shut up!

555
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:42,660
So I never pIayed Spin the BottIe,

556
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:46,800
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven, I...

557
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,063
Never... kissed anyone?

558
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:52,572
That's right,
Jo MitcheII is a virgin!

559
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,035
She's a virgin?

560
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,079
Young love. lsn't it pathetic?

561
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:20,359
Jo, I'm so sorry.
It's gonna be OK, I promise.

562
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:31,939
Emergency slumber party?

563
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:34,873
Thanks, Abby.

564
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,913
You're the best. I'm...

565
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,884
I'm sorry I didn't listen.

566
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,589
And Abby was the best.

567
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,989
Which onIy made me feeI worse.

568
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:46,651
I was totaIIy Iying to her,

569
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:49,821
the one person who
kept having my back.

570
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:51,728
Maybe I deserved Mandi's torture.

571
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:52,959
Jo.

572
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:54,296
I'm sorry, I didn't...

573
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:55,994
How could you set me up like that?

574
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:59,130
I hope you and Mandi
are very happy together.

575
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:02,506
I can't believe him!

576
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:08,475
Jo, how are you holding up?

577
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:11,814
Elliot wanted to do a story
on virgins in high school,

578
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:13,979
but I totally nixed it.

579
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:16,523
- Hi. You're Jo, right?
- Yeah.

580
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:21,119
Guys. Last year, all three of us fell
for this jerk of a senior.

581
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:23,322
We put out, and he
dumped us the next day.

582
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:26,332
We should have waited,
like you, for the right guy.

583
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:28,663
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Yeah.

584
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:30,635
Tyler wasn't exactly the right guy.

585
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:32,673
He was just another one
of Mandi's puppets.

586
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:35,333
Yeah, well, we just wanted to tell you
we think you're awesome.

587
00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:37,308
- Yeah, definitely.
- See you around.

588
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,743
Thanks!

589
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:41,142
Why does he even put up with her?

590
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:43,080
Why wouldn't he?
You can't choose your siblings.

591
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:48,650
- What? Siblings?
- I thought he told you.

592
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,419
- Tyler is Mandi's stepbrother.
- I'm such an idiot!

593
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,156
- I thought they were just hooking up.
- Oh, gross!

594
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:59,756
But now you see why it was so easy
for Mandi to bug your date.

595
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,030
No way, not Tyler.
It had to have been someone else.

596
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:04,867
Oh, my God. We were in Nick's car.

597
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:08,534
- You dick! You bugged the car?
- Come on, man.

598
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,406
- I thought it was fun.
- Don't you turn your back on me, Nick!

599
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:12,309
What are you gonna do, Tyler?
You're gonna hit your best friend?

600
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,848
- Break it up! That's enough!
- Can't you take a joke?

601
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:16,781
- I'm gonna mess you up!
- You don't scare me!

602
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,716
You don't scare me.

603
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:20,981
- Punch me! Bring it on!
- Come on. Are you afraid?

604
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:22,590
Well, that was fun.

605
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,386
Hope, what else do we have
on the Virgin Queen?

606
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:28,860
Well, a 4.5 GPA, high SATs,
three AP classes and...

607
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,466
Oh, she's applying for
architecture scholarships.

608
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,329
Her dream...

609
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,027
...Carnegie Mellon University.

610
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,836
OK, so one more time.

611
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:43,411
She's never made out
with anyone... ever?

612
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:45,308
Or this week?

613
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,948
Hey, not so fast.

614
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,610
Today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

615
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:56,122
- Twenty percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

616
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:58,886
Look, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

617
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:00,962
I was clouded by lust.

618
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:05,829
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

619
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,799
You're still a jerk.

620
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:10,672
At least your shirt's funny.

621
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:22,974
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

622
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,915
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

623
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:28,387
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

624
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:32,422
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi

625
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:34,825
in a totally platonic way.

626
00:39:34,963 --> 00:39:37,898
Wait, you thought...

627
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:39,728
Dude, gross!

628
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:42,695
But despite Quinn and Abby's urging,

629
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,136
I refused to stoop to Mandi's IeveI.

630
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:50,541
Besides, I was having so much fun with
my new friends, I aImost didn't care.

631
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,237
You coming?

632
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:57,547
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

633
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,517
I was just looking
at the Homecoming website,

634
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:01,589
and everybody's talking
about the hot new couple.

635
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:04,955
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

636
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:07,085
Not anymore.

637
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,676
So this was it, the first chaIIenge.

638
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,040
Success was worth 100 points,

639
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:28,240
and I needed every point I couId get
to quaIify for the schoIarship.

640
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:34,352
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

641
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:37,923
- Ready?
- Ready.

642
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,620
And... drop!

643
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,501
OK, who switched the eggs?

644
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:50,161
Who? No one?

645
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,802
Oh, well.

646
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:58,368
Who's next?

647
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:02,742
Mandi had found a new part
of my Iife to destroy:

648
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:05,410
My chance
at the Thompson-Bird schoIarship.

649
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:08,886
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

650
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:11,389
- You ready?
- Yeah.

651
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:15,994
Hope caIIed her doctor on speed diaI

652
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:19,658
and switched our CO2 for Iaughing gas.

653
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:40,316
Hey, guys, I'm here.

654
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:43,319
Seriously, Chastity?

655
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,949
I said ''incognito,''
not ''like a flamingo.''

656
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:48,585
Go.

657
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,999
There's poo on my Jimmy Choo!

658
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,834
Shake it off, shake it off.

659
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,965
Go, slow.

660
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,369
Faster!

661
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,881
I can't go any further.

662
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:12,316
What is the matter with you?

663
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,429
Funnel.

664
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,058
The funnel!

665
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:28,601
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

666
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:32,031
Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

667
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,489
Coffee?

668
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:04,561
Perfect.

669
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,555
Dad, what's going on?

670
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:27,925
It's ruined.

671
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,089
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

672
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,634
- It was running perfectly yesterday.
- I don't know.

673
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,501
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

674
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,269
It doesn't matter because Jimmy and the
boys are expecting a trial run tomorrow.

675
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:44,806
Dad...

676
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,771
We can figure something out.

677
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,976
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

678
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:54,585
Maybe I can call in a favor,

679
00:43:56,124 --> 00:43:59,218
beg for an extension, tell 'em
it was some kind of fluke accident,

680
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:00,692
I don't know.

681
00:44:21,016 --> 00:44:24,349
But this was definiteIy no accident.

682
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,114
Mandi had gone too far.

683
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:28,813
Mess with me, fine.

684
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,016
Mess with my famiIy...

685
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,289
...you're dead.

686
00:44:34,162 --> 00:44:38,394
It was as if aII my girI hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

687
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:40,592
and I was out for bIood.

688
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:42,735
The PIastics were going down,

689
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:46,531
and I didn't care
what ruIes I had to break...

690
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:48,506
...to make her pay.

691
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,242
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

692
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,552
Is that all you got?

693
00:44:59,688 --> 00:45:04,022
Going after my dad,
you spoiled, narcissistic bitch!

694
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:08,024
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you!

695
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,324
But it was so much fun.

696
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:14,424
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

697
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:15,558
Right?

698
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:18,163
I don't run away that easy.

699
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:20,866
Get over yourself, man-hands.

700
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,977
You're just a passing phase.

701
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,578
I'm here for the long run.

702
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:31,609
Oh, yeah?

703
00:45:31,753 --> 00:45:33,414
Are you sure about that?

704
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:45,025
Coffee?

705
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:56,242
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

706
00:45:57,512 --> 00:46:00,879
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

707
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,615
There's something I need to tell you.

708
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:15,058
This was it, the moment to teII Abby

709
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:18,928
I'd made a deaI with her father
that I totaIIy regretted,

710
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,932
and beg for forgiveness.

711
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:23,529
But Iooking at her,

712
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,732
the idea of Iosing my first
best friend in a Iong time,

713
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,864
I couIdn't do it.

714
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:31,437
So, what do you need to tell me?

715
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:35,306
I...

716
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:41,887
You should know,
my last BFF relationship

717
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,354
crashed and burned.

718
00:46:44,493 --> 00:46:47,690
She became snobby and judgmental

719
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:51,094
and used guys as pawns of warfare,

720
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,394
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

721
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,203
Geez! Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

722
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,808
But don't worry,
we're nothing like that.

723
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:03,570
Success! OK.

724
00:47:03,712 --> 00:47:07,170
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

725
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:10,580
which was pretty much every issue.

726
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,086
- lf there's dirt, we'll find it.
- What's this?

727
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,952
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.

728
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:20,493
- Everybody wants to be invited.
- But, of course, they aren't.

729
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,427
Mandi never allows anybody
to throw a party when she does.

730
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:26,363
Is that so?

731
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:38,138
I am so excited. Tonight
is gonna be the perfect night.

732
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,907
It should be.

733
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:41,982
It's costing my dad enough.

734
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:44,278
Our dad, Tyler.

735
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:46,853
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

736
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:49,548
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

737
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,552
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

738
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:58,421
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

739
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,127
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

740
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,032
But high school will end, Mandi.

741
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,139
And then what will you have left?

742
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:17,344
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's gonna show up.

743
00:48:17,485 --> 00:48:20,352
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party

744
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:22,581
with cocktail dresses and raw fish,

745
00:48:22,724 --> 00:48:25,318
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

746
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,894
People who think Mandi's awesome.

747
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:30,088
No one actually thinks that.

748
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:33,258
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

749
00:48:35,604 --> 00:48:38,801
Wait, why aren't you guys ready?

750
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,874
People will arrive any minute!

751
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:43,510
We are ready.

752
00:48:43,645 --> 00:48:45,442
No! No!

753
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,275
- Abby, no! Honey!
- Mom...

754
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:50,179
I bought you all those
party clothes for a reason.

755
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,287
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

756
00:48:53,421 --> 00:48:55,616
Come on. Come on!
Come on, let's go.

757
00:48:55,757 --> 00:48:57,918
Come on, sugar, let's go!

758
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:01,620
Come on! My little girl
is throwing a party!

759
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,192
- Seriously?
- Mom, stop.

760
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:11,499
Now, Jo, you know you're not gonna
have this little body forever.

761
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,005
- Mom!
- I'm just saying

762
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:14,506
she oughta show it off.

763
00:49:14,643 --> 00:49:17,407
- Mom, just stop!
- ln something like this.

764
00:49:17,545 --> 00:49:20,912
- llene Hanover!
- Definitely.

765
00:49:21,716 --> 00:49:22,808
I knew it!

766
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:33,187
- lnvitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

767
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:35,319
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it's invite only.

768
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:40,596
OK.

769
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,240
Thank you, thank you all so much
for coming to my birth...

770
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:56,749
Where... Where is everyone?

771
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,269
Wow! I can't believe this!

772
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:23,240
I can't believe this
is my house, my party!

773
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:26,010
Believe it.

774
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:31,050
- You both look amazing.
- Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.

775
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:33,279
This party rocks!

776
00:50:34,189 --> 00:50:35,588
Only where's the food?

777
00:50:35,724 --> 00:50:39,421
Oh, I heard Mandi's
serving nigiri sushi.

778
00:50:40,128 --> 00:50:43,564
- That's sushi.
- Pizza's coming.

779
00:50:43,698 --> 00:50:45,427
Pizza.

780
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,633
This is a disaster of epic proportions!

781
00:50:49,771 --> 00:50:52,296
I mean, don't panic, Mandi.

782
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,807
Maybe they just got the wrong address.

783
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:57,309
Or...

784
00:50:58,113 --> 00:51:00,308
What if Jo and Abby

785
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,681
are throwing a party tonight?

786
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:09,180
Stating the obvious much, moron?

787
00:51:09,324 --> 00:51:13,784
- What are we gonna do?
- Not go over there?

788
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,193
He's inside!

789
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,181
Hope, do you still have that
vile medicine from your doctor?

790
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:47,090
You mean the ipecac? Of course.

791
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:04,109
Elliot hasn't stopped
staring at you all night.

792
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:06,805
Really? But he's Elliot.

793
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,412
Thanks.

794
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:18,185
Oh, thank God, I'm starving.

795
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:20,658
Do these smell funny?

796
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:23,764
Maybe the delivery guy
mixed up our order.

797
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:28,667
- Here you go. Thanks.
- No problem. Glad to help.

798
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:32,136
- Wait! Don't eat that.
- What? Why?

799
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:35,299
Because I'm not the only one
who paid the pizza guy.

800
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,141
OK, it's done.

801
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:44,149
Their party's about to
get extremely unsanitary.

802
00:52:49,357 --> 00:52:51,951
- What'd I miss?
- Oh, nothing, honey bear.

803
00:52:52,093 --> 00:52:53,856
We just have a party to attend.

804
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:56,657
Oh, and I wouldn't wear
nice shoes if I were you.

805
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,390
Perhaps galoshes.

806
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:12,709
- Happy not your birthday!
- Really, Chastity?

807
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:14,813
Joke.

808
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,880
Wait, nobody's puking.

809
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,658
Oh, thank God!

810
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,726
I mean, damn it!

811
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:28,761
Where's the pizza?

812
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,299
What the hell happened?

813
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:35,061
God, Nick, go do something!

814
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:42,234
Look at those two.
God, what does Tyler even see in her?

815
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:45,744
Get over it already, Chastity.
My brother is off-limits.

816
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,745
Like what you say matters, Mandi.

817
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:49,679
You can't even throw a birthday party.

818
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,341
Shut up!

819
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,422
I'll be right back.

820
00:53:57,492 --> 00:53:59,289
Man, the food's all gone.

821
00:53:59,427 --> 00:54:03,261
Oh, Nick, I saved you a piece of pizza.
One second.

822
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:06,760
Why is Mandi here?

823
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:09,961
Well, I think she was hoping
to gloat over a party disaster,

824
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:13,505
which, if I can count on Nick,
won't take long.

825
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,876
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

826
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:23,274
Mandi, can I see your invitation?

827
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:28,378
Because I'm pretty sure I left
''Vapid Bitch'' off the list.

828
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:31,686
You think you're so clever,
but you're not.

829
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:33,418
You're just using my brother
to get back at me,

830
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,585
and I'm gonna make sure
that he knows that.

831
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:39,530
Not everything is about you, Mandi.
Especially not my love life.

832
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:45,065
At least I have one. Where's your
boyfriend on your birthday?

833
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:49,334
You wanna see a love life,
little virgin?

834
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:51,001
I'll show you.

835
00:55:12,567 --> 00:55:14,660
Oh, my God, did he just...?

836
00:55:14,802 --> 00:55:17,771
Oh, God, move! Move!

837
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:20,203
Yep. Sorry about your patio.

838
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:22,741
Oh, totally worth it!

839
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,143
And we didn't just stop there.

840
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,772
Abby, Quinn and I set out
to disband the PIastics

841
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:31,214
once and for aII.

842
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:34,048
We caIIed ourseIves the Anti-PIastics.

843
00:55:34,188 --> 00:55:38,818
Not very originaI,
but it got the point across.

844
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,450
Wow.

845
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:42,490
Wow.

846
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:45,964
Wow.

847
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,565
We gathered our forces.

848
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,140
But as the Anti-PIastics grew,

849
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:57,176
Mandi started recruiting
for her side.

850
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,054
It was time to break apart
the founding members,

851
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:13,319
starting with Chastity.

852
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,957
So we simpIy tipped PrincipaI DuvaII.

853
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:19,862
Oh, Principal Duvall! A note.

854
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,333
Her weakness: a raging Iibido.

855
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,634
OK, where's the back stairwell that's
a herpes infection waiting to happen?

856
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:28,799
- C-wing.
- Thank you.

857
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:40,377
Elliot, let me borrow that.

858
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,154
The camera! Get to class.

859
00:56:45,293 --> 00:56:49,059
For the love of all that's sanitary,
get outta there, people!

860
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:57,431
You wait right here, young lady.

861
00:56:57,572 --> 00:57:01,508
You officially earned detention
for a week. Unbelievable.

862
00:57:01,642 --> 00:57:05,203
No, no, no! ln solitary confinement.
Let's go, move it.

863
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:06,438
- Principal Duvall.
- What?

864
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:08,742
- The announcements!
- Oh, yeah, let's go!

865
00:57:14,255 --> 00:57:16,746
- And action!
- Good afternoon, everybody.

866
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,383
We have a winner for the
Homecoming Dance Charity.

867
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:23,861
The winner is the Humane Society.

868
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:25,022
So...

869
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:29,093
Where did you come from?
Get outta here!

870
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,172
I'm talking about the importance
of neutering here, people! Cut it off.

871
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,203
- How could you do that?
- Do what?

872
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:42,078
Rat out all of my make-out spots!
You're the only one I told, Mandi.

873
00:57:42,216 --> 00:57:45,276
Now, who's gonna do my homework
and tell me I'm special?

874
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,551
- Sorry.
- Hey!

875
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:53,660
For Hope, who'd been a hypochondriac

876
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:56,229
since contracting mono
from a water fountain,

877
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:59,492
we said goodbye to Mandi's
''no bodiIy fIuids'' ruIe.

878
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:03,260
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

879
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:07,204
- I'm gonna contract E. coli.
- Even worse, you have a zit.

880
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:10,870
I knew ugliness was contagious!

881
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:14,140
Hope booked an emergency heaIing
massage and seaweed faciaI.

882
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:27,190
UnfortunateIy, there
was a mix-up at the spa...

883
00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:30,263
...and Hope ended up resembIing
the Wicked Witch of the West.

884
00:58:30,398 --> 00:58:33,424
It stiII hadn't faded
after an entire weekend.

885
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:40,098
Mandi! What is wrong with you?

886
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,101
You didn't pick me up.
I had to ride my Schwinn.

887
00:58:43,244 --> 00:58:45,178
I don't pick up ogres.

888
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,180
And green, definitely not your color.

889
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,749
Wha...?

890
00:58:52,186 --> 00:58:53,847
Why hasn't it washed away?

891
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,513
I added some
long-lasting henna ink.

892
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:58,648
Don't you think that's a bit much?

893
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:01,961
Come on, she deserved it.

894
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:23,775
Peace out!

895
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,221
Nobody'll ever see that.

896
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:33,620
With Chastity and Hope down,
there was onIy one PIastic Ieft.

897
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:36,355
Cupcakes! Cupcakes!

898
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:39,294
Red velvet,
or perhaps devil's food cake?

899
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:41,162
- Thank you!
- Traitor!

900
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:44,294
- You don't own me, Mandi.
- Oh, yeah?

901
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:49,303
I don't like you right now!

902
00:59:49,443 --> 00:59:51,877
You totally lost my vote.

903
00:59:54,448 --> 00:59:56,313
Yummy frosting, though.

904
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:01,881
Nice job, Quinn. You truly are
an amazing investigative reporter.

905
01:00:02,023 --> 01:00:05,618
I've been obsess... I mean,
watching them for years.

906
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,126
Just needed to dig a little deeper.

907
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:12,432
Hi!

908
01:00:12,566 --> 01:00:13,897
Hey.

909
01:00:14,635 --> 01:00:15,966
- Hey!
- Hey!

910
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:19,472
- Hi.
- Hey!

911
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,675
- Hello, girls.
- Hey!

912
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,108
- I already got my dress.
- Hey.

913
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,305
- Oh, hey, Abby.
- OK, Jo, this year the music

914
01:00:27,448 --> 01:00:29,848
better not suck at the dance.
You have sway with the DJ, right?

915
01:00:29,984 --> 01:00:32,612
- Of course. What are your requests?
- OK...

916
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:35,449
- We could get that guy who...
- You know, if she keeps

917
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:38,558
inviting everybody to join our group,

918
01:00:38,693 --> 01:00:40,490
there won't be any room left.

919
01:00:40,628 --> 01:00:44,086
At least Mandi understood
the importance of exclusivity.

920
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:47,200
Someone has to be the proletariat.

921
01:00:47,335 --> 01:00:49,360
That's lower class.

922
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,737
Hey, kid. Lend me a hand.

923
01:00:58,879 --> 01:01:01,439
Jimmy gave me an extension
on delivering the engine.

924
01:01:01,582 --> 01:01:05,575
Sorry, Dad. I've got shopping with Quinn
and a movie with Tyler,

925
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,655
and I still have
to make my campaign buttons.

926
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:10,723
Busy, busy!

927
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:16,458
Busy, busy.

928
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,763
- Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

929
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,458
- Hey!
- Hi.

930
01:01:21,602 --> 01:01:23,331
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

931
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,031
- What's up?
- Hi.

932
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:30,076
I wonder how much sugar is in this.

933
01:01:30,211 --> 01:01:32,873
- You did not just ask that.
- What?

934
01:01:33,014 --> 01:01:36,245
Jo, you ate, like,
two funnel cakes, a hot dog

935
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:38,784
and a bag of kettle corn
on our first date.

936
01:01:38,919 --> 01:01:41,479
And you didn't wear
these crazy studded boots.

937
01:01:49,263 --> 01:01:51,595
Come on. You're kidding me, right?

938
01:01:51,732 --> 01:01:54,292
- Using me to make Chastity jealous?
- Look, I was just...

939
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:57,097
Starting to act a hell
of a lot like Mandi,

940
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:59,536
which is not the kind of
girl I want to be dating.

941
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:02,665
Hey, I am nothing like Mandi.

942
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,304
Oh, really? Running for queen,
humiliating people,

943
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,972
using their secrets against them,

944
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,674
dressing like you're
on the cover of RoIIing Stone,

945
01:02:10,818 --> 01:02:13,844
which, OK, it's kinda
hot sometimes, but not the part

946
01:02:13,988 --> 01:02:17,185
where you suddenly care about
what everyone else thinks.

947
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,049
Jo...

948
01:02:21,262 --> 01:02:24,197
What happened to that girl
I met in shop class?

949
01:02:44,485 --> 01:02:47,943
And when I got home, there it was,
waiting for me:

950
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:49,750
my future.

951
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,983
How had I aImost forgotten?

952
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:01,234
The fat letter!

953
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:04,895
- It's good news, right?
- The best.

954
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:08,874
Jo. Look, honey,

955
01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:12,376
I feel lousy about your tuition fund.

956
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:14,947
But, honey, that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't be excited.

957
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,983
I mean, CMU, that's... that's big stuff!

958
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:20,110
And if I can just get
this engine finished,

959
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,348
or... what about that
architectural scholarship?

960
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,981
The scholarship.

961
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:26,991
But somehow, aII this campaigning

962
01:03:27,128 --> 01:03:30,461
and preening and pIotting
had gotten in the way.

963
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,965
I didn't even know what my grade was
in shop cIass anymore.

964
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:37,568
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

965
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,836
Abby's dad dropped this off for ya.

966
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:43,773
So does she know where
she's goin' to college yet?

967
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:48,109
Abby wants art school, but
her dad's more of a pre-med guy.

968
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:52,310
Well, just make sure that she knows
that to... to win the race...

969
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,444
You gotta be in the race.

970
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,160
But what if I wanted out?

971
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:13,330
What if I wanted to forfeit the race
because I didn't deserve to win?

972
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:17,333
Got something that's real revolutionary.

973
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:20,970
It's gonna revolutionize
your gardening experience.

974
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:24,510
Hey, Mr. Hanover.

975
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,210
Abby's not home
from the movie yet, is she?

976
01:04:26,353 --> 01:04:29,049
No, thought you'd be with 'em.

977
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:34,927
- But glad you're here.
- Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...

978
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:39,328
- I brought back the money.
- Jo, what, are you crazy?

979
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:42,526
The money's for you, every damn penny.
You've earned it.

980
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,470
Hiring you to be her friend was
the best money we've ever spent.

981
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:50,407
Please. Mr. Hanover, I can't.

982
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:56,147
Jo, I'm sending it right back to you.
I'd give a bonus, if I gave them.

983
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:57,682
Which I don't.

984
01:05:10,965 --> 01:05:14,662
Is it true? Did my dad pay you
to be friends with me?

985
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:18,298
Quinn finally got her big story.

986
01:05:18,439 --> 01:05:20,498
She quoted Mandi as a witness.

987
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:22,506
Why would Quinn do this?

988
01:05:23,744 --> 01:05:25,712
How could you?

989
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:29,009
- I was gonna tell Abby everything.
- Face it, Jo.

990
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:30,844
The Plastics are the originals,

991
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:33,510
and they don't have to pay
anyone to be their friend.

992
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:36,316
No! You just sold out
your friends for free!

993
01:05:36,457 --> 01:05:38,049
Oh, what, like you sold me out?

994
01:05:38,192 --> 01:05:40,524
God, I trusted you.

995
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:43,528
You know what?
You go to hell, Jo Mitchell.

996
01:05:43,664 --> 01:05:45,029
I wish I never even met you.

997
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:30,504
Just to see their faces.

998
01:06:30,644 --> 01:06:33,807
You were so good, Mandi.
I totally voted for you.

999
01:06:33,947 --> 01:06:36,609
- Too bad this didn't come out earlier.
- Why?

1000
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,083
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

1001
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,518
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

1002
01:06:42,656 --> 01:06:48,026
- That is, if she's eligible.
- Eligibility is based on matriculation.

1003
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:51,427
So she'd have to be
expelled or something.

1004
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:56,936
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

1005
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,216
This is gonna be
the best senior prank ever.

1006
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:17,790
The best.

1007
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:23,426
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

1008
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:26,328
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

1009
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:28,958
and if there's no dance,
I'm not the queen.

1010
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:31,899
I don't know.

1011
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,331
Money can't do this.

1012
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,212
As many of you know,
we had a robbery Iast night.

1013
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,656
Now, the evidence strongIy suggests
that the thief

1014
01:07:53,794 --> 01:07:58,026
was a student, because of his wanton
disregard for schooI property.

1015
01:07:58,165 --> 01:08:01,726
This student, or students,
cIearIy degenerates,

1016
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,869
stoIe the money that was
intended for heIpIess animaIs.

1017
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:07,871
Now, unIess the money is returned,

1018
01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:12,945
I have no choice but
to canceI the Homecoming Dance.

1019
01:08:14,515 --> 01:08:16,540
This is your principaI,

1020
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,378
signing off for today,

1021
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:22,751
reminding you to stay Ieft
or right, not center.

1022
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:32,722
Miss Mitchell, I received an anonymous
tip today that you stole the money.

1023
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,269
That's a lie. I would never do that.

1024
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,768
Well, apparently you did.

1025
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,874
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

1026
01:08:42,776 --> 01:08:45,142
And I'm afraid we
found the stoIen money.

1027
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,112
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear!

1028
01:08:48,248 --> 01:08:50,546
Somebody must've put it there, and...

1029
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:52,618
I would bet anything it was Mandi.

1030
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,950
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

1031
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:57,488
but unless you have proof,

1032
01:08:57,624 --> 01:08:59,888
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

1033
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:03,320
It officiaIIy couIdn't get much worse.

1034
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:06,956
I'm also sorry to say that I'm gonna
have to report this to Carnegie Mellon,

1035
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,558
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

1036
01:09:11,872 --> 01:09:14,432
Miss Mitchell, where are you going?
Come back here!

1037
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:16,372
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

1038
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,273
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

1039
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:21,779
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

1040
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:24,440
I tried to protect you all from her.

1041
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:27,486
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

1042
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,182
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch!

1043
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:34,852
Wait. As much as we all might like that,
I can't let it happen.

1044
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:38,453
This is crazy! Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

1045
01:09:38,599 --> 01:09:40,533
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

1046
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,464
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls!

1047
01:09:42,603 --> 01:09:45,970
I'm sick of the mind games
and the backstabbing and the set-ups.

1048
01:09:46,106 --> 01:09:49,007
I know you framed me, Mandi.

1049
01:09:50,744 --> 01:09:53,770
So we're gonna settle this like men,
on the battlefield.

1050
01:09:53,914 --> 01:09:56,109
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

1051
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,478
I challenge you...

1052
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,984
...to a football game,

1053
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,821
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

1054
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,225
I... I don't do sports.

1055
01:10:11,398 --> 01:10:12,865
You scared?

1056
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,560
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

1057
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,895
I thought you were
the best at everything.

1058
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,601
I thought people trembled
in the presence of the Plastics.

1059
01:10:23,744 --> 01:10:25,507
You wanna win?

1060
01:10:25,646 --> 01:10:30,606
The only way you're gonna
become queen is by default.

1061
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:38,190
Fine, you're on.

1062
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,589
But be prepared to lose.

1063
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:43,560
You know, you and your team of one.

1064
01:10:51,605 --> 01:10:56,338
I reaIized a IittIe too Iate
that I no Ionger had any friends.

1065
01:10:56,476 --> 01:11:01,175
But if I had to take on
aII the PIastics by myseIf, I wouId.

1066
01:11:08,922 --> 01:11:12,221
All right, let's get to class,
everybody. Hang out in the hallway.

1067
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:15,556
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

1068
01:11:15,696 --> 01:11:17,527
Certainly not about Jo.

1069
01:11:29,176 --> 01:11:34,113
Hey, Mr. Hanover.
This was in our mailbox. It's for you.

1070
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:37,410
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend, right?
- Ex-boyfriend.

1071
01:11:39,186 --> 01:11:41,051
Awkward.

1072
01:11:41,188 --> 01:11:43,554
Thing is, I've got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

1073
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:47,091
Would you give it to her? A deal's a
deal. It's not her fault Abby found out.

1074
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,827
- She gave the money back to you?
- Of course.

1075
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:54,797
I was expecting it, really.

1076
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:57,062
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

1077
01:11:57,204 --> 01:11:58,637
I just needed to make that happen.

1078
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:00,899
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

1079
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:02,565
Those are my colors.
And I'm wearing my hair up,

1080
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,473
'cause it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

1081
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:09,673
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

1082
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:16,553
Hey, Abby.

1083
01:12:19,192 --> 01:12:21,285
- Look, just don't.
- But...

1084
01:12:21,428 --> 01:12:24,056
You know, Jo may have lied to me,

1085
01:12:24,197 --> 01:12:25,994
but at least she taught me one thing.

1086
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:30,297
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

1087
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:33,304
Fine, hate me.

1088
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,308
But you should know I don't think
Jo stole the money.

1089
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:39,878
I think Mandi did.

1090
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:43,380
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her

1091
01:12:43,517 --> 01:12:46,077
the idea to get Jo expelled.

1092
01:12:48,188 --> 01:12:52,522
Also, Jo spent an awful lot of time
putting together

1093
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:56,459
and sending out
college applications for you.

1094
01:12:56,596 --> 01:12:59,588
She even put together your portfolio.

1095
01:13:02,736 --> 01:13:07,105
I helped her make about a dozen
of those with journalism equipment.

1096
01:13:08,942 --> 01:13:12,241
I hope you get into art school, Abby.

1097
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:14,006
I really do.

1098
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:35,430
So Mr. Hanover just called.

1099
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:38,834
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

1100
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,801
That's great, right?

1101
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:46,845
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

1102
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,915
So, you... You heard from Abby?

1103
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:54,151
I've texted, called.

1104
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:57,723
I tried her NorthShoreCentric page.

1105
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:59,553
No luck.

1106
01:13:59,693 --> 01:14:02,389
That girl really hates my guts.

1107
01:14:03,497 --> 01:14:07,263
But I can't blame her.
I'm not sure why you don't hate me.

1108
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:12,705
Listen, kid, I'm not proud
of what you did to Abby,

1109
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:15,706
but I know that you care about her.

1110
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:20,302
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

1111
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,317
Oh, I don't think it's just me.

1112
01:14:33,894 --> 01:14:37,022
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

1113
01:14:37,164 --> 01:14:38,495
Not even close.

1114
01:14:42,068 --> 01:14:44,559
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

1115
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:47,969
- That's right, we've got your back.
- Mandi's goin' down.

1116
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:52,407
I knew it.
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

1117
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:55,472
...you guys came to rescue me.

1118
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,252
I don't deserve you.

1119
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,448
Oh, my God, are you crying?

1120
01:15:02,589 --> 01:15:04,989
No, I never cry.

1121
01:15:08,829 --> 01:15:11,229
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

1122
01:15:11,364 --> 01:15:14,128
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

1123
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:16,292
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

1124
01:15:39,059 --> 01:15:42,358
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

1125
01:15:42,495 --> 01:15:45,931
Not easy, but not impossible. I just
have to detect their wireless signal,

1126
01:15:46,066 --> 01:15:48,830
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

1127
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:50,334
Wait, got it.

1128
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:53,900
They named their Wi-Fi
''AlwaysWatching?''

1129
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,905
What's their pass code, ''666?''

1130
01:15:57,077 --> 01:15:59,545
It'll take a few days,
but if Mandi planted the evidence,

1131
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,408
I'll find the footage.

1132
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:03,176
But...

1133
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,542
I want something in return.

1134
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,710
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

1135
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,015
What do you want, Elliot?

1136
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:13,557
A date to the dance, with Abby.

1137
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:21,959
Hey, good luck at the game.
I'll be rooting for you.

1138
01:16:22,102 --> 01:16:24,127
Even got my own side biz going on.

1139
01:16:24,271 --> 01:16:26,796
Odds are 30 to one in Mandi's favor.

1140
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,377
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

1141
01:16:31,711 --> 01:16:34,680
Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

1142
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:38,841
...a fifth-year senior
who feIt no pain...

1143
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:45,056
...and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

1144
01:16:46,326 --> 01:16:48,590
But we weren't backing down.

1145
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:51,362
And neither was Mandi.

1146
01:16:51,498 --> 01:16:53,796
She wasn't going to puII any punches.

1147
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:56,260
It was time to end this
once and for aII.

1148
01:17:04,511 --> 01:17:05,808
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

1149
01:17:05,946 --> 01:17:06,935
Good!

1150
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:11,674
Hi, baby! Oh, you look so cute.

1151
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:14,048
- Our little athlete.
- Mom, Dad, come on.

1152
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:15,745
You know you can't be in here.
Just go.

1153
01:17:15,889 --> 01:17:18,187
You're right, you're right.
We need to find a seat.

1154
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:21,488
- The bleachers are already filling up.
- Yay! Yay!

1155
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:29,262
- I'm gonna vomit.
- It's gonna be OK, I promise.

1156
01:17:29,402 --> 01:17:31,996
- What's the worst that could happen?
- We lose?

1157
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,507
Is everybody decent in here?

1158
01:17:35,642 --> 01:17:38,440
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

1159
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:39,909
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

1160
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:42,344
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

1161
01:17:42,482 --> 01:17:45,542
Well, I've tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

1162
01:17:45,685 --> 01:17:48,313
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

1163
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:52,789
and you've plastered the school
with posters made that kinda hard.

1164
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:55,156
Thought you guys would wimp out.

1165
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:58,093
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

1166
01:17:58,231 --> 01:18:01,667
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

1167
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:05,032
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

1168
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:07,139
you are not allowed on school grounds.

1169
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:09,298
Thus, you cannot play the game.

1170
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:13,845
- Damn it! Mandi was counting on this.
- I know.

1171
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,312
- You know?
- Yep, which is why

1172
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:18,940
I looked into this issue days ago.
You know, technically,

1173
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:22,282
the football field is public property
since it's on park land.

1174
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:24,686
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

1175
01:18:24,824 --> 01:18:28,885
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

1176
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,828
Well, great then.

1177
01:18:31,965 --> 01:18:35,662
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

1178
01:18:37,604 --> 01:18:39,037
See ya!

1179
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:42,500
Well, I guess my job here is done.

1180
01:18:43,777 --> 01:18:47,736
Let's go, team!
Kill! Maim! Dismember.

1181
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:57,111
Yeah!

1182
01:19:00,493 --> 01:19:01,983
Yeah!

1183
01:19:03,897 --> 01:19:04,886
Go, Abby!

1184
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:08,725
The big day was upon us,

1185
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:11,632
and we were going
to take the PIastics down.

1186
01:19:14,407 --> 01:19:15,999
Come on, girls!

1187
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:19,168
We were ready for anything.

1188
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:27,619
Didn't expect to see me here?

1189
01:19:27,754 --> 01:19:30,245
I'm still gonna kick your team's ass.

1190
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,017
OK, girls, listen up.

1191
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:35,594
Football is a religion,
and you are now in church.

1192
01:19:35,728 --> 01:19:39,323
Do not disgrace this field.
We'll play by playground rules.

1193
01:19:39,466 --> 01:19:43,459
Fumbles that hit the ground
are live balls. Four downs and out.

1194
01:19:43,603 --> 01:19:47,539
No punts, no extra points
and a touchdown is seven points.

1195
01:19:47,674 --> 01:19:50,768
Get it? Got it?

1196
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,070
Good.

1197
01:19:52,712 --> 01:19:55,180
We will flip a coin to see
who receives the ball.

1198
01:19:55,315 --> 01:19:57,010
- Pink Team, you call it.
- Heads.

1199
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:01,652
- Heads it is.
- We'll receive.

1200
01:20:01,788 --> 01:20:04,086
All right, shake hands.

1201
01:20:06,559 --> 01:20:08,390
OK, then.

1202
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:24,841
Run, moron, run!

1203
01:20:28,715 --> 01:20:30,307
Take it, take it.

1204
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:53,871
- There's no nunchakus in football!
- Man.

1205
01:20:59,379 --> 01:21:00,573
Ball, now!

1206
01:21:15,962 --> 01:21:17,520
Touchdown!

1207
01:22:02,842 --> 01:22:05,868
So listen. My dad always
says to win the race,

1208
01:22:06,012 --> 01:22:07,377
you've got to be in the race.

1209
01:22:07,513 --> 01:22:09,879
So think of the worst thing
the Plastics have done to you,

1210
01:22:10,016 --> 01:22:12,041
and knock them down.

1211
01:22:12,185 --> 01:22:14,745
lf they're gonna play
full contact, so are we.

1212
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:16,514
Fumble-rooski on two.

1213
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:20,058
- Break!
- Break.

1214
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:21,455
Yeah!

1215
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,158
Yeah, Jo!

1216
01:22:29,702 --> 01:22:31,169
Good job, honey!

1217
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:36,204
What... What's goin' on?
What... What are you doing?

1218
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:40,739
- Yes!
- Touchdown!

1219
01:22:43,216 --> 01:22:46,049
That's not fair! She can't do that.
Can she do that?

1220
01:22:49,122 --> 01:22:52,114
- You girls can really play. Who knew?
- Thank you.

1221
01:22:55,028 --> 01:22:56,689
Damn it, we're tied.

1222
01:22:56,829 --> 01:23:00,765
I swear, if you let that psycho Jo near
me, I will end your social lives.

1223
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:04,700
- Time for D and D.
- Dirty dancing?

1224
01:23:04,837 --> 01:23:07,328
Yeah, Chastity, dirty dancing.

1225
01:23:07,473 --> 01:23:11,273
No! Down and dirty, OK?
Down and dirty.

1226
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:13,106
Let's get 'em. Go!

1227
01:23:13,246 --> 01:23:15,737
OK, they were big, they were bad.

1228
01:23:17,317 --> 01:23:18,477
We were dead.

1229
01:23:22,989 --> 01:23:25,924
I can't see. I can't see!

1230
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:29,028
- Nothing? How bad's your vision?
- I'm legally blind!

1231
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:31,027
Number one!

1232
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:36,791
Just freshening up.

1233
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:39,632
Smells like lavender
and ocean breeze, doesn't it?

1234
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,800
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, girls.

1235
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:45,774
Enough of this, let's play football!

1236
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:48,506
All right. My muscles are mush,

1237
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,775
my lungs are about to burst
and just look at us.

1238
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:53,613
I agree, we're totally not gonna lose.

1239
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:55,721
- Gesundheit.
- Cover your mouth.

1240
01:23:55,855 --> 01:23:58,790
- Really? 'Cause they have the ball.
- We have to take a stand.

1241
01:23:58,925 --> 01:24:00,893
We can't let them score.

1242
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:03,325
- Gesundheit.
- Dude, cover your mouth!

1243
01:24:03,463 --> 01:24:06,591
- OK, I got it.
- Jo! I did it!

1244
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:08,530
- Look, he did it!
- He did what?

1245
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:09,828
Yeah. Yeah.

1246
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:12,531
Is that yours?

1247
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:16,203
Cool, Mandi is goin' down!

1248
01:24:27,653 --> 01:24:29,052
I told you.

1249
01:24:29,188 --> 01:24:30,621
Let me see that, let me see that.

1250
01:24:39,665 --> 01:24:41,792
- Ling... Come on!
- What?

1251
01:24:43,269 --> 01:24:46,136
What are you waitin' for?
This is football! Come on!

1252
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:51,337
Makin' everyone else do
your dirty work, Mandi?

1253
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:52,876
You're still gonna lose.

1254
01:24:55,348 --> 01:24:56,838
Give me the ball.

1255
01:24:56,983 --> 01:24:58,109
Now!

1256
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:01,920
Is that Nick Zimmer?

1257
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,222
One, two, three... hut.

1258
01:25:10,797 --> 01:25:14,358
No, no, no! No, no!
Come on, man, it was her idea.

1259
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,766
Right there, Mandi! Number one!
You're not number one anymore.

1260
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:23,069
But I love you, baby. It wasn't my idea.
Why are you handcuffing me?

1261
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,834
- Get off me!
- I'd love to.

1262
01:25:58,344 --> 01:26:00,471
Let me go! Get off me!

1263
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:01,773
That's not me!

1264
01:26:01,914 --> 01:26:03,848
It sure looks like it's you,
Miss Weatherly.

1265
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:10,815
Are you crazy?
Do you know who I am?

1266
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:14,393
I am Mandi Weatherly!
My mother will sue you!

1267
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:17,394
How dare you touch me!
She'll sue all of you!

1268
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,664
Let me out of here!
I'll have you fired!

1269
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,495
I'm so sorry for
the misunderstanding, Jo.

1270
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:25,695
Consider yourself
officially un-expelled.

1271
01:26:25,838 --> 01:26:28,170
And I'll make some calls
and sort things out college-wise.

1272
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:31,574
Yeah!

1273
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,897
I figured at this point,

1274
01:26:53,032 --> 01:26:56,160
I might as weII go for the whoIe
high schooI experience.

1275
01:27:11,484 --> 01:27:14,282
All right,
quiet down, everybody. Quiet.

1276
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:17,514
Stop your dancing, stop your fun.
Stop it right now.

1277
01:27:17,657 --> 01:27:18,646
Quiet down.

1278
01:27:20,293 --> 01:27:23,456
Quieter. Good.

1279
01:27:23,596 --> 01:27:25,587
Well, you should all
be very happy to know

1280
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:30,668
that we raised $6,800 for
the Humane Society, huh?

1281
01:27:33,973 --> 01:27:36,498
All right, forget it.
I know the announcement

1282
01:27:36,642 --> 01:27:39,611
you guys really care about,
so let's get to it.

1283
01:27:39,745 --> 01:27:43,704
The Homecoming King is...

1284
01:27:47,353 --> 01:27:50,117
- ...Elliot Gold?
- My God, it's you!

1285
01:27:50,256 --> 01:27:52,690
- Elliot Gold.
- Go!

1286
01:27:57,263 --> 01:27:59,527
Wow. Elliot really is going to rig

1287
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:01,565
the presidential election
someday, isn't he?

1288
01:28:01,701 --> 01:28:04,101
Yep. Just as soon as
the voting goes hi-tech.

1289
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,233
Congratulations.

1290
01:28:08,374 --> 01:28:09,932
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1291
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:13,102
And your Homecoming Queen...

1292
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,445
...Abby Hanover.

1293
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:18,447
Oh, my God!
I've never won anything!

1294
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,074
Go! You won, go!

1295
01:28:21,854 --> 01:28:23,913
Yeah, Abby!

1296
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:28,153
You won! That's so awesome!

1297
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:31,491
- That crown is mine! It's mine!
- Get 'em out of here!

1298
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:34,361
No, don't reach for me!

1299
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,765
Get out of here! You're not
allowed on school grounds!

1300
01:28:38,537 --> 01:28:40,903
- Get off me!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1301
01:28:42,642 --> 01:28:44,303
A little to the right.

1302
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:47,708
- Give me that.
- I'm legally blind.

1303
01:28:48,547 --> 01:28:49,844
There.

1304
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,819
Here's your Homecoming King
and Queen, let's give it up.

1305
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,421
Make some room, let them
have their first dance.

1306
01:28:56,555 --> 01:28:59,820
You guys have a good time.
No dirty dancing, I'm watching.

1307
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:22,879
I have a feeling Elliot wasn't
the one who rigged this vote.

1308
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:26,550
Well, we both know
crowns aren't my thing.

1309
01:29:26,686 --> 01:29:28,779
So you dropped out of the race?

1310
01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:30,912
Sometimes, it's not
about winning the race,

1311
01:29:31,057 --> 01:29:33,719
it's just about being a part of it.

1312
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:35,486
Besides...

1313
01:29:37,063 --> 01:29:39,190
...I have enough already.

1314
01:29:56,115 --> 01:29:59,607
OK, weII, it's not Iike
we aII Iived happiIy ever after.

1315
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:03,119
Mandi and Nick did get
community service instead of jaiI.

1316
01:30:03,255 --> 01:30:06,383
And her mom donated
a new Iibrary to North Shore,

1317
01:30:06,525 --> 01:30:08,823
so PrincipaI DuvaII Iet her graduate.

1318
01:30:08,961 --> 01:30:11,327
But she never regained her status.

1319
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,362
Quinn took over Mandi's roIe
as Iead PIastic.

1320
01:30:16,502 --> 01:30:20,404
But we had a deaI: She Iet the
senior cIass end their year in peace.

1321
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:25,101
She aIso wrote an award-winning articIe
on the sociaI dynamics of mean girIs.

1322
01:30:25,244 --> 01:30:30,147
Chastity finaIIy Iooked up her name,
and joined the Abstinence CIub.

1323
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:35,615
And Hope finaIIy braved her fear
of water fountains and pubIic germs...

1324
01:30:40,826 --> 01:30:43,693
...onIy to catch
a nasty case of swine fIu.

1325
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:47,196
From then on, she swore
to overcome her fears, and instead,

1326
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:51,167
put her trust in antibiotics
and hot doctors.

1327
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,672
TyIer decided to go to Penn State,

1328
01:30:54,807 --> 01:30:59,676
which, by totaI coincidence, was
onIy a few hours away from my schooI.

1329
01:30:59,812 --> 01:31:01,541
As for me, I managed to earn

1330
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,945
my Carnegie MeIIon tuition
with Sidney's heIp after aII.

1331
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:07,575
The man couId truIy seII anything,

1332
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,449
even my shop cIass project.

1333
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:12,421
A birdhouse and security camera,
aII in one.

1334
01:31:12,558 --> 01:31:14,788
OnIy $19.99.

1335
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:17,691
Mr. Hanover even compromised
on Abby majoring in art,

1336
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:21,425
so Iong as she went to a top coIIege,
which worked out perfectIy for me.

1337
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,626
- So how does it look?
- Nice crown.

1338
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:26,101
Thanks. I thought it
went with the t-shirt.

1339
01:31:28,007 --> 01:31:30,976
So I guess my dad was right after aII.

1340
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:34,045
To win the race,
you have to be in the race.

1341
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:38,514
Sometimes it just takes a IittIe girI
drama to find out who your friends are.

1342
01:31:38,651 --> 01:31:42,883
And, once you have that,
you can survive aImost anything...

1343
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:46,318
...even high schooI.
