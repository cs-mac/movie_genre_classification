1
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,380
It's where we want to be.

2
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,839
It's where you want to be,
it's where I want to be...

3
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,259
Honey, that's all I've been saying.
I've been saying that.

4
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,677
I mean, this is New York City.

5
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,095
It's the greatest city on Earth,

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,097
and we get to own a part of it.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,807
Or we keep renting.

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,560
George, please. It's time
for us to own something.

9
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,103
We're not kids anymore.

10
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,271
It's true. Pros and cons,

11
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,022
one more time. Okay.

12
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,774
Go ahead. Talk it over
again. Okay, good.

13
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,234
Pros. Great neighborhood.

14
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,318
It's a great neighborhood.

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,445
A block from Joe's Coffee.
I Iove that coffee.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,322
It's his favorite coffee.
Best coffee in the city.

17
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,574
Shade-grown, fair trade.

18
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,909
So, that's a pro. Coffee.

19
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,286
Con, money.

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,579
You said that we could do this.

21
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,581
I'll feel better once
I get my bonus.

22
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,417
HBO may make an offer
on my documentary.

23
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,668
Well...

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,170
Are we done with the pros and cons?

25
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,089
Another con would be space.

26
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,757
You know, it's a studio apartment.

27
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,385
No, it's a microloft.
It's a microloft.

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,554
It's written in here that it's a
microloft. We're adults here.

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,764
Let's call it what it is.
It's a studio apartment.

30
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,182
It says it somewhere.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,684
I've never even heard
of a microloft.

32
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,019
Does your husband do this?

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,521
My husband is blind.

34
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,732
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,358
No, there's no need to be sorry.

36
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,943
Pierre has been blind since birth.

37
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,279
Good. I mean, not "good,"
but, you know...

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,949
Don't worry, it's the only
reality he knows.

39
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,619
But, believe me, he can still
smell the Chanel on my neck.

40
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,537
He can still taste the
pain au chocolat

41
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,456
I bake for him from time to time.

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,249
He can still hear every stroke as

43
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,710
I brush my hair before
we Iie down at night.

44
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,879
And as for touch?

45
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,132
I can get him there with
one flick of the finger.

46
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,468
Okay, I know you're nervous,
but believe me

47
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,764
this neighborhood is a terrific
investment, even in a recession.

48
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,266
It's the West Village.
It's the best. Yeah.

49
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,185
Really the best.

50
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,728
This is where you want to be?

51
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,481
This is where we need to be.

52
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,442
Let's do it!

53
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,487
I'm so sorry. I bet this
happens all the time.

54
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,946
No.

55
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,948
Here we go. Wait.

56
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,753
Wow! Look at all this space!

57
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,690
Just right up against this...

58
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:23,828
I got a really big day tomorrow,
and you've got HBO.

59
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,497
I wouldn't mind taking a sleeping pill.

60
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,458
Oh, no! I can't take Rick right now.
I cannot take your brother.

61
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,584
I'll just... No Rick.

62
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,877
Come on, two minutes. Let's
just get it over with.

63
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,129
It's never two minutes.

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,382
Hey, Rick. Ricky Iicky,
suck my dicky.

65
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,801
Don't hate me 'cause
it's extra thicky.

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,387
AII right, enough gabbing.
Give me the grand tour.

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,596
AII right.

68
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,265
That's the kitchen. Small.

69
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,891
That's the bathroom. Small.

70
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,643
That's the bedroom. Small.

71
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,728
That's the tour.

72
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,897
Holy shit! Our TV room is twice
the size of your whole place.

73
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,441
Yeah, but you Iive in Atlanta.

74
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,817
Hi, George. Hey, Linda.

75
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,360
It is alive.

76
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,570
Hi, Marisa. Hi, Marisa.

77
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,029
Hi! You Iook great!

78
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,617
Thanks. I read this article that
said if you smile all the time,

79
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,829
you can trick your brain into
thinking that you're happy.

80
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,831
Really? Wow.

81
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,250
AII right, enough girl gab. I want
to show you the new baby.

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,418
New baby?

83
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,337
We adopted a black baby.
There she is.

84
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,925
AII the bells and whistles, 48
Iarge. And check this out.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,552
If some Jackamo tries
to steal my car,

86
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,095
I got a remote tracker on there.

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,764
Tells me where he is,
down to 10 yards.

88
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,350
I go down there, fucking police
escort, nab the motherfucker.

89
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,800
It's Iike, "See you in three
to five, ass wipe. You

90
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,771
fucking towel head."

91
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,315
So, you think a Sheik is
going to steal your car?

92
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,734
Hey, don't Iaugh, this is Atlanta.
We got CNN down here.

93
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,278
I think our connection is
bad. You're breaking up.

94
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,739
I can see you closing the
computer, dipshit.

95
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,910
I got to say, that Marisa,
one Iucky Iady

96
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,496
because she gets to be
married to him. Yeah.

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,624
Know what I want to do? I'm going
to take off that robe and...

98
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,001
It's okay.

99
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,045
Sorry. You're so tired. I know.

100
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,382
What say we break this place
in the old-fashioned way?

101
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,469
Don't fall asleep. Okay.

102
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,929
We can do this. I'm not
going to fall asleep.

103
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,689
Are you ready for your meeting?

104
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,733
Yep. Don't forget to smile.

105
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,778
AII right? Your movie is a Iittle bit
heavy, so keep the room Iight.

106
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,488
Do you not think I'm
a good filmmaker?

107
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,740
That's not what I said.
I think you're great.

108
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,701
I think you're a great children's
book illustrator,

109
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,620
a terrific jewelry designer.

110
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,372
I Ioved the homemade
ice cream business.

111
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,042
I am familiar with my eclectic
resume, thank you very much.

112
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,753
But, honey, with this film, you
know it, I found my niche.

113
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,090
I can fly. I believe I can fly.

114
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,508
Come on, say it.

115
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,426
Fine, I believe you can fly.

116
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,012
Get off your fucking phone!

117
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,431
Knock them dead. I'll call
you Iater. Good Iuck.

118
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,600
The world is becoming
a terrible place.

119
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,646
Antarctica is home to some of the
world's most beautiful wildlife,

120
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,648
most of whom are dead or dying.

121
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,317
This cute Iittle guy has
testicular cancer.

122
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,280
This Iittle girl's home melted
and her parents sank.

123
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,992
In our hunger for resources,
we are raping these animals.

124
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,451
We are raping them... Stop.

125
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,995
...and then we are murdering them.

126
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,747
Stop. Stop.

127
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,708
It's actually not finished.

128
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm getting a very interesting sense
of what you're going for here.

129
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,714
Thank you! There's no way in hell.
We're going to have to pass.

130
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,382
Mmm-hmm.

131
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,759
"Pass"? Yes, "pass."

132
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,554
But it's An Inconvenient Truth
meets March of the Penguins!

133
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,556
Meets "I want to slit my wrists,

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,392
"because this is the most depressing
thing I've ever seen."

135
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,435
I don't understand.

136
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,811
I think what Marcy
is saying, Linda,

137
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,271
and please correct me
if I'm wrong, Marcy,

138
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
I don't want to be off base here.

139
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,357
But what she's saying is that
she wants to slit her wrists

140
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,943
because this piece is depressing.

141
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,236
I got that. Yes.

142
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,738
I see that you're pregnant.

143
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,657
Thank you for noticing. What tipped
you off, my giant belly?

144
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,867
Or can you see my hemorrhoids

145
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,077
and my second thoughts from
where you're standing?

146
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,704
Don't you want your
child to grow up

147
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,581
in a world where there
are penguins?

148
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,000
To be perfectly frank,
fuck the penguins.

149
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,586
I don't think that what Marcy is
saying is to fuck the penguins.

150
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,297
No, it is what I'm saying.
Fuck the penguins.

151
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,798
And I Iove penguins. Uh-huh.

152
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,052
But I have to agree with
Marcy. Fuck them.

153
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,430
Java chip sounds Iike it's
going to be a winner.

154
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,723
How's the new place, man?

155
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,643
Oh, terrific. Super small
and really expensive.

156
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,728
Oh, my God, that does sound good.

157
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,980
Super small and really
expensive? Yeah.

158
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,608
Sometimes you can only get one of
those, but you got both of those.

159
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,026
Yeah, it's a deal. That's great.

160
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,277
How did that happen?

161
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,696
I know.

162
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,115
Reason number 25 I'm not married.

163
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,409
Like I need someone telling me
to buy shit I can't afford.

164
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,663
It's all about the Benjamins,
my friend. The Benjamins.

165
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,789
Yeah.

166
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,123
I'll be one of those
guys who's just

167
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,125
old and ugly, rich, has a hot wife.

168
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,627
Like...

169
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,545
Gollum. Not Gollum.

170
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,713
Georgie!

171
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,549
Come see me for a Iittle chat when
you get upstairs.

172
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,469
AII right! You got the
point and the wink.

173
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,054
Boss man Iikes you.

174
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,847
It just doesn't fit the HBO brand.

175
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,684
We do violence and heartache,
but it's sexy.

176
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,018
Mmm-hmm. Do you understand?

177
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,021
Of course. 
What was I thinking?

178
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,189
You know what we could do?

179
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,192
We could throw some vampires in there
to have sex with the penguins.

180
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,070
And then you could have brooding,
sexy Iittle vampire penguins.

181
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,446
Would that work for your brand?

182
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,991
What if the polar bears were
hookers, and on meth?

183
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,368
And then they show their tits for no reason. 
How would that work?

184
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,704
I think you're joking,

185
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,124
but if you could do that, that would
be very interesting for us.

186
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,001
Yeah, very interesting.

187
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,794
And if I do get the promotion,
then what?

188
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,504
I have to work more hours
at the job I hate.

189
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,048
Wow, you're really bumming me out, man. 
I hate this job, too.

190
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,216
Wait, what's going on?

191
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,802
Feds got in at 5:00 this morning.
Seized everything.

192
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,138
Georgie! Man with the plan.

193
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,056
I am going to take a Iittle rain
check on our chit-chat.

194
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,767
Company shutdown effective immediately.

195
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,897
Did I just get wink-point
shitcanned?

196
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,195
What are you doing here?
How did HBO go?

197
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,864
Well, they're passing on this one,

198
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,908
but they are definitely interested
in not seeing my other projects,

199
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,953
so it turns out I can't fly.

200
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,748
Why are you not at work, George?

201
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,459
Oh!
I got fired.

202
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,462
You want to sell?

203
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,883
Well, my work situation
has changed a Iittle.

204
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,968
Look, I'm going to be completely
honest with you guys.

205
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,178
The market has dropped.

206
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,512
We just bought it.

207
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,972
You said it was a good investment.

208
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,182
I think you said that.

209
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,391
You said that!

210
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,394
In any case, it doesn't
matter who said it.

211
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,646
Nobody's buying studio
apartments right now.

212
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,898
It's a microloft.

213
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,192
Okay, Iet's just grow up and
call things what they are.

214
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,693
It's a studio apartment.

215
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,070
I knew it!

216
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,572
Even if you could sell it,
it would be at a Ioss.

217
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,199
You're not seeing that money again.

218
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,995
As soon as we can get
back on our feet,

219
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,705
we'll talk about coming
back to New York.

220
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,248
Right now my brother
has offered me a job

221
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,000
and Atlanta's the best
place for us to be.

222
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,169
They call it "Hot-Ianta!"
Isn't that funny?

223
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,594
You're so obsessed with your Joe's Coffee. 
It had to be Joe's Coffee.

224
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,638
It's great fucking coffee!

225
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,438
We are fucked, we are fucked!

226
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,232
We're fucked! George, stop!

227
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,033
That's how much you made
Iast year, $800.

228
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,202
You know what? I think you
Iike that I don't work.

229
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
How could you Iet this
happen to us?

230
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,330
Eight hundred dollars!

231
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,040
I didn't mean it. I was upset.

232
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,459
Yes, I meant it!
I told you, you did!

233
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,883
Oh!

234
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,601
You were the one that
said, "Let's Iook

235
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,145
"in the West Village to
buy an apartment."

236
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,813
I'm turning on the music!
Don't turn on that music.

237
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,031
Cock.

238
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,336
I can't be in this car
anymore! Jesus Christ!

239
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,422
I just can't. We've got
to stop somewhere.

240
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,215
Fine. Okay.

241
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,717
I'm just really tired, okay?

242
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,968
I said "fine," all right?

243
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,803
Just quit selling me
after I said yes.

244
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,140
Elysium Bed and Breakfast,
10 miles. Fine.

245
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,920
Oh, my God, it's just a shack
and it's closed. I'm going

246
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,854
to scream, George.

247
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,022
It's a fruit stand.

248
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,774
Hold on, what's down that road?

249
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,238
"Elysium. Dreams dispensed daily.
Bring your own container."

250
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,656
I just hope they have a bed.

251
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,618
If they didn't, it would probably be
called "Elysium just Breakfast."

252
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,536
Does everything have to
be a joke, George?

253
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,540
Are you Iooking for the B and B?

254
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,209
It's another half mile.
You can't miss it.

255
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,420
Thank you. Thank you.

256
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
Leave? Yeah.

257
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,299
Back up, back up, back up.

258
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,927
No, no, no.

259
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,470
He's following us!
What does he want?

260
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,388
Honey, he's coming after
us! Oh, my God!

261
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,057
What does he want? I don't know!

262
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
He wants to chop us
up into 100 pieces

263
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,602
to make a suit out of our skins!

264
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,145
I don't know. Just back up faster!

265
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,481
The Bed and Breakfast is the
other way! The other way!

266
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,817
He's getting really close!
Hurry! What are you doing?

267
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,361
Oh, my God!

268
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,947
Oh, God! Oh, God!

269
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,828
Are you guys okay?

270
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,330
Oh, boy.

271
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,250
There is nothing we can do
about it until morning.

272
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,417
But we'll take care of you.

273
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,753
My name is Wayne, by the
way. I'm a nudist.

274
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,880
Yes, we noticed your penis earlier.

275
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,423
Touche!

276
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,929
I'm sorry?

277
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,765
Don't be sorry. It means "good
evening" in Swedish.

278
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,767
I studied economics in Stockholm.

279
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,977
But don't worry, I'm
not going to be

280
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,186
throwing Swedish at you all night.

281
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,146
"God afton" is pretty much
all I can remember.

282
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,066
But there I go, running
off at the mouth again.

283
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,319
Some people call it "verbal diarrhea."
I just call it "word shit."

284
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,363
I'm a butterfly!

285
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,407
I've got wings!

286
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,741
Grisham is a butterfly.

287
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,618
I'm really a boy.

288
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,162
Okay, that will be our
secret. AII right!

289
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,207
He thinks I didn't hear what
you just said, but I did.

290
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,544
These folks pulled the old
flip-de-doo at the ravine.

291
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,004
Probably trying to back
out because they

292
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,797
thought I was some kind
of naked weirdo.

293
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,590
No. Yeah.

294
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,385
Do you have a room?

295
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,345
Do you remember downstairs
a minute ago

296
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,222
when you asked if I had a room?

297
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,391
Does this answer your question?

298
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,892
Yeah, I guess it does.

299
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,352
Completely.

300
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,854
I'm Kathy, by the way.

301
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,897
I'm Linda. That's George.

302
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,065
Hello.

303
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,984
"George," huh?

304
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,363
If you're George, then where's
John, Paul and Ringo?

305
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,991
Ah.

306
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,328
Where are they? Did you bring them?

307
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,580
No, I didn't bring them.

308
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,040
Not even Ringo?

309
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,042
Nope.

310
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,384
You know I'm kidding,
right? I do, yeah.

311
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,636
We're really tired, Kathy.

312
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,096
Okey-dokey.

313
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,265
Thank you, though. God afternoon.

314
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,030
What is that?

315
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,824
I thought it was you.

316
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,035
Me, doing what?

317
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,873
Please, baby. I'm so tired.

318
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,041
Oh, God.

319
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,125
I beg of you.

320
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,211
Please make it go away.

321
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,463
You're my hero.

322
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,287
George?

323
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,334
George!

324
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,794
That's it, George!

325
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,796
Linda! Yes.

326
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,549
Kathy told me that you
had beautiful skin.

327
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,427
But she's a Iiar, because
it is Iuminous.

328
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,554
Thank you. Who are you?

329
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,097
My name is Karen.

330
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm sorry if my hands smell Iike tahini. 
I was just making some hummus.

331
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,352
Take it home!

332
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,066
This is much Iess aggressive
than clapping.

333
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,277
Try it, try it. Seriously,
it's better.

334
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
Babe, can I talk to you just
for a second, outside?

335
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,533
Did you smoke pot?

336
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,703
No.

337
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,123
Why did you just Iie to me? 
I'm not going to tell on you.

338
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,125
I had one hit. One?

339
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,044
I think it might be the best pot
I've ever had in my Iife.

340
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,089
You have to try this.

341
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,383
Hey, Rodney. What's up?
What's up? What's up?

342
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,051
This is Linda.

343
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,636
Hey. Here you go, beautiful.

344
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,180
Linda with the Iuminous skin,

345
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,474
it's so nice to meet
you. Thank you.

346
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,976
Did you know that all these
people, they Iive here?

347
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,811
This is a commune.
Isn't that crazy?

348
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,021
That's crazy.

349
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,647
I'm Rodney, I'm her husband.

350
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,275
He's an African-American.

351
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,612
Wow, you guys are really in Iove.

352
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,741
We are. We are just as much in Iove
as if we were the same color.

353
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,368
We actually had our wedding
ceremony right here

354
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,329
and Seth was our spiritual
officiant.

355
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,455
Who's Seth?

356
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,207
You haven't met Seth?

357
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,917
In a word, he's

358
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,879
a teacher, a guide, a coach,
a guru, a shaman.

359
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,964
He's everything.

360
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,049
Everything.

361
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,759
So, Seth is your Ieader?

362
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,260
No, no, no.

363
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,221
We have no Ieaders here.

364
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,641
Mother Earth is the only
Ieader we need.

365
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,727
You two must be the proud owners of

366
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,771
that upside-down people-mover
out in the driveway.

367
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,564
I'm Seth.

368
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,608
I'm George. This is Linda.

369
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,734
Hi. Hi.

370
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,861
Looks Iike you made
it out unscathed.

371
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,698
Not totally unscathed. Ow!

372
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,243
Feel it?

373
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,539
How do you feel?

374
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm better, I think.

375
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,166
That's good.

376
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,210
We'll deal with those withholding
father issues another time.

377
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,046
And you must be...

378
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,297
I'm Linda.

379
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,259
Linda.

380
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,219
Hi. Oh.

381
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,222
You smell Iike walnuts and suede.

382
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,308
Walnuts and suede.

383
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,396
Welcome to Elysium. Come on,
I'll show you around.

384
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,899
That's a God's eye. I made
it myself, Iast Kwanzaa.

385
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,568
I Iove what you've got going here.

386
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,069
Honest, I feel Iike I can breathe

387
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,904
for the first time in I
don't know how Iong.

388
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,239
It's incredible!

389
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,076
How Iong has the house been here?

390
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,289
I bought this house in 1971
with nine of my friends.

391
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:07,210
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis, Ronny
Shames, Danielle Meltser,

392
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:12,173
Janie Brody, Billy Marcus,
Glen Stover, Tony Piloski,

393
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,425
and Janice Woo.

394
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,094
Meet Carvin. He's kind of the
Iion around these parts.

395
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,680
So, have you Iived here
this entire time?

396
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,100
Yeah, ever since I bought
the place in 1971.

397
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,977
Right. With nine of my friends.

398
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,480
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis, Ronny
Shames, Danielle Meltser...

399
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,857
Those are the names you just said.

400
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,193
Yeah. Billy Marcus, Glen
Stover, Tony Piloski...

401
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,029
Those are all people you've
already named.

402
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,864
So, you don't have
to say them again.

403
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,407
Any of those people
still Iive here?

404
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,994
No, no. They're mostly dead.

405
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
Pretty much dead.

406
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,956
I'm going to go to bed.

407
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,291
Good night.

408
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,709
Dead but not forgotten.

409
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,252
I mean, who knows how many days

410
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,670
any of us have Ieft on this Earth?

411
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,796
Right.

412
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,759
That's why I choose to fill my
Iife with nature and Iaughter

413
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,344
and friendship,

414
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,054
Iove.

415
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,267
This is some commune.

416
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,810
"Commune"?

417
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,397
Boo, hiss. We prefer the term
"intentional community."

418
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,649
When you hear the word "commune,"

419
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,900
you think of a bunch of hippies

420
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,070
sitting around, smoking
pot and playing guitar.

421
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,906
Hey!

422
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,991
I'm Eva! Hi!

423
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,660
I hear you guys are from New York.

424
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,245
Fellow New Yorker.
88th and Broadway.

425
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,372
Oh!

426
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,706
Yeah.

427
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,626
What do you know?

428
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,420
We're from the West Village. Yeah.

429
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,422
Waverly and Christopher.
The best neighborhood!

430
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,507
I know!

431
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,300
I know New York is a great city

432
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,052
but I do not miss that
Iifestyle at all.

433
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,514
It was just stress and BlackBerrys
and sleeping pills.

434
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,183
I used to drink a triple Iatte
every morning just to wake up.

435
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,685
I see your point,

436
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,145
but I kind of value
the sleeping pill

437
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,856
and the BlackBerry and the Iatte.

438
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,526
You know, you can really get
trapped in that web of

439
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,863
beepers and Zenith televisions
and Walkmans and Discmans,

440
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,199
floppy disks and zip drives.

441
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,704
Laser discs, answering machines
and Nintendo Power Glove.

442
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,790
Wow, you know so much
about technology.

443
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,042
AII right, the pond
behind the house

444
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,129
is just begging to be dipped in.

445
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,463
Skinny style.

446
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,716
Let's do it. Let's do it.

447
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,050
Yeah, Iet's...

448
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,343
You're unbelievable.

449
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,678
Skinny style!

450
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,305
George! George!
Jump in, George!

451
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,600
Atta boy, baby!

452
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,398
I cannot believe...

453
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,151
I'm naked! I'm naked!

454
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,863
I'm sorry. My bad.

455
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,367
A Iot of magical things
have happened

456
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,785
since you walked through
those doors.

457
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,997
Amen. My menstrual cycle
started back up again.

458
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,290
Stop. What?

459
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,000
And I don't even have a uterus.

460
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,627
I mean, I have it. It's in a jar.

461
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,255
It's actually in the room that you're staying in.

462
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,882
This is great, actually, because

463
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,010
we actually totally forgot
to pack our uterus.

464
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,224
Hey, all right! I Iike your shirt.

465
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,852
Here.

466
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,228
No, man, I can't do that.

467
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,813
We share everything here.

468
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,941
Wow.

469
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,071
Who are these people?

470
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,073
I have no idea.

471
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,659
I'm just going with it.

472
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,245
God afton.

473
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,665
One! Two! Three!

474
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,917
Give it a nice push!

475
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,932
Oh, you guys.

476
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,600
Incredible night. Truly.

477
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,852
Do you take credit cards?

478
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,938
No, no, we all decided that
you paid us Iast night

479
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,817
with your friendship and honesty
and your stories.

480
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,862
I mean... That's so kind.

481
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,613
Do we get change back for that?

482
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,409
If we didn't need the money
so badly, we would insist.

483
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,745
Just remember, money buys nothing.

484
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,540
Nothing important, right?

485
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,501
No, no. Money Iiterally
buys nothing.

486
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,795
I think you mean metaphorically.

487
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,963
No, Iiterally. Nothing.

488
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,382
Literally, money buys most things.

489
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,217
No, nothing. Are you saying that...

490
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,052
I'm saying that Iiterally, it...

491
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,138
No, but I'm saying, Iiterally,
money buys nothing.

492
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,890
It buys nothing. You're right.

493
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,558
Money pays for nothing.

494
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,976
That's right.

495
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,026
But not Iiterally. Honey.

496
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,029
And I don't want to hear that this
one slipped back into the world of

497
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,450
two-way pagers and VCRs and
The Arsenio Hall Show.

498
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,952
You can't express your feelings

499
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,330
by sending a Ietter through
a fax machine.

500
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,498
Oh, God.

501
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,834
I'm having a feeling.

502
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,753
Hey, man.

503
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,922
And the feeling is that
you guys should stay.

504
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,298
We can't.

505
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,091
Wow. That is so sweet.

506
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,968
You never hear that at Embassy
Suites, do you?

507
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,970
No, you don't.

508
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,181
Anyway, you don't have
to answer now.

509
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,683
Just suck on it for a while.

510
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,728
Yeah.

511
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,813
We'll mull it over.

512
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,398
Suck on it.

513
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,984
Wait!

514
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,612
I made this for you guys.

515
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,822
So you'll always remember Elysium.

516
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,700
Wow! What is it?

517
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,036
It's some sticks glued
to orange peels.

518
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:22,251
Bye!

519
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,586
L, George!

520
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,588
You the man! You the man!

521
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,716
Bye! We Iove you!

522
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,426
We Iove you!

523
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,806
Bye, guys!

524
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,658
Hi!

525
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,451
George and Linda! Oh, my gosh!

526
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,830
What happened? We were so
worried sick about you!

527
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,914
What happened?

528
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,084
What do you mean? We just
spoke an hour ago.

529
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,419
Oh, that was you.

530
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,255
I was too embarrassed
to say, "Who is it?"

531
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,843
There he is, my moron homeless brother!
Where's your cardboard box?

532
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,429
Get over here, I'm going to
fill up your soup bowl.

533
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,598
Come on, you Iose your sense of humor
when you Iost your apartment?

534
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,601
"But I want
to stay in my apartment

535
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,854
"even though I can't
pay my mortgage."

536
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,024
"I'm all upset."

537
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,277
Linda, Iook at you, your
body is redonkulous.

538
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,446
Have you been working out? My God!

539
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,532
Rick, I think you're making
everybody uncomfortable.

540
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,367
Oh, everybody knows what I mean.

541
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,245
Hey, Tanner, come out here and say
hello to your aunt and uncle.

542
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,872
Hi, Uncle George and Linda.

543
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,708
Hey, Tanner! Wow, you're so big!

544
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:48,421
So I'm not five years old anymore.
It's such a freaking shocker.

545
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,800
Funny. Yeah.

546
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,926
What a shithead.

547
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,304
What's that over there? Is
that a margarita machine?

548
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:01,225
Oh, yes, this is my new very best
friend in the whole wide world.

549
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,186
I have a Iittle bit of
a SkyMall problem.

550
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,104
Do you want one? I can
make you one. Please.

551
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,274
We normally have a 4:30 ritual
and I always say,

552
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,737
"Why have 5:00 when you
could have 4:30?"

553
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,155
Do you ever read SkyMall?

554
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,281
Yeah, when I'm on a plane.

555
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,657
Yeah. It's good reading.

556
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,618
Little more. Okay.

557
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,454
Keep going. Okay.

558
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,506
I thought you rented construction
equipment.

559
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,341
I do. Porta-Pottys.

560
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,302
What do you think, construction
workers hold it in all day?

561
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,597
Here's a Iittle business model for
you, Mr. New York Fancy Pants.

562
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,432
They shit, I rake it in.

563
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,772
What, are you grossed out by money?

564
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,816
So, this is the new den,

565
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,444
and this is where I sit and
watch TV all day Iong.

566
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,115
Just wasting my Iife away.

567
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,784
Thank God for Wellbutrin, right?

568
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,869
I'm alone most of the time.

569
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,037
Rick work a Iot?

570
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,709
Well, he entertains clients at
night or has affairs or...

571
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,795
I'm kidding, of course. Are you?

572
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,380
I have a dildo in here.

573
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,299
Feel free to use it and know
that it's clean because

574
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,969
I put it through the dishwasher
Iike Whoopi say to do.

575
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,095
Can we top these off?

576
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,304
Do you Iike hamburgers?

577
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,390
Rick's going to grill some
hamburgers this weekend.

578
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,601
I have mixed feelings
about being a parent.

579
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,565
Here you go, shithead.
Simple data entry.

580
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,900
Do they still
use computers in New York City?

581
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,862
Yeah. You want me to
enter this data?

582
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,572
Are you questioning me?
Don't question me.

583
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,200
Here, you're not my brother, you're
not my buddy, you're my employee.

584
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,827
Got it? Are you serious?

585
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,787
Am I serious? You're fired.

586
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,585
You're rehired, okay? Consider that
a warning shot. Get to work.

587
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,337
Paco, watch this guy, all right?

588
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,673
Do me a favor. Keep
your eye on Paco,

589
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,634
because I don't trust
these people, okay?

590
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,690
You're drinking already?

591
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,484
It's a mimosa. It's
a breakfast drink.

592
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,903
You know, it's kind of funny.

593
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,280
Because when we were kids, George
used to mooch off me.

594
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,450
And now that we're all grown up,
the mooching has begun again.

595
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,868
You win, Rick.

596
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,662
You got a big house, you're a big
success. You're the winner.

597
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,040
Come on. You know I'm being
a dick to be a dick.

598
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,626
I'm just being a dick to be a
dick. Family's family, right?

599
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,377
My Iittle brother needs
a job, I hook him up.

600
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,087
I'm Iooking for something
on my own, actually.

601
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,089
In this economy? You think you're
going to find something?

602
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,507
Here comes the Iecture.

603
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,176
"Here comes..."

604
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,054
"Here comes the..."

605
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,264
AII right, then I'll shut up.

606
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,226
I'll shut up. You know
what? I'll shut up.

607
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,478
Because I don't want
to Iecture you.

608
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,317
In my own house!

609
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,278
God damn it!

610
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,580
Okay, you know what?

611
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:14,794
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I "apologize," okay?

612
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,505
But can I give you one
piece of advice?

613
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,090
You're doing it wrong.

614
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,259
Rick, come on. Can I get
a word in edgewise here?

615
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,177
You come to my house,
crawling for help.

616
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,346
What do I do? I open
my door to you!

617
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,722
Can I please have some
more mimosa juice?

618
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,099
Marisa, please, mimosa juice.

619
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,435
You know, you don't have a goddamn
clue how to Iive Iife!

620
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,938
I gave you a gift, and you
think you can do better?

621
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,190
Who else do you know who
owns their own company?

622
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,359
So what if it's the
doo-doo business?

623
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,528
You want this? This
is how you get it!

624
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,197
Forget what you think
and do what I say!

625
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,242
I pull down six figures, George.
You should Iisten to me!

626
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,577
But you just talk, talk,
talk, talk...

627
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,874
Who knows how many days any
of us have on this Earth?

628
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,420
I want to fill mine with Iaughter,
happiness and Iove.

629
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,796
Let's get the fuck out of here.

630
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,216
Linda, take off your
robe. We're Ieaving.

631
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,510
No, upstairs, with your other
clothes. I'm sorry.

632
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,845
Come on. Okay.

633
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,097
Are you guys going
to be back for dinner?

634
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,645
With open arms and open hearts

635
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,316
we welcome George and Linda
as resident members

636
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,484
of the Elysium community.

637
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,987
Welcome home.

638
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
AII right!

639
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,284
This is it.

640
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,618
What? Wait a minute.

641
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,329
What happened to that fancy
room with the fireplace

642
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,955
that we were in the Iast time?

643
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,458
That room is for paying guests,
you silly billy.

644
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,211
I Iove it. I think it's great. What
more do we need, you know?

645
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,423
We got a bed. It Iooks
nice and broken in.

646
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,801
We've got a shelf, got a door...

647
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,595
...way.

648
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,013
Got a doorway.

649
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,473
Doors close us off
from one another.

650
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,516
We Iike to keep a nice,
open flow in the house.

651
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,435
Yeah, I don't need a door.
Do you need a door?

652
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,187
Nah.

653
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,398
I'm glad we don't have a door.
Doors are bullshit.

654
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,691
That's right.

655
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,822
Honey, I can't do this. I can't.

656
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,783
I Iike doors. I Iove them, in fact.

657
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,951
We're going to stay here. This
is the best place for us.

658
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,536
He's absolutely right, Linda.

659
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,913
Seth, you're back!

660
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,164
I never Ieft.

661
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,958
I was just relaxing outside
the door, here.

662
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,668
But I think you two should
talk privately.

663
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,671
AII right.

664
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh, my God. Is this the stupidest,

665
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,551
most crazy decision
we have ever made?

666
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,345
Honey, come on. We're just
running away from Iife.

667
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,847
Linda, the concept of an intentional
community Iike Elysium

668
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,100
is far more involved
and far more evolved

669
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,060
than any of these plastic,
shrink-wrapped

670
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,561
summations you're coming out with.

671
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,063
He's right. Thank you, Seth.

672
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,564
Thank you.

673
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,402
Is he gone? Let me see.

674
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,571
I'm not gone yet. But I'm
going to Ieave now.

675
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,411
George, convince me that
this is the right thing.

676
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,840
Didn't you feel more alive
that first night than you

677
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,789
had in a Iong time?

678
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,041
Yes, I did. Honey, it was amazing.

679
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,001
So why shouldn't we feel
that every day?

680
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,295
I think it's such a obvious choice.

681
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,713
There's no one way
to Iive our Iives.

682
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,048
I think it's really
cool if we do that.

683
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,299
I get what you mean.

684
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,760
It's not Iike we're signing a Iease.
If we don't Iike it, we Ieave.

685
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,262
But Iet's stay a month,
and at the end

686
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,472
we can decide if we're in
it for the Iong haul.

687
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,099
Two weeks.

688
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,855
Two weeks.

689
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,620
Hey, George.

690
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,623
I need a wine critic,
I got a new batch.

691
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,168
Why not? I'm not driving.

692
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,420
It's got to be better
than this, anyway.

693
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,672
To you. Welcome to the clan.

694
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,798
Thank you.

695
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,924
Welcome.

696
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,886
Mmm.

697
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,680
That's Italian.

698
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,182
These grapes were grown
here in Georgia,

699
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,641
so the proper word would
be "delicious."

700
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,726
I'm going to Iet that go.

701
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,478
Let what go? You know what?

702
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,314
I'm going to show you the
method to my madness.

703
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,398
Okay.

704
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,735
But first, I have to put on the
old dangle bag, just in case.

705
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,361
Just in case of what?

706
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,655
You know, pubes.

707
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,959
You're certainly the first nudist
winemaker I've ever met.

708
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,336
There's a Iot of us.

709
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,670
Yeah, we meet from time to time.

710
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,922
But my real passion is writing.

711
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,216
Yeah? I'm writing
a novel right now.

712
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,134
Hi. Hi, honey!

713
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,845
What's that?

714
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,765
We're choking the
birds on our smoke.

715
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,600
Detergents in the ocean.

716
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,438
Seth, are you okay?

717
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,275
Yeah! Never been better, my man.

718
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,446
I just Iike to begin my day with
a Iittle primal gesticulating.

719
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,448
We were convinced that someone
was getting axe-murdered.

720
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,824
The only thing getting axe-murdered

721
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,117
are my anxieties, tensions
and fears.

722
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,911
Speaking figuratively, of course.

723
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,371
I'm against violence of any kind.

724
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,747
Come on, gesticulate with me.

725
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
I'll give it a shot.

726
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,293
So, what you do is just basically

727
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,213
shout out whatever you don't Iike!

728
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,881
Shout it out!

729
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,925
Why is there war?

730
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,969
Mushrooms!

731
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,971
Sure. Mushrooms!

732
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,681
It's a textural thing for me.

733
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,599
Pomegranates.

734
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,268
The Dallas Cowboys!

735
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,894
Hummers!

736
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,356
The car, not an actual...

737
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,316
Pick something a Iittle
more global.

738
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,236
Ketchup! I don't Iike that.
No, ketchup's okay.

739
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,862
AII right! Traffic!

740
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,073
Really try and come up with some
stuff that's self-reflective.

741
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,075
Wheatgrass! Wheatgrass?

742
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,243
It tastes Iike grass!

743
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,369
I know!

744
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,330
War! War!

745
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,040
He's doing great. War!

746
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,251
Great job! And other card games!

747
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,586
Thanks.

748
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,421
Linda, do you want to top that?

749
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,589
No. AII right.

750
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,881
I won't right now.

751
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,049
You're sure? Yeah.

752
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,342
We're going to get you in here.

753
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,052
Time is our friend.

754
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,679
Oh, my God! This
place is incredible!

755
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,222
Do you Iive here?

756
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,559
No. I Iive wherever I am.

757
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,519
But this is where I
take my slumber.

758
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,146
So, what do you do when it rains?

759
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,689
I drink the nourishment that Gaia

760
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,858
is feeding me through
her cloud teats.

761
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,445
You guys are getting
the hang of it.

762
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,946
Get some callus on those
hands of yours.

763
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,281
Oh, yeah!

764
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,992
Hey, man.

765
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,537
Look at this. We've got an
axe man in Brother G.

766
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,457
You guys Iike Spin Doctors?

767
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah!

768
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,662
Go Seth!

769
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,797
Oh, my God.

770
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,175
Coming your way in
a second, George.

771
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,678
Take it!

772
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,971
Come on, take a solo!

773
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,435
Rip it out, man. Let it out.

774
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,021
Let it out from your heart,
not from your fingers.

775
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,606
Wait, wait.

776
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,943
I don't Iike it. I don't Iike it.

777
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,862
It's a simple story. Princes.

778
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,282
Like this, ready? Watch.
Just nice and simple.

779
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,456
You.

780
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,002
It's Iike he has sausage fingers.

781
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,587
I feel stupid.

782
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,423
Honey, that was great.

783
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,757
You just go, man.

784
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,092
Are you sure? Yeah.

785
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,593
Please! Erase this.

786
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,220
But what am I going to sing?

787
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,305
Give me something to sing about.

788
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,515
Linda.

789
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,642
Wind?

790
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,271
"The Wind" by Linda.

791
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,815
You're really good. Okay.

792
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,656
The ways of the wind

793
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:28,203
Won't free you from sin, woman

794
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,331
See your sweet breasts heavin'

795
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,627
Feel my blue jeans screamin'

796
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,754
Yes, sir.

797
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,092
I'm gonna Iove you Iike an animal

798
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:50,017
Eat you alive, woman

799
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,979
Seeds

800
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,106
and

801
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:01,528
all

802
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,702
That was pure magic.

803
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,828
Who wrote that?

804
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,038
You did.

805
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,206
I did not.

806
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,583
That's Iike saying, "Did
you make that coffee?"

807
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,794
No, I didn't make that coffee.

808
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,172
I'm just the coffee pot.

809
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,381
You're the beans.

810
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,040
This is awesome.

811
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,458
Isn't that cool? Yeah.

812
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,572
No fucking doors.

813
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,660
I can help you with
the constipation.

814
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,830
A Iittle senna root from the garden
ground up with some cannabis.

815
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,958
I'm all right, thanks.
Yeah, I just sat down.

816
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,543
I don't know what to
give you for that.

817
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,587
I'm really all right. I
don't need anything.

818
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,716
I Iike that. It's Iike, "If it
ain't broke, don't fix it."

819
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,634
That's the bottom Iine, right?

820
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,055
That's the bottom Iine. AII right,
I Iike that. I Iike that.

821
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,683
So, I need your car keys.

822
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,809
What?

823
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,729
We share everything here,
George. Truck's in town.

824
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,441
Yeah, sure. Most of our
stuff is still in it.

825
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,610
But, here you go. My
car is your car.

826
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,986
Right on. Right on.

827
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,072
So, I'm Iight on your biography.
Where are you from?

828
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,199
Could we talk about this Iater?

829
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,412
I Iike that. Kathy said
you were really funny.

830
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,747
My ears are ringing.

831
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,041
Hope I'm not interrupting boy time.

832
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,084
Actually, more Iike, "me time."

833
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,879
Seth called a truth circle.

834
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,173
You newbies are going to Iove it!

835
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,091
Let's go.

836
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,176
I'll wait for you.

837
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,102
Now then,

838
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:43,023
what would you say
a truth circle is?

839
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,568
A circle of people that
tell the truth?

840
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,279
Exactly right. Good, Linda.

841
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,281
Context clues. Do you
see how she did that?

842
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,699
Here, George.

843
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,618
What is this?

844
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,994
It's ayahuasca tea.

845
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,121
Oh.

846
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,790
I think I'll pass.

847
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,043
We feel that sharing the tea is an
extension of sharing our truths.

848
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,337
It smells Iike Willie
Nelson's braids.

849
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,256
You interrupted me, George.

850
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,342
Well, hey, was I Iying?

851
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,635
Not yet.

852
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,220
Linda, would you Iike to start?

853
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,972
Okay. Um...

854
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,515
You're Iying.

855
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,808
I didn't say anything yet.

856
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,976
You didn't have to.

857
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,519
I'm wondering, maybe I
shouldn't go first.

858
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,853
I think maybe somebody
else should...

859
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,313
I'll go.

860
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,525
Truth, I'm worried that
my changing body

861
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,735
may make me Iess desirable
to my partner.

862
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,696
Less desirable?

863
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,408
I find you sexier than ever. As
we used to say in Charleston,

864
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,034
"When the belly starts to show,

865
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,494
"that's when the titties
start to grow."

866
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,329
And everybody knows I Iove titties.

867
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,289
Everybody knows I Iove titties!

868
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,499
Stunning truth.

869
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,919
Linda, do you want to try again?
Something true this time?

870
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,006
Okay.

871
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,674
I can't believe you're
going to sit here

872
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,592
and puke your Iies all over us.

873
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,177
What?

874
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,387
If I wanted my face
covered in Iies,

875
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,806
I would still be in porn. Right?

876
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,519
Obviously, we've never done this
before and it's a Iittle...

877
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,688
It's probably just hard for you
because you're so full of shit.

878
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,566
Linda, don't Iet George disrespect
your process.

879
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,775
What?

880
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,444
Just think of George
as a crying baby.

881
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,279
A crying, broken Iittle baby.

882
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,489
Wow, thanks a Iot, Seth.
I appreciate that.

883
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,576
Do you really appreciate it, or are
you just Iying directly to my face?

884
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,785
I'm being sarcastic.

885
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,287
Look who's decided to be truthful.

886
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,960
He actually uses sarcasm
when he gets into uncomfortable

887
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
confrontations.

888
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,461
Yeah, right, Iike I do that.

889
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,713
And you hate it.

890
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,964
I don't Iove it.

891
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,466
Or maybe you hate it.

892
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,093
It gets old. It does get a
Iittle... Yes, I hate it.

893
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,344
You hate it when I make jokes?

894
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,389
I can tell when you don't really care
and you're just humoring me.

895
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,183
And how does that make
you feel, Linda?

896
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,269
Like crap. Like my problems
don't matter.

897
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,272
What are you talking about? Your
problems are my problems.

898
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,650
Minus the eczema. That
would be your problem.

899
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:55,072
See? I hate that. And I
don't feel supported.

900
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,281
What? I don't feel...

901
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,699
Did you just say, "I don't
feel Iike I support..."?

902
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,493
Yes, I did. You want the truth?

903
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:02,120
I work Iike crazy so you
can make a documentary

904
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,082
about penguins with
testicular cancer!

905
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,292
The point is, you jump...
Here's the point.

906
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,710
Linda, he's getting to the
point. Let me get...

907
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,755
This is when the breakthroughs
happen.

908
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,923
Would you please Iet
me get to the point?

909
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,342
Don't get angry at me!
Get angry at her.

910
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,011
I work... "Linda." Start
with "Linda."

911
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,888
Linda... Don't edit yourself.

912
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,264
I'm not. "Linda."

913
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,183
I work... Have at her, George.

914
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,309
Hit her! What?

915
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,938
Not with your hands. With
words, with your truth.

916
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,439
I'll hit you with truths.

917
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,024
Do you want to know what
it's Iike to work

918
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,652
as hard as I do and get
no appreciation?

919
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,155
Just so you can do whatever flight
of fancy you have this year

920
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,034
whether it's pottery, or photography,
or it's "the Occasional Cafe."

921
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,953
What the fuck is "the
Occasional Cafe"?

922
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,246
That was an occasional cafe!

923
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,747
Pick one thing and just
stick with it!

924
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,750
Do you know how hard it is
to be married to somebody

925
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,378
who is still trying to figure
out their major?

926
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,718
I'm sorry that I haven't
figured out

927
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,304
what it is that I Iove
to do yet, George.

928
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,349
But at Ieast I'm not sitting in
a fucking office Iike you did

929
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,644
miserable, hating your job,
and complaining about it.

930
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,980
That job that I sat at and
complained about every day

931
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,523
paid for the apartment
you wanted so much.

932
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,024
We don't even have it anymore.

933
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,865
Linda, is there anything else
you want to say to George?

934
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,159
Any other ways he's completely
failed you?

935
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,413
Do you want the truth?

936
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,878
George is right.

937
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,796
He's totally right.

938
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,761
I've never committed to anything
in my entire Iife.

939
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,351
No, it's not...

940
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,312
It's true.

941
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,521
Linda,

942
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,357
I think you just met Linda.

943
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,611
You're an amazing woman.

944
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,780
Thank you. Thank you so much.

945
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,282
I have one more question.

946
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,701
Ask anything, my sweet
soul warrior.

947
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,330
Why is that grass crying?

948
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,457
It's really Ioud.

949
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,876
I have a feeling that
it's my fault.

950
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,295
Because I think I made it cry.

951
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,546
Don't take it personally.

952
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,006
What the fuck are you
talking about?

953
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,591
It's the ayahuasca.

954
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,220
What the fuck is going on?

955
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,305
Ayahuasca has hallucinogenic
properties.

956
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,349
It's Iike a stronger peyote.

957
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,351
Mine just kicked in.

958
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,269
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

959
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,188
Yeah, no, I don't think
it's affecting me.

960
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,106
I think mine's starting
to kick in, too.

961
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,151
I can see George's spirit animal.

962
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,277
What? What?

963
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,403
What did you say? What did you say?

964
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,447
You see my spirit animal?
You see my spirit animal?

965
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,531
What is it? 
What?

966
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,616
Huh? Huh?

967
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,784
Oh, Jesus Christ!

968
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,827
Hey, guys, I just Iost my keys.

969
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,871
I had them right in this pocket.

970
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,790
She's going to
have so much fun.

971
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,669
There's a snake
in the mirror.

972
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,360
The word that's coming
out of my mouth Iooks

973
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,800
Iike a tiny pink mouse.

974
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,306
Are you okay?

975
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,149
Yeah, yeah!

976
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,654
Whoa! Holy shit!

977
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,242
Sweetheart, Iisten to
me. Listen to me.

978
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,412
You are tripping your balls off.

979
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,623
I can fly! I believe
I can fly, George!

980
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,918
Metaphorically, I believe you can
fly. Literally, you can't fly!

981
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,545
I believe I can fly!

982
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,214
If you're going to get Iiteral
with an R. Kelly song

983
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,258
do Trapped in the Closet.

984
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,136
You can't break your neck if
you're trapped in a closet.

985
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,762
You just watch me. No, no, no.

986
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,806
Watch me, George. No, no, no!

987
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,309
I believe I can fly! No! No! No!

988
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,400
See? You can fly. I
always believed it.

989
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,068
Oh, my God.

990
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:10,493
Hmm.

991
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,038
Morning.

992
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,289
Oh, God.

993
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,166
That was a Iittle crazy.

994
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,959
That was great.

995
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,423
You probably don't remember, but you
said some crazy stuff Iast night.

996
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,759
I remember every word of it.

997
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,846
Oh, God, I really just feel great.

998
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,474
Why is the doorway crying?

999
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,267
I'm just kidding.

1000
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,152
Downtown Atlanta. Uh-huh. Okay.

1001
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,196
Corner of Peachtree
and Third Street.

1002
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,324
Terrific. I can probably get there
around noon if I Ieave now.

1003
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,408
You're qualified?

1004
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,327
Yeah, I'm more than qualified
for the job.

1005
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,495
Noon at the Iatest.

1006
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,205
I Iook forward to it. Thank you.

1007
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,043
Wayne! Hey.

1008
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,129
Wow, that's quite a
big pile of pages.

1009
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,173
I get it, George.

1010
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,550
You're interested. I'm flattered.

1011
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:11,221
When the time comes, I'll Iet you
know. I'll share it with you.

1012
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,098
I got a protagonist issue
I'm still working out.

1013
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,224
AII right. I have a Iot of thoughts

1014
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,642
that I wanted to get
down here, and...

1015
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,561
That sounds great. I gotta
go into town for a second.

1016
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,146
How are you going to do that?

1017
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,856
Rodney didn't tell
you what happened.

1018
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,525
What happened?

1019
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:26,778
I don't understand.

1020
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,824
I know. I know, right? It's
crazy. It's crazy.

1021
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,161
What exactly happened, all
right? Take me through.

1022
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,039
Okay. Well, it was Iike,
"I'm going on the road."

1023
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,582
Cut to, in the pond.

1024
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,543
No, don't "cut to" the pond.

1025
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,002
What... Don't cut.

1026
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,964
I mean, can you believe that?
Can you believe it?

1027
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,382
No, I can't believe it.

1028
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,427
Which is why I want you to tell
me, how did that happen?

1029
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,594
I'll tell you what.

1030
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,471
Hindsight being 20/20,

1031
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,348
I probably wouldn't have
done it the same way.

1032
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,308
What did you need
our car for anyway?

1033
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,227
It doesn't matter anymore.

1034
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,071
Hey, George.

1035
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,489
Hey, Eva, I didn't see you there.

1036
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,617
You Iook sad. Well...

1037
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,495
Everything that's been happening
in your Iife recently,

1038
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:21,708
the fact that you're walking on
two feet at all, it's amazing.

1039
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,710
Seriously, George.

1040
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:27,380
I've been walking on two feet
for most of my adult Iife.

1041
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,718
Oh, George.

1042
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,052
I Iike you.

1043
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,221
I Iike you, too, Eva.

1044
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,390
We should make Iove sometime.

1045
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,068
George? Yeah.

1046
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,321
I heard you. Yeah.

1047
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,239
You don't know about
our philosophy.

1048
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,200
Here at Elysium we
believe that open

1049
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,076
sexual boundaries Iead
to a deeper honesty.

1050
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,204
How would you and Linda
feel about that?

1051
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,710
Anyway, think about being
inside me. Talk to Linda.

1052
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,925
Here you go, sir. Have a great
day. Thank you very much.

1053
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,636
And you enjoy that apple.

1054
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:15,845
Honey!

1055
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,557
I just sold my first apple. I picked
it, I bagged it and I sold it.

1056
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,018
Terrific. Our car is at
the bottom of a Iake.

1057
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,396
So, George, I hear Eva asked
to intercourse with you.

1058
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:26,606
What?

1059
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,774
Yeah.

1060
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,150
Thanks, Seth.

1061
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,819
That was what I was
going to tell you.

1062
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,822
Apparently, at Elysium, they
practice free Iove.

1063
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,952
And Eva suggested that we try it.

1064
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,537
What did you tell her?

1065
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,165
No. I said no.

1066
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,584
I mean, we didn't finish
the conversation,

1067
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:50,630
but I was about to, and
I will and did say no.

1068
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
This is just biology.

1069
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,634
Homo sapiens weren't meant to
be monogamous creatures.

1070
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,262
I don't know, that just sounds
to me Iike an excuse

1071
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,472
for everybody just to get
into bed together.

1072
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,225
If you want to pick a fight with
your body's sexual chi,

1073
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,977
it's just going to
drive it inwards.

1074
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,021
And that invites disease and death.

1075
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,858
Man, I'm not a fan of death.

1076
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:16,489
People treat sex Iike it's this huge
deal with crazy Iife consequences.

1077
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,032
Right.

1078
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,325
What are you doing here?

1079
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,578
I don't understand. What are you
doing here on our property?

1080
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,870
That sounds Iike the Iion's cry.

1081
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,122
This is our property!

1082
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,374
Of course we have the
goddamn deed to it.

1083
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,293
Then prove it. Where is the deed?

1084
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:33,089
If you think I can remember where
I put a piece of paper in 1971...

1085
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,549
If you wanna make a
stink out of this,

1086
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,175
you can do that, but you're
going to Iose.

1087
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,720
Or, we resolve this very quickly

1088
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,222
and we all come away
with something.

1089
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,309
It's okay, George. I got this.

1090
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,019
I wasn't going to do anything.

1091
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,522
Our people have a spiritual
right to this Iand!

1092
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,525
We have deep roots here.

1093
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,945
I don't think the Iion could have
roared any clearer, my friend.

1094
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,657
No dice.

1095
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,662
There's thousands more where that
came from. I actually...

1096
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,039
Can I have one of those?

1097
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,541
Yes, please, that's for you.
And keep that, sir.

1098
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,377
Oh, really? Smile.

1099
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,296
I can do that, too.

1100
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,547
Deal with me.

1101
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,050
How do you Iike that? Here,
Brett, why don't you?

1102
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,343
See? How do you Iike that?

1103
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,011
Really? Do you want it?
I'll take another.

1104
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,055
Yeah, sure. Here you go.
Thanks very much.

1105
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,724
Please, please. It's my pleasure.

1106
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,143
Three can play at that game.

1107
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,729
There's a Kinko's 13
miles down the road.

1108
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,813
Go get copies.

1109
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,065
I will get more cards.
I will be back.

1110
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,067
Come back and buy a zucchini.

1111
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,110
And we will build that casino.

1112
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,366
Carvin, do you have any
idea where the deed is?

1113
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,994
No, I'll find it, because
I use the think method.

1114
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,288
I just think of, "Where wouldn't

1115
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,666
"I expect it to be?"
and I go there.

1116
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,084
And so far, it's not there.

1117
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,794
Don't worry,
we can fight this.

1118
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,337
Oh, my God!

1119
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,755
What's the matter? What happened?

1120
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,757
George just killed a
defenseless animal.

1121
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,969
What? No, I just swatted a fly.

1122
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,765
For Christ's sake! Here we go.

1123
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,518
And now it's dead. What if it
had young Iiving somewhere?

1124
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,479
Young? Like, maggots?
Are you serious?

1125
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,648
This man has a fetish for
violence. No, I don't.

1126
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,942
He has a fetish for violence!

1127
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,110
We're talking about a fly.

1128
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,277
And where does it end?

1129
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,654
When you kill a fly,
you kill a bird.

1130
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,905
You kill a bird, you kill a dog...

1131
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,573
You kill a dog, you kill a soldier.

1132
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,659
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I was killing soldiers.

1133
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,868
I support the troops.

1134
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,287
I cannot even Iook
at you right now.

1135
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,206
I'm sorry, I'm trying to
Iearn all the rules.

1136
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,874
There are no rules here, George.

1137
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,292
Except "no swatting flies."

1138
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,794
That's not a rule.

1139
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,629
It's just a way of thinking
about stuff.

1140
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,964
You did something wrong

1141
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,799
and you're a Iittle embarrassed
about it. It's okay.

1142
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,883
I did something wrong?

1143
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,009
Forgiveness is always allowed.

1144
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,178
I've seen you throw a
battery at a pigeon.

1145
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,099
I didn't kill it. Why
are you doing that?

1146
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,976
It was a Iong time ago.
A Iong time ago.

1147
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,894
And it was right on our window, it was all...

1148
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,312
That's not the point.

1149
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,399
I've said for years we should
have a bug zapper here.

1150
00:53:56,567 --> 00:54:00,486
1971, right here at this table with

1151
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,156
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie,
Ronny, Danielle...

1152
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,116
Here we go. Thank you, acid.

1153
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,994
Tony, Janie, and Janice Woo.

1154
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,037
You know, it's amazing,
I can remember

1155
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:13,040
Janice Woo with perfect clarity.

1156
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,169
I just can't remember
where the deed is.

1157
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,045
You know why? Because I
didn't fuck the deed.

1158
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,130
That's right.

1159
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,229
Hey, it's Sherm. I'm
out as usual. Leave a message.

1160
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,899
Hey, Sherm, it's George, from work.

1161
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,192
How are you doing, man?

1162
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,861
Look, I was wondering
if you've heard

1163
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,363
of any job opportunities
back in the city.

1164
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,032
Linda and I have been out
of town for a while

1165
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,743
and we're kind of itching
to get back.

1166
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,204
Call me if you get the message.

1167
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,207
Hey.

1168
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,042
Hi.

1169
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,752
Oh, wow.

1170
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,922
She really is blossoming,
isn't she?

1171
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,467
Yeah, Iook at her go.
Marking her turf.

1172
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,219
So free.

1173
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,721
I'm just sad that she didn't respond
to the free Iove idea.

1174
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,182
I know. I know.

1175
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,726
I respect your and Linda's
relationship so much.

1176
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,062
But if you ever change your mind...

1177
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,605
You'll be the first to know.

1178
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,149
I promise I wouldn't disappoint.

1179
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,402
Yeah, that's great.

1180
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,365
I mean, I can Iick your balls
while I give you a blowjob.

1181
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,491
No way! Yeah.

1182
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, my God.

1183
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,746
I'm getting a Iittle wet
just talking about it.

1184
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,165
Me, too.

1185
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,463
People, they are breaking ground
on the casino today!

1186
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,090
We got to protest!

1187
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,092
The people will be heard!

1188
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,761
Where's my bullhorn?
I need the bullhorn!

1189
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,014
Where once stood an insignificant
fruit stand

1190
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,852
will now grow the much sweeter
fruit of prosperity.

1191
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:59,355
So here's to good jobs,
economic growth

1192
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,275
and tax revenue for years to come.

1193
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:08,114
I'm the fucking founder, for Christ's
sake, suburban mall-dweller!

1194
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,158
No, no, no. You're all
on private property.

1195
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,535
Yeah, it's our property.

1196
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,954
Private property this.

1197
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:18,040
Almond, no, no! Anger is
not the cure for this.

1198
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,292
Come on, we have to do something.

1199
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,002
I know! It's Iike...

1200
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,129
Brother, if we could just talk,

1201
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,463
heart to heart, for one moment.

1202
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,799
Greed-mongering shithead!

1203
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,135
We're going to expose
you and your greed!

1204
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,387
You're all free to stand on
that side of the barrier.

1205
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,057
Hey, news gal!

1206
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,059
Where the hell are you going?
We got what we need.

1207
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,186
Don't your viewers care about

1208
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,273
a corporation making backroom
deals with politicians

1209
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,525
so they can screw over another
Iocal business?

1210
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,612
Not for a 30-second segment
at the end of Atlanta P. M.

1211
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,580
It's impossible to reason
with these people.

1212
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,831
They won't Iisten to the truth!

1213
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,834
Your bulldozer's
a bully-dozer!

1214
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,337
We have to do something
right now. This is it.

1215
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,505
Hey, Iady, do you want
to see something?

1216
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,008
Do you want a really
good news story?

1217
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,217
Take this!

1218
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,429
We've got boobs out! And
they're good ones!

1219
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,680
If you want to move any further,

1220
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,806
you're going to have
to run me over!

1221
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,391
Holy shit!

1222
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,311
County officials got
more than they gambled for

1223
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,481
at a casino groundbreaking
ceremony earlier today

1224
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,443
when an angry, shirtless Iady treated
attendees to quite the show.

1225
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,945
They Iied to us!

1226
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,865
No more Iies!

1227
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,160
One by one, the topless woman's
enraged colleagues

1228
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,538
threw off their shirts and
joined her in protest.

1229
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,084
Baba Booey! Howard Stern!

1230
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,920
Wonderful.

1231
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,006
It's an interesting story pitting
a ragged band of Iocals

1232
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,343
against a Iand deal worth upwards
of 10 million dollars.

1233
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,929
But just now the County
Commissioner has

1234
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,973
stated that no construction
will go forward

1235
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,101
until a full review of community
impact. Michael?

1236
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,561
Great report. Thank you, Deena.

1237
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,981
Hey, Deena, maybe if they
ever build this casino

1238
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,482
these hippies can win the jackpot

1239
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,900
and buy themselves some shirts.

1240
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,735
It's certainly possible.

1241
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,487
Deena, could you Iet
us know if you're

1242
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,197
ever planning on protesting
a casino?

1243
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,534
They're building a casino at
my place Iater tonight.

1244
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,620
Okay, nailed it. There's more.

1245
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,205
Deena, I don't think any
of us would protest

1246
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,958
if you unexpectedly took
off your shirt.

1247
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,336
Deena, I do have a
new weather report

1248
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:31,132
which is hot, sweaty and
I have an erection.

1249
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,343
This is historic.

1250
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,095
The revolution has begun.

1251
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,933
AII because this courageous
woman saw an unjust world

1252
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,810
and waved her boobies at it.

1253
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,270
Let's celebrate!

1254
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,900
I didn't even know we
had a television.

1255
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,528
Let's open some chutney!
The tomato chutney!

1256
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,321
The tomato chutney!

1257
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,117
No. No!

1258
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,827
Where's George?

1259
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,456
Are you okay?

1260
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,749
I'm doing great!

1261
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,794
I felt something today when we were
standing up there and just...

1262
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,546
I know.

1263
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,841
Screaming it out and seeing
you with your shirt off...

1264
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,886
That's an amazing experience
for me.

1265
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,723
I just only hope that
George gets it.

1266
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,309
You are a natural Ieader.

1267
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,520
Oh, God, get out of here.
I feel Iike a schoolgirl.

1268
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:30,733
Go on, tonight's your night.
Enjoy it, celebrate it.

1269
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,908
Hi!

1270
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,328
God! I still cannot believe
that I did that!

1271
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,121
You're a hero.

1272
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,873
You're Iike a topless Norma Rae.

1273
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,208
I feel amazing!

1274
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,542
It's great to see you so happy.

1275
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,960
I know, I am!

1276
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,338
I really am.

1277
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,715
So... Yeah.

1278
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:55,883
It's been two weeks.

1279
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,844
I want to stay.

1280
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,137
Okay, but before you answer...

1281
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,555
I already answered.

1282
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,559
There's a possibility that I
have a job back in New York.

1283
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,853
We can go home. We can go home!

1284
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,190
But I really...

1285
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,567
I really feel Iike
this is our home.

1286
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,071
For the first time in my Iife,
I feel Iike I have a purpose.

1287
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,616
I've heard you say that before so many
times with so many other things.

1288
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,701
No, it's different this
time. I feel it.

1289
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,954
So you can Iive the rest of your
Iife without bathroom doors?

1290
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,080
Yes.

1291
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,289
You could be a vegan?

1292
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,083
I am a vegan. I Iove it.

1293
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,793
For two weeks you've been doing it.

1294
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,212
They say three weeks and then
it's out of your system.

1295
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,216
Open relationships?

1296
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:41,137
No sexual boundaries. That's
part of the deal here, too.

1297
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,888
Can you do that?

1298
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,308
Exactly.

1299
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,853
So, please, Iet's just go... Okay.

1300
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,396
Okay? Yeah?

1301
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,481
No, okay. Free Iove.

1302
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:57,278
As Iong as there's trust, and
communication, and respect,

1303
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,573
we can all enjoy each
other intimately.

1304
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,410
What? I Iove all of these
people, George.

1305
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,289
I Iove how I feel about myself
when I'm here. I just...

1306
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,624
George, I want to stay.

1307
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,921
Okay.

1308
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,256
Really?

1309
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,091
Let's do it.

1310
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,260
Oh, God.

1311
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,599
I'm so proud of us right now.

1312
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,144
What did you say? "Now
I'm gonna stay"?

1313
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,772
You're funny. I'm going
to go tell everybody.

1314
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,320
We're staying! We're staying!

1315
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,211
George,

1316
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,796
Linda just told me the good news.

1317
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,174
I'm so excited to hear
of your decision.

1318
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,721
Yeah, it's great! I know.

1319
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,768
Eva's really something, isn't she?

1320
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,312
Yes, absolutely. The best.

1321
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,108
I just made Iove to your
wife in the other room.

1322
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,820
Great.

1323
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,739
Thank you.

1324
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,118
Honey, we said we were
going to do it.

1325
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,538
No, I said we would do
free Iove in theory.

1326
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,165
I didn't say Iet's do it tonight!

1327
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,667
George! Oh, my God!

1328
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,670
This is awful. This is
such a nightmare!

1329
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,672
You have to do it tonight.

1330
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,382
I don't know if I can
do it tonight!

1331
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,466
You have to!

1332
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,302
You can't just make me be
the only one who did it!

1333
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,845
This was your idea!

1334
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,223
Oh, my God, I can't
believe you did it!

1335
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,518
You just have to please go do this
tonight, otherwise we're doomed!

1336
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,852
I don't know... For us!

1337
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,271
I can try.

1338
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,355
No, there's no "try."

1339
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,023
There is only "do."

1340
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,900
What, are you Yoda? George!

1341
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,361
I'm okay. I can do this.
Are you sure?

1342
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,029
Yeah, this is good. Tonight's
the night.

1343
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,490
This is it. This is
what it's about.

1344
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,285
Yeah! No shackles. We're
doing this as a team.

1345
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,913
You got to do this.

1346
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,583
Oh, God!

1347
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,878
This was your idea, George.

1348
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,756
It's a good idea, right?
It's a good idea.

1349
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,800
Monogamy is sexual slavery.

1350
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:28,971
She got an exquisite pussy, well, how
about my exquisite erection? Huh?

1351
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:33,392
Eva, what do you think, do you
Iike my exquisite erection?

1352
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,062
Do you Iike my erection selection?

1353
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,481
What do you think, Eva? Yeah?

1354
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,736
Are you going to take it? Are
you going to take that dick?

1355
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,780
Are you going to take that dick?

1356
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,658
I'm going to pop off
a piece of my dick.

1357
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,619
Oh, yeah, I'm fixing to fuck you.

1358
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,496
I'm going to fuck you.

1359
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,914
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1360
01:03:55,999 --> 01:04:00,461
I'm going to get it
all up in your vag.

1361
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:04,173
Get it up in your vag with my dick.

1362
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,842
With my dick.

1363
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:11,013
I'm going to put it
in with my dick.

1364
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:17,144
I'm going to put my dick in.

1365
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,520
What's up, man? Are you all right?

1366
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,772
What's up?

1367
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,493
So, how we doing, George?

1368
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,536
Hi, Wayne. Great. Never better.

1369
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,288
It's funny because I
didn't want to get

1370
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,082
into this before because
we had just met,

1371
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,334
but, as you know, I'm writing
a new novel right now.

1372
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,418
Really?

1373
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:44,922
It's a political parable about the
flaws of capitalistic society.

1374
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,424
I could tell you the story, but
it would probably bore you.

1375
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,967
Maybe Iater. I'll just
give you a taste.

1376
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:52,012
Basically, it's about this
one guy named John Belson.

1377
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:55,099
And John is just this guy,
an average Joe...

1378
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,434
I can actually even maybe
name him "Joe Belson."

1379
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,228
You could. And the big thing is...

1380
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,896
Tell me if I'm boring you.
No, finish your sentence.

1381
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,732
The big thing is, at a
certain point I reveal

1382
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,819
that this is all happening
in Washington, D.C.

1383
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:08,904
Wow. Yeah.

1384
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,948
Belson's a creature of the Beltway.

1385
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,659
Yeah. I'll tell you this...

1386
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,743
Eva...

1387
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,578
I'll read you this one part, unless
you're not interested.

1388
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,839
Hey. There you are.

1389
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,173
Hi.

1390
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,175
I am ready to have sex.

1391
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,469
Great. Come here.

1392
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:34,888
Awesome!

1393
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,308
But I can't believe this
is actually happening.

1394
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,726
Yeah. Oh, my God.

1395
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,311
God, George...

1396
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,313
Your heart is racing. I know.

1397
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,691
I've wanted to do this
since we first...

1398
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,359
Yeah. Since we first...

1399
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,278
And now it's okay. Yeah.

1400
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,030
Now it's not Iike before.
Now I can actually...

1401
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,576
Breathe, George, breathe.

1402
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,119
Feel it in your diaphragm,
just breathe it in.

1403
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,745
You're going to feel it in
your diaphragm with my...

1404
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,582
You're going to feel
it with my dick.

1405
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,041
Okay.

1406
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,377
Do you need to take
a minute, George?

1407
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,421
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1408
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,881
I'm going to do this.

1409
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,466
This is going to happen.

1410
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,592
Yeah.

1411
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,719
I'm going to throw down.

1412
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,929
I'm going to throw down onto you

1413
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:19,850
with my testicles.

1414
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,185
Okay.

1415
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,312
I'm going to get on it.
I'm going to get on it

1416
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,607
and I'm going to get in it and
down it and through it.

1417
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,109
It's going to be magically
delicious.

1418
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,653
You're going to be my Iucky charm.

1419
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,572
Okay, just don't talk,
Iet's just...

1420
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,783
I'm going to get a big old
brimming bowlful of fuck

1421
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,911
on your boobs.

1422
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,704
George, Iet's just...

1423
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,539
I'm going to Iick your titties.

1424
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,208
I'm going to Iick your...

1425
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:45,959
What? Can I Iick it?

1426
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,005
I'm going to slap you on the eye

1427
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,090
with my cock.

1428
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,718
I'm going to flick you in
the nuts with my balls.

1429
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,053
I'm going to put my...

1430
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,679
Put it on your neck.
I really don't...

1431
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,724
That's... I'm going to pump
you with my gonads.

1432
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:01,808
No.

1433
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:02,976
That's a spicy meatball...

1434
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,102
George, you know...

1435
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,312
...in your spicy hole.

1436
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:06,605
George, you're creeping me out.

1437
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,358
I'm sorry. When I get nervous, I
sometimes just talk, and that's...

1438
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,776
I'm sorry, Iet's...

1439
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,280
Okay. George...

1440
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,617
I really think you should
go take a minute.

1441
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,369
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I
don't think this is...

1442
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,620
Just don't even worry about it.

1443
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,871
Maybe we should do this
some other time.

1444
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,540
Let's not. No, just
the head of it in.

1445
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:27,334
It wouldn't even have to stay.
I'd just go, Iike, beep-boop.

1446
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,294
Then technically, we did it.
Just a quick Iittle...

1447
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,796
You wouldn't even know.

1448
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,506
No. No.

1449
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:33,882
This is very important, all right?

1450
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,510
We have to do this for Linda.

1451
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,470
I'm sorry, George. I'm
just not into it.

1452
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,721
I am.

1453
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,139
Great.

1454
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,850
Let's switch out. Okay?

1455
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:54,069
I'm about to put my vag

1456
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,989
all up on your dick.

1457
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,617
Excuse me.

1458
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:07,833
Hey, George.

1459
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,419
Oh. Sorry.

1460
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,337
Are you meditating or something?

1461
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,673
No, not at all. Come join me.

1462
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,136
You didn't feel Iike going on
the moon hike with everyone?

1463
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,348
No, I'm taking a breather
from all that tonight.

1464
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,685
Maybe it's divinely inspired

1465
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:30,731
that you and I are here right now.

1466
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,984
That's nice.

1467
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,570
I can see that you
have a kind soul.

1468
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,036
Are we...

1469
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,663
Is this...

1470
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,719
It's Iike Tantric or something.

1471
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,721
I'm having my baby, George.

1472
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,641
What? Fuck. No, you're not.

1473
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:06,975
Yes, I am, George.

1474
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,727
No, no, no. Stop doing that.

1475
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,312
There's nothing to stop, George.

1476
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,022
My baby is on its journey.

1477
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,899
Oh, my God! AII right.

1478
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,317
I'll call the hospital.

1479
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,860
No, no need.

1480
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,570
I'm going to do this myself.

1481
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,238
No! No, that's a bad idea.

1482
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,909
It is the best idea the universe
has ever come up with.

1483
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:28,080
This is the most natural thing
that can happen to a person.

1484
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,125
I'm going to get Rodney.

1485
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,711
No. He'll be here soon enough.

1486
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,588
Look at the full moon right now.

1487
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,257
It's Iuminous.

1488
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,342
Oh, God!

1489
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,426
Okay.

1490
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,642
I'm opening Iike a Iotus flower.

1491
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm passing out.

1492
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,607
Are you okay? I'm passing out.

1493
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,692
Okay.

1494
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,584
Rough couple of weeks, huh?

1495
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,003
No hard feelings about the
whole fly-swatting thing.

1496
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,589
I would have done the same thing
if the tables were turned.

1497
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,513
By the way, I just
fucked your wife.

1498
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,561
Hey, Eva and I are downstairs
flipping flapjacks.

1499
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,020
You may want to get down there.

1500
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:37,023
Thanks, Wayne. How about getting
your dick out of my face?

1501
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:48,785
Is this coffee?

1502
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,829
No, it's better than coffee.
It's kutcha root.

1503
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,955
It tastes Iike cow shit.

1504
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:56,251
George! It's so good to have
a joker in the house.

1505
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,129
It's real sugar? It's not
bark or sand or anything?

1506
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,006
There he is!

1507
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:02,507
Look at him!

1508
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,259
Oh, my God! So cute.

1509
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,511
There he is.

1510
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,721
What is that?

1511
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:08,889
That's the placenta.

1512
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,561
We keep the cord and placenta attached
until it falls away naturally.

1513
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,314
And we're going to use
it to make some soup.

1514
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,402
Okay, you know what?
That's ridiculous.

1515
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:24,780
I can't do it. I can't
do this anymore.

1516
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,031
Hey, whoa, whoa.

1517
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,784
You need to simmer down and breathe,
brother. Take a Ioad off.

1518
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,369
No, why don't you simmer down? Why
don't you breathe, brother?

1519
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,621
Whoa, George...

1520
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:33,955
No! This is crazy!

1521
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,749
I'm drinking dirt for breakfast.

1522
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,292
There's no privacy anywhere.

1523
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,044
Rodney, you owe me a car!

1524
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,463
And, Almond, cut and
discard that shit

1525
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,881
off of your infant immediately!

1526
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,633
It's gross!

1527
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,220
And, Karen, I hate to break it to
you, but flies don't feel pain.

1528
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,180
Billions of them are
killed every day,

1529
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,348
so blow me!

1530
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,891
Fine! When?

1531
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,644
And, Seth, where do I start?

1532
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:56,812
George!

1533
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,647
Linda! Are you still here?

1534
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,441
Did your 10 a.m. fuck
session get canceled?

1535
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,280
Linda...

1536
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,366
Ooh.

1537
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,117
You wanted this.

1538
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,286
You wanted to come back
here, we moved.

1539
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,665
You wanted to dive headfirst into
everything that Elysium represented,

1540
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:17,916
we did that.

1541
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,585
You wanted to be free sexually,
I said "fine."

1542
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,671
So Iast night I do something that

1543
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,548
I never ever expected
that I could do,

1544
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,591
only because you encouraged it.

1545
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,094
So how could you possibly
be mad at me

1546
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,429
when all I did was
follow your Iead?

1547
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:32,973
Because it was a stupid idea!

1548
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,100
I'm an idiot! Why would
you Iisten to me?

1549
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,185
My God, we've known these
people for two weeks!

1550
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,855
But I'm not the same person
I was two weeks ago.

1551
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,233
You said to me, "Why can't
we be happy every day?"

1552
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,818
I Iied, okay?

1553
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,655
I panicked, all right?
We were broke.

1554
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,323
This place had food and shelter,

1555
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,409
and it was way better than Rick's.

1556
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,828
I'm admitting it. I thought
we could have fun here

1557
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,289
but then you drank the Kool-Aid
and I can't stand it.

1558
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,542
I want to support you, I do.

1559
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,627
But I can't if it means
Iiving here.

1560
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,964
That might be a problem.

1561
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,216
George, can I just read
a passage from my book?

1562
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,634
I think it's relevant.

1563
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,969
Wayne, no.

1564
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,431
"John Belson sat in his car at
a stoplight at a crossroads."

1565
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,141
Wayne, your novel sucks. It sucks.

1566
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,561
It isn't interesting, it isn't
entertaining, it isn't anything.

1567
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,854
Come here. What's wrong with you?

1568
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,439
I can't do this. I can't do it.

1569
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,065
I can't have 15 people involved

1570
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,026
every time we have an argument.

1571
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,403
I miss meat, I miss
air-conditioning,

1572
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,696
I miss going to the bathroom

1573
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,115
and being able to shut a
door Iike most people.

1574
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,409
I'm not the weird one.
I'm in the majority.

1575
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,119
I'm Ieaving.

1576
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,373
I'm staying.

1577
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,669
Looks Iike it's time for
you to move on, brother.

1578
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,233
This is mine!

1579
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,697
It's okay.

1580
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:29,839
Yo. Sherm, it's George.

1581
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,758
Hey. I'm coming back.

1582
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,510
Is that job still available?

1583
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,470
Dude, there's no job.

1584
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,806
I was just having some
fun with you.

1585
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,892
I told you that there was a job
available that wasn't available.

1586
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,560
I thought that would be funny.

1587
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,944
Turn right
onto State Route 320

1588
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,238
and go 13 miles.

1589
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,084
Lion, you here?

1590
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,088
If I was an old man's deed,
where would I be?

1591
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,631
Where is it?

1592
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,383
What?

1593
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:25,645
Jackpot.

1594
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,565
Wrapped in Reynolds.
I should have known.

1595
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,407
Stop.

1596
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,368
Did you come alone?

1597
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,495
Yes. Did you bring it?

1598
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,792
When you told me you found the deed,
I was sure we were done for.

1599
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,461
What changed your mind?

1600
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,047
It's not my mind that's
changed, it's my heart.

1601
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,216
I've met my soulmate.

1602
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,718
I'm going to take her
away from here

1603
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,012
and start a new Elysium in Miami.

1604
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,263
Here.

1605
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,224
It is not without some
hesitation that

1606
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,810
I render my brothers and
sisters homeless.

1607
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,486
And here is the amount
we agreed upon.

1608
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,863
Okay.

1609
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,991
Oceanfront property in
South Beach, Miami...

1610
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,242
Never a bad investment.

1611
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,660
Even in a recession.

1612
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,830
I don't understand any of
your Iegal mumbo-jumbo

1613
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,042
but I'm sure it's nothing
$11 ,000 can't fix.

1614
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,003
Goodbye, hassles, hello, casino.

1615
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,800
Now,

1616
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,552
the piece of resistance.

1617
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,596
It's hot. Careful.

1618
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,350
It might have been easier just
to burn it in the first place.

1619
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,481
Arriving at
your destination, on Ieft.

1620
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1621
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,115
Oh! There he is!

1622
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,243
I knew you would find a way
to fuck up being a hippie.

1623
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,372
Hello.

1624
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,998
Marisa. Hi.

1625
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,291
Is George there?

1626
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,168
Yes, he's right here.
Do you want me to...

1627
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,255
No, no. I just wanted to make
sure that he's okay.

1628
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,423
Don't actually tell
him I called, okay.

1629
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,552
One more thing. Who is this?

1630
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,056
Dear George, I took
your criticism to heart

1631
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,309
and after some serious soul searching,
I concluded you were right.

1632
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,937
It wasn't exciting, it
wasn't interesting,

1633
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,398
so I spent the whole day
reworking the story.

1634
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,277
I would Iove your notes. Be brutal
Iike you were before, okay, buddy?

1635
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,071
Sincerely, Wayne.

1636
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,489
Wait a minute. So...

1637
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,533
Belson is in D.C.?
Washington, D.C.?

1638
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,618
Yeah, that's it. He's a creature
of the Beltway.

1639
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:48,997
Wow! I didn't see that coming.
That's an explosive twist.

1640
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,294
We gotta talk about the
next phase of Elysium.

1641
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,212
We need to take our
message out there.

1642
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,590
We need to take Elysium
on the road.

1643
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,508
I've just recently
put a down payment

1644
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,719
on a small split-Ievel
condo in Miami.

1645
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,512
Wait a minute. We can't
Ieave this place.

1646
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,014
The others will find their way.

1647
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,223
This is insane.

1648
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,309
I know. It is insane.

1649
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,977
I am so glad you're
on the same page.

1650
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,271
I thought I was the
one going crazy.

1651
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,773
Now I feel Iike you're the one going
crazy, but I'm here to help you.

1652
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,025
I am not crazy.

1653
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,151
I'm not crazy either.

1654
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,235
Well, I don't...

1655
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,862
That makes two of us. Okay.

1656
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,073
Let's just make Iove.
And then we'll talk.

1657
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,867
No. I would rather not.

1658
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,912
Yeah. I understand.

1659
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,080
George. I remember him well.

1660
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,126
What we will do, is we will
make Iove without touching.

1661
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:39,964
You know what, I gotta go.

1662
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,299
Wait, Linda...

1663
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,595
God, Seth.

1664
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,848
I was almost there.

1665
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,853
I just figured out what George's

1666
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:55,813
fortune cookie fortune would say.

1667
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,984
"Confucius say when wife screw other
guy, husband must get rid of wife.

1668
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,570
"She no good. The pork fried rice."

1669
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,157
What exactly did Mom do to you
that she didn't do to me?

1670
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,659
Come on, I know it's offensive,

1671
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,285
but you gotta admit, it's funny.

1672
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,995
That's funny!

1673
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,705
I'm not Chinese.

1674
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,376
That's funny! AII I'm saying is
Linda is no good, screw her,

1675
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:19,712
screw those hippie-dippies, with their
B.O. and their white dreads.

1676
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,130
You have no idea, man.

1677
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,757
Okay,

1678
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,176
so you're complaining about Linda?

1679
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,262
You're the one who wanted to
sleep with other people.

1680
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:28,972
I didn't think she would
say yes! Bingo.

1681
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,974
At Ieast she had permission
before she cheated.

1682
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,559
My husband has been fucking at
Ieast one woman on the side

1683
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,520
ever since before our wedding.

1684
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,773
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

1685
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,900
You have a tracking
system in your car.

1686
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,944
You never shut up about it, stupid.

1687
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,242
Little reality shift, Rick?

1688
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,785
Honey, no, no, no.

1689
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,537
No, no, no.

1690
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,455
No! Listen to me.

1691
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,834
I Iove you, and I have sex with other
women because I Iove you so much.

1692
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,628
I'm getting it out of my system.
I'm trying to protect you.

1693
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,171
Are you kidding me? What
do you want me to do?

1694
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:05,008
Do you want me to tell you every
time I sleep with somebody?

1695
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:08,177
And then we have to deal
with that every time?

1696
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,595
What is wrong with you?

1697
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,556
George, back me up on this!

1698
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,893
What are you doing?
What's that face...

1699
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,312
Why are you doing that?

1700
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,980
Are you pooping?

1701
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,064
No, I'm crying.

1702
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,566
That's not what crying Iooks Iike.

1703
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,151
What do you want me to do?

1704
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,820
Can you get the fuck out of my house
and out of my Iife forever?

1705
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,531
That's it. Okay, thanks. Get out!

1706
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,034
You're taking my infidelity
and making it about you!

1707
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,994
Do you realize how
selfish you sound?

1708
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,996
This is exactly why
I have to cheat!

1709
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,956
I hate you. I want a divorce.

1710
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,041
No, honey, no.

1711
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,626
I Ieft my wife at a commune.

1712
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,378
What the fuck am I thinking?

1713
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,547
I'm auditioning for Real
Housewives of Atlanta.

1714
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,591
Are these your car keys? Yes.

1715
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,385
Honey, you don't...

1716
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,054
Wait! No! No!

1717
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,144
What are you doing with my car?

1718
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,021
We're family. It's our car.

1719
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,191
Get out of the goddamn car!

1720
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,027
My baby is all I got Ieft!

1721
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,083
That Iooks good. It Iooks
even. Centered?

1722
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,380
I'm going to town. I'll
see you in a bit.

1723
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,006
Bye, Linda.

1724
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,857
Mmm.

1725
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,734
Terrible, I know.

1726
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,569
Steak at a diner.

1727
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:53,199
It's Iike getting cognac
at a gas station

1728
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,326
or a diner.

1729
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,747
Carvin, please don't judge
me. I needed meat.

1730
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,999
Hey, I come here every Sunday.

1731
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,502
You can't Iive off of macrobiotic

1732
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,629
bean curd shit your whole Iife.

1733
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,674
The first time I snuck
away years ago,

1734
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,384
I had a veggie burger.

1735
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,803
The next time, chicken salad.

1736
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,805
And then, two pounds of bacon.

1737
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,140
Oh, my God!

1738
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,766
Nobody knows about this.

1739
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,476
Your secret is safe with me.

1740
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,644
Who cares?

1741
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,355
I've been in Elysium four decades.

1742
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:28,401
Hell, I co-founded the place with
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis...

1743
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,153
Yeah, I know. AII those people.

1744
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,529
Billy Marcus, Tony Piloski...

1745
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:32,864
AII of them. AII those people.

1746
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:36,200
My point is you gotta do
what is right for you.

1747
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,037
Don't get me wrong. Elysium
is an amazing adventure,

1748
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,873
but sometimes I think

1749
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,043
I missed out on something
that was even more real.

1750
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,628
You know, more real.

1751
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,632
Here you are, darling.

1752
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:52,967
Mmm-hmm.

1753
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:58,139
Wow! That's every member
of the meat family.

1754
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,224
That's some kind of wurst. "Wurst"?

1755
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:03,311
I don't know why they call
it "wurst." It's the best.

1756
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1757
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,823
Surprised to see you here, brother.

1758
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,492
Where's Linda? I need
to talk to her.

1759
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,744
I'm diving into the Linda
pool these days.

1760
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,996
I only tell you this because
I Iove you, brother.

1761
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,249
Move or I will run you over,
because fuck you, brother.

1762
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,587
What the fuck are you doing?

1763
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,130
Capoeira.

1764
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,341
Although a beautiful form
of Afro-Brazilian dance,

1765
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,885
it's also a devastating
form of self-defense.

1766
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,560
Let's dance, brother.

1767
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:49,565
Turn around, brother!

1768
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,025
Let go of the wheel!

1769
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:54,445
She's a beautiful spirit who has
evolved away from you, George.

1770
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,073
What are you talking about?
You're so full of shit!

1771
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,667
Wow! They make cars with
CD players now?

1772
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:13,130
Wow, it's so great to see so
much of so many of you.

1773
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,799
I don't
know what's worse,

1774
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,803
Marty's pasty ass, or Beverly's
Malbec Pinot blend.

1775
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,137
This is great.

1776
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:23,849
Everybody run!

1777
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:42,952
Let go!

1778
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,078
George!

1779
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:50,459
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1780
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,837
No, I turned away for one second.

1781
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,047
Did I miss something incredible?

1782
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,136
No! Who's in the car? I don't know.

1783
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,596
Who is that? Seth?

1784
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,763
I told you.

1785
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,516
That's a very easy mistake to make.

1786
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,395
Oh, my God. George!

1787
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,277
George, what's going on here?

1788
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,321
Wayne, hey! I read
the Iatest draft.

1789
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:19,405
Really?

1790
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,656
Incredible! Yeah? Thanks!

1791
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,116
And that Iast sentence.

1792
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,326
"Get me Senator McCIusky."

1793
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,910
Oh, my God! How did you
even think of that?

1794
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,662
Lightning in a bottle
type of thing.

1795
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:27,830
You know D.C. will
never be the same.

1796
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:28,956
That's what I Iove about it.

1797
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,625
But it doesn't spell it out.

1798
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,376
Thank you so much for
saying that, man.

1799
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,544
Well done, really.

1800
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:37,381
Seth, are you all right?

1801
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:43,679
Seth, what are you doing?

1802
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,348
Stop punching me!

1803
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:46,599
I'm not punching you.

1804
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,142
I'm slapping you!

1805
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,477
I wish there was something
we could do to help,

1806
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,145
but we're non-violent.

1807
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,938
What do we do?

1808
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,113
Stop!

1809
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,408
What happened to non-violence?

1810
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,412
Violence is justified when it
serves the greater good.

1811
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,039
That's very convenient.

1812
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,918
This is not working! No shit!

1813
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,212
What the hell are you doing?
Get off of him.

1814
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:21,467
I came back to tell you I Iove
you more than anything.

1815
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,802
Oh, honey.

1816
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,512
Jesus! Can a person go
a day in this place

1817
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,347
without getting a dick in the face?

1818
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,099
I've heard that. Every day.

1819
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,266
That's what I'm talking about.

1820
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:33,562
Come on, George!

1821
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:34,939
Get him!

1822
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,024
You've progressed far
beyond George, Linda.

1823
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,735
You're selfless, you're
pure, you're vegan.

1824
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,737
I just had a steak at a diner.

1825
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,198
In time, I can Iearn to
forgive you for that.

1826
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,783
Let go of George!

1827
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,660
Anything for you, my Iove.

1828
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,208
You have to know that he asked
me to run away with him

1829
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,377
and he said that you would
all just find your way.

1830
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,545
God damn it!

1831
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:01,132
Linda! I would never do that to my
brothers and sisters, please.

1832
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:05,636
He's Iying! Seth burned the deed
to the commune. I saw him!

1833
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,222
He burned it? The deed
to the commune?

1834
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,348
Motherfucker!

1835
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,225
Seth, is that true? You
burned the deed?

1836
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,310
You burned the deed?

1837
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:17,231
Look, if everyone's going to get
all Iawyeristic on me, yeah.

1838
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,608
Yeah, I did. I sold and
I burned the deed.

1839
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:21,444
Rat bastard turncoat.

1840
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:24,363
But I did it for Iove.
I did it for Linda.

1841
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:28,242
Anyone would have done the
same thing for $11 ,000.

1842
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:29,910
I Iove you.

1843
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,954
But I Iove me more.

1844
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,415
And for you guys to turn
this around on me,

1845
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,667
well, frankly, it's selfish.

1846
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,794
And fuck you, Grisham.

1847
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,679
Ow! God, my wrist!

1848
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:52,933
I don't think I did that right.
My wrist is killing.

1849
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,435
Honey, you're a Iover,
not a fighter.

1850
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,978
I'm an idiot.

1851
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:57,855
I Iove you so much. I'm sorry.

1852
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:01,192
I know. I'm so sorry,
too. I went too far.

1853
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,902
I drank the Kool-Aid.

1854
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,695
And then when I was done
with the Kool-Aid,

1855
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,573
I made more Kool-Aid and
then I drank that too

1856
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,742
and it just filled with Kool-Aid.

1857
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,204
I Iove you and I will support
you in whatever you choose.

1858
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,580
Forever.

1859
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,874
I don't care where we Iive.

1860
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,709
You're where I want to be.

1861
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,337
And you're where I want to be.

1862
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,054
Yes! Oh, yes!

1863
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:31,972
That's what I'm talking
about, George!

1864
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,564
And we're back.

1865
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,316
Later in the show,
we're going to be

1866
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,068
Iearning all about how
these text messages

1867
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,070
are actually making our
children stupider,

1868
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,072
and the statistics are terrifying.

1869
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,657
I've seen them and they are.

1870
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,534
But first, do you remember
about a year ago,

1871
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,035
when a bunch of hippie types

1872
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,745
up in the mountains put on
their birthday suits?

1873
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,413
They were protesting a casino?

1874
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:59,542
I would remember it better if they
took those birthday suits off.

1875
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,544
I don't know what that means.

1876
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,879
Our own Deena Schuster
is back with an update

1877
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,131
about these Bohemians in the buff.

1878
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,384
Hi, Deena. Hi, guys!

1879
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,761
It Iooks Iike one of
those naked ninjas

1880
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,138
was cooking up more than
just a skin feast.

1881
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:15,599
I'm talking about Wayne Davidson,

1882
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,726
the best-selling author
of the breakout

1883
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,895
political thriller,
Belson's Lament.

1884
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,107
As well as the eagerly awaited
sequel, Belson Rising.

1885
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,359
My favorite thing about
that book is

1886
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,611
when they reveal that it's
in Washington, D.C.

1887
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,072
What did I do?

1888
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,448
Michael, I haven't read it yet!

1889
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,952
First-time novelist Davidson
is a nudist, winemaker

1890
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,538
and full-time resident of
an intentional community

1891
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:39,415
in Northern Georgia called Elysium,

1892
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,376
worlds away from the
corridors of power

1893
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,837
he so piercingly chronicles
in his books.

1894
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:48,424
There's even talk of a Belson
movie starring Ray Liotta,

1895
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,134
who has been spending time here

1896
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,886
with the wardrobe-Iess wordsmith.

1897
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,389
Ray is an amazing actor,

1898
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,057
he makes a great vegan chili

1899
01:29:57,142 --> 01:30:00,311
and he is an intense Iover.

1900
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,813
We almost Iost the whole
place Iast year,

1901
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,232
until an old friend
saw us on the tube.

1902
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,151
I thought she was dead.

1903
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,278
And yet, she wasn't dead.

1904
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:12,406
Co-founder Janice Woo had
a copy of the original deed,

1905
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,284
preserving the community's rights
to the disputed Iand.

1906
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,662
And as Iuck would have it, none of
the founding members were dead.

1907
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,081
Not Jerry Beaver, not
Stephanie Davis,

1908
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,250
not Ronny Shames, not
Danielle Meltser,

1909
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:25,461
not Janie Brody, not Billy Marcus,

1910
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:28,088
not Glen Stover and
not Tony Piloski.

1911
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:31,759
In fact, all were found to be in
above-average health. For now.

1912
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,761
And the story of Belson's journey

1913
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,971
to bookshelves is just as unlikely.

1914
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,556
It was discovered by a boutique

1915
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:40,100
Brooklyn, New York publishing house

1916
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:42,603
run by husband and wife, George
and Linda Gergenblatt.

1917
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,063
I actually wrote a book, too,

1918
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:48,150
and it's a children's book called
I Believe I Can Fly.

1919
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:51,360
And it's about a confident
Iittle penguin who overcomes

1920
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,321
his Iimitations.

1921
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,073
Originally, we were
going to call it

1922
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,367
The Penguin With Testicular Cancer.

1923
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,868
Originally, but...

1924
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,161
That wasn't going to sell.

1925
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,412
No, no.

1926
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,624
And now we have a growing company
where we can foster new writers.

1927
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,752
And we have connections to a
Iot of really fresh voices.

1928
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,797
My husband's book is
destined to be a classic.

1929
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,591
Pierre and I have been
in Iove since we met.

1930
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:17,846
I have always had a thing
for black women.

1931
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,018
And you wrote the whole
thing here at Elysium?

1932
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,521
Dreams dispensed daily. Just
bring your own container.

1933
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,774
What do I get if I win?
Okay and stop!

1934
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,069
Oh, God!

1935
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,907
Stop! I can't breathe...

1936
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,331
I think we're where we want to be.

1937
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,874
So do I.

1938
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,339
Honey, can you shut the door?

1939
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,133
Yes.

1940
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:56,510
The door.

1941
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,221
I Iove the door.

1942
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,682
LINDA: I Iove you.

1943
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,100
I Iove you, too.

1944
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:16,780
Thank you. Background.
Here we go.

1945
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,117
What happens to all those
ticks that die

1946
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,036
in those thatchy armpits of yours?

1947
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,412
George...

1948
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,956
They're my friends!

1949
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,379
Ow! Shit!

1950
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:35,299
Wow! You're so big!

1951
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,761
Yeah, you Iook different
too, you fucking reject.

1952
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:44,641
The Sioux Indians believed that
when you produce a fece...

1953
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,310
A piece of...

1954
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,980
A man makes a fece...

1955
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:55,277
When a man makes a fece,

1956
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,237
a piece of him goes with it.

1957
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,240
Oh, no.

1958
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,242
Two weeks. Two weeks.

1959
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,829
What? What happened?

1960
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,247
Suck on it for a while.

1961
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:15,172
I'll have you check out the erection
selection at the Dick-E-Mart.

1962
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,592
"I believe I can fly"? Well,
I believe I can fuck.

1963
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,723
I'm grossing myself out.

1964
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,239
I am ready for action,

1965
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:52,908
because I got all my ex-husband's
toilet money.

1966
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,952
So, bring it on, Hot-Ianta.
Show me what you got!
