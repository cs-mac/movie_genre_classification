TOP GUN @Arman_HSE


2
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,510
- Morning, Scott.
- Morning, Ben

3
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,600
- Morning, Wells.
- Hey, sir.

4
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:19,828
Ghost Rider, this is Strike.
We have an unknown aircraft.

5
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:23,828
Inbound Mustang,
you're in Vector 090 for bogey.

6
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:37,832
- Who's up there?
- Cougar & Merlin, and Maverick & Goose.

7
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:41,001
Great. Maverick and Goose.

8
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,806
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. Contact:

9
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:55,891
20 left at 30 miles, 900 knots closure.

10
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,645
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

11
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:03,065
- Merlin, you got them?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.

12
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:08,696
- I'll get a visual ID, Cougar. You hook them.
- Roger, an' I'll clean 'em and fry 'em.

13
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,240
Mystang, this is Ghost Rider, 203.

14
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:22,835
I got them inbound, bogey
heading 270 at 10 miles.

15
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:27,631
<i>- 900 knots closure.</i>
- Ghostrider, take angels 10, left, 3, 0.

16
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:31,302
- Are we supposed to have visitors today?
- Negative, sir.

17
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:42,438
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

18
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:48,277
- Goose, do you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin. Looks like he's a single.

19
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,695
- Cougar, I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.

20
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,115
Take it easy, Maverick, I don't like this shit..

21
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,201
I'm gonna break high & right,
see if he's really alone.

22
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,765
- We got a 1000-knot closure, Mav.
<i>He's coming right at us.</i>

23
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:19,850
Okay, buddy. What's on your mind?

24
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,564
- Shit, there's two of them. MiG-28s!

25
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,735
What the hell are they doing?
What's their position?

26
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:33,697
- 250 miles out, sir.
- 250 miles? Get 'em out of here!

27
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,329
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

28
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:47,086
I lost him in the sun! Shit, what's
he doing? You got him, Merlin?

29
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:52,132
He's coming around,
he's coming around on our tail!

30
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:55,970
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

31
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:02,122
- What's their range now?
- 200 miles, sir.

32
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:04,728
If they break 150 miles, launch
the alert-five aircraft.

33
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:12,069
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.

34
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,993
Let's see if we can scare him this guy
out of here. Come on, lock up, baby.

35
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:23,038
I've got him locked. Bingo!

36
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,672
- We got him, Mav. He's
bugging out and going home.

37
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,924
Mustang, this is Maverick.
MiG two is headed home.

38
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:38,262
- Alright, what's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.

39
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,518
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us!
Get away from this guy!

40
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:46,604
- What the hell is this shit? He's engaging me.

41
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:52,693
Goddamn it. Mustang, this is Ghostrider
117, this bogey's all over me.

42
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,760
- He's got missile lock on me,
do I have permission to fire?

43
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,198
Do not fire until fired upon.

44
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,506
- Goose, there they are. Right below us.

45
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,955
The MiG's in perfect firing position.
And he's right on Cougar's tale.

46
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:08,497
- No way, Goose. He would have fired by
now. He's just trying to piss us off.

47
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,836
Maverick, get down here and
get this asshole off me!

48
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:19,845
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,
hard right. Help me engage.

49
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,556
I'm on my way.

50
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:41,408
I can't shoot this son of a bitch.
Let's see if we can have a little fun with him.

51
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:49,250
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

52
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,464
Greetings.

53
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:59,927
Watch the birdie.

54
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:02,847
Geez, I crack myself up.

55
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:12,481
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.

56
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:17,257
Cougar, your tail is clear.
MiG one has bugged out.

57
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,876
Cougar, this is Maverick. We've had
enough fun for one day, don't you think?

58
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm getting a lil' low on fuel,
so we're heading home.

59
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:41,552
We'll see you on deck.

60
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:52,271
Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get outta here.

61
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,566
Cougar?

62
00:09:57,902 --> 00:10:01,655
We're on vapour, Cougar.
Let's do it.

63
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,494
Cougar, come on, Cougar!

64
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:18,652
- Let's take it back to the ship, man.
<i>Come on, Cougar.</i>

65
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:21,258
- Get him on deck as soon as possible,
he's gotta be low on fuel.

66
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:28,849
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas, you understand me?

67
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,768
Are you all right, man?

68
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:40,393
Maverick, you're 3/4 to
fall out, call the ball.

69
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,321
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

70
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,251
Goose, Cougar's in trouble.

71
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,059
Come on, Mav, we're getting low
on gas, let's land this sucker.

72
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:53,749
<i>Cougar!</i>

73
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,129
Goddamn it, Maverick!

74
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,510
What're you doing, Mav?
We've got no fuel for this.

75
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,761
We're going after Cougar.

76
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,007
You tell him to land that
plane. That's an order!

77
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:14,770
<i>Ghostrider, you're instructed
to land. Land immediately.</i>

78
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:22,444
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

79
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:26,833
Man, we got a little problem up
here, that MiG really screwed him up.

80
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,951
I don't think he can make it back.

81
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:37,174
You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on my
wing. I'll take you all the way in.

82
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:38,544
Just stay with me.

83
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:57,730
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

84
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,736
You're a little low. You're a little low, Coug.
Come on, buddy, pull up.

85
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,572
Pull up, Cougar.

86
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,660
That's it. Almost there.

87
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:15,915
A little below glide path.
3/4 over now, call the ball.

88
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,480
Rogerball.

89
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:34,391
<i>You're too low. You're too low,
Cougar! More power!</i>

90
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,614
Come in.

91
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:56,733
- Cougar, you should be in a
sickbed, what's on your mind?

92
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,082
My wife and kid, sir.

93
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:02,086
I almost orphaned him today,
and I've never even seen him.

94
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,085
I don't know what happened
up there, but I was so scared.

95
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,633
Come on, we've seen this before.

96
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,385
No, sir.

97
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,812
I'm sorry.

99
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:27,862
Cougar?

100
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,971
Thanks, Maverick.

101
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:39,133
<i>Maverick, Goose, come in here.</i>
- What the hell's going on?

102
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:43,002
- I don't know.
- Shit.

103
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:50,885
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

104
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:58,225
What you should have done was land your plane.
You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do!

105
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:01,478
Son, your ego's writing cheques
your body can't cash.

106
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:06,442
You've been busted, you've lost your
qualifications as section leader three times.

107
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:11,071
Put in hack twice by me
with a history of high-speed passes...

108
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:15,201
...over five air control towers
and one admiral's daughter!

109
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:19,955
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.

110
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,041
Thank you, sir.

111
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,514
And let's not bullshit, Maverick.
Your family name ain't the best in the Navy.

112
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,972
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy,

113
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,342
now what is it with you?

114
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:34,710
Just want to serve my country, be the
best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir.

115
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:36,305
Don't screw around with me, Maverick.

116
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,148
You're a hell of an instinctive
pilot. Maybe too good.

117
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,258
I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't...

118
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,473
...I got another problem here.

119
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:47,274
I gotta send somebody from
this squadron to Miramar.

120
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:53,458
I gotta do something. I still can't believe it.
I gotta give you your dream shot.

121
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:59,245
I'm gonna send you up against the best.
You two characters are going to Top Gun.

122
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:04,375
For five weeks you're going to fly
against the best pilots in the world.

123
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:09,839
You were number two. Cougar was number one.
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.

124
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,177
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing:

125
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,990
You screw up just this much,
you'll be flying a cargo plane...

126
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,433
full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.

127
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,102
Yes, sir!

128
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,357
That is all.

129
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:32,820
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen?

130
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,219
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

131
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,263
During Korea, the Navy kill ratio was 12 to 1.

132
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:24,413
We shot down 12 of their
jets for every one of ours.

133
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:29,710
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3 to 1.
Our pilots become dependant upon missiles.

134
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:31,795
They lost some of their dog-fighting skills.

135
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:37,384
Now, Top Gun was created to teach ACM -
'Air Combat Manoeuvring'. Dog-fighting.

136
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:38,979
- This gives me a hard-on.

137
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,931
By the end of Vietnam, that
ratio was back to 12 to 1.

138
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,226
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

139
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,267
I'd like to take this
opportunity to introduce you...

140
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:48,606
to our commanding officer at Top Gun.

141
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,065
...very first man to win the
Top Gun trophy.

142
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:55,286
You will not find a finer fighter
pilot anywhere in the world.

143
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,737
Commander Mike Metcalf.

144
00:16:56,987 --> 00:17:01,075
- Call sign 'Viper.'
- Gentlemen...

145
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:05,579
You're the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

146
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:12,711
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.

147
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:18,116
You fly at least two combat missions
a day, attend classes in between,

148
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,052
and evaluations of your performance.

149
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,430
On each combat sequence you're
gonna meet a different challenge.

150
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,090
<i>Every encounter is gonna
be much more difficult.</i>

151
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:30,567
<i>We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14
right to the edge of the envelope,</i>

152
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,148
<i>faster than you've ever flown before.</i>

153
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,671
And more dangerous.

154
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:41,115
Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.

155
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:46,067
<i>We are the instruments of that policy,
and although we are not at war,</i>

156
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,039
we must always act as though we are at war.

157
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,420
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.

158
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,758
In case some of you wonder who the best is,
they're here on this plaque on the wall.

159
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,095
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

160
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:10,936
And they have the option to come back here
to be Top Gun instructors.

161
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,929
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

162
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,358
Yes, sir.

163
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:20,258
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

164
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,573
Yes, sir.

165
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,766
I like that in a pilot.

166
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:34,960
Remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

167
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:41,884
Gentlemen, this school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.

168
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:46,597
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.

169
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,229
The plaque for the alternates
is down in the ladies' room.

170
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,755
Oh, Jesus... You kill me.
You really do.

171
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:04,198
No, no, no. There's
two O's in Goose, boys.

172
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,551
- This is what I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs, Mav.

173
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:26,804
Goose, even you could get laid
in a place like this.

174
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,558
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

175
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,233
Mav, you wanted to know who
the best is? That's him. Iceman.

176
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:43,529
That's the way he flies.
Ice-cold. No mistakes.

177
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:48,784
Just wears you down. You get bored, frustrated,
you do something stupid, and he's got you.

178
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:53,914
Hey, hey, Slider. I thought you wanted
to be a pilot, man. What happened?

179
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,251
Goose, you're suck a dickhead.
Whose butt did you kiss to get here?

180
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:01,088
- The list is long but distinguished.
- Yeah, so is my johnson.

181
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:04,237
- So you're flying with lceman, huh.
- It's Mr. Iceman for you.

182
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,801
Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?

183
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:10,139
Doing good. Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.

184
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:11,888
- Congratulations on Top Gun.
- Thank you.

185
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,544
Sorry to hear about Cougar...

186
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:17,042
...you know, we were like brothers
in fight school. He was a good man.

187
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:19,106
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

188
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,306
Thought so.

189
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:27,656
- So, you need any help? - With what?
- You figured it out yet?

190
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:32,828
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.

191
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:36,090
No, I think I can figure
that one out on my own.

192
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,552
I heard that about you.

193
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,065
You like to work alone.

194
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,069
Mav, you must've your soul
under a lucky star, huh?

195
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,592
I mean, first the MiG and then
you slide into Cougar's spot...

196
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:49,303
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot,
it was ours, ok.

197
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:52,597
Yeah well, some pilots wait a
whole career to see a MiG up close.

198
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,694
Guess you guys are lucky and famous, huh.

199
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:01,252
- No, you mean notorious. I'll see you later.
- You can count on it.

200
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:07,342
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time. - Always.

201
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:16,893
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is 20 dollars.

202
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:22,711
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

203
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:27,132
- On the premises.
- Come on, Mav... a bet's a bet.

204
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:33,430
I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair...
for you, I mean. But uh...

205
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:37,028
She's lost that loving feeling.

206
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:40,531
- She's los... No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has. - She has not lost that lo...

207
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:44,984
- Goose, she's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.

208
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:54,743
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

209
00:21:55,828 --> 00:22:03,528
<i>You never close your eyes anymore
when I kiss your lips...</i>

210
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:10,874
<i>...there's no tenderness like before
in your fingertips...</i>

211
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:16,088
<b>You're trying hard not to show it,
baby...</i>

212
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:21,875
<i>...but baby, believe me, I know that...</i>

213
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:30,633
<i>You lost that loving feeling,
oh, that loving feeling.</i>

214
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:37,828
<i>You lost that loving feeling,
now it's gone, gone, gone...</i>

215
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:48,631
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

216
00:22:56,263 --> 00:23:03,072
I love that song. I've never seen that approach.
How long have you two been doing this act?

217
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:07,191
- I don't know. Since uh...
- Puberty? - Right, puberty.

218
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:10,861
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

219
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:15,072
'Maverick'? Did your mother
not like you or something?

220
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:16,700
No, it's my call sign.

221
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:21,789
- You're a pilot!
- That's right. A naval aviator.

222
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,211
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- Oh, how'd you do?

223
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:31,126
Crashed and burned on the
first one, it wasn't pretty.

224
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:32,174
And the second?

225
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:37,179
I don't know, I'll tell you tomorrow.
But it's looking good so far.

226
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:45,406
Well, 'Maverick'... my friend just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

227
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,939
- Perry! - Hi.
- Hi. Here you go.

228
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:50,651
I'll be with you in just a second, ok.

229
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:58,242
- Listen, can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.

230
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:04,498
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.

231
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:11,547
Great. Then I won't have to worry about
you making your living as a singer.

232
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:24,018
I'm gonna need a beer to put these
flames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.

233
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,254
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?
- Too long.

234
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:56,300
What you wanna do, just drop by
down on the tile and go for it?

235
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,346
I actually had this counter in mind.

236
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:06,310
- That would be very, very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.

237
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:14,527
Actually, I came in here to save you
from making a big mistake with that older guy.

238
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:21,242
Really? So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

239
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,745
Maybe.

240
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,584
- I have to get up early in the morning.
- What are you doing?

241
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:36,549
Your friend was magnificent.

242
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:46,517
You'll also be trained and evaluated
by civilian specialists.

243
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,492
The civilians are hre because
they are our very best...

244
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:51,564
source of information on enemy aircraft.

245
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:57,444
One of the most qualified is our call sign
Charlie. She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics.

246
00:25:57,695 --> 00:26:00,906
And she's also a civilian contract,
so you do not salute her.

247
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,290
But you better listen to
her, because the Pentagon...

248
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,879
listens to her about your proficiency.

249
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:08,372
All yours, Charlie.

250
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:14,920
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s
and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

251
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:18,535
Now, then, as most of you
know, the F-5 doesn't have...

252
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,135
the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.

253
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:26,015
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots like the MiG-28.

254
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:31,896
However, the MiG-28 does have
a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

255
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:35,316
It won't do a negative G push-over.

256
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:41,113
The latest intelligence tells us
the most it will do is 1 negative...

257
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:44,909
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?

258
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,539
- Yes, ma'am. The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that, Lieutenant?

259
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,753
- Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28...
- We, we. - Sorry, Goose.

260
00:26:56,003 --> 00:27:01,759
<i>We happened to see a MiG-28</i>
do a 4 G negative dive.

261
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:04,678
Where did you see this?

262
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,514
- That's classified.
- It's what?

263
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:11,091
It's classified. I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

264
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:14,313
Lieutenant, I have
Top Secret clearance.

265
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,462
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

266
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:23,981
- Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem
so in this case now, does it?

267
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:27,284
So, Lieutenant... where exactly were you?

268
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:34,250
<i>Well, we started up on his six when he pulled</i>
through the clouds. I went above him.

269
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,754
If you were directly above him,
how could you see him?

270
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:42,716
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

271
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:46,387
No, he was, man. It was a really great move.
He was inverted.

272
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:51,851
You were in a 4 G inverted dive
with a MiG-28?

273
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:55,020
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

274
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,429
About two metres?

275
00:27:56,533 --> 00:28:01,068
Well, it was actually about 1/2, I
think. I have a great Polaroid of it.

276
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:04,822
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?

277
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:12,204
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating. - Communicating.

278
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:16,041
Keeping up foreign relations.

279
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:20,713
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.

280
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,724
- I know the finger, Goose.

281
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:26,135
I'm sorry, I hate it when
it does that. I'm sorry.

282
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:30,139
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?

283
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:35,144
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.

284
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:40,816
The hard-deck on this hop will be 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

285
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,776
<i>Move it!</i>

286
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,199
Lieutenant!

287
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:55,581
Okay, don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

288
00:28:55,831 --> 00:29:00,169
Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me
you were the famous MiG lnsulter?

289
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,453
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.

290
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:05,549
And what would've?

291
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:08,977
I'm an instructor at this
school, I see 20 new hotshots...

292
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,202
every eight weeks. Now, I'm
sure you can figure that out.

293
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:17,978
Look, Lieutenant. I'd just really like
to hear about the MiG sometime.

294
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,610
You've got security clearance.
You read about it.

295
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:34,286
Maverick...
I'm curious.

296
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:41,502
Who was covering Cougar while you
were showboating with this MiG?

297
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:43,838
Cougar was doing just fine.

298
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:49,049
Gentlemen, this is your first hop.
The jets you're flying against are...

299
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,126
smaller and faster and more manoeuvreable.

300
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,291
Just like the enemy MiGs. Clock
is ticking, and as of now...

301
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:55,432
we are keeping score.

302
00:29:56,725 --> 00:30:01,105
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.

303
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:04,671
- I lost him.
- I'm looking. I'm looking.

304
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,457
I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard.

305
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,136
I got him. Here we go.

306
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,787
Alright, talk to me, Goose.

307
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,924
He's still back there. He's closing
in on us. He's closing fast.

308
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,239
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

309
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:39,205
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.

310
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,339
Watch the mountains!

311
00:30:56,598 --> 00:31:00,498
I still got 'im, he's still back there.
Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.

312
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,374
Yeah. I got him.

313
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,118
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had about enough of this shit.

314
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:22,415
- When I hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.

315
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:32,133
Jesus Christ!

316
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:39,557
- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.
- Ok, man. Let's turn and burn.

317
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:02,372
- He's going vertical. So am l.
- We're going ballistic, man. Go get him!

318
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:14,843
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's get down there first and nail him, Mav.

319
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,679
No way, Jester. You're mine.

320
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:35,509
I've got you now!

321
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,246
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.

322
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,210
Get your butts above the hard-deck
and return to base.

323
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:55,258
Yes, sir!

324
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:03,282
Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.

325
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:06,248
Negative, Ghost Rider. The pattern is full.

326
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:08,921
No, no, Mav. This is not a good idea.

327
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:11,941
Sorry, Goose... but it's time to buzz the tower.

328
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:26,247
Goddamn son of a bitch!

329
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,295
Great balls of fire.

330
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:39,094
- Jester's dead.
- You won? Bullshit.

331
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:42,159
- Didn't everybody?
- No, man. We got our butts kicked.

332
00:33:42,472 --> 00:33:44,974
30 seconds. We went like this,
he went like that...

333
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:50,146
...I said to Hollywood, 'Where did he go?'
Hollywood said, 'Where did who go?'

334
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:53,542
- And he's laughing at us right on
the radio, he's laughing at us.

335
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:55,485
That was me laughing, dickhead. We won.

336
00:33:55,735 --> 00:34:00,240
- All right!
- They won too, man.

337
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,160
- That's not what I heard.
- No, we did. We got Jester.

338
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,128
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.

339
00:34:06,232 --> 00:34:08,540
Hard-deck my ass, we nailed that son of a bitch.

340
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,272
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazansky?

341
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,100
You're everyone's problem.

342
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:18,341
That's because every time you go
up in the air, you're unsafe.

343
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:24,389
- I don't like you because you're dangerous.
- That's right, lceman.

344
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,641
I am dangerous.

345
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,343
Maverick. You and Goose get
your butts outta that...

346
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,482
flight gear and up to Viper's office, now!

347
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,741
Remember boys, no points
for second place.

348
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:47,412
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up. - Don't worry, don't worry.

349
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:51,645
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys did a fly-by
at my tower at over 400 knots.

350
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:55,503
I want somebody's butt, I
want it now, I've had it.

351
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,177
Goddamn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!

352
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:08,433
- Well, that'll just about cover the fly-bys.
- Follow me.

353
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:18,068
Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.

354
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:27,202
The hard-deck for this hop was
10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.

355
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:34,751
You followed Commander Heatherly
below after he lost sight of you. Why?

356
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:41,508
Sir, I had Commander Heatherly in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill...

357
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:44,685
...he then proceeded below the hard-deck.

358
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:48,515
We weren't below 10,000 for
more than a few seconds.

359
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:52,394
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.

360
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:58,608
You took it,
and broke a major rule of engagement.

361
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:04,781
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt fly-by.

362
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:08,047
Lieutenant Mitchell, Top Gun
rules of engagement exist...

363
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:10,359
for your safety and for that of your team.

364
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:12,789
They're not flexible, nor am l.

365
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:16,751
Either obey them or you
are history. Is that clear?

366
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:20,401
Yes, sir!

367
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:30,661
Dismissed.

368
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:41,359
I really enjoyed that, Mav,
thanks a lot. Holy shit.

369
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:48,835
Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver.
Mav, you got the number of that truck-driving

370
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,210
school that was on TV, Truck
Master, something like this?

371
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:51,995
I might need that.

372
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:57,167
State in those reports says it all.
He's a wild card.

373
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:01,212
Completely unpredictable.

374
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:05,592
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

375
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:10,680
Maverick. I flew with his old man.

376
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:18,709
Tell me one thing... if
you had to go into battle,

377
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:21,316
- would you want him with you?
- I don't know.

378
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:25,320
I just don't know.

379
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:38,583
- Still awake?
- Yeah.

380
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,673
- What's up?
- Can't sleep.

381
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:50,274
You kow, when I realised
we were going to Top Gun,

382
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:53,431
all I could think about was getting that trophy.

383
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:58,895
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

384
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:06,486
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

385
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:13,159
I guess that fly-by
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

386
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,397
Look, man, I know it's tough for you.

387
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,751
The Academy rejected you because
you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

388
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:25,338
You have to live with that reputation.

389
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:30,135
But it's like everytime we go up there,
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

390
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:34,597
It makes me nervous.

391
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:43,857
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.

392
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:57,037
Get out of here.

393
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:16,139
A rolling reversal
would work well in that situation.

394
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,893
If I reversed on a hard cross, I could
immediately go to guns on him.

395
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:25,503
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.

396
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:29,444
Too aggressive?

397
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:34,157
Yeah, I guess when I see
something, I go right after it.

398
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,226
You didn't tell me who
you were the other night.

399
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,331
You didn't give me a chance,
did you? You deserved it.

400
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:51,049
I know... but uh... you were tempted...
to ask me out for dinner.

401
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:54,469
- No.
- No? - No.

402
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,471
I don't date students.

403
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:11,861
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me...

404
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,072
...maybe you could.

405
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:24,124
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

406
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:41,850
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

407
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:46,271
Slider...

408
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:51,109
You stink.

409
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:01,870
Let's go!

410
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:26,371
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.

411
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:31,001
- I got some things to take care of.
- 'Take care of'? Just one more game.

412
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:37,027
- Please? For me? - I'm sorry.
- You're sorry... Come on... For me?

413
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:12,938
Damn it.

414
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:25,930
Lieutenant?

415
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:36,024
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm...

416
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,839
No apologies.

417
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:49,309
If you don't mind, I'm... I'm
just gonna take a quick shower...

418
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:51,081
while you're finishing up here.

419
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:57,691
Yeah, I do mind. I'm hungry.

420
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:04,636
And then I thought about it.

421
00:44:04,886 --> 00:44:09,349
I thought,
'You know, he's a smart guy.'

422
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,522
'Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?'

423
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:20,777
It's the MiG.

424
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:29,786
The MiG. You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

425
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:36,710
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.

426
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,922
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.

427
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:47,929
Except you did forget the wine.

428
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:50,473
Sorry.

429
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:56,104
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

430
00:44:56,354 --> 00:45:00,817
Then relax about the MiG.

431
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,686
This music...

432
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,732
An old friend?

433
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:25,905
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.

434
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,766
My mother used to call from her room
and have me play this over and over again...

435
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:35,842
...I got so sick of it.

436
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:44,194
But not her. She'd sit up there alone,
just listening for hours.

437
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:50,742
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.

438
00:45:51,722 --> 00:45:54,517
What happened to your father?

439
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:05,361
I guess I kinda figured with your security
clearance you'd know more about it than I do.

440
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:08,697
Well, I didn't get that far.

441
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,933
Well, that's a big mystery.

442
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:19,896
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

443
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:27,737
The stink of it was... he screwed up.

444
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:32,951
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

445
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:39,968
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

446
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:46,756
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.

447
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:52,095
Is that why
you're always second best up there?

448
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:54,243
You are direct, aren't you.

449
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:06,943
I'm sorry I was late.

450
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:13,158
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.

451
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:18,830
This is going to be complicated.

452
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:32,802
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

453
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:42,228
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

454
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:23,144
It looks like you need another shower.

455
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:26,085
Right.

456
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:35,240
I'm gonna be honest with you.

457
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,578
Your MiG sighting
is really important to my work, but uh...

458
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:49,713
I don't normally invite students
to my house. You're uh...

459
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:01,516
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

460
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:33,089
I'm glad we got that straight.

461
00:49:48,563 --> 00:49:53,443
I told her how tough it is here. You know,
my ass dragging like an old tired dog.

462
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:56,988
I told her you didn't even
have a woman here.

463
00:49:57,238 --> 00:50:00,950
She said, 'Oh, he probably
doesn't have 1, he's got 8.'

464
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:11,503
- Hi!
- Daddy.

465
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:21,554
So, Maverick! Goose tells me you're
in love with one of your instructors.

466
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:23,014
Is that right?

467
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:29,500
I didn't tell her that. I can't believe
you said that. That was a secret.

468
00:50:36,027 --> 00:50:41,408
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.

469
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:45,954
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.

470
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:52,669
Better to retire and save your aircraft
than push a bad position.

471
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:58,133
Charlie, jump in here any time. Now, you stay
in that diamond another three seconds...

472
00:50:58,383 --> 00:51:03,179
...the bogey's gonna blow you out in the sky.
You take a hard right, select zone five...

473
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:08,351
...you can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.

474
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:15,775
- Charlie?
- Aircraft one performs a split S?

475
00:51:16,026 --> 00:51:20,196
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.

476
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:24,305
Freeze there, please. The
MiG has you in his gunsight.

477
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:27,037
What were you thinking at this point?

478
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:31,791
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.

479
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:36,740
That's a big gamble with a
$30-million dollar plane,

480
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:37,797
Lieutenant.

481
00:51:43,094 --> 00:51:48,308
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.

482
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:55,148
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical
move here, comes over the top, and he

483
00:51:55,398 --> 00:52:00,779
The encounter was a victory, but I think
we have show it as an example of what not to do.

484
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:05,075
Next.

485
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:08,787
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

486
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:16,586
Now then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

487
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:30,392
Lieutenant?

488
00:52:43,279 --> 00:52:48,243
My review of your performance was
right on, in my professional opinion.

489
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:50,182
I can't hear you.

490
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:17,063
<b>Jesus Christ! And you think I'm reckless!</b>
When I fly, my crew and my plane come first.

491
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:19,837
Well, I'm gonna finish
my sentence, Lieutenant.

492
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:22,517
My review of your flight
performance was right on.

493
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:24,206
- Is that right?
- That is right.

494
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,926
But I held something back.

495
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:30,066
I see some real genius in your flying,
Maverick, but I can't say that in there.

496
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,663
I was afraid that everyone in that
tacts training would see right through me.

497
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:37,334
I just don't want anyone
to know that I've fallen for you.

498
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:28,069
- Hey, Maverick? You hear about lce?
- What's that?

499
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,178
- He won another one.
- Really? - Yeah.

500
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:37,172
- I fell the need...
<i>...the need for speed.</i>

501
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:47,161
Gentlemen, this is hop 19. Multiple aircraft,
multiple bogeys. Your training is half-over.

502
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:51,760
The competltion for the Top Gun
trophy remains tight. First place, lceman.

503
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,420
Second place, Maverick.
Just two points behind.

504
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:59,653
There they are. Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.
I don't think they see us yet.

505
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:04,397
Ok, I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.

506
00:56:13,198 --> 00:56:16,481
Good morning, gentlemen. The
temperature is 110 degrees...

507
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:17,756
Holy shit! It's Viper!

508
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:22,009
Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.

509
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:25,137
Great. He's probably saying,
'Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose.'

510
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:27,233
Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.

511
00:56:30,507 --> 00:56:34,302
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.

512
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:39,349
Hollywood, you got the lead,
I'll cover you.

513
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,446
Break now, Jester.

514
00:56:57,492 --> 00:57:00,356
Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

515
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,298
Roger, I'm on 'im.

516
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:08,550
Goose, find Viper. He's out there somewhere.

517
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:12,382
Stay with Hollywood, Mav,
we're covering his wing.

518
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:17,345
- Goose, there's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we're his cover.

519
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:21,641
- Don't you leave me, Mav.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.

520
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:23,977
I'm going after Viper.

521
00:57:26,604 --> 00:57:29,566
- Goddamn you, Maverick!
- Mav, don't leave him.

522
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:33,737
Goose, Hollywood's okay.
I want Viper.

523
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:38,950
Stand by.
Viper's coming down.

524
00:57:45,248 --> 00:57:48,877
Holy shit. We're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.

525
00:58:02,807 --> 00:58:06,186
Rock and roll! Here's our chance,
it's a big one, Goose.

526
00:58:08,897 --> 00:58:11,983
Come on, goddamn it.

527
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:16,988
Come on, keep coming.

528
00:58:20,116 --> 00:58:24,079
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.

529
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:26,831
Come on, Come around.
That's it.

530
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:40,470
- Jesus, this guy's good. Where's he going?
- Come on, come on. Keep coming.

531
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,893
Come on, baby.

532
00:58:50,146 --> 00:58:52,941
Damn, this kid's good.

533
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:56,778
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

534
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,367
Come on, come on.

535
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:06,121
Stick with it...

536
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:13,128
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!

537
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:18,258
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

538
00:59:18,508 --> 00:59:21,434
The Defence Department regrets
to inform you your sons...

539
00:59:21,538 --> 00:59:23,263
are dead because they were stupid.

540
00:59:23,784 --> 00:59:25,734
<i>Great balls of fire.</i>

541
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,769
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

542
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:40,655
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!

543
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:46,578
That was some of the best flying I've seen yet.
Right up to the part where you got killed.

544
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:50,352
You never, never leave your wingman.

545
00:59:56,546 --> 01:00:02,344
Maverick... It's not your flying,
it's your attitude.

546
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,981
The enemy's dangerous, but
right now you're worse than...

547
01:00:08,086 --> 01:00:11,061
the enemy. You're dangerous and foolish.

548
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:18,360
You may not like who's flying with you, they may
not like you... but whose side are you on?

549
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:32,624
At least Viper got lceman before
he got us. We've still got a shot at it.

550
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:38,963
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.

551
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,009
I know...

552
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:49,849
I know.

553
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,571
Maverick, would you go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

554
01:01:44,821 --> 01:01:50,827
- Goose? Hell no. Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter. - What? !

555
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:56,333
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

556
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,085
Did he? That's great...

557
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:04,799
He tells me about all of them. How my
lil' angel Goose goes home early for church...

558
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,806
- ...and you! You always go
home with the hot women.

559
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:09,346
Alright. Thank you, Carole.

560
01:02:09,596 --> 01:02:14,934
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

561
01:02:31,242 --> 01:02:36,206
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.

562
01:02:37,707 --> 01:02:42,712
I've known Pete for a lot of years now and...
I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.

563
01:02:42,962 --> 01:02:48,155
- There are hearts breaking wide open
all over the world tonight. - Why?

564
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:52,681
Because, unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

565
01:02:52,931 --> 01:02:58,269
He is 100% prime-time in love with you.

566
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:04,432
- Hey, Goose, you big stud. - That's me, honey.
- Take me to bed or lose me forever.

567
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:06,465
Show me the way home, honey.

568
01:03:08,279 --> 01:03:10,573
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

569
01:03:42,897 --> 01:03:47,736
Maverick, you big stud...

570
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:52,324
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

571
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:08,006
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.

572
01:04:08,256 --> 01:04:11,801
The Top Gun trophy
is still up for grabs, so

573
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:57,360
Well, it's bottom of the
night, the score is tied.

574
01:04:57,465 --> 01:04:58,640
It's time for the big one.

575
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:03,937
- You up for this one, Maverick?
- Just a walk in the park, Cazansky.

576
01:05:06,898 --> 01:05:11,976
Contact. Multiple bogeys, 165. Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

577
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,740
- Oh, I see 'em. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.

578
01:05:35,885 --> 01:05:39,305
That son of a bitch cut me off.

579
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:52,475
- Come on. Jesus Christ, lce, take the shot.
- Come on, Ice. Get the hell out of there.

580
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:56,281
I can't get the angle. I'm too close
for missiles. I'm switching to guns.

581
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:58,804
Ice, fire or clear!

582
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:07,711
Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here.

583
01:06:07,815 --> 01:06:10,295
I need another 20 seconds and I've got him.

584
01:06:16,259 --> 01:06:18,085
I'm moving in. I've got the shot.

585
01:06:18,189 --> 01:06:20,659
<i>Come on, Mav, let's get in there. Come on, Mav!</i>

586
01:06:22,098 --> 01:06:24,312
Maverick's getting impatient.
Now, come on, take the shot.

587
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:25,685
10 more seconds, then I've got 'im.

588
01:06:27,854 --> 01:06:30,916
Come on, get the hell out
of there. Let's do it, Mav.

589
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:32,723
Ice, Come off my right. I'm in.

590
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:35,695
- Five more seconds.
- Come off my right. I'm in.

591
01:06:35,945 --> 01:06:38,073
I'm off. Shit.

592
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,370
We're in a jetwash. Shit!

593
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:49,773
This is not good. Shit,
we've got a flame-out, Mav.

594
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:52,337
Engine one is out... Engine two is out.

595
01:06:52,587 --> 01:06:55,590
I'm losing control. I can't control it!

596
01:06:59,844 --> 01:07:03,640
It's coupling up. This is not good!

597
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,269
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!

598
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,776
Altitude 8,000... 7,000...

599
01:07:15,026 --> 01:07:17,821
We're at 6,000!

600
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:22,450
I can't reach the ejection handle!

601
01:07:24,619 --> 01:07:31,251
- You're gonna have to punch us out.
- I can't reach the ejection handle!

602
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:35,005
- Eject...
- Watch the canopy!

603
01:07:51,604 --> 01:07:54,024
Goose... Oh, no!

604
01:07:57,694 --> 01:08:00,363
Oh, God.

605
01:08:47,744 --> 01:08:51,247
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go, sir.

606
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:38,420
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

607
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:44,801
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

608
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:51,662
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

609
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:56,980
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

610
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:05,030
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.

611
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:11,536
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.

612
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:15,290
You can count on it.

613
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,294
You've got to let him go.

614
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:23,173
You've got to let him go.

615
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:44,361
I think maybe it was my fault.

616
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:46,905
I don't know.

617
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:52,160
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

618
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:57,374
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

619
01:11:02,962 --> 01:11:05,528
God, I want him back.

620
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:13,828
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

621
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:10,715
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

622
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:33,780
He would have flown anyway...
without you.

623
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:38,118
He'd've hated it,
but he would have done it.

624
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:02,018
We find that the F-14 flatspin
was induced by the...

625
01:14:02,122 --> 01:14:05,186
disruption of air flow
into the starboard engine.

626
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:09,357
This disruption stalled the engine...

627
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:14,727
...which produced enough yaw rate
to induce a spin...

628
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:17,657
...which was unrecoverable.

629
01:14:17,907 --> 01:14:21,009
There was no way Lieutenant
Mitchell could see or avoid...

630
01:14:21,114 --> 01:14:23,455
the jetwash which produced the engine stall.

631
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:26,522
Therefore, the Board of lnquiry
finds Lieutenant Mitchell...

632
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:28,918
was not at fault in the
accident of 29th of July.

633
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:32,193
Lieutenant Mitchell's record will
be cleared of this incident.

634
01:14:32,297 --> 01:14:35,717
Lieutenant Mitchell's restored to
flight status without further delay.

635
01:14:36,885 --> 01:14:39,304
These proceedings are closed.

636
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:50,920
Get him up flying, soon.

637
01:15:17,008 --> 01:15:18,385
Come on, kid, come on. Get in there. Engage.

638
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:23,598
Alright, you've got a bogey at two o'clock low,
Maverick. You got the angle, piece of cake now.

639
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,438
Take the shot, kid.
Take the shot.

640
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:33,838
You can engage any time, Maverick.

641
01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:48,175
- Hey! Where the hell are you going?
- It's not good. It doesn't look good.

642
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:51,522
What do you mean, 'it doesn't look good'?
It doesn't get to look any better than that.

643
01:16:03,972 --> 01:16:08,539
Hey, man. We coulda had him...
Hey! We coulda had him, man!

644
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:15,859
I'll fire when I'm goddamn
good and ready. You got that?

645
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:38,965
- He can't get back in the saddle,
he won't engage.

646
01:16:39,215 --> 01:16:41,906
<i>You know, he just might not make it back.</i>

647
01:16:44,804 --> 01:16:46,577
Keep sending him up.

648
01:17:05,909 --> 01:17:07,535
Mitchell?

649
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,435
I'm sorry about Goose.

650
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:16,586
Everybody liked him.

651
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:24,010
I'm sorry.

652
01:17:43,113 --> 01:17:45,115
Hi, it's Wolfman.

653
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:50,245
Maverick just quit.

654
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:14,185
Excuse me...

655
01:18:17,418 --> 01:18:20,317
- May l?
- Please.

656
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:34,456
I'll have what he's having.
Hemlock, is it?

657
01:18:34,706 --> 01:18:37,208
Ice water.

658
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,423
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

659
01:18:45,342 --> 01:18:50,451
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.

660
01:18:51,535 --> 01:18:57,020
Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

661
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:05,487
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

662
01:19:07,155 --> 01:19:13,495
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

663
01:19:13,745 --> 01:19:17,968
Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

664
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,272
It's not your fault.

665
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:25,590
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

666
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,261
What you do up there... It's dangerous.

667
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:35,517
- But you've got to go on.
- You don't understand.

668
01:19:36,643 --> 01:19:42,023
When I first met you,
you were larger than life.

669
01:19:43,942 --> 01:19:46,444
Look at you.

670
01:19:47,112 --> 01:19:50,236
You're not gonna be happy
unless you're going Mach 2...

671
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,482
with your hair on fire, you know that.

672
01:19:52,586 --> 01:19:55,286
No, that's over. It's just over.

673
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:59,395
To be the best of the best means
you make mistakes and then...

674
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:02,033
you go on, it's just like the rest of us.

675
01:20:02,137 --> 01:20:04,546
You don't think I know that?

676
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,675
I'm here to help.

677
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:17,434
Look, thank you. But if I'd wanted help,
really... I would have asked for it.

678
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,859
So, I'm too late.

679
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:29,279
You've already left.

680
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:33,783
You didn't learn a damn thing,
did you?

681
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:35,952
Except to quit.

682
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:43,387
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

683
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,625
So long, Pete Mitchell.

684
01:21:18,495 --> 01:21:22,426
Oh, hi, Maverick, come on in.
How are you doing?

685
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,078
- Good
- Yeah? Sure you're feeling okay?

686
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:25,121
- Fine.
- Great.

687
01:21:25,225 --> 01:21:28,576
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a
drink or anything else like that?

688
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,339
No, thank you.

689
01:21:29,589 --> 01:21:31,445
- Ok, why don't you just uh...
- Thank you very much.

690
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:34,118
- Make yourself comfortable, 'cuz
Mike will be right down, ok?

691
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:34,761
Ok. Thank you.

692
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:58,556
I flew with your old man.
VF-51, the Oriskany.

693
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:05,750
You're a lot like he was.
Only better...

694
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:08,253
...and worse.

695
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:13,883
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch,
that man.

696
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,931
So he did do it right.

697
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:26,083
Yeah, he did it right.

698
01:22:35,655 --> 01:22:40,431
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

699
01:22:42,203 --> 01:22:44,539
Yeah, your old man did it right.

700
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:50,295
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

701
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:53,715
We were in the worst dogfight ever
dreamed of.

702
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:57,969
There were... bogeys like fireflies
all over the sky.

703
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:02,599
His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could have made it back.

704
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:06,936
He stayed in it,
saved three planes before he bought it.

705
01:23:09,272 --> 01:23:12,566
- How come I never heard that before?

706
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:17,322
The battle occurred over
the wrong line on some map.

707
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:21,201
- So you were there?
- I was there.

708
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:24,204
What's on your mind?

709
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:28,166
My options, sir.

710
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:33,338
Simple.
First, you've acquired enough points...

711
01:23:33,484 --> 01:23:36,299
...to show up tomorrow and graduate
with your Top Gun class.

712
01:23:37,404 --> 01:23:38,656
Or you could quit.

713
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:44,182
There'll be no disgrace. That spin was hell,
<i>it would have shook me up.</i>

714
01:23:44,432 --> 01:23:48,478
- So you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.

715
01:23:49,354 --> 01:23:52,668
The simple fact is, you
feel responsible for Goose.

716
01:23:52,772 --> 01:23:54,964
And you have a confidence problem.

717
01:23:56,361 --> 01:23:59,531
I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine
up your ass, Lieutenant.

718
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:04,244
A good pilot is compelled
to always evaluate what's happened...

719
01:24:04,494 --> 01:24:07,372
...so he can apply what he's learned.

720
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:12,585
Up there, we've got to push it.
That's our job.

721
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:19,592
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.

722
01:24:30,854 --> 01:24:35,275
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but
thank you very much for your time.

723
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:38,392
No problem. Good luck.

724
01:25:26,743 --> 01:25:31,164
- Gentlemen...
- Where's Maverick?

725
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:37,045
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?

726
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:41,320
It's got to be hard on the guy,
though, you know.

727
01:26:12,163 --> 01:26:15,208
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

728
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:20,380
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav. - Sir.

729
01:26:22,966 --> 01:26:29,055
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party
<i>before it really gets out of hand...</i>

730
01:26:29,305 --> 01:26:34,394
<i>Some of you have to depart immediately.
We have a crisis situation.</i>

731
01:26:34,644 --> 01:26:36,876
- Ice, Slider...
- Yo.

732
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:39,044
- Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Yes, sir.

733
01:26:40,775 --> 01:26:44,112
- Maverick.
- Sir.

734
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:52,704
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship. And if you don't...

735
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:57,208
...give me a call. I'll fly with you.

736
01:27:09,804 --> 01:27:13,628
Gentlemen, this is bull's eye. The
communication ship SS Layton has...

737
01:27:13,732 --> 01:27:16,780
become disabled and has wandered
into foreign territory.

738
01:27:16,884 --> 01:27:20,982
A rescue operation is to begin
within the hour. Your mission is...

739
01:27:21,086 --> 01:27:23,234
to give air support to that rescue.

740
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,591
There are MiGs in the area,
and tensions are high.

741
01:27:26,695 --> 01:27:29,970
If you witness a hostile
act, you will return fire.

742
01:27:30,825 --> 01:27:33,379
Those MIGs carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.

743
01:27:33,483 --> 01:27:36,206
They can fire that missile
from a 100 miles away.

744
01:27:36,456 --> 01:27:42,431
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.

745
01:27:42,535 --> 01:27:47,967
You are America's best. Make us proud.
Ice... Hollywood, sector two.

746
01:27:48,218 --> 01:27:52,263
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin
on ready five.

747
01:27:52,514 --> 01:27:55,809
- Yes, sir.
- Rise.

748
01:27:57,852 --> 01:28:00,814
Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.

749
01:28:01,064 --> 01:28:03,984
But with regard to Maverick...
is he the best pilot to..?

750
01:28:04,192 --> 01:28:07,112
- I know what's on your mind,
Cazansky, just get on it.

751
01:29:26,107 --> 01:29:29,486
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

752
01:29:29,736 --> 01:29:33,593
Voodoo One, Voodoo One. 090,
radar contact 15 miles.

753
01:29:33,697 --> 01:29:35,450
They're doing 500 knots.

754
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,535
Roger, that's your bogey.

755
01:29:40,497 --> 01:29:43,208
Dead ahead, 15 miles,
airspeed of 600 knots.

756
01:29:52,175 --> 01:29:56,137
They're at 15,000 feet now,
dead ahead, 10 miles.

757
01:29:56,388 --> 01:30:00,600
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.

758
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:06,022
- Wood, you got 'em? - Not yet, I can't see 'em.
- They must be close. I'm getting a hard-on.

759
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:15,656
Ok, Wood, I'm taking the
lead. Let's identify 'em.

760
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,630
Roger, Ice. You got the lead, I'm
on your leftside, a little low.

761
01:30:19,953 --> 01:30:23,039
- Maverick's up and ready in alert five.
- Good, good.

762
01:30:25,709 --> 01:30:29,921
My bogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.

763
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,336
Still manoeuvring, course 090.

764
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:37,095
Ok, Wood. Let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on 'im.

765
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:49,776
Ice, we've got a problem here.
Now I have four aircraft on radar,

766
01:30:49,881 --> 01:30:51,860
not 1 pair, 2 pairs. Repeat, 4 bogeys.

767
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:54,592
Wood, we've got four bogeys.

768
01:30:56,614 --> 01:30:59,096
- Wrong, make that five!
- There's five, sir.

769
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,390
- That's five?
- Yes, sir.

770
01:31:02,912 --> 01:31:06,082
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.

771
01:31:08,585 --> 01:31:11,087
Get out of there, Hollywood!
<i>Get outta there, goddammit.</i>

772
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:25,518
I'm hit. We're coming apart.
I can't control it! We're going down.

773
01:31:25,769 --> 01:31:28,688
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!

774
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:32,192
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We've lost Hollywood!

775
01:31:32,442 --> 01:31:35,612
- Repeat, we've lost Hollywood.
- Launch Maverick on Alert 5.

776
01:31:35,862 --> 01:31:40,909
<i>Get a bearing on Hollywood and Wolfman.
And launch the rescue helicopter immediately.</i>

777
01:32:06,726 --> 01:32:11,231
- Iceman, what's your position?
- 090 at 180 miles.

778
01:32:11,481 --> 01:32:16,069
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead, coming on the left side

779
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:21,053
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

780
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:27,622
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them!

781
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:38,049
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.

782
01:32:38,299 --> 01:32:39,855
Launch the alert fiighters!

783
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:42,846
Where are they? - 160 miles
and closing in fast, sir.

784
01:32:43,096 --> 01:32:44,764
Ready Willard and Simkin.

785
01:32:47,892 --> 01:32:50,812
Maverick supersonic.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

786
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:51,855
Where are you at?

787
01:32:52,063 --> 01:32:53,940
Show up here, I'm engaged with
5, repeat 5. I'm in deep shit.

788
01:32:56,318 --> 01:33:01,281
- What about Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

789
01:33:01,531 --> 01:33:02,924
- How long?
- It'll take 10 minutes.

790
01:33:03,028 --> 01:33:05,994
Bullshit! 10 minutes! This thing will
be over in two minutes! Get on it.

791
01:33:08,705 --> 01:33:12,625
One MiG 12 o'clock high...
Watch your back!

792
01:33:18,631 --> 01:33:23,219
- Break right!
- Shit, that was close.

793
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:26,114
Maverick, get your butt down here,
what the hell are you doing?

794
01:33:26,218 --> 01:33:27,328
Come on, kid. Hang in there.

795
01:33:29,267 --> 01:33:31,415
Jesus Christ!

796
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:35,649
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddammit!

797
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:39,048
Maverick, we've got a
MiG on our tail.

798
01:33:42,593 --> 01:33:43,740
Watch out!

799
01:33:46,242 --> 01:33:49,037
Sir, we just flew right
through his jetwash!

800
01:33:50,747 --> 01:33:53,541
Get control!

801
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:05,679
- Good recovery, Mav.
- Okay, let's get in there, we gotta help lce.

802
01:34:05,929 --> 01:34:09,610
Let's get back in the game.
<i>Come on! Get in there, Maverick!</i>

803
01:34:09,714 --> 01:34:10,684
No, it's no good.

804
01:34:13,728 --> 01:34:19,129
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- I knew it. Shit! - Goddammit, Maverick!

805
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:25,970
<i>- Get in there, Maverick, come on.</i>
<i>- Maverick! What the hell are you doing?

806
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:28,420
Maverick, get in there, for chrissake!</i>
- Talk to me, Goose...

807
01:34:28,524 --> 01:34:30,595
<i>Ice is in trouble! Come
on, get in there, Maverick!</i>

808
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:33,477
<i>Ice won't last down there alone,
get in the fight, for God's sake...</i>

809
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:34,520
Talk to me, Goose.

810
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,210
Maverick!

811
01:34:39,421 --> 01:34:41,277
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

812
01:34:46,886 --> 01:34:49,921
- I can't get him off my tail.
- Ice, I've got your MiG dead ahead.

813
01:34:50,025 --> 01:34:51,391
<i>I got 'im dead ahead.</i>

814
01:34:52,976 --> 01:34:56,896
I got tone. Firing!

815
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:11,067
- Where are they?
- 155 miles.

816
01:35:11,171 --> 01:35:13,595
Two MiGs dead ahead,
closer, 800 miles an hour.

817
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,124
<i>I see them. I'm gonna take
them on the left side.</i>

818
01:35:18,043 --> 01:35:20,399
Oh, my God.

819
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:24,862
Ice is right below us,
he's got a MiG on his tail.

820
01:35:26,885 --> 01:35:29,554
He's firing. Break left!

821
01:35:31,848 --> 01:35:34,726
He overshot!

822
01:35:34,976 --> 01:35:36,957
Coming in, lce. Coming in.

823
01:35:39,251 --> 01:35:41,253
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.

824
01:35:42,275 --> 01:35:44,986
I got 'im, Mav.
One MiG passing between us.

825
01:35:48,323 --> 01:35:52,431
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!

826
01:36:00,126 --> 01:36:03,171
Check the guy to the north!

827
01:36:05,548 --> 01:36:08,259
Banking left.

828
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:14,474
- There he is. Get him, lce!
- Okay, you guys, I'm coming in.

829
01:36:18,937 --> 01:36:21,919
Maverick! We got a MiG's coming
round on our tail, we gotta get outta here!

830
01:36:22,065 --> 01:36:23,222
I can't leave lce.

831
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:26,390
He's still coming around,
he's gonna get behind us!

832
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:28,029
<i>I'm not leaving my wingman.</i>

833
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:34,580
I'm on his tail. I'm going for
it. I'm going for the shot...

834
01:36:34,684 --> 01:36:36,246
right now. Roger, engaged!

835
01:36:38,957 --> 01:36:43,336
- I've got radar lock.
- I'm taking the shot. Fire!

836
01:36:48,216 --> 01:36:52,543
- Bingo! - Watch it, sucker, yeah!
- Ice, watch out. There's a MiG to your right.

837
01:36:52,648 --> 01:36:53,680
He's firing!

838
01:36:54,973 --> 01:37:01,187
- I'm hit. We're hit in the right engine.
- I'm shutting it down.

839
01:37:06,463 --> 01:37:08,153
Coming in, lce.
Coming in.

840
01:37:11,614 --> 01:37:14,786
Ice, that bogey's still behind
you. I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

841
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:16,578
<i>Stay with him, Mav, Stay with him!</i>

842
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:20,060
- Take the shot, nail him, nail him!
- Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.

843
01:37:20,165 --> 01:37:22,313
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail.

844
01:37:26,546 --> 01:37:29,966
- Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again again!
- We're okay.

845
01:37:30,216 --> 01:37:33,011
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right.

846
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:37,411
Three... two... one...
break right!

847
01:37:41,165 --> 01:37:42,625
Firing!

848
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:50,184
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go. Keep on him, Mav, keep on him.

849
01:37:50,289 --> 01:37:54,293
I got him. I got him.
Here comes the shot.

850
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:01,706
Strike three.

851
01:38:02,874 --> 01:38:05,279
- Maverick, move. There's a MiG on your tail.

852
01:38:05,383 --> 01:38:08,333
We got a problem here, we've
only got one missile left.

853
01:38:08,437 --> 01:38:10,851
- Approaching, 110 miles, sir.
- Goddammit.

854
01:38:10,955 --> 01:38:13,635
I got him, I got him.
<i>He's right on us, he's on our tail.</i>

855
01:38:21,643 --> 01:38:23,332
We haven't lost him,
he's still with us.

856
01:38:27,357 --> 01:38:31,403
- What're you doing, you're slowing down!
- I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.

857
01:38:31,528 --> 01:38:32,445
<i>You gonna do what? !</i>

858
01:38:37,617 --> 01:38:39,024
This is it, Maverick.

859
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:42,122
I'm gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by us.

860
01:38:46,084 --> 01:38:47,335
Now!

861
01:38:52,382 --> 01:38:54,718
I've got a good lock. Firing.

862
01:38:58,638 --> 01:39:00,974
Strike four!

863
01:39:04,686 --> 01:39:09,587
Mustang, this is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

864
01:39:23,413 --> 01:39:29,315
- Mustang, this is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, Ghostrider. The pattern is full.

865
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:34,570
Excuse me, is there something
I should know about?

866
01:39:53,151 --> 01:39:55,820
Goddamn that guy.

867
01:40:50,959 --> 01:40:53,023
You!

868
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:58,237
You are still dangerous.

869
01:41:01,553 --> 01:41:04,368
But you can be my wingman anytime.

870
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,143
Bullshit. You can be mine.

871
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,696
- Maverick?
- Sir!

872
01:42:02,447 --> 01:42:06,190
You're on the front pages
of all the English-speaking world.

873
01:42:06,295 --> 01:42:08,516
Even though the other side
denies the incident, congratulations.

874
01:42:08,641 --> 01:42:09,923
Thank you, sir.

875
01:42:10,027 --> 01:42:12,502
They gave you your choice of
duty, son. Anything, anywhere.

876
01:42:12,606 --> 01:42:13,625
Do you believe that shit?

877
01:42:13,938 --> 01:42:15,293
Where do you think you want to go?

878
01:42:16,252 --> 01:42:19,412
I thought of being an instructor, sir.

879
01:42:20,455 --> 01:42:21,341
Top Gun? !

880
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:23,145
Yes, sir.

881
01:42:23,864 --> 01:42:25,199
God help us!

882
01:43:45,258 --> 01:43:47,552
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

883
01:43:51,264 --> 01:43:55,915
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here, so...

884
01:44:00,899 --> 01:44:03,005
This could be complicated.

885
01:44:04,527 --> 01:44:09,157
You know,
on the first one, I crashed and burned.

886
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,514
And the second?

887
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,418
I don't know.

888
01:44:20,523 --> 01:44:22,212
But uh...

889
01:44:23,369 --> 01:44:25,861
...it's looking good so far.
