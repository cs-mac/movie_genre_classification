00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:42,226
(# 'Let's Misbehave')...

2
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:32,200
...# We're all alone,
no chaperone can get our number...

3
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:34,474
...# The world's in slumber...

4
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,732
...# Let's misbehave...

5
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,564
...# There's something wild about you,
child, that's so contagious...

6
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,959
...# Let's be outrageous...

7
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,081
...# Let's misbehave...

8
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:51,074
...# When Adam won Eve's hand,
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

9
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:55,509
# He didn't care about
those apples out of season...

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,542
...# They say that spring
means just one thing to little lovebirds...

11
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,919
...# We're not above birds...

12
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,058
...# Let's misbehave...

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,880
...# Let's misbehave...

14
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,459
...# Let's misbehave...

15
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:48,089
...# If you'd be just so sweet
and only meet your fate, dear...

16
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:53,065
...# 'Twould be the great
event of 1928, dear...

17
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:04,827
...# Let's misbehave...

18
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,471
...# Let's misbehave.

19
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,905
Well...

20
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,103
...a most excellent feast.

21
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,243
(all) Hear, hear.

22
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,777
Soon we will retire
to the royal bedchamber.

23
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:55,531
But first, as I have been victorious
this week in battle...

24
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,671
...(cheering)...

25
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,161
...I wish to be amused. Bring me my fool.

26
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,301
(fanfare)

27
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:13,174
Your Majesty, it's great
to be back at the palace.

28
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:18,289
You know what the palace is -
24 living rooms and a dungeon.

29
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,978
But seriously... I love the king. He's one
of the strongest men here, isn't he?

30
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:28,690
He's the only one amongst us
that can swim the moat lengthwise.

31
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,829
Cos...

32
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,571
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing.

33
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,740
But seriously, ladies and germs,
I wanna say that...

34
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,867
...that plague is really something.

35
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:42,602
Doesn't everything look black?.

36
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:45,915
Cos it's a... a black... a black plague.

37
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,960
Save it up and let me hear it
at the end... big.

38
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,172
And, uh... I love the new exercise
His Majesty does to keep in shape.

39
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,652
It's called taxing peasants.

40
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:02,265
But seriously... the... the best... thing...

41
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:05,152
I can't stand it any longer.

42
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,284
He's not funny.

43
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,189
I've cut men in half
for making jokes as bad as that.

44
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,443
But, sire...
- Get me a fool who's funny.

45
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,668
Go on. The feast is over.

46
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,460
Not funny.

47
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,211
Come on. Out, out, out, out.

48
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:23,953
I do a couple of impressions
that you might like.

49
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:28,499
L-I'm one of the few guys that can do the
King of France. Not his voice, his walk.

50
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,962
If you've ever noticed, he'll have
that funny motion when he walks.

51
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:38,672
He's... Don't everybody... burst
into spontaneous applause on this.

52
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:01,032
Look where thou goest, fool.
- I beg your puberty.

53
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:03,910
Thou hast dropped
the royal rubies and emeralds.

54
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,205
I fain wouldst pick it up
and pin it and fain well on thy fain.

55
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,582
Aye, pin.
- Yes, extend thy fain, madam.

56
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:13,336
And I... On the knocker it hangs. Perfect.
- Knock.

57
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,476
Didst I feel right?

58
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:19,676
Or didst I feel that thy two hands
did upon my royal body cop a feel?

59
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,972
Oh, madam, not I. I surely would never
lay my hands on the royal tomatoes.

60
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,473
Tomatoes?.

61
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,768
Hearken to me. If my husband the king
and my son the doctor...

62
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:33,022
...walketh near upon these paved paths
and heareth what thou sayest...

63
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,358
...thy life would not be worth a plug nickel.

64
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,069
But so beautiful do they lay -
one on either side...

65
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,504
That's the way they were made, fool.
Away with thee.

66
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,049
(groans)

67
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:49,728
Oh... I... I fell on my bells.

68
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:53,334
TB...

69
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,474
...or not TB?

70
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,643
That is the congestion.

71
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:01,384
Consumption be done about it?

72
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,524
Of cough. Of cough.

73
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:06,568
(guard) Ohhh, Jesus.

74
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,737
My jokes grow stale.

75
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:12,181
I would my life take for a bare bodkin.

76
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:15,773
If only I could see the queen's bare bodkin.

77
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:18,651
Or anybody's bare bodkin, for that matter.

78
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:22,030
Or a bodkin with a little clothes on it even.

79
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,169
I'm so melancholy.

80
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:26,910
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead.

81
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,078
Their tailor shop is closed.

82
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:31,218
(echoing) Felix.

83
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:33,387
Who calls my name?

84
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,210
Felix.

85
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,880
No one knows I'm here.
Not even my service.

86
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:43,608
I am the ghost of thy father.

87
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,774
Oh... my father.

88
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,774
You who died in childbirth.

89
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,946
I cannot rest...

90
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,444
...unless thee makes it with the queen.

91
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,694
But she is a queen
and I am a baseborn fool.

92
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:02,528
I can't screw above my station.

93
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,787
You must know, my son...

94
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,416
...that thy uncle...

95
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,591
...my father...

96
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,100
...poured hemlock in my ear.

97
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,042
Why?

98
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,182
Don't ask me why.

99
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,765
He does that with everybody.

100
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:24,519
Whenever he sees an ear...

101
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,275
...he likes to pour hemlock in it.

102
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,157
(gasps) Oh, Father.

103
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,866
See the sorcerer, my son.

104
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,035
(fading) The sorcerer.

105
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,324
The sorcerer...

106
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,292
He's gone.

107
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,490
Do I dare sleep with the queen?

108
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,659
And will she sleep with me?

109
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,538
Although she sleeps with the king,
and he wears leotards.

110
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,638
The sorcerer...

111
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,841
Ah. An aphrodisiac.

112
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,978
Do you want a soft one?

113
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,147
A strong one?

114
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,316
Or one that will...

115
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,604
...mmm?

116
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:16,414
What can I get without a prescription?
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

117
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:20,199
This, placed softly...

118
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,234
...in the queen's drink...

119
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,403
...will make her blood boil.

120
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,623
Her passion... unbridled.

121
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,255
Lustful.

122
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:34,120
In other words...
- The hots for me.

123
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,260
(chuckles)

124
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,389
Exactly.

125
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,430
But be cautious.

126
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,880
For if His Majesty
should get wind of thy intent...

127
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,479
...he will cut off your legs...

128
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,648
...your arms...

129
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,817
...and your head.

130
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:55,423
Right... Five out of six is not bad.

131
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,531
Now go.

132
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,103
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,498
I think your eggs are done.

134
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,408
Halt. Who goes there?
- It's just the fool.

135
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,827
What business have you
in the royal chamber?

136
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,622
I was just bringing Her Majesty
her orange juice.

137
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:19,832
But why you? Where is her usual servant?

138
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:25,171
He... He lies ill on the... kitchen floor with
the pox. A terrible pox all over his socks.

139
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:30,134
Get thee hence, fool.
- Yes, I'm getting hence. Immediately. I...

140
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:33,549
D'you like the way I fooled these guys?

141
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,028
Fool, what dost thou in my chamber?

142
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:53,992
Madam, I fell by for perchance you might
like a drink - a nice, soothing potion.

143
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:56,661
Aye, well, I do confess a thirst.
Bringst to me.

144
00:10:56,761 --> 00:11:00,665
Yes. Wouldst grab some of this potion
before the fizz goes out.

145
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,585
Isn't it wonderful? Mm.
- It bubbleth greatly.

146
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,725
Wolf some down, my lady.

147
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,589
Cheerst.

148
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,728
And Roebuck.

149
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,254
It go down bubblest, but it's fine.

150
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,573
Takest away.

151
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,274
Well, I have to go back now to the dungeon.

152
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:30,029
There's a...
To get a deposit on the goblet.

153
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,155
Wait.

154
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,255
Fool, come here.

155
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,454
I have o'er me this extraordinary warmth
that is flowing through my veins...

156
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:44,959
...that makes me wisht - nay, longst - thou
should run amok over my entire body.

157
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,087
Make love to me now.
Ravage me and take me now. Take me.

158
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:51,883
It will be my pleasure.
- Take me to the bed. Make love to me.

159
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:55,094
Yes. To the... To the bed.
- Lead me there, fool.

160
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:57,805
Yes, I am.
- How this passion groweth within me.

161
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,600
Right. Come quickly.
- I cannot walk fast, fool.

162
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,561
(queen) The passion is so great.
- Right. To the bed.

163
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,521
Aye. Haste to the bed.

164
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,661
Right, over here.

165
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,484
Here.

166
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:14,239
The potion will be under the pillow. If you
lose your hots, we can refurbish them.

167
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,407
Aye. Comest o'er.
- Oh, yes.

168
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:20,203
Run thy hands upon my body.
- I shall. I shall reline your brakes.

169
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,342
Aye. Mmm. Oh, God.

170
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:26,084
Nay, I needst the feel
of naked flesh against flesh.

171
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:30,129
I'm all out of naked flesh.
But will the velvet do?

172
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,674
Kiss me quick.
- Yes. Where is your quick?

173
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:37,109
Shh. Canst undress me now?
- I'm kissing my own arm.

174
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:41,307
Yes. Up quickly
and I will remove the royal dress.

175
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:42,809
(panting)

176
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,234
Oh, God... Mmm. Oh, God.

177
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,287
Takest off. Pullst not upon me so.

178
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,570
On thy feet, fool. This is
not mockery. This is not games.

179
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,709
Ah. Oh, God...

180
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,994
At la. What... What's this?.

181
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,620
Heavy underwear.

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,541
'Tis the chastity belt that
the jealous king hath fastened on me...

183
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,003
...that no man but him shallst
havest the goodst of the body.

184
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,964
That's a bad break for
all of us here at the palace.

185
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:15,133
Yes... Yes... Wait. Wait here.

186
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,272
L-I... I will go.

187
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:23,099
Here, now, with most grievous dispatch,
I will open the latch...

188
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,324
...and get to her snatch.

189
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,438
Quickly.
- Aye.

190
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,577
All right, hold that.

191
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:32,775
This key is too big for that lock.

192
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,164
(key drops to floor)...

193
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,126
Um...
- Agh.

194
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,295
J-J-Just move back.

195
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,660
(clang)

196
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,883
Sorry about that.

197
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,001
I must think quickly.

198
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:56,391
Before you know it, the Renaissance
will be here and we'll all be painting.

199
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,595
Her Majesty wishes to borrow this.

200
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:04,891
She has some food stuck between
her teeth and I need to pull it out.

201
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,564
Forgive me...
- Argh.

202
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,741
Whoops.

203
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:15,902
Ah.

204
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,041
Ugh.

205
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,864
No. Agh.

206
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:23,279
This is what they call beaver shooting.

207
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,514
I wouldst pick this lock.

208
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,597
There.
- Agh. We did it. It's done.

209
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,177
Yes.
- And now I am yours.

210
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:44,931
At last, the portals of ecstasy.
You have got portals of ecstasy?

211
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:49,143
Be prepared. His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging.

212
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:52,897
Be prepared. His Majesty has this day
been awakened by a loud banging.

213
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:56,276
He will cleave thee in twain.
- Yes. Cleave me in twain.

214
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:59,320
Twain over here and twain
on the other side of the room.

215
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,460
Onst chopping block.

216
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,658
Yes. I do not look good in twain.

217
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:08,079
My suits are made for a whole person.
- I shall not have this passion fulfilled.

218
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:13,626
Well, quickly, lock up the... the thing
that you have there. Lock the royal box.

219
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,545
Quickly. Quickly. Before...

220
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:19,144
Help me. Help me.
- I'mst helping, but...

221
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,313
Aye, 'tis done.

222
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:24,095
'Tis locked solid. More solid than any...

223
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,015
M-My hand.'Tis caught in the chastity belt.

224
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,809
I always get my hand
in the cookie jar, so to speak.

225
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,061
The king approaches. What canst we do?

226
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,161
The king?.
- Aye.

227
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:36,983
Quickly.

228
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,378
Into the dress immediately.

229
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:43,254
My queen. Where is my queen?

230
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,992
Very casual. As though
nothing had happened.

231
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,619
Queen.

232
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,287
Oh, my queen.

233
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,915
A most dreadful pounding did awaken me.

234
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,506
Making my mood most foul.

235
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,961
Oh... My lord didst startle me.

236
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:01,257
Aye, my lord. Be a good king, wouldst
thou, and go and get me a drink of water?

237
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:05,220
The fool hath made the most
jestfully quipping in thine absence.

238
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,473
Aye, my lord. Tickling
the royal funny bone, so to speak.

239
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:11,476
Because, you see,
'tis most Ionely when thou nappest.

240
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,645
Aye, my lord. For me, too.

241
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,821
I still don't...

242
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,995
...think he's funny.

243
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,610
I got some new ones for you, my lord.

244
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,031
What's black and white, black and white,
black and white and black and white?

245
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:27,200
A nun falling down the stairs.

246
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,339
(nervous giggle)

247
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:31,508
Come give me a kiss.

248
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:33,957
Of course. Stick out your tongue.
- Not you.

249
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,096
Now begone.

250
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,633
That damn fool.
- No.

251
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,085
I... I will accompany thee to the door.

252
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,426
At last.

253
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,852
At last, we are alone.

254
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,359
Aye, my lord.
- Come to me.

255
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,559
My lord, I wouldst...
- Mmm. Mmm.

256
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:55,209
Nay. Kiss me not.
- To the bed.

257
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:58,648
I will soon find that key. Where is't?

258
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,784
Ah. Here it is.

259
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:25,187
Ha-ha-ha. Tickles.

260
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,817
Oh.

261
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:35,602
Aye, my lord.

262
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:41,737
Remember you said that if I was ever
in town I should look up your wife?

263
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:49,699
I don't know what everybody's getting so
upset for. I never humped her, you know.

264
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,984
Just... Just clean up my neck a little
and leave the top full.

265
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,960
Your case.

266
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,086
So...

267
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,171
Give me a good 'ah'.
- Ah.

268
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,506
Ah.

269
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:48,967
...down this side of my arm,
mostly at night.

270
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,929
I don't notice it as much in the daytime,
but at night it bothers me.

271
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,932
I don't want to hurt you,
but how far up can you raise it?

272
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:59,517
Mr Milos, would you come with me, please?

273
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:07,735
Come in, Mr Milos. Come in.
Sit down right over here.

274
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:11,660
I just want to get some history on you first.

275
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:14,546
So...

276
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,546
Your name is?
- Stavros Milos.

277
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,974
And your address?
- Armenia.

278
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,792
Armenia?
- I am from Armenia.

279
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,044
I am visiting my brother.
- I see.

280
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,184
Um... occupation?

281
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,882
Shepherd.

282
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:31,050
A shepherd?
- My whole family.

283
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,429
Except for my brother over here,
who is a rug salesman.

284
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,471
Mm-hm.

285
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:38,516
Have you had any major illnesses?
- No.

286
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,656
None. Good.

287
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,937
So...

288
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,690
Now... what seems to be the trouble?

289
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,615
I'm in love with a sheep.
- I beg your pardon?

290
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,124
I am in love with a sheep.

291
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:18,193
Oh... I see.

292
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:22,518
You see, doctor, up there in
the mountains where I tend my flocks...

293
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:25,230
...it's so beautiful under the starry skies.

294
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,358
And I am alone.
And sometimes it gets so Ionely.

295
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,497
And the hours pass.

296
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,836
And soon I desire a woman.

297
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,906
But, doctor, there are no women.

298
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,045
I am not married and...

299
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,520
Well... one night last summer...

300
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,706
...I could stand it no longer.

301
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:46,441
My body needed to be satisfied.

302
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:49,183
And then... I saw her.

303
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,089
Her?

304
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:53,680
Daisy.
- Sheep?

305
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:56,876
I took Daisy off to a little cove...

306
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:02,253
...and there, under the Armenian sky,
had sexual intercourse.

307
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,479
With the sheep?

308
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,579
Naturally.

309
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:15,124
Ohhh... God.

310
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:18,837
It was the greatest lay I ever had.

311
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,633
Mr Milos...

312
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:25,874
Forgive me if I... seemed at all shocked.

313
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,417
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:30,879
Doctor, Mrs Gallbladder's
on the phone about her rupture.

315
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,018
Later. Later...

316
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,674
Uh...

317
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,814
Mr Milos...

318
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:40,138
Of course, I'm happy for the two of you.

319
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,806
But, um...

320
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:43,975
...I do have other patients.

321
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:46,144
And unless there's some...

322
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,367
...specific way...

323
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,565
...that I could help you...

324
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,640
Doctor. Doctor, please. One minute.

325
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,833
See, the point is...

326
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,615
...she no longer loves me.

327
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:00,754
That's why I'm here.

328
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:03,620
Because she's fallen out of love with me.

329
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,759
How can you tell that?

330
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,928
Oh... little things.

331
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,092
She's cold. Indifferent.

332
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:14,882
Mm-hm?
- Speak to her. She'll listen to you.

333
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,633
Mr Milos...

334
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:18,772
You are...

335
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,901
...crazy.

336
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,972
I brought her all the way from Armenia.

337
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:26,434
My brother says you are a great doctor.
You saved his life once.

338
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:30,271
You need a psychiatrist.
I am a medical doctor.

339
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:32,411
Speak to her. Please?

340
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,528
I can't talk to a sheep. Are you nuts?
- She's outside in my brother's truck.

341
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,114
Would you get out of my office, please.

342
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:42,575
I'm an MD. I'm not a veterinarian.

343
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,703
I bring her in.
- Don't bring any sheep in this office.

344
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:50,208
My mother just got finished paying for it.
- I know no great men of wisdom.

345
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:52,335
My brother says you are a great man.

346
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:54,837
I'm not. I'm just an ordinary GP.

347
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:56,464
That's all I am.
- I'll get her.

348
00:22:56,564 --> 00:23:00,385
No. Mr Milos. You don't understand.
It's not normal...

349
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:04,097
...to experience mature love
for anything with four legs.

350
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:06,197
Wait till you meet her.

351
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,238
I don't believe this.

352
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:22,115
Doctor, the prescription you gave me...
- I can't.

353
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:26,494
I'm sorry. I can't. Would you sit down?.
Would you sit down, Mrs...

354
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:29,229
I'll talk to you...
- (bleating)

355
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,511
Doctor Ross, this is Daisy.

356
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,461
Oh... Good.

357
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:39,726
Um... Why don't you
take her right into my office?

358
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,720
You'll have to excuse me. His sheep has...

359
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,859
...a... a strep throat.

360
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,479
Mr Milos, I'm gonna have to call the police.

361
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:58,067
Can we talk for a minute? Mr Milos,
don't put that sheep on my desk. Please.

362
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,612
You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't do that.

363
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:03,865
Isn't Daisy beautiful?
- Yes, she is beautiful.

364
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:09,078
Mr Milos... You're a very nice man. I don't
want to see you get into any trouble.

365
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:12,918
What I don't think you understand is that...

366
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:15,430
...you have...

367
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,129
...a, uh... psychiatric problem.

368
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,694
You really need to see, uh...

369
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:25,136
...someone in the...
in the, um... psychiatry field.

370
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:27,276
I'm a medical doctor.

371
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,112
Um...

372
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,449
...(bleats)

373
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:43,529
I know you didn't, uh... mean any harm...
bringing this sheep in here, but...

374
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,669
...(bleats)...

375
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,867
...I have patients, you know.

376
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:50,007
Kidney problems and...

377
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:54,011
...heart problems and...

378
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,370
Seeing a sheep just like that, it's...

379
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:03,145
Hello, Daisy.

380
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,314
(bleats)
- She's so...

381
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:08,400
...wonderful.

382
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,569
I'm, uh...

383
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,738
I'm Dr Ross.

384
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,699
Doug Ross.

385
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,831
She's...

386
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,381
Um...

387
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,511
Mr Milos...

388
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,636
I, uh...

389
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:38,960
I'd like to see the two of you again, but...

390
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,672
...right now, you know,
my office is jammed full.

391
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,841
Oh, I knew you could help.

392
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,980
Thank you, doctor.

393
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,178
As a matter of fact, uh...

394
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:51,890
...if I could see Daisy alone...

395
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,030
...maybe, you know, I...

396
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,198
Anything. Anything.

397
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:06,237
Darling, what's the matter?

398
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:08,377
Nothing.

399
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:11,566
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

400
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,989
Why don't you turn in early, then? Hm?

401
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,518
What are you doing?

402
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:28,426
Oh, just nothing.

403
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:32,436
No, you were fondling
your lamb's-wool sweater.

404
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,227
I was not fondling my lamb's-wool sweater.

405
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:40,146
What would I do something like that for?

406
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:42,286
Well, God knows.

407
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:50,657
Doctor.

408
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:53,307
Mr Milos brought in his sheep.

409
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:55,465
She's here?

410
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:02,055
All right, show her in.

411
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,696
(gargles)

412
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:25,260
Thank you. You can... you can go.

413
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,301
Hi...

414
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:42,012
...darling.

415
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,383
I know this must all seem
very strange to you.

416
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:51,384
You from the hills of Armenia
and me from Jackson Heights.

417
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:53,524
And yet...

418
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:55,778
...I think it could work.

419
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,443
If we gave it a chance.

420
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,916
A room, please.

421
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,131
Oh. Thank you very much.

422
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,299
Wait a second.

423
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,635
There you are.

424
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:28,880
Oh, uh... do you want
the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door?

425
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,049
Oh... th-that's all right. I...

426
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,967
Uh... all right. Yes.

427
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,067
Thank you very much.

428
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:44,570
Uh... Room service,
this is Dr Ross in room 525.

429
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:49,067
I would like to have
some chilled white Burgundy...

430
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,312
...a little caviar... and some grass.

431
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,415
Oh, just... plain, green grass.

432
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,841
That's 525.

433
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,010
Thank you.

434
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,310
Daisy.

435
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,937
Little Daisy.

436
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:15,693
Let's be gentle.
- (bleats)

437
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:23,893
I'm, uh...

438
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:25,770
I can't...

439
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,910
I'm exhausted. Just...

440
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,042
...(sniffs)

441
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,714
Boy.

442
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,053
That was really something.

443
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:47,994
I never thought it could be like this.

444
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:50,378
Never in my wildest imagination.

445
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,518
(bleats)

446
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:56,159
You're really something special.

447
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,859
I love our L-shaped room.

448
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:04,188
I'll never forget these afternoons we've had.

449
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,316
I don't think I've ever known
such peace and happiness in my life.

450
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,484
I hope you feel the same way.

451
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,584
(bleats)

452
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:32,170
Sorry. I'm sorry, honey.
I was out when you phoned.

453
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,339
Mm.
- Emergency house call.

454
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:37,159
Mm. You smell good.
- (sniffs)...

455
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,734
Darling?
- Hm?

456
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:44,557
Is it my imagination, or do you
always smell from lamb chops?

457
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:49,062
Lamb chops? What kind of silly thing
is that to say about lamb chops?

458
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:53,107
How could I possibly smell
of lamb chops? That's not logical.

459
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:56,182
What... kind of cheap suit is this?

460
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,714
That's it with these suits.

461
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
(door bursts open)

462
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:16,631
Ann. Wait a minute, I can explain.
We're just friends.

463
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:19,842
How could you?.
- This is Mrs Bencourse.

464
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:21,982
One of my patients.

465
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:24,236
She thinks she's a sheep.

466
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,400
That's all. There's nothing to it.

467
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:31,938
(man)... defendant did commit
an adulterous act with a sheep.

468
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,776
It's most distasteful in view of the fact
that the sheep was under 18 years old.

469
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,736
So what?

470
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:42,699
So Ann's left me. So she's taken
all my money, all my savings.

471
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,179
My licence has been revoked.

472
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:48,091
But I don't care.

473
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,260
If you're willing...

474
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,430
...we'll get by somehow.

475
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,193
I'll get a job. I don't know...

476
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:04,406
We've been here for an hour.

477
00:32:07,365 --> 00:32:09,404
That's what I ordered.

478
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:14,039
Waiter, I ordered two sauerkraut.
I didn't order cake.

479
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:18,067
Waiter.
- Don't call me waiter.

480
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:21,487
I'm a doctor. You understand that?
I'm not a waiter.

481
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:25,752
I am a doctor. Don't call me waiter.
I'm a doctor.

482
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:28,926
Ah. Say 'ah'.

483
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:33,278
Come here. Spread your legs apart.

484
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,461
Couldn't you at least
not have eaten this morning?.

485
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:40,896
Isn't that...
What kind of a mess is that in there?.

486
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:46,275
Daisy?

487
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:50,725
Daisy?

488
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,865
Honey?

489
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:59,067
'I have finally saved up enough money...

490
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:03,238
...to come back to America
and take my Daisy home.'

491
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:08,785
'You did a terrible thing to me, but now
I've taken Daisy to the mountains again...

492
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,775
...where you will never find her.'

493
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:15,387
'Stavros Milos.'

494
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:19,475
(sobs)

495
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:40,954
I have waited so long for this moment.

496
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:48,228
Fabrizio, my darling,
go easy on my hymen.

497
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:51,713
Gina, your body to me is a cathedral.

498
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:54,188
Now take off your pants.

499
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,284
Didn't you like it?

500
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,623
Yes.

501
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:08,742
It didn't look like you were
having fun to me.

502
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,087
Yes. You were wonderful.

503
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:19,473
But you just lay there - passive - like a lox.

504
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:24,582
It was my first time - did you like it?

505
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:29,302
Me? Are you kidding?
More fun than laughing.

506
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:37,148
Maybe next time I'll be more relaxed.

507
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:41,617
Sì.

508
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:44,983
(camera shutter clicking)

509
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,122
Brava. Bravissima.

510
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:52,162
Marcello, do you know anything
about frigidity?

511
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,201
It's all in the foreplay.

512
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:57,912
A woman needs to be played with
before you lay her.

513
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,539
How long?

514
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,292
Fifteen minutes, half hour -
depends on the woman.

515
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:03,501
What about your wife?

516
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,601
Thirty seconds.

517
00:36:06,604 --> 00:36:08,604
Lucky.

518
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:12,576
Don't tell me Gina's a problem.

519
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,945
Er... no... it's not that.

520
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,195
Do you fondle her before putting it in?

521
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:22,613
Put what in? Oh.

522
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:27,400
I don't like to talk about Gina
like she's a whore.

523
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,777
How long have you been married now?

524
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,877
Six weeks.

525
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:37,091
Play with her. Fondle her.

526
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:42,953
It's always the man's fault.
Any woman can be made to feel ecstasy.

527
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:46,094
Last week, in the middle of... of...

528
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:49,729
She was watching television.

529
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:52,871
You must be doing something wrong.

530
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:57,362
Some women take longer.

531
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,109
Find her erogenous zones.

532
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:08,905
Her father gave me a map
of them, and still...

533
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:18,201
Okay, turn over.

534
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,077
Huh?

535
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:24,930
Over. I want to do a quick check
on some parts I missed.

536
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:27,097
Ah...
- Sì.

537
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,212
Sì...

538
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:30,672
Foreplay...

539
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:31,923
Mmm.

540
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:34,692
Foreplay...

541
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,822
Eccitare...

542
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,367
Eccitare...

543
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:51,205
Eccitare...

544
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,999
...(snores)

545
00:37:56,798 --> 00:38:01,077
Fabrizio, there is nothing
the church can do for you.

546
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:05,665
If I could, I would be glad to try
and make your wife come...

547
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,000
...but that is impossible.

548
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,075
At least you get pleasure from her.

549
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:13,626
Maybe someday she will get it from you.

550
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:52,961
And here will be my new offices.
A hundred people will work under me.

551
00:38:53,271 --> 00:39:00,187
Yes... Yes, but tell me about
your sex life... your wife.

552
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:07,483
She moans and screams
and claws my back.

553
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:11,109
She comes six, seven times.

554
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:14,415
She's like a wolf in heat.

555
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:20,042
Mine lays there and stares
at the ceiling. Like a dead one.

556
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,418
Are you... small?

557
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:29,215
Small? Like a French bread. Small...

558
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,819
Okay, okay... then I don't know.

559
00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:44,195
You're depressed still.

560
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:46,238
No.

561
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
I'm okay.

562
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:51,282
(Gina sighs)

563
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:54,047
You're still thinking about it.

564
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,986
Because I love you...
because you're so beautiful...

565
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,405
...and I want you to love me loving you.

566
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:02,505
Please...

567
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,511
...(Gina moans)

568
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:20,675
What are you doing?

569
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:23,348
Take me. Do it to me.

570
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:25,388
Here?.

571
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,488
Yes... yes...

572
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:36,898
There's people all around.
- I don't care.

573
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:41,905
We could get caught.

574
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:45,124
I know... I know... Do it...

575
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:49,677
Do it.

576
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,252
Oh, my God. Now she wants it.

577
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:26,048
Life plays strange tricks on me.

578
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:30,506
She comes - like an express train.

579
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:34,963
The next night in bed she lays there...

580
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:42,929
It's the danger, my friend.
The fear of being caught.

581
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:48,194
The sinful, mischievous, naughty,
tempting of fate...

582
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,239
That's what she needs.

583
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,909
Mark my words.

584
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:00,900
No question.

585
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,787
She is weird-city.

586
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:18,597
Did anyone see Fabrizio?

587
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,605
Listen carefully to what I say.
You'll get caught.

588
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,200
It's dangerous. Don't do it.

589
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:35,486
We were nearly caught last week.

590
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:38,354
At the church. In the confessional.

591
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:41,539
I still have a charlie-horse.

592
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,915
(exasperated sigh)

593
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:47,509
Stop it before it's too late.

594
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
(screams)...

595
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,612
...(woman screams)

596
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,325
Ma che sta facendo?

597
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:26,584
Ma questa è una cosa da pazzi.

598
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,832
Are you angry with me?

599
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:37,086
I love you. At least we know
you're not frigid.

600
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:42,052
As long as we do it in public.

601
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:45,469
You'll get used to it.

602
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,216
I'll try.

603
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:53,144
I knew we'd work things out.

604
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,365
(banging)...

605
00:44:37,615 --> 00:44:41,352
...(man) Do we have to get there that early?
Where is it written that we do?

606
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:44,564
Oh, Sam. It's Julie's fiancé's parents.
You wanna be late?

607
00:44:44,664 --> 00:44:46,524
Listen, Tess.
- Mm?

608
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:50,904
I haven't been feeling well lately.
- Oh, come on. It's just psychosomatic.

609
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,531
A tension headache by you
is psychosomatic.

610
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,326
All of a sudden
you've become a psychiatrist?

611
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:59,996
Stop complaining. It's Alvin's parents,
so it's an obligation.

612
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:03,666
An obligation.
- I don't like them any more than you do.

613
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:06,794
Or should I say it's them that
look down their noses at us?

614
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:10,173
I heard that. I think
you're both a little paranoid.

615
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:15,883
Alvin's parents are lovely people.
They like both of you very much.

616
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:23,978
That's what I call a lawn. Nice, clipped.
Not like my house - overgrown.

617
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:26,689
Did you hear George and I...
- Who's your gardener?

618
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,858
Me. Me.
- You're the gardener?

619
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,486
Of course.
- Sam, did you see the roses?

620
00:45:31,586 --> 00:45:33,947
I thought that...
- Oh, please pick...

621
00:45:34,047 --> 00:45:36,427
...(romantic piano music)...

622
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,056
Can you give me the recipe?
- You didn't make this yourself?

623
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:03,101
Excuse me.
- (Tess) Where are you going, Sam?

624
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:07,230
To the bathroom.
- (George) Upstairs, first door to the left.

625
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,330
(woman) Well...

626
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:29,294
Yes. We prefer Bermuda
to Puerto Rico, let's say.

627
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:31,394
It's much nicer.

628
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:36,941
Mm.

629
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:41,389
Of course, I like... I enjoy wearing
a formal gown once in a while...

630
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,558
...but when I'm on vacation...

631
00:46:43,658 --> 00:46:46,477
...I like to relax and wear slacks...

632
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:48,646
...or little skirts and blouses.

633
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:50,746
And sweet little hats.

634
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:54,235
We, um... Your husband and I
had quite a talk.

635
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:58,330
He's a very, um... gentle man.
Very interesting.

636
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,582
I'd love to. I've never seen wood carvings.

637
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:11,836
Well, I mean African heads,
and we picked them up in, uh...

638
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:13,671
...(George) Bimini.
- Bimini.

639
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:17,383
We got them for a steal. You won't
believe the price we paid for them.

640
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:20,845
You want wood carvings?
I'll show you wood carvings. Tell her.

641
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:24,940
You simply must see these.
They're absolutely...

642
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,504
...(George coughs)...

643
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:54,766
George.
- Yes, dear?

644
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:57,340
They're on the top shelf in the closet.

645
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,729
The closet or the bureau?

646
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:01,899
Top shelf in the closet.

647
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:04,067
Top shelf? Right.

648
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:11,325
(humming)

649
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,175
You know, Bimini is a free port
and we got a marvellous buy on them.

650
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:49,017
From Bimini. The Bahamas?
- Oh?

651
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:51,185
Beautiful, hm?
- Uh... yes.

652
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:53,271
Look at that detail.
- They're...

653
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:55,398
I'd like your husband to see these.

654
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:57,498
Thief. Purse-snatcher.

655
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,752
Thief. Help. Help. Get him.

656
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:12,582
(high-pitched voice) Let it go. Don't call
the police. Oh, my God. The police.

657
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:16,711
You know, I'm wondering, uh...
what could be taking Sam so long?

658
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:20,423
Would you excuse me for a second?
- Certainly.

659
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:25,094
Are you all right, lady?
- It's just another crime in the street thing.

660
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:28,890
It's... an everyday happening.
It just happened to me. It's...

661
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,477
You're really lucky.
- Lucky?. Well, I don't know...

662
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:35,980
Oh. I coulda been dead.
- Right. You're absolutely right.

663
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,651
Did you have any valuables in it?
- No, I don't think so.

664
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:42,320
You're probably wondering why...
- Yes.

665
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,741
I got a cold. It's dripping.
I don't feel good altogether, you know...

666
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:50,537
Oh, these young people today.
- What can you do? What can you do?

667
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:54,916
It's the society we're living in.
What I... But don't make a fuss.

668
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:58,331
(knocks) Sam, what did you do? Fall in?

669
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:05,343
Are you sure you're all right?

670
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:07,720
Officer, there was a bag stolen.
He got away.

671
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,848
All right. Who's the lady
whose purse was snatched?

672
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:14,686
It's perfectly OK, officer.
I forgive the little rascal.

673
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:17,230
I'm sorry, but I'll have to fill out a report.

674
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,358
I don't wanna press charges.
Really, you silly...

675
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,498
...(siren)...

676
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:31,327
What's all the excitement about?
- There's a crowd. And police.

677
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:33,496
Police?
- (Julie) Exciting.

678
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:38,084
You got me, too. I follow fire engines.
- (Julie) Let's look.

679
00:50:38,184 --> 00:50:40,224
Do you need some money?

680
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:43,798
(woman) I don't need any money.
It was her purse that was stolen.

681
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:46,448
Somebody oughta give her some.

682
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,903
Name?
- Uh... name? I...

683
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:51,264
Jasmine.

684
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:53,364
Jasmine Glit.

685
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:57,353
Oh, that's a very unusual name.
- Oh, you're sweet.

686
00:50:57,453 --> 00:51:01,441
What seems to be the trouble, officer?
- It's just a purse-snatching.

687
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,234
Purse...

688
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:06,029
Oh. L-I'm sorry, lady.
I'm very sorry for you.

689
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,197
If I lose my baby, I...
- Baby?

690
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:09,699
Yes.
- Come in and lie down.

691
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:12,160
I'm three months pregnant.
- I'm sorry.

692
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,000
My gynaecologist told me
to avoid excitement.

693
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,335
Please come inside and let me...
- Nah...

694
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:21,836
...(woman screams)

695
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:25,020
My God. She's my husband.

696
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,187
Sam... Sam Le...

697
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,356
Yes. Sam Letterman.

698
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,846
I'm a man. I'm a man. Here. See?

699
00:51:31,946 --> 00:51:33,806
Pull. Pull. Look.

700
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:35,946
Sylvia. Zip me down.

701
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:37,894
(Sam) Look at this.

702
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,034
Look at this. Look. Huh?

703
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,202
Huh?. Look at this.

704
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,485
(outraged screams)
- Help me get this stuff off.

705
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:47,957
Here. Take a look at that.

706
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:51,074
(Tess) Sam, you should have
told me, that's all.

707
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,214
I would have understood.

708
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,663
It's not the kind of thing
that's easy to talk about.

709
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:59,823
Sam... we've been married for years.

710
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,591
I love you. You love me.

711
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:06,047
You could have come to me and said...

712
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:09,563
...'Tess... I have a diseased mind.'

713
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:12,566
'I'm a sick individual.'

714
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,735
'I need help.'

715
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:17,754
'I need treatment. I'm perverted.'

716
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:22,618
'I'm unfit to function
with normal, decent people.'

717
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:24,954
I would have understood.

718
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,122
Thank you. Tess?

719
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:31,239
I'm going to see Dr Fillmore next week.
- I'm glad.

720
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:33,378
You're wonderful.

721
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:42,125
The look on their faces
when the police removed your hat.

722
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,225
Ha-ha.

723
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,388
Brought to you by Lancer,
the hair conditioner for men.

724
00:52:55,488 --> 00:52:58,308
Are you still using
that same old stuff on your hair?

725
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,059
Yeah. Why?

726
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:02,199
Try this.

727
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,664
Lancer. Really?
- Go ahead.

728
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:11,237
Hey, this is great. No grease or oil.

729
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,865
Right. Grooms and conditions
at the same time.

730
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:16,004
Smells great, too.

731
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:21,218
Lancer. The conditioner
that grooms and conditions.

732
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:25,013
Good.

733
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:30,840
Lancer - for that better-groomed look.

734
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,575
A product of K Pharmaceuticals.

735
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:42,560
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

736
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,521
Welcome once again
to What's My Perversion?

737
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:47,732
Panel members, you look splendid.

738
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:52,195
Pamela and Toni, so beautiful.
And Regis and Robert Q, so handsome.

739
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,489
And, panel members, we have...

740
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:58,534
...some very interesting guests
this evening. Let's get right to them.

741
00:53:58,634 --> 00:53:59,827
So...

742
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:03,157
First guest, will you sign in, please?

743
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,685
(Jack) Bernard...

744
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,521
...Jaffe.
- (applause)

745
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:20,098
Mr Jaffe, would you sit down, sir?

746
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:23,726
A pleasure to have you with us,
here on What's My Perversion?

747
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:26,354
You know the rules of our game.
- Yes, I do.

748
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:29,649
You get $5 every time the panel
comes up with a 'no' answer.

749
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:31,818
To start our game going...

750
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:34,946
...would you whisper in my ear
what your perversion is?

751
00:54:35,046 --> 00:54:38,783
While you do that, we will let the studio
and the home audience know...

752
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,858
...exactly what your perversion is.

753
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:48,001
Good. All right, panel members.

754
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:51,754
The studio and the home audience
know what his perversion is.

755
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:54,674
We'll start with Robert Q Lewis.
- Thank you, Jack.

756
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,635
Mr Jaffe, is this one of
those nice perversions...

757
00:54:57,735 --> 00:54:59,888
...that any guy might indulge in?

758
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:02,056
(Jaffe) Anybody can do it.

759
00:55:02,156 --> 00:55:05,184
I'm sure you could.
It's just a matter of wanting to.

760
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:08,021
I see. Thank you. Is this
one of the perversions...

761
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:11,232
...that might best be...
performed in the home...

762
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:14,611
...or could you just do it anywhere?
- (Jack) Not necessarily.

763
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,906
I think that will get a 'no' answer.
And $5 to you, Mr Jaffe.

764
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:21,534
And we turn the questioning
over to Pamela Mason. Pamela?

765
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,787
Is it something that is, uh...
done with the hands?

766
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:26,956
Do you want to help me on that?
- Yes.

767
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:31,294
I would think that would not necessarily
have to play a part in the procedure.

768
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:35,006
And we give you a 'no' answer on that.
That's $10 for you, Mr Jaffe.

769
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,175
And Regis Philbin is up next.

770
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:39,552
When you're doing your perversion...

771
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,639
...do you have any need for... for props?

772
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,057
Props?

773
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:46,351
You know, uh... whips or leather boots?

774
00:55:46,451 --> 00:55:49,771
Oh, no.
- No, no. That's definitely not necessary.

775
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:53,691
$15, Regis Philbin. And now Toni Holt.
- Mr Jaffe...

776
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:58,988
...would a telescope or a pair of binoculars
be helpful to you at any time?

777
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:02,575
It would have to be...
pointed in the right direction.

778
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:06,287
(audience laughter)
- I would have to interject to say that...

779
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:09,499
...it would not be helpful to you,
but to somebody else.

780
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,753
In that respect, I think we must give you
a 'no' answer, Toni. Robert Q Lewis.

781
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:16,005
Are you... I'll take a wild guess.

782
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,643
Are you... a rapist?

783
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,719
Hardly.
- No. No, not at all.

784
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:24,904
$25. And... Pamela Mason.

785
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,601
I'll pass to Regis.
- Is it self-contained?

786
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:32,564
(Jaffe) Yes. I carry it with me at all times.

787
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:37,277
(audience laughter)
- I'm gonna take a guess. I think I have it.

788
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,416
Do you molest children?

789
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:41,864
(Jack) No, you're all on the wrong track.

790
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:45,868
Would you tell them what your perversion
is? You already have your $50.

791
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:49,080
Yes. L-I like to...
to expose myself on subways.

792
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,220
On subways.

793
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:53,555
(applause)

794
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,088
And now the winner of this week's contest.

795
00:56:57,188 --> 00:57:00,633
Each week, we give you at home
an opportunity to play our game.

796
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:04,262
We ask you to write and tell us
exactly what your perversion is.

797
00:57:04,362 --> 00:57:06,806
We select the most interesting letter...

798
00:57:06,906 --> 00:57:11,728
...and we give that contestant a chance
to act out his fantasy on the programme.

799
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:16,691
I present this week's winner. Ladies and
gentlemen and members of the panel...

800
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:21,237
...here from Muncie, Indiana
is our winner - Rabbi Chaim Baumel.

801
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,337
(applause)

802
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,288
Well, congratulations to you,
Chaim Baumel.

803
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:32,427
Uh, excuse me.

804
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:35,585
It's not Chaim. It's not Caim. ...

805
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,721
It's pronounced Chiam.
- Chiam.

806
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,966
Chiam. Very good. I understand,
in addition to being...

807
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:46,346
...a very distinguished clergyman,
you have a very fascinating fetish.

808
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:49,815
Yes... You mean a hang-up.
- Yes.

809
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,392
Yes.

810
00:57:51,492 --> 00:57:53,532
Silk stockings.

811
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:56,272
Silk stockings?
- I love silk stockings.

812
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,650
To touch 'em... To hug them...

813
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,750
To... To...

814
00:58:00,835 --> 00:58:04,072
Now, you wrote in your letter
that what you'd like is to be...

815
00:58:04,172 --> 00:58:06,211
...tied up.

816
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:10,286
For this we need the help of
one of the members of the panel. Uh...

817
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,414
Someone to tie him up.
Regis Philbin, would you?

818
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:15,554
Excuse me.

819
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:17,723
Must be a girl.
- A girl.

820
00:58:17,852 --> 00:58:21,047
Well, we certainly have
two lovely girls. Pamela...

821
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:24,676
...will you do the honours and tie him up?
- Love to.

822
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:26,815
(Jack) Rabbi.

823
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,184
Now, Pamela is going to tie Rabbi Baumel...

824
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:36,771
...according to the wishes
as expressed in his letter.

825
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:41,276
I haven't had a lot of experience, Rabbi,
but... I think I can manage.

826
00:58:41,376 --> 00:58:44,862
If you have any special instructions,
please let me know.

827
00:58:44,962 --> 00:58:48,449
Is there any special area
that you'd like to have tied?

828
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:50,618
Not too tight. (chuckles)...

829
00:58:50,718 --> 00:58:52,537
There.
- Good.

830
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:56,040
(Jack) And now a model from
the Lucy Jones Modelling Agency...

831
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,044
...is going to pretend that
she is Rabbi Baumel's governess...

832
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:03,459
...and she is going to spank the rabbi.

833
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:07,302
You've been a naughty rabbi.

834
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:11,347
(Jack) While at the same time...
- I have to be in the synagogue tomorrow.

835
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,810
...Mrs Baumel, the rabbi's wife,
who we've flown in from Indiana...

836
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,062
...will sit at the rabbi's feet...

837
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:20,202
...and eat pork.

838
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,165
Take that. Naughty rabbi.

839
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:25,674
Now, don't you do that again.

840
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,418
(model) You're bad.

841
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,992
Naughty, naughty... (giggles)...

842
00:59:31,092 --> 00:59:36,456
...(Jack) Well, there it is, America. Another
lucky winner gets to act out his fantasy.

843
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:41,044
This is Jack Barry, saying goodbye
and good luck from me and the panel.

844
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:45,394
We'll see you next week on...
What's My Perversion?

845
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:48,484
(applause and cheering)...

846
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:24,431
Uh... Let me have 50¢ worth of regular.
- You bet.

847
01:00:32,987 --> 01:00:36,266
Excuse me. My car broke down
about two miles down the road.

848
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,977
Could you send somebody to get it?
- Sure, ma'am.

849
01:00:39,077 --> 01:00:40,728
Thank you.

850
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:43,064
Uh, how far is Dr Bernardo's house?

851
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:46,309
Uh... about seven miles.
- Oh, dammit.

852
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:48,373
Miss?
- Yes?

853
01:00:48,503 --> 01:00:51,239
You're going to Dr Bernardo's house?
- Uh-huh.

854
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:54,993
Would you like a lift? I'm going there.
- Oh... Gee, that'd be swell.

855
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:57,558
Yeah? Oh, well, come on.
- OK.

856
01:01:00,515 --> 01:01:02,667
Are you a friend of Dr Bernardo's?

857
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:07,505
Not exactly. I'm gonna be working
with him, helping with his experiments.

858
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:10,258
Are you studying sexual phenomena, too?

859
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:13,469
Yes. I, uh... was a biology major in school.

860
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:18,641
I'm really looking forward to working with
the doctor. He's a great hero of mine.

861
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:23,646
He was the first man to ever measure the
sound waves produced by an erection.

862
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,416
Yes, I know.
- Do you?

863
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,693
Yes, I'm a reporter for The Globe.

864
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:33,323
I'm going to interview Dr Bernardo
for a story in our Sunday supplement.

865
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,463
A reporter, huh?
- Mm-hm.

866
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,660
You know, you're kinda cute.

867
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,121
Why don't you just watch the road, huh?

868
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:41,748
What's your name?

869
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:44,421
Helen Lacey. What's yours?

870
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,793
Victor.

871
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:47,933
Victor Shackelpopolous.

872
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:42,030
(mumbling)

873
01:02:44,077 --> 01:02:46,287
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here?

874
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:50,048
I think he wants us to come in.

875
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:56,231
The doctor is expecting us, so, uh...

876
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,799
Look at this place.

877
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:05,790
It's really great.
Is your decorator still living?

878
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,709
It's chilly.

879
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:09,961
Uh... So... So, what d'you think?

880
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:12,547
Is... Is Dr Bernardo here or... what?

881
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,686
I am Dr Bernardo.

882
01:03:18,152 --> 01:03:20,192
You must be Victor.

883
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:22,321
And Miss Lacey.

884
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,310
Igor.

885
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,813
I thought I told you to keep to your room.

886
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:30,953
(mumbling)

887
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,085
Forgive him.

888
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,283
He usually keeps to his room.

889
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,703
I know there's a big problem
with domestics nowadays.

890
01:03:43,803 --> 01:03:45,843
Come.

891
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:48,011
Shall we have dinner?

892
01:03:48,141 --> 01:03:50,180
(whispers) Yeah.

893
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,338
I understand you're famous
for your potato pancakes.

894
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:56,424
Dr Bernardo, you don't know
how excited I am to be here.

895
01:03:56,524 --> 01:03:58,593
I've waited so long to meet you.

896
01:03:58,693 --> 01:04:02,180
I'm really looking forward to
helping you with your experiments.

897
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,349
Have you read my latest book...

898
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:07,602
...Advanced Sexual Positions:
How To Achieve Them Without Laughing?

899
01:04:07,702 --> 01:04:09,771
It's getting to be a classic.

900
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:11,910
I'm familiar with it.

901
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,484
It's wonderful how you men of science...

902
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,611
...have finally gotten around to sex.

903
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:21,074
The girls at The Globe are so pleased with
your work on respiration during orgasm.

904
01:04:21,174 --> 01:04:23,451
A mere trifle compared to my real work.

905
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,870
Doctor, I read a statement you made.

906
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:30,291
You felt the average length
of a man's penis should be 19 inches.

907
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,111
Doesn't that seem a little long?

908
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:34,963
Long?.

909
01:04:35,063 --> 01:04:38,216
My friend, I'm making discoveries
you wouldn't dream of.

910
01:04:38,316 --> 01:04:41,886
Yes, I know. But... But 19 inches...
I mean, that's...

911
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,972
...(doctor) Does that sound mad?.

912
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:48,434
That's what they called me at
Masters' and Johnson's clinic. Mad.

913
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:51,229
Because I had visions of explorations...

914
01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:54,941
...in sexual areas undreamed of
by lesser human beings.

915
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:59,696
It was I who first discovered how to
make a man impotent by hiding his hat.

916
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:02,740
I was the first one
to explain the connection...

917
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,578
...between excessive masturbation
and entering politics.

918
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,746
It was I who first said...

919
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:11,875
...that clitoral orgasm
should not be only for women.

920
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:14,878
They laughed at me,
ridiculed me, said I was mad.

921
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:17,103
Ha-ha. But I showed them.

922
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:20,008
Ha-ha. They threw me out
of Masters' and Johnson's.

923
01:05:20,108 --> 01:05:22,176
No severance pay. And I had it coming.

924
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:24,996
But I showed them. (manic laugh)

925
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:29,863
Are we having dessert?

926
01:05:31,703 --> 01:05:35,273
Oh, come. I want to show you
my laboratory.

927
01:05:35,748 --> 01:05:37,788
Igor.

928
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:40,373
(mumbling)

929
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,697
Clean up this table, and hurry.

930
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,837
(mumbling)

931
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:48,465
You must forgive Igor.

932
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:51,915
He was part of an experiment
of mine that backfired.

933
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:56,252
Using an electrical generator,
I gave him a four-hour orgasm.

934
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,752
He had fun, but he turned out like this.

935
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,563
Well...

936
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:07,651
Posture. Posture.

937
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:16,189
Here it is. Here's where
I'm discovering new facts about sex.

938
01:06:16,289 --> 01:06:18,983
Facts that will make me
a great man one day.

939
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,123
(electricity buzzing)...

940
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:34,636
...(machines humming)

941
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:42,340
Dr Bernardo, what is all this?

942
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,109
Come this way and you'll see.

943
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:57,879
Here I'm studying premature ejaculation
in a hippopotamus.

944
01:06:57,997 --> 01:07:01,818
How often does that problem
come up with a hippo?

945
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:06,281
Here I'm forcing a man to have
intercourse with a large rye bread.

946
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:08,761
They're getting on famously.

947
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,579
Here... I'm going to take
the brain of a lesbian...

948
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:17,125
...and put it into the body of a man
who works for the telephone company.

949
01:07:17,225 --> 01:07:19,419
But why?
What good will this do anybody?

950
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:23,429
It'll show those fools
who called me mad. Come.

951
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:28,636
But, doctor, this is immoral.
- Nonsense.

952
01:07:28,736 --> 01:07:31,764
The human mind is capable
of many strange things. Look.

953
01:07:31,864 --> 01:07:35,268
Each day for the past year
I feed her nothing but silicone.

954
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,437
She used to be flat-chested.

955
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:40,512
Give me another year and watch out.

956
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:48,168
You're insane.

957
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,783
That's what they said
at Masters and Johnson.

958
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:54,453
And all because I built a 400ft diaphragm.

959
01:07:56,472 --> 01:08:00,127
Birth control for an entire nation at once.

960
01:08:02,562 --> 01:08:06,982
You. You will be the subject
of my newest experiment.

961
01:08:07,608 --> 01:08:11,392
Me?.
- Yes. Look here.

962
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,857
(moaning)
- In here I have 20 Scouts.

963
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:20,647
I want to measure your respiration
when they gangbang you.

964
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:23,831
No.
- (moaning)

965
01:08:28,046 --> 01:08:29,697
Get away from her.

966
01:08:29,797 --> 01:08:33,493
Why don't you let her relax and enjoy it?
- You shoot her...

967
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:35,578
...and I'll sue you for malpractice.

968
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,718
Igor.

969
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:43,044
Victor. Victor, do something.

970
01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:45,213
Helen, keep your legs crossed.

971
01:08:45,313 --> 01:08:47,804
Victor.

972
01:08:58,242 --> 01:09:00,242
(machine buzzes)

973
01:09:10,296 --> 01:09:12,296
Igor.

974
01:10:04,559 --> 01:10:06,684
Now we owe them a dinner.

975
01:10:06,728 --> 01:10:08,767
(engine doesn't start)

976
01:10:09,731 --> 01:10:11,770
What's wrong, Victor?

977
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:17,169
I think the battery's dead
and we're out of gas, oil and water.

978
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:24,437
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

979
01:10:24,537 --> 01:10:26,397
(explosion)
- Agh.

980
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:29,192
What was that?
- That sounded like Igor.

981
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,292
Victor. Look.

982
01:10:33,588 --> 01:10:35,448
Oh, my God.

983
01:10:35,548 --> 01:10:37,408
A gigantic tit.

984
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:39,797
(bubbling)

985
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:41,871
Oh, Victor, what are we gonna do?

986
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,416
I don't know about you, but I'm
going home to get my catcher's mitt.

987
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:48,253
(Victor) It looks angry. The nipple's erect.

988
01:10:48,353 --> 01:10:54,133
Oh, Victor. Come on, let's go.
- No. They were all boys in my family.

989
01:10:57,403 --> 01:10:59,443
Oh...

990
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:07,159
...(typewriter)

991
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,652
Sheriff, I wanna report an escaped tit.

992
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:15,238
A what?.
- It's already killed two people.

993
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:17,407
Dr Bernardo and his assistant.

994
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,368
A tremendous tit.
- Have you been drinking?

995
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:22,954
Listen, we don't have time to argue here.

996
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:26,165
The countryside's being ravaged
by a colossal boob.

997
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:28,305
(woman giggles)

998
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:30,003
Mmm.

999
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:33,923
You've got the most beautiful breasts.
- (interference on car radio)

1000
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:36,063
Oh, shit.

1001
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:38,803
There's something wrong with the radio.

1002
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:41,848
There's something wrong
with the radio. See?

1003
01:11:41,948 --> 01:11:44,320
(bubbling)...

1004
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:47,282
...(man) Oh, my God.

1005
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,856
Jesus Christ.

1006
01:11:49,956 --> 01:11:51,995
God.

1007
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,209
What is it?.
- Relax. Just relax.

1008
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,585
Be on the lookout for a large, female breast.

1009
01:12:10,685 --> 01:12:13,379
It's about a 4,000 with an X cup.

1010
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:15,859
About a 4,000 with an X cup.

1011
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,724
Let's go.

1012
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,899
(bubbling)

1013
01:12:30,663 --> 01:12:32,732
We're too late. He's dead.

1014
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:35,526
The cream slowed him up
and the milk killed him.

1015
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:39,405
We're up against a very clever tit.
It shoots half and half.

1016
01:12:39,505 --> 01:12:42,992
Victor, what are we gonna do
to stop this fiendish tit?

1017
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:46,955
I got an idea, but I'd have to
get my hands on some camouflage.

1018
01:12:47,055 --> 01:12:49,180
I can get you camouflage.

1019
01:12:49,223 --> 01:12:51,501
Victor, don't do anything dangerous.

1020
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:54,916
Don't worry. I know how to handle tits.

1021
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:07,571
(bubbling)

1022
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:06,451
Victor. I'm so proud of you. You did it.

1023
01:14:06,551 --> 01:14:10,002
Oh, I was so worried. Were you scared?

1024
01:14:10,138 --> 01:14:14,042
Do I look like a guy who gets scared?
- I thought you'd be nursed to death.

1025
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:17,003
Everything's all secure now.
You don't have to worry.

1026
01:14:17,103 --> 01:14:21,257
One thing bothers me, though. That's
a single. You're sure that was a single?

1027
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:24,427
That was a single.
- They usually travel in pairs.

1028
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:27,764
No, you don't have to worry.
- I've never seen one by itself.

1029
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:29,933
Two, yes. But not just one.

1030
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:33,811
So we're gonna take a nipple print,
just so we'll have ID on this one.

1031
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:37,649
I think we'll put it on probation
for maybe... 90 days...

1032
01:14:37,749 --> 01:14:40,318
...and then take it down to the orphanage.

1033
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:42,904
There's a lot of hungry babies down there.

1034
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:46,149
You both take care of yourselves now.

1035
01:14:47,592 --> 01:14:49,827
(Helen) You were so magnificent out there.

1036
01:14:49,927 --> 01:14:51,996
I knew then that I wanted you.

1037
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:54,749
I don't wanna say anything
about this, Helen.

1038
01:14:54,849 --> 01:14:58,044
L-I kinda had a personal stake
in this case, you know.

1039
01:14:58,144 --> 01:15:00,129
I've never told anyone this...

1040
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:04,008
...but when I was a little child,
I was breast-fed from falsies.

1041
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:08,096
I've learned one thing from
this whole situation, and that is:

1042
01:15:08,196 --> 01:15:12,350
...when it comes to sex, there are certain
things that should be left unknown.

1043
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:15,850
And with my luck, they probably will be.

1044
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:38,347
(phone rings)

1045
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:40,128
Brain room.

1046
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:43,118
Come in, motor function 12. Check.

1047
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,940
His leg itches.

1048
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:54,415
Scratch the, uh... left leg.
- The leg has been scratched.

1049
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:57,437
There's a joke coming in on 4-1.

1050
01:15:57,537 --> 01:16:01,107
Prepare response for incoming joke.
- Joke response 18.2.

1051
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,484
Smile, please.
- He's smiling.

1052
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:05,153
Brain to stomach.

1053
01:16:05,253 --> 01:16:07,411
Stomach to brain. Over.

1054
01:16:07,547 --> 01:16:09,365
Food coming down.
- What kind?

1055
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:12,383
Fettucine.
- Jesus Christ.

1056
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:15,455
Italian food coming down.
- (man) Again?.

1057
01:16:15,555 --> 01:16:17,880
Italian food?.

1058
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:23,838
Stomach proceeding with breakdown.

1059
01:16:23,938 --> 01:16:28,551
This is Mission Control. Mission Control.
Please stand by for systems check.

1060
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,861
Well... what do you think?

1061
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,026
No, thanks.

1062
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:36,309
Think we'll have intercourse?
- I'm very optimistic.

1063
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:38,770
The date is beautiful. Have you seen her?

1064
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:42,357
No. I haven't had a chance.
It's been so damned hectic up here.

1065
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:45,602
She's lovely. You should take a look.

1066
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:50,740
Brain to eyes. Brain to eyes. Come in.
- Eyes to brain. Over.

1067
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,534
Focus on the dinner date.
I want to check her out.

1068
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:55,912
Do you want the whole body?
- Yes, please.

1069
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,051
Take a look.

1070
01:17:01,225 --> 01:17:02,252
Hey.

1071
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:05,296
(man #2) lt'd be a shame to lose her.
- (man #1) And how.

1072
01:17:05,396 --> 01:17:07,090
Wow.

1073
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,229
Any indication yet?

1074
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,629
Brain to ears. Brain to ears.
Can you throw some voice up here?

1075
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:20,061
Yes. For me, Norman Mailer has
exactly that... same sort of relevance.

1076
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:23,561
That... affirmative, negative duality...

1077
01:17:23,581 --> 01:17:26,818
...that only Proust or...
Flaubert could achieve.

1078
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:30,113
I don't know if we're gonna make it.
Doesn't look too good.

1079
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,907
I'm a graduate of New York University.

1080
01:17:33,007 --> 01:17:34,576
We're gonna make it.

1081
01:17:34,676 --> 01:17:36,077
(man #2) I'm worried.

1082
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:38,246
About a possible failure, huh?

1083
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:39,497
Yes.

1084
01:17:39,597 --> 01:17:41,958
Anyone can have a fiasco now and then...

1085
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:45,879
...but a few in a row can lead to
a serious loss of confidence.

1086
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:49,340
You can see what it's doing
to morale around here already.

1087
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,510
Don't worry. We're gonna bring this off.

1088
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:56,097
My place or your place? To me,
it doesn't matter where we do it.

1089
01:17:56,197 --> 01:17:58,266
Hey. Why do you look so scared?

1090
01:17:58,366 --> 01:18:01,644
Goddammit. Who flashed
the scared expression?. C'mon.

1091
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:04,039
Anybody press 'frightened'?

1092
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,399
No one. Must be a short circuit somewhere.

1093
01:18:06,499 --> 01:18:08,151
That's all we need now.

1094
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:10,111
(bleeping)

1095
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:12,655
Mission Control. Prepare for launching.

1096
01:18:12,755 --> 01:18:16,576
Prepare for launching.
It looks like they're gonna do it.

1097
01:18:16,676 --> 01:18:19,996
Attention, sperm.
Attention, sperm. Stand by.

1098
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:24,042
Well... here we go again.
- D'you think we'll get out this time?

1099
01:18:24,142 --> 01:18:26,211
I hope it's not another false alarm.

1100
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:28,630
Been having trouble in Engineering.

1101
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,965
Yeah, but I heard it was all mental.

1102
01:18:31,065 --> 01:18:33,134
Hey, you're... you're on my tail.

1103
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:34,552
Sorry.

1104
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:38,139
Heart factors are all balanced.
We could use more adrenaline.

1105
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,226
This is the adrenal gland.
We're pumping away here.

1106
01:18:41,326 --> 01:18:43,645
Oh, my God, Sydney. Can't you wait?

1107
01:18:43,745 --> 01:18:46,397
You wanna do it right here
in the parking lot?

1108
01:18:46,497 --> 01:18:48,775
Signal the voice to answer yes.

1109
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:54,315
All systems on the alert.
We're gonna try to ball her in the car.

1110
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:57,956
Ears. Quickly. Ears.

1111
01:18:58,092 --> 01:19:01,663
I've made it in cars before,
but always in hardtops.

1112
01:19:01,763 --> 01:19:05,625
Prepare for launching.
- Sexual organs, proceed with erection.

1113
01:19:05,725 --> 01:19:08,878
(man #1) It's stuck.
- (man #2) Let's go, boys.

1114
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:11,047
Come on, get it up, fellas.

1115
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,638
Pull. All together...

1116
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:19,195
Roll out the tongue.

1117
01:19:23,576 --> 01:19:26,041
Here comes the kiss. Hang on.

1118
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:28,494
(rumbling)

1119
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:33,209
Activate pleasure centre.

1120
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:37,879
(ecstatic moaning)

1121
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:41,202
Can we have an erection?
What the hell's going on?.

1122
01:19:41,302 --> 01:19:44,107
I know you can do it, boys. Pull.

1123
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:49,836
Come on, fellas. What's the matter?
Don't just stand there.

1124
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:52,146
What's the matter, Sydney?

1125
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:56,676
Maintain hands on breasts.
- We're having trouble with respiration.

1126
01:19:56,776 --> 01:19:59,012
We're way over the limit down here.

1127
01:19:59,112 --> 01:20:02,056
If you're not getting an erection,
something's wrong.

1128
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:04,392
Proceed with erection. All systems go.

1129
01:20:04,492 --> 01:20:07,065
Let's go, boys. All together.

1130
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:08,897
We gotta get it up.

1131
01:20:08,997 --> 01:20:11,232
What the hell's going on down here?

1132
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:13,026
We need an erection.

1133
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:15,528
We need more help from the brain room.

1134
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:18,281
Maybe there's some trouble in the stomach.

1135
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:21,186
Fettucine is moving along nicely.

1136
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:24,871
A couple of injuries from
the veal scallopini, though.

1137
01:20:24,971 --> 01:20:27,946
I'm not laughing, Sydney, honestly.

1138
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:31,383
Now kiss me.

1139
01:20:31,519 --> 01:20:34,409
We have an erection of 45 degrees.

1140
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,155
Shall we attempt penetration?
- Prepare for penetration.

1141
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:45,225
Well, this looks like it.
- Do you know what it's like out there?

1142
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:48,269
It's like they told us
in training school. It's an ovum.

1143
01:20:48,369 --> 01:20:50,834
I'm scared. I don't wanna go.

1144
01:20:50,872 --> 01:20:53,733
This is what all this training was for.

1145
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,402
Who knows what
it's gonna be like out there?

1146
01:20:56,502 --> 01:20:58,542
You saw slides in class.

1147
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:02,325
Yeah, but... you hear these strange stories.

1148
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:05,119
Like, there's this pill these women take.

1149
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:09,123
Or sometimes the guys slam their heads
up against a wall of hard rubber.

1150
01:21:09,223 --> 01:21:11,292
(sperm #1) Oh, that's nonsense.

1151
01:21:11,392 --> 01:21:14,712
Yeah, or... or what if
it's a homosexual encounter?

1152
01:21:14,812 --> 01:21:17,507
(sperm #2) This is no time
to doubt our mission.

1153
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:22,720
You took an oath when you went to sperm
school. To fertilise an ovum, or die trying.

1154
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,473
No, I'm scared. I don't wanna go out there.

1155
01:21:25,573 --> 01:21:28,643
We're too low to attempt penetration.
The men can't hold.

1156
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:30,436
We gotta hold.

1157
01:21:30,536 --> 01:21:32,661
We need more stimulation.

1158
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:35,817
Organ room to brain control.
Re-stimulate pleasure centre.

1159
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:39,320
Prepare to stroke her thighs.
- We're on the thighs and stroking.

1160
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:43,491
Attention, mouth. Attention, mouth.
Please blow in her ear.

1161
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:46,160
Erection is at 45 degrees and holding fast.

1162
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,831
Readjust mouth. We're missing her ear
and blowing into her nose.

1163
01:21:49,931 --> 01:21:50,999
Attempt penetration.

1164
01:21:51,099 --> 01:21:52,709
Thrust.

1165
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:55,879
Ah, it'll never work. The angle's bad.

1166
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:59,430
Hey, we're gonna make babies.

1167
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:15,690
This is Mission Control. Penetrate.

1168
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:20,635
We can't. It's no use.
- Hold tight, men. We're losing it.

1169
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:27,714
What am I doing here?

1170
01:22:27,844 --> 01:22:29,662
What am I doing here?.

1171
01:22:29,762 --> 01:22:33,262
It's going down. Keep it up, boys.

1172
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:35,043
Higher. Pull.

1173
01:22:35,143 --> 01:22:37,212
It's no use. We're losing it.

1174
01:22:37,312 --> 01:22:39,505
Start preparing an alibi to save face.

1175
01:22:39,605 --> 01:22:43,384
We found him tampering with
the machinery in the cerebral cortex...

1176
01:22:43,484 --> 01:22:47,889
...turning up the guilt reflex.
- That's a lie. I never touched anything.

1177
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:50,808
It's a lie, sir.
- I work in the conscience room.

1178
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:54,187
We found the conscience tied to a chair.
He'd knocked him out.

1179
01:22:54,287 --> 01:22:56,825
Is this true?
- What if it is?

1180
01:22:56,956 --> 01:22:59,651
Don't you think
you should be ashamed of this?.

1181
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:02,779
Sexual relations
between unmarried people?.

1182
01:23:02,879 --> 01:23:04,948
To take an innocent woman...

1183
01:23:05,048 --> 01:23:09,744
...and assault her in a brutal,
sadistic, ungodlike manner is...

1184
01:23:09,844 --> 01:23:11,704
...blasphemy.

1185
01:23:11,804 --> 01:23:13,844
Lock him up.

1186
01:23:13,973 --> 01:23:15,973
Sabotage is over.

1187
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,140
Blasphemy.

1188
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:20,558
It's blasphemy.

1189
01:23:20,688 --> 01:23:23,179
Full steam ahead.

1190
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:25,474
(pleasured moans)...

1191
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:28,429
Here we go again.
- I'm not going out there.

1192
01:23:28,529 --> 01:23:30,682
I'm not gonna get shot outta that thing.

1193
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:33,685
What if he's masturbating?
I'll wind up on the ceiling.

1194
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:36,454
No.
- Get a grip on yourself.

1195
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:39,809
Fellas... Fellas, it's dark out there.

1196
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:44,112
Sh. Sh.
- I'm due at my parents' for dinner.

1197
01:23:44,212 --> 01:23:46,251
Heave-ho.

1198
01:23:46,839 --> 01:23:48,879
Heave-ho.

1199
01:23:49,884 --> 01:23:52,885
# Mine eyes have seen the glory...

1200
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:56,464
...# Of the coming of the Lord...

1201
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58,639
...(excited gasps)...

1202
01:24:03,398 --> 01:24:06,634
...# He hath loosed the fateful lightning...

1203
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:09,771
...# Of his terrible swift sword...

1204
01:24:09,904 --> 01:24:14,899
...# His truth is marching on

1205
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:16,269
Mmm.

1206
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:18,563
We're inside. We're making it.

1207
01:24:18,663 --> 01:24:21,236
(gasps)

1208
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:24,736
Memory, think of baseball players
to keep sperm from premature launching.

1209
01:24:24,836 --> 01:24:26,875
(melancholy harmonica)

1210
01:24:40,101 --> 01:24:42,837
Can't hold out any longer.
Prepare for release of sperm.

1211
01:24:42,937 --> 01:24:46,252
Willie Mays. Joe Namath. Mickey Mantle.

1212
01:24:50,528 --> 01:24:52,738
See you guys in the ovary.

1213
01:24:53,448 --> 01:24:55,487
Save me an egg.

1214
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,495
Well, at least he's Jewish.

1215
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,660
(pleasured gasps)...

1216
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:03,399
...(bleeping)...

1217
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,624
...(frenetic bleeping)...

1218
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:08,542
...(bleeping slows)...

1219
01:25:13,593 --> 01:25:15,328
...(alarm)...

1220
01:25:15,428 --> 01:25:17,428
...(power shuts down)

1221
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:30,260
Listen. Everybody. Everybody. Can I have
your attention? This is Mission Control.

1222
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:35,223
I just wanna congratulate everybody
on a fine job, well done.

1223
01:25:35,323 --> 01:25:39,185
I mean that in all sincerity.
It was hectic, but we brought it through.

1224
01:25:39,285 --> 01:25:41,325
(cheering)...

1225
01:25:42,121 --> 01:25:44,315
Well, she was worth it.
- Yes, she was.

1226
01:25:44,415 --> 01:25:47,645
I'll drink to that.
- (relaxed chatter)

1227
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,709
That was great, Sydney.

1228
01:25:53,675 --> 01:25:55,916
Let's do it one more time.

1229
01:25:56,052 --> 01:25:58,377
Hey. Everybody stand by.

1230
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:00,978
Here we go again.
- (groaning)

1231
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:07,547
Attention, all hands. Attention, all hands.
Stand by. Stand by.

1232
01:26:07,647 --> 01:26:09,757
Give me a fatigue reading.
- Uh, 4.5.

1233
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:13,636
Fatigue reading 4.5. Looks good.
We're going for seconds.

1234
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:17,306
Attention, gonads. We're going for record.

1235

no chaperone can get our number...
