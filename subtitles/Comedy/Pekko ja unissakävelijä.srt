<i>LAHEE / Princess of Nakrang</i>
Send a message to the palace.

4
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,615
lnform the king
that Goguryeo has invaded us

5
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:30,314
and request an army.

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,918
Yes Your Highness.

00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,394
<i>EUNPO BORDER</i>
<i>GOGURYEO TERRlTORY</i>

8
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:18,296
What's that?

9
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,631
<i>CHA CHASUNG</i>
They're sending
smoke signals to warn war.

10
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,004
<i>JAMYUNG </i>
But this is Nakrang territory.

11
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:31,614
Goguryeo is far away.
Their army will come.

12
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,114
<i>TAECHU</i>
lt'll be difficult to
capture Princess Nakrang alive.

13
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,911
She's shielded.

14
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,923
<i>PRlNCE HODONG</i>

15
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:42,325
l have to capture
Princess Nakrang alive

16
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:44,626
and take herto Guknae palace.

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,426
lt is the king's order

18
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,431
as well as the purpose
of this battle.

19
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,680
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,585
<i>WANG JA-SlL</i>
We'll discard the carriage.

21
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,786
l can't let myself be
a burden on Nakrang.

22
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,587
Look overthere
Your Highness!

23
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,100
<i>BUDAL / Second general</i>
Your Highness you leave the border.

24
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,603
Do you regard me as just a girl
or as your crown princess?

25
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:35,898
<i>HA HOGAE / Soldier</i>
The queen is waiting foryou!

26
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,809
Do any of you know
Sun Tzu's ''The Art of War''

27
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,609
and learned sword fighting
from the king himself?

28
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,113
Your Highness!

29
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:50,413
l'll not abandon Eunpo.

30
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:58,921
<i>SUAK</i>
<i>6 miles from Eunpo Gate</i>

31
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,458
Watch that area.

32
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,263
<i>DO SUGl</i>
Do not let down
your guard for a minute.

33
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,371
<i>CHlSO</i>
Only l prepare
the queen's food.

34
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,983
<i>MO YANGHAE</i>
Bring more rice.

35
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:24,089
At least two rice balls
for each soldier.

36
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:30,488
l'll wait forthe
crown princess here.

37
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,790
<i>WANG HOL</i>
l'll leave Do Sugi
and the troops behind.

38
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,696
l'll send a messenger if
danger is on the way.

39
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,900
lf that happens don't look back.
Return to the palace immediately.

40
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,716
Great General!

41
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,822
Great General!

42
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,732
Go ahead without me.

43
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,031
Yes sir.

44
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,953
Find a chance to
get rid of Jamyung.

45
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,149
How can you say such a thing?
We're at war now.

46
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:35,951
She went running to
Hodong's side the minute

47
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,360
she heard the war
broke out.

48
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,061
She'll side with Goguryeo
if we let her live.

49
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:20,337
<i>Hol!</i>

50
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,834
Hol!

51
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,740
Bring Puku.

52
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,338
Time is of the essence.
How can you.

53
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,347
Bring me Jamyung.

54
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,149
You.

55
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:38,747
knew?

56
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,654
Just because l've grown
attached to you

57
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,954
as my husband and
brother-in-law

58
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,167
doesn't mean l've forgotten
my vendetta against Jasil.

59
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:50,663
Sister-in-law.

60
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,367
You want to do your
filial duty to me?

61
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,700
lf you don't want to
see me dead

62
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,711
you must bring
Jamyung back alive.

63
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,932
<i>NAKRANG WAGNGEOM LOOKOUT</i>

64
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,451
<i>RYU Jl Minister</i>
<i>DOCHAL Minister</i>
The smoke signals came up

65
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:45,350
simultaneously from Mukbang
Minbong Algi and Eunpo.

66
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,651
<i>CHOl Ll</i>
Who's the enemy leader?

67
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,655
How many Goguryeo
troops were mobilized?

68
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,755
We'll learn the details
when a messenger arrives.

69
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,160
There was no news
from our spy that

70
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,700
<i>SPY</i>
the five tribes agreed
to the war.

71
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:03,804
And there was no news of
any movement of theirtroops.

72
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:10,912
Then why would Muhyul
invade us?

73
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:14,517
lt's probably revenge for
breaking the talk of marriage.

74
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:20,323
We must send an army to
bring the princess back.

75
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,334
The Crown Princess is
not a fragile flower.

76
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,031
lf she can't lead her army
on battlefields

77
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,435
she can't become
the Queen of Nakrang.

78
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:47,920
<i>MOBYUNGHACHlK</i>
<i>King's order to mobilize troop</i>
l'll summon the army.

79
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:56,555
Summon <i>7</i>00 troops each from Algi
Minbong Mukbang and Eunpo.

80
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,689
l'll obey your command
Your Majesty.

81
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:14,136
<i>GOGURYEO GUKNAE PALACE</i>

82
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:22,314
What's holding
the four battlefields?

83
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,822
<i>EUL DUJl / Officer of Right</i>
lt wouldn't be easy for General
Wu to defeat General Majo

84
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,617
who's defending Mukbang.

85
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:33,529
And since capturing
a hostage alive

86
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,330
is much harderthan killing one

87
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,935
the prince will be having
a hard time in Eunpo.

88
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,131
<i>KlNG DAEMUSHlN</i>
l know that.

89
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:45,935
We've been eating and
sleeping on horseback.

90
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:51,139
Ourtroops are different
from Choi Li's lazy bums.

91
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,742
Why can't they sneak up and

92
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,844
bring them down
in one fell sweep?

93
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,288
Your Majesty

94
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,592
we have a message from
our spy in Jinyang Palace.

95
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,692
Speak.

96
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,896
<i>CHU BALSO / Envoy for southern district</i>
Choi Li summoned the
armies from the four prefectures

97
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:11,598
and sent them
to the four borders.

98
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,099
Why that treacherous man.

99
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:18,677
<i>Liu Xian / Former King of</i>
<i>Nakrang Commandery</i>
He's become a cunning
strategist after

100
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,508
<i>Liu Xian / Former King of</i>
<i>Nakrang Commandery</i>
for a decade.

101
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,305
l didn't expect him to
retaliate so quickly.

102
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:27,618
We must send reinforcements
to the prince.

103
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:29,017
No.

104
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,913
Choi Li's army will get there
first even if we send them now.

105
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:36,020
Hodong will win somehow.

106
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:41,328
He'll be victorious in Eunpo
and bring Choi Li's daughter back.

107
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,633
<i>EUNPO GATE</i>
<i>GOGURYEO TERRlTORY</i>

108
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:32,407
We must buy time until the
reinforcements arrive.

109
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:34,412
There's only one strategy
Goguryeo will employ

110
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,511
when they're outnumbered.

111
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,413
An all-out attack.

112
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,125
How can we buy time when
they swarm over us like bees?

113
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,125
What happened?

114
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:54,133
<i>BUDAL / Second General in command</i>
<i>BU TUNG / Lieutenant</i>
The corpses of ourtroops

115
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,840
and those of Goguryeo have
piled up like a mountain.

116
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,340
Ourtroops can't
march forward

117
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,968
with the corpses in the way.

118
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:02,371
Food supply is a
bigger problem.

119
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,984
Our men need to be fed.

120
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:15,290
Captain take Butung and
go to the Goguryeo camp.

121
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,985
Yes Your Highness.

122
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,629
<i>EUNPO GATE</i>
<i>GOGURYEO TERRlTORY</i>

123
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:43,111
We have a message from the
Crown Princess of Nakrang.

124
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:44,715
Speak.

125
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,328
Son you read it.

126
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,075
Mountains of dead troops
of both Goguryeo and

127
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:08,079
Nakrang have
rendered us immobile.

128
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,977
l propose two-hour of truce.

129
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:16,287
l wish we both have
time to clear away the corpses

130
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:22,086
move the wounded
and feed the soldiers.

131
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:26,695
You just want to buy time
until your reinforcements arrive.

132
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,002
Walk overthe corpses if
that's what you want.

133
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,402
Your men trip over dead bodies
but you won't even help

134
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,599
the wounded and
pick up the dead?

135
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,303
You vulgar jerks.

136
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:41,107
Like father like son.

137
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,111
They sent a couple of
ignoramuses as messengers.

138
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:50,720
l'm old enough to be
yourfatheryou punk.

139
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:54,523
We'll accept the crown
princess's proposal.

140
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,122
No Your Highness.

141
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,957
We'll resume fighting
in two hours.

142
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:09,067
Feed the troops collect the dead
and bring back the wounded.

143
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,275
Why did you agree to it.

144
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,067
You know she's just
trying to buy time.

145
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:17,777
l also need time.

146
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,422
Here take these.

147
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,422
<i>MlCHU</i>
Make sure you eat some too.

148

<i>SOSO</i>

149
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:13,937
Eat up.

150
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:18,341
This way.

151
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,531
Can you do it?

152
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,029
Yes Your Highness.

153
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:22,833
We're trained
in acrobatics.

154
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:25,342
Casting a net is
a piece of cake.

155
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:33,041
l'm ready to give up my life
foryou for saving Puku's life.

156
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:34,849
Thank you.

157
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:39,054
Cha Chasung but you're not
from Goguryeo.

158
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:42,953
And Hangkai
you're from Nakrang.

159
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,359
l must give you
a great burden.

160
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:54,371
You'll be seated among my
counsel the day l become king.

161
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,169
You're most gracious
Your Highness.

162
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:01,506
Your Highness arrows from the
Yeonna tribe have arrived.

163
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,313
All right.

164
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:07,109
Select the best and the
strongest archers we have.

165
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,817
Yes Your Highness.

166
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,515
Prince.

167
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:19,530
Do as exactly as you are told.

168
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:21,927
Yes Your Highness.

169
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,027
You may leave.

170
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,460
No more tighter.

171
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,363
Do we have to go
to battle too?

172
00:17:58,437 --> 00:17:59,301
Boss.

173
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:03,502
<i>lLPUM </i>
You can leave with Michu.

174
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:08,908
l'll pay him back
for saving Puku.

175
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:12,007
l'm not staying
here just for Puku.

176
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:16,912
We're in a horrific
blood-drenched battle

177
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,522
but l feel as if l've
finally become a man.

178
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,319
Cha Chasung.

179
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,832
l thought my life was about

180
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:34,940
doing circus acts and
selling laughter.

181
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:41,145
Michu l want to live
like a real man too.

182
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:48,152
Can't we just live a
quiet long life?

183
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:57,157
But that's how we've lived
until now quiet like a mouse.

184
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,494
l may not become
the great general

185
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,600
but l want to be called
''general'' at least once.

186
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,499
Please let me make something
of myself before l die.

187
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:12,905
Honey.

188
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,007
Honey.

189
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,714
People are looking.

190
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:29,985
l may never be able
to go to Nakrang.

191
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,621
Yes.

192
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,334
Since you killed
a Nakrang warrior

193
00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:40,933
you may never be
allowed on their land.

194
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,643
l'm sorry Puku.

195
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:51,746
Because of me.

196
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,552
You'll regret it for
the rest of your life.

197
00:19:56,421 --> 00:20:00,482
Let me help you capture
Princess Nakrang alive.

198
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,490
No.

199
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,391
More Nakrang
troops are coming.

200
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,596
lf you don't capture
Princess Nakrang

201
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,001
you'll never leave this place.

202
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:18,102
What man would let his woman
hold a sword and smell blood?

203
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,307
What kind of woman
do you want me to be?

204
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,816
l haven't thought about it.

205
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:35,325
You want me sitting
pretty in a garden

206
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:43,332
wearing silk robes and draped
in jewelry waiting foryou?

207
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,333
That sounds good too.

208
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,431
lt would be nice to
see you in that.

209
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:49,437
You told me this in Simbeon.

210
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,543
lt's important to
know who you are

211
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:57,443
but it's also important to
know your purpose in life.

212
00:20:58,817 --> 00:20:59,875
Yes.

213
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:05,885
Maybe meeting you.

214
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,488
sharing your pain

215
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,495
is my purpose in life.

216
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:27,302
l came back because my
present with you is more

217
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,710
important than
finding out who l am.

218
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:36,911
Puku.

219
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,117
l'm not a woman who
can benefit Goguryeo.

220
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:44,328
l'm not a woman who
satisfies a man's lust.

221
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:50,835
l want to be someone.

222
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:56,038
who shares
everything with you

223
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,337
even death

224
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,385
The two hours are up.

225
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:38,706
Drink this.

226
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,967
The feathers
were cut in half.

227
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:06,570
lt'll add to theirflight
but the arrows

228
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,279
could lose balance
and miss yourtargets.

229
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:20,287
Wait for a north wind and
aim a few inches above target.

230
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,094
You must aim and kill the
crown princess's guards.

231
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,994
Yes Your Highness.

232
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,597
Your Highness.

233
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:59,055
Our prince challenges the
Crown Princess of Nakrang.

234
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,758
Has Prince Hodong
gone crazy?

235
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,875
Will the Crown Princess
of Nakrang

236
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:17,975
who'll succeed the throne
cower before a challenge?

237
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:24,481
<i>Are you Princess Nakrang</i>

238
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:27,682
<i>only capable of adorning</i>
<i>yourself and playing a lute?</i>

239
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,997
<i>How do Nakrang army</i>
<i>serve such princess?</i>

240
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,595
l'll cut off his head!

241
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,296
Stay calm!

242
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:46,305
He means to aggravate
you with insults.

243
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:48,708
Don't fall for it.

244
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,308
l know.

245
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:55,014
l won't fall for such
a childish trick.

246
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:58,419
With no future
for Nakrang

247
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,120
you should admit defeat
and save your own lives.

248
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,029
There will be ten rounds

249
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:13,932
but our prince will concede
three of them leaving seven.

250
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:17,839
lf you even so much as slash
his robe during the seven rounds

251
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,943
he'll apologize and
withdraw from the battle.

252
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:24,148
Challenge!

253
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,544
Challenge!

254
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:36,659
Challenge!

255
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,158
Your Highness

256
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,360
we the troops of Nakrang
wish to see your skills.

257
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:44,667
Shut up.

258
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:48,171
You dare doubt our
princess's skill?

259
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,769
We have nothing to lose

260
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:52,466
since Goguryeo will
concede three rounds.

261
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,171
Give my message
to your prince.

262
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,416
Prince Hodong had a match
with our Great General once

263
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,622
but it was a draw.

264
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,127
lf he can defeat
the Great General

265
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,420
l'll accept his challenge.

266
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,542
She fell for it.

267
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:36,851
We'll signal you when we succeed.

268
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:26,431
North wind.

269
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,014
Budal, Butung!

270
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,326
Wipe out their archers!

271
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:30,526
Yes Your Highness.

272
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,132
Protect the crown princess!

273
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,854
Those rats.

274
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,033
Your Highness.

275
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:55,345
l'm sorry
l couldn't protect you

276
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:07,287
Just what are you?

277
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:14,088
l'm the bodyguard of Goguryeo
who was abandoned by Nakrang.

278
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,103
What? You're from Nakrang?

279
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,300
<i>How can a girl</i>
<i>become a bodyguard?</i>

280
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,907
<i>Maybe Prince Hodong</i>
<i>has feelings for her. </i>

281
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:34,909
Are you Hodong's woman?

282
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:39,818
Ask the prince yourself.

283
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:46,027
Awoman of Nakrang will
abandon her country for a man

284
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,324
and kill her own countrymen?

285
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:53,930
l'll neverforgive you.

286
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:09,486
The prince's army has
retreated safely.

287
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,578
Really?

288
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:14,085
Then we'll go to

this would happen.

299

Who gave you permission to

317
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:14,267
Less than 200 were injured.

318
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,571
We have captured 2500
of Nakrang people

319
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,082
building the fortress.

320
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:25,085
1300 were taken by the Hwanna and
Gwanna tribes as spoils of war.

321
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,289
Your Majesty.

322
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,390
What is it?

323
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:33,492
General Wu is returning to the
palace with 1200 prisoners.

324
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,999
l have to hand it to Wu Naru.

325
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,797
l heard he was injured
fighting Majo.

326
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:43,497
l assume he's fine.

327
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,606
Your Majesty ljust
received a message that

328
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:50,110
the prince will arrive
at Bukyang shortly

329
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,905
with the Princess
of Nakrang in captive.

330
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,314
l told you
Hodong could do it!

331
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:02,320
He's not only the best
swordsman in Goguryeo

332
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:05,521
he's now the best
strategist as well.

333
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:14,629
How shall we receive
Choi Li's daughter?

334
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:17,731
She's a hostage but
she'll marry our prince.

335
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:21,144
We should receive
her accordingly.

336
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:22,638
l agree.

337
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:27,748
She'll be Hodong's wife
and my daughter-in-law.

338
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,354
Give Choi Li's daughter
a grand welcome.

You have done well.

What's the meaning of.

Hodong doesn't know
anything about women.

349
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:31,037
l apologize Princess.

350
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,341
l'm grateful
l wasn't dragged by a horse

How can you say such.

00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:41,352
You're not a prisoner.
You're here as our guest.

354
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:45,555
As Hodong's princess.
Please appease your anger.

Your Highness.

356

Come in.

357
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,311
A man from your
house brought these.

00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,310
He got here quickly.

Put them on the table.

360
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:05,507
Yes.

Please wearthese until we
can make you new clothes.

And wearthese for now.

My brother will spare no jewelry
for his eldest daughter-in-law.

365
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:28,731
lt's all right.

366
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:30,134
lt is all right.

367
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:35,640
l had promised Hodong jewelry
and makeup as wedding gifts.

368
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,742
My people were
brought here as prisoners.

369
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,146
l'm not so clueless
that l'd adorn myself with

370
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:51,554
Goguryeo clothes and jewelry
in such situation.

371
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:58,366
Well if you'd rather stay in
your bloodstained clothes.

372
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,901
lf you'll bring me
some water

373
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,302
l'll wash my bloodstains
off my hands.

374
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:08,011
All right.
Bring her some water.

375
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,908
Yes Your Highness.

376
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:16,815
When he was young Hodong
came back from his trip to

377
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,515
Nakrang as an envoy and
told me you had a foul temper.

378
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:21,317
He was right.

379
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:53,447
Your Highness.

380
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:57,751
Who are you to sit at
the prince's table and

381
00:38:57,928 --> 00:38:59,589
share his precious tea?

382
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:03,693
l'm Puku.

383
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:06,802
the prince's bodyguard.

384
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:10,299
You're that Puku?

385
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:15,009
The girl Hodong brought back
to the palace from Simbeon?

386
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,017
The prince took care of
me when l was ill.

387
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:25,317
l heard that
Queen Maeseolsu gave you

388
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:27,520
to the Great General
of Nakrang as a gift.

389
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,119
That's correct.

390
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:32,528
And how are you
so well informed?

391
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:34,824
There are no secrets
in the palace.

392
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,831
Then you must know.

393
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:43,930
Puku is my friend and
my woman.

394
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,343
What do you see in
this skinny girl?

395
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:51,346
Leave us.

396
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:53,843

what l do with Puku.

Hodong.

403
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:34,021
l'm exhausted.

404
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:42,423
At least once a day
l want to smile like the others.

405

At least once a day.

406
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:57,842
l want to feel how happy
to be alive and breathing.

407
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:02,374
And only she can
do that foryou?

408
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:07,487
Yes.

409
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:13,992
Where is Puku from?

410
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:18,301
She grew up in Dongmohyun
but she's originally from Nakrang.

411
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:19,697
Nakrang?

412
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:21,895
Haven't you learned
your lesson?

413
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,099
You've suffered
more than enough

414
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:27,007
because your birthmother
was from Buyeo.

415
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:32,106
l'm happy enough that she's
not from the Biryuna tribe.

416
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:39,122
They say that a hero is
rendered powerless by beauty.

417
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,720
l'm afraid
a girl will ruin you.

brought me here?

427
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:40,916
Your mother was the
one who started this.

428
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:42,611
Nonsense.

lf l hadn't gone through
trouble to bring you here

Let's not argue.
Our people are watching.

Why aren't you
with the prince?

435
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:18,385
Palace life seems
so complicated.

00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:23,292
l think l'll only be a
burden to the prince.

437
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,604
They must be
Nakrang people.

438
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,314
They are with
General Wu Naru.

439
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:51,320
They must be prisoners
captured at Mukbang.

440
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:56,621
Nakrang has done
nothing for us.

441
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:58,961
We can't even call
it our motherland.

442
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,064
We've come this far.

443

Let's forget
we're from Nakrang.

Your Majesty!

449

Come to my chamber.

450
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,139
Send an envoy to Muhyul and
find out what his terms are

451
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,338
forthe release
of the crown princess.

452
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:31,445
Also forthe release
of our people.

453
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,353
They took the crown princess
to Guknae Palace.

454
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:38,354
lt seems they'll force her
to marry Prince Hodong.

455
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:39,753
That can't happen!

456
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:42,861
Our people will not
acknowledge her as queen

457

if she is forced to
marry the enemy prince.

458
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:51,067
lt's their ploy to snatch up
Nakrang with princess

459
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:54,870
on their back.

460

l'll meet him at the
border of Eunpo.

clothes and a maid.

467
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:26,035
She can't lose her dignity
in the Goguryeo palace.

468
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:29,444
All right.

469

What will you do

470
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:35,349
if the King of Goguryeo won't
release the princess?

00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,463
Only if Jamyung is alive.

475
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:56,569
What are you saying?

476
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:59,506
Will you forsake Lahee?

477
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:05,808
l'll save her.
l'll bring her back to you.

478
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:09,511
l'll stop Muhyul from
marrying her off to Hodong.

479
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:13,015
But why are you
bringing up Jamyung?

480
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:18,628
A king must prepare
forthe worst.

481
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:22,126
l have to have an
alternate plan.

482
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:23,827
Your Majesty.

483
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:30,135
The best thing is to bring
Lahee back but if we can't.

484
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:33,838
lf Jamyung is alive

485
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,035
l'll find her and
make her crown princess.

486
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:40,849
And if Jamyung
is not alive

487
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,146
the Great General
will succeed me.

488
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:52,061
<i>QUEEN JASlL'S CHAMBER</i>

489
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,155
What?

490
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:58,162
He'll do what if
Jamyung is alive?

491
00:47:58,235 --> 00:47:59,497
He'll make her
crown princess?

492
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,901
<i>CHlSO</i>
Things have gotten out of hand

493
00:48:01,972 --> 00:48:03,599
since you broke
the talk of marriage.

494
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:07,901
lt's a bridge we must
cross sooner or later.

495
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,511
But l had no idea Lahee
would be captured.

496
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:13,907
lf she's forced to marry

497
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:17,613
Princess Jamyung will
become crown princess.

498
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:20,112
Never.

499
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:25,323
Jamyung is Hodong's woman.

500
00:48:25,495 --> 00:48:29,829
And she killed General Ha Hogae
and Captain Takchi in Eunpo.

501
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,033
l've heard as well.

502
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:34,031
Who is Ha Hogae?

503
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:39,337
He's the king's most loyal retainer
and a meritorious subject.

504
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,542
How can the princess
who turned against her country

505
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:43,736
become crown princess
and queen?

506
00:48:43,914 --> 00:48:45,347
You're right.

507
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:50,550
How can anyone
accept her?

508
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:58,959
Lahee may be captured
but Heaven is on my side.

509
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:04,591
Jamyung put a noose
around her own neck.

510

Lady Mo is looking foryou.
But why were you so startled?

lt's nothing.
Let's go.

518

<i>BUDAL / Second general</i>
Are you having an affair?

Are you writing a love

520
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:52,446
Give that to me.

l may not know
how to read well

524
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,490
but l have an idea
what this letter says.

525
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:16,996
Sugi!

526
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:18,602

Father.

531
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:48,830
l'm all right.

532
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,438

Master will help you.

534
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:18,801
Father
what has he done wrong?

535
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:23,599
A slave who betrays
his master must die!

536
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:25,300
Let's go.

537
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:41,518
Bring him in!

538
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:55,734
l didn't miss your heart
because l'm too old to shoot.

539
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:58,435
l know that My Lady.

540
00:51:59,342 --> 00:52:02,277
lt is so that l could ask
you if you betrayed me

541
00:52:02,846 --> 00:52:06,475
the late general
and Younghojangwon

542
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,779
for a taste of power.

543
00:52:09,552 --> 00:52:10,678
Speak.

544
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:26,097
Princess Jamyung killed
General Ha Hogae and Takchi.

545
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:29,304
How can we make such a
person crown princess?

546
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:31,704
That is none of
your concern!

547
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:36,709
A king's life can't be
compared to a thousand of

548
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,905
his subjects' lives
or even tens of thousands.

549
00:52:39,883 --> 00:52:41,316
Killing them is
no matter.

550
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:45,011
Nakrang must unite
against Goguryeo.

551
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:50,421
Nakrang will collapse if
the two princesses fight

552
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:52,618
overthe throne.

553
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:54,529
You arrogant.

554
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:58,968
My Lady.

555
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:11,579
Where is Sister-in-law?

556
00:53:12,048 --> 00:53:15,381
She's inside but she
said to let no one in.

557
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:17,478
Sister-in-law!

558
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:21,283
lt is Hol!
Open the door!

559
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:24,292
Since you seem to have a
reason foryour betrayal

560
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:26,794
l won't stain my hands
with your blood.

561
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:31,900
Kill yourself!

562
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:38,600
Sister-in-law
l'll knock this door down

563
00:53:38,775 --> 00:53:40,106
if you don't open it!

564
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:41,803
What's keeping you?

565
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:45,107
Are you trying to beg your
masterforyour life?

566
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:56,723
My Lady l'm off to see the general.

567
00:53:57,393 --> 00:54:01,659
Please live a long life.

568
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:14,675
Do Chal!

569
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:15,768
Father!

570
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:19,676
Master.

571
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:27,984
Please protect our lady
and Nakrang.

572
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:30,490
Father.

573
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:37,593
l deserve to die.
Don't be sad.

574
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:45,797
Serve our lady and
Master.

575
00:54:47,877 --> 00:54:49,401
Father!

576
00:54:55,785 --> 00:55:00,119
Yourfather was a great
retainer of Younghojangwon.

577
00:55:05,495 --> 00:55:09,625
Give him a funeral befitting
his status as a minister.

578
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:12,732
Yes My Lady.

579
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:15,831
Sister-in-law!

580
00:55:43,032 --> 00:55:45,057
lt doesn't matter
who becomes king.

581
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:47,967
Forthe sake of Nakrang?

582
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,371
Don't give me that nonsense.

583
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:55,977
You haven't changed a bit

584
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,671
since you shot that
fire arrow at Sister.

585
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:04,309
Whether it's Jamyung
Lahee oryou that becomes king

586
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,820
do you think people
will care?

587
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:11,322
lt would have
been the same

588
00:56:11,394 --> 00:56:14,022
if our general had become
king instead of Choi Li.

589
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,930
Sister-in-law!

590
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,634
ls anyone born
to become king?

591
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:22,327
No you brat.

592
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,338
The powerful man
becomes king

593
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,841
and the weak one
gets trampled.

594
00:56:30,813 --> 00:56:32,747
Unless he were crazy

595
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:39,150
any king would want to
provide for his people.

596
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,959
A king can't exist when
his kingdom is in distress!

597
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:49,357
He'll die with his people!
Why don't you know that?

598
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:51,864
Hol.

599
00:56:53,936 --> 00:56:55,460
Since you're the great general

600
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:57,572
you live forthe
Kingdom of Nakrang.

601
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:03,307
l'll live for our
general's revenge.

602
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:15,881
<i>GUEST CHAMBER</i>
<i>GUKNAE PALACE GOGURYEO</i>
The queen has invited you to tea.

603
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:20,329
The prince wants to
have lunch with you.

604
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:23,831
<i>LAHEE / Princess of Nakrang</i>
Who'd have known

605
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,727
the Princess of
Nakrang would

606
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:27,326
be so popular in the
Goguryeo palace?

607
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:33,341
Princess of Nakrang l
come from the king's chamber.

608
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,138
May l come in?

609
00:57:40,616 --> 00:57:41,844
Sir.

610
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,351
Sir.

611
00:57:46,522 --> 00:57:47,750
What is it?

612
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:51,150
The king wishes to see you.

613
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:58,359
All right.

614
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:28,020
What's wrong with her now?

615
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:29,430
Puku.

616
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,628
Puku.

617
00:58:33,102 --> 00:58:35,434
She still has poison
left in her body.

618
00:58:35,705 --> 00:58:37,935
ls it because she overexerted
herself at Eunpo?

619
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:40,638
ls she worried about
Princess Nakrang?

620
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:42,844
l don't think so.

621
00:58:44,514 --> 00:58:46,448
We saw Nakrang prisoners
on our way back.

622
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:47,640
And?

623
00:58:48,117 --> 00:58:51,553
She's been upset ever since.

624
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:17,505
Puku.

625
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:19,113
What?

626
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:23,312
You saw that woman who stabbed
you with the coral hairpin again?

627
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:27,515
No.

628
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:32,620
lt is l Puku.

629
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:34,026
Come in.

630
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,127
l was about to go see you.

631
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:42,837
Prince do you
believe in dreams?

632
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:46,141
Like seeing your
future in dreams.

633
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,638
You saw the future?

634
00:59:49,912 --> 00:59:51,140
l think so.

635
00:59:53,115 --> 00:59:55,345
lt was no ordinary dream.

636
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,284
l could sense that the
images in my dream

637
01:00:01,657 --> 01:00:05,889
were things l'll
face in the future.

638
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,587
l don't know
but coming from you

639
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:10,293
l'll believe it.

640
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,091
You've opened your
energy channels.

641
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,303
Don't tease me.

642
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,401
Were you happy with
me in your dream?

643
01:00:18,674 --> 01:00:20,904
Were our children playing?

644
01:00:22,378 --> 01:00:23,811
Don't tease me.

645
01:00:26,382 --> 01:00:27,610
What was it?

646
01:00:31,387 --> 01:00:36,825
On a vast field l was standing
alone with a sword.

647
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:44,123
l saw hundreds of troops running
toward me from a distance.

648
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:49,935
What was l trying
to protect?

649
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:51,932
lt's so frustrating.

650
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:55,138
Why are you frustrated?
lt's easy.

651
01:00:57,914 --> 01:01:00,678
The enemies were
my enemies

652
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:04,980
maybe the Biryuna tribe,
Liaodong or Xuantu.

653
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:10,086
And just as you protected
me in Simbeon and Eunpo

654
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,488
will you protect me for
the rest of your life?

655
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:20,102
So you'll depend on me for
the rest of your life?

656
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,398
Why?
Do you not like it?

657
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:25,604
You don't like a weak man?

658
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:29,401
Well if that's my fate.

659
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,306
lt'd be nice

660
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,315
if my fate were to protect
you and Goguryeo but.

661
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:38,613
l have to go see Father.

662
01:01:45,194 --> 01:01:47,924
<i>QUEEN MAESEOLSU'S CHAMBER</i>

663
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:55,529
The king summoned the
Princess of Nakrang.

664
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:57,131
l know.

665
01:01:57,206 --> 01:02:00,073
<i>SONG MAESEOULSU</i>
l'm on my way as well.

666
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:13,686
<i>YANGDEOK</i>
Your Majesty
did you know that Puku

667
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:16,791
the girl you had given to
the Great General of Nakrang

668
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,884
came back?

669
01:02:20,062 --> 01:02:21,086
Did she?

670
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:26,397
l saw her with my own eyes
at the prince's chamber.

671
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,100
She is Hodong's woman.

672
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,301
lt seems that way.

673
01:02:33,976 --> 01:02:37,104
The Queen of Nakrang
wanted her as well.

674
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,807
She seems to be very useful.

675
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:45,120
Keep an eye on
her at all times.

676
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:52,022
The Crown Princess
of Nakrang is here.

677
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,069
Greetings Your Majesties.

678
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,475
Welcome.

679
01:03:08,344 --> 01:03:09,868
Welcome Princess.

680
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:17,080
General Wu Naru couldn't
stop praising your beauty.

681
01:03:17,353 --> 01:03:19,082
And he was right.

682
01:03:21,357 --> 01:03:22,881
Your attire.

683
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:25,993
l've sent you some
clothes a few times.

684
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:28,291
l was taken from
the battlefield.

685
01:03:28,364 --> 01:03:31,094
lt is only natural that a
prisoner is still in her armor.

686
01:03:41,377 --> 01:03:42,503
Did you call for me?

687
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:45,310
Be seated both of you.

688
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:49,317
Let me offeryou my
congratulations before l sit down.

689
01:03:51,387 --> 01:03:54,117
l had once asked the
prince to relay my message

690
01:03:54,390 --> 01:04:00,260
to the queen wishing her
safe birth of a healthy prince.

691
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:02,857
Did you give
herthe message?

692
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:05,966
l couldn't.

693
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,065
l knew you'd be delivering
the message in person.

694
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:17,379
You must be happy to have
given birth to Prince Haeaewu.

695
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:18,877
Congratulations.

696
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:20,873
Thank you.

697
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:34,989
We should set
the wedding date.

698
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,394
The soonerthe better.

699
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:40,999
As you wish.

700
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,404
Be it tomorrow orthe day
aftertomorrow

701
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:46,307
the date is of
no significance.

702
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:52,010
The King of Nakrang
cherishes his people.

703
01:04:53,582 --> 01:04:57,313
He wouldn't forsake his
people for his child.

704
01:04:58,387 --> 01:04:59,513
So?

705
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,021
lf l'm forced to marry

706
01:05:03,592 --> 01:05:07,426
he'll take the title of
crown princess away from me.

707
01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:15,433
Do you really think so?

708
01:05:16,105 --> 01:05:19,131
When he has no
other child but you?

709
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:23,342
Although he's not his child
he has General Wang Hol.

710
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:28,843
Princess our wedding was
already under discussion.

711
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:32,954
He has no reason to take your
title of crown princess away

712
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:35,049
even if you marry me.

713
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:46,368
<i>CHOl Ll'S OFFlCE</i>
<i>JlNYANG PALACE NAKRANG</i>
l'm done packing for
the princess in Goguryeo.

714
01:05:46,836 --> 01:05:48,064
Very well.

715
01:05:55,044 --> 01:06:01,108
lf l weren't crown princess
l'd have no reason to live.

716
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:15,725
Pack this among herthings.

717
01:06:17,399 --> 01:06:19,128
What is the
meaning of this?

718
01:06:22,404 --> 01:06:25,840
The princess our Lahee
wouldn't go on living

719
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:29,536
if she weren't crown princess.

720
01:06:30,512 --> 01:06:33,345
No. That can't happen.

721
01:06:33,816 --> 01:06:36,546
l decide herfuture.

722
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:41,053
Muhyul will demand
things l cannot accept.

723
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:49,063
l can't have Lahee insulted
and living in Goguryeo

724
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:53,361
or have her become
a burden to Nakrang.

725
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:10,118
<i>Lahee will understand</i>
<i>the meaning of this dagger. </i>

726
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:19,021
Your Majesty even if l were
to marry Prince Hodong

727
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:23,729
l'd have nothing
to offer Goguryeo.

728
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,731
lf you can't bring anything

729
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:28,335
l'll take what l need from
Choi Li, yourfather!

730
01:07:28,904 --> 01:07:30,838
lt is of no concern to you.
