{\a6}Episode 29

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,520
When mom was alive, she
loved Yeo Jun, didn't she?

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,260
She did think he was good,

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,910
but knowing your situation now,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,270
she couldn't possibly rest in peace.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,350
Remember how your mom
struggled to bring you up?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,260
How could she let you suffer all this?

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,500
Grandfather!

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,020
<i>Remember my words well,</i>

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,450
I put up with him only
because I treasured you,

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,140
but not anymore.

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,260
<i>Yeo Jun certainly won't do.</i>

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,710
<i>What are you waiting for?
Go to your room.</i>

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,230
This is all a joke.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,790
What is a joke?

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,400
The elders tell them to
break up so they break up,

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,880
tell them to date so they date,

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,540
<i>isn't that a joke?</i>

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,350
<i>And unni loves Yeo Jun oppa,</i>

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,130
we should be on her side and support her.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,040
You still don't understand.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,790
Even if she marries into that family,

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,100
they might be happy for a short while,

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>but long term misfortune
will be awaiting her.</i>

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,530
That is to be expected.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,870
They said all kinds of things to our face.

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,860
When Sang Eun is there
all alone, at that time...

29
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,830
Give me a massage.

30
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,672
Episode 29

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,710
Father...

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,400
yesterday my wife said the wrong
things because she is ignorant.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,480
Please be kind and forgive her.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,260
Forgive her?

35
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,670
Forget it.

36
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,250
Now we have nothing to do with each other,

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,420
let's live like we're strangers.

38
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:24,120
Why must you do this, Father?

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,650
Of course I have to.

40
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,880
After you found out about
Sang Eun's birth mother,

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,190
<i>your hearts must have been
very unsettled, right?</i>

42
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,570
Even if they got married,

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,730
you will continue to find trouble
with Sang Eun over this matter.

44
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,630
That is what I'm not happy about.

45
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,060
Once they get married, would any
of this be a problem still?

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,770
You are such a naive man.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,340
That is what will happen
once they get married,

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,970
why can't you understand that?

49
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,230
I really don't want to see
Sang Eun live like that.

50
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,250
But that's not how we will behave, Father.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,880
If there is a first time,
there will be a second time.

52
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,940
And as an elder, I'm telling you...

53
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,390
stop going to my son-in-law
to plead for mercy.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,120
I will certainly not allow this matter.

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,170
Understand?

56
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,080
Where did you go?

57
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,720
To Kyung Tae's.

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,300
Why do you have to go to their place?

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,070
Why do you always ignore what I say?

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,440
Because of that attitude of yours,
Yeo Jun is all soft-hearted too.

61
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,260
Really!

62
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,420
What's so great about your son anyway?

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,030
Other than an unreasonable mother-in-law,

64
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,630
she has to deal with a
troublesome family too.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,610
What?

66
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,470
Are you making any sense at all?

67
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,160
You said worse things
to Kyung Tae, you know.

68
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,460
How desperate must a parent have felt
to give their child to someone else?

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,170
Why can't you just empathize with
how the other person feels?

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,420
That's right,

71
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,709
I just hate that family.

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,720
<i>What?</i>

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,220
What is happening here?

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,770
We're just into the new year, and there's
loud shouting and quarreling in the house?

75
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm sorry, mother.

76
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:08,560
Why is it even you two have to quarrel?

77
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,060
There're enough complications
already giving me headaches.

78
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,050
This man's mind isn't cleared up yet,

79
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,500
he went looking for Kyung Tae again.

80
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,880
So because of your stubbornness,

81
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,040
I have to stop being friends with him?

82
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,170
For the sake of your own
child, can't you do that?

83
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,900
Keep it down now.

84
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,850
What did Kyung Tae say?

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,930
Kyung Tae isn't that upset with us,

86
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,480
but Father is determined to break
off ties with our family.

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,080
That's good then,

88
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,560
we take this opportunity to
break off all ties now.

89
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,300
Since I've already made it clear
to Sang Eun's birth mother,

90
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,500
<i>her appearance didn't seem like
one to abandon her own child.</i>

91
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,940
To you, is it really that
important whose child she is?

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,130
Of course,

93
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,260
isn't it important to you too, Mother?

94
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,490
To me, more important than
who her birth parents are,

95
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,740
it's the issue of trust and sincerity.

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,330
That is the crux of why I
object to the marriage.

97
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:15,220
Putting aside Sang Eun,

98
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,410
<i>Kyung Tae and that old man
shouldn't have treated me like that.</i>

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,230
Mother...

100
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,870
Enough.

101
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,530
You two leave, I'm having a headache now.

102
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,370
It's really been a long time.

103
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,480
What are you doing?

104
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,730
I've forgotten what your face looks like.

105
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,490
You just saw me this morning.

106
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,740
Recently, too many things
have been happening.

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,170
I really don't get what's
up with the elders.

108
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,460
That's true.

109
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,190
I said I didn't like you
right from the start.

110
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,830
But why only now they object to it?

111
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,640
That's what I'm saying.

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,270
I said I didn't like you at the start too.

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,350
I am warning you now,

114
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,710
don't run away just because
it gets difficult, all right?

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,140
Not to Australia nor America.

116
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,980
If I do, aren't you coming after me?

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,700
You know I will chase after you, right?

118
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,210
But I don't think we should waste
any time by running away.

119
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,490
Then, what should we do?

120
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,670
Shall we get married, Han Sang Eun?

121
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,690
What?

122
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,440
Marry me.

123
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,940
I can't wait anymore.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,200
I don't want the elders nor anything else

125
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,330
to interfere with our love.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,380
Grandfather said he definitely
won't allow me to marry you.

127
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,390
It's all right,

128
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm not marrying grandfather.

129
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,360
We can't get married like this.

130
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,950
If we waited and waited and
it still doesn't work out,

131
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll go ahead.

132
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,030
I really wonder how other
people get married.

133
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,630
Yeo Jun, does it bother you that
I'm that woman's daughter?

134
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,950
It sure does.

135
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,500
Because you don't look like your mother,

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,110
otherwise you're sure to be a beauty.

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,430
If that were the case,

138
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,540
maybe when we first met at the airport,
I might have fallen in love with you then.

139
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,540
Ridiculous.

140
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,630
That's right, it's ridiculous.

141
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,620
So stop saying silly things like that.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,680
Did you come right back from the hospital?

143
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,160
Or did you meet with Sang Eun?

144
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,980
Mother.

145
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,880
Answer me.

146
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,260
Did you meet with Sang Eun?

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,530
Yes, I met Sang Eun.

148
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,600
<i>Can't you sober up?</i>

149
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,370
They don't agree to it and neither will I,

150
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,700
why do you persist?

151
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
In your eyes, I might be a perfect son,

152
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,740
but in reality,

153
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,570
I have my shortcomings too.

154
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,090
And only Sang Eun can
complement my shortcomings.

155
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,990
Other than Sang Eun, I
will not marry anyone else.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,720
Yeo Jun!

157
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,220
Yeo Jun.

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,610
You'll keep fighting for it, won't you?

159
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,470
My experience tells me,

160
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,660
a marriage objected by parents
is not going to be a happy one.

161
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,450
- Noona...
- But,

162
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,970
if you really believe and love each other,

163
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,840
you won't be forced apart.

164
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,640
We will definitely not part.

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,000
Then you make sure you put Sang Eun at ease.

166
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,820
I know.

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
That's good.

168
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,100
I won't worry then.

169
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,320
Hey, stop sighing.

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,940
Why can't things just go smoothly?

171
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,730
If you're bothered about Doctor Kim Yeo Jun,

172
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,940
don't waste time worrying about him.

173
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,430
That guy is a perfect man,
nothing will go wrong with him.

174
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,930
Hey,

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,100
why don't you worry about
things happening to us?

176
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,450
But there's nothing about us to worry over.

177
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,810
So I wanted to ask,

178
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,300
would you like to go on a trip?

179
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,650
A warm and romantic place.

180
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,980
Why?

181
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,920
What do you mean why?

182
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,120
We're dating, aren't we?

183
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,450
It doesn't mean you can do anything
just because we're dating.

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,040
And what makes you think I'd trust you
enough to go on a trip with you?

185
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
<i>Impossible.</i>

186
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,100
Hey,

187
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
what do you take me for?

188
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,370
You're the one who's
thinking dirty thoughts.

189
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,680
Forget it then.

190
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,490
She worries about so many things.

191
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,180
Let's go anyway.

192
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,740
Really?

193
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,460
Who says I want to go with you?

194
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,030
Then who else are you going with?

195
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,200
My family members.

196
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,320
You won't follow along, will you?

197
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,130
Hey,

198
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,780
it was my idea, you know.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,410
- I'm off.
- Thank you.

200
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,240
Grandfather. Dad.

201
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,620
- Yes.
- Let's go skiing.

202
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,990
Why go skiing suddenly?

203
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,630
Child, you want your grandfather
to break his bones?

204
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,050
I'd rather go for hot springs.

205
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,930
Fine,

206
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,640
we go ski this time then
hot spring next time.

207
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,190
You people might think it's fun,

208
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,060
but you think grandfather
and I think so too?

209
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,190
We must watch the shop too.

210
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,700
Then I'll go with unni.

211
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,050
I've been staying home since
I came to Korea, all right?

212
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,700
Two of you?
One night stay?

213
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,270
Don't you think unni is pitiful?

214
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,500
Grandfather wouldn't let her date,

215
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,380
so she's supposed to just stay at home?

216
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,890
She should at least release
some stress, right?

217
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,850
Grandfather! Daddy...

218
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,090
Well...

219
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,940
No trouble, okay?

220
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,760
Just skiing, no kissing.

221
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,980
See if you dare run out at night.

222
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,280
I know.

223
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,450
Mother.

224
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
What now?

225
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,500
Is it about Sang Eun?

226
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,620
No... well...

227
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,990
that's on my mind too, but I think
the factory needs an expansion.

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,900
<i>Our production has already doubled,</i>

229
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,440
but we can't keep doing it.

230
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,320
What should we do, Mother?

231
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,240
What can we do?

232
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,140
We wanted to let everyone
know about our rice cakes,

233
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,840
surely we must continue.

234
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,100
<i>It seems he's really capable.</i>

235
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,810
A family business which we ran for 30 years,

236
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,260
he expanded it in hardly a few months.

237
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,830
That's right.

238
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,190
He must be busy with lots of
matters at his company too.

239
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,560
It's all right, I'll leave it to you.

240
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,510
Yes.

241
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,810
Then, Mother, well...

242
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,420
<i>Aigoo,</i>

243
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,280
<i>if it's about Sang Eun then stop.</i>

244
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,380
I have to talk to that
old man to resolve this.

245
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,960
I understand.

246
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,580
<i>Jin Ju, what kind of ice cream do you like?</i>

247
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,200
<i>Chocolate.</i>

248
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,290
What kind of milk do you like?

249
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,230
Pure milk, banana or strawberry?

250
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,280
Banana.

251
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,730
Ah, banana.

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,210
What about doughnuts?

253
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,820
Cheese doughnuts.

254
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,960
Cheese doughnuts.

255
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,840
<i>How is Jin Ju?</i>

256
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,930
She's fine.

257
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,600
She misses you.

258
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,410
No problem at the factory, right?

259
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,390
Thanks to you,

260
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,940
the elders are all very happy about it.

261
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,610
<i>Yun Hee...</i>

262
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>It's time for the meeting.</i>

263
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,570
We'll talk again.

264
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,040
Hyo Eun.

265
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,680
Something to tell me?

266
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,910
I have a favor to ask you.

267
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,600
What?

268
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,430
Ski?

269
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes,

270
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,320
Jin Ju says she wants to go ski,

271
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,770
do you have time?

272
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,110
I will make time if Jin Ju wants to go.

273
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,290
How about we ask Kyu Han along?

274
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,170
If so, forget it then.

275
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,150
All right, I'll make time this weekend.

276
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,760
The car's available but...

277
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,700
I thought you said you were busy,
why are you going skiing?

278
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,460
Noona's going too,

279
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,260
forget it if you don't want to.

280
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,370
I'll go.

281
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,080
<i>Skiing?</i>

282
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,000
Doctor, you're going skiing?

283
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,370
None of your business.

284
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,950
Sang Eun, long time no see.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,980
<i>That's right.</i>

286
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,830
Unni!

287
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,440
Jin Ju.

288
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,830
Unni, you're coming along too?

289
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,850
Why? I can't go?

290
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,340
No.

291
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,040
Then get in, let's go.

292
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,090
Hyo Eun's been bugging you, right?

293
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,080
No, I'm so bored in the shop all the time.

294
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,160
Ski?

295
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,810
If you say you'll go, Yeo Jun oppa
will be there too, all right?

296
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,190
Otherwise the two of them
won't get to date at all,

297
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,990
<i>the elders have such violent objections.</i>

298
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,270
Wow, this place is a blast!

299
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,720
What a blast!

300
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,600
Hyo Eun, she's learning from you,
be careful what you say.

301
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,150
Don't worry, Jin Ju talks like that too.

302
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,900
Mom, when do we get to ski?

303
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,430
Can't we go now?

304
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,170
Yes, let's go now.

305
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,390
Since we're here already,

306
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,780
staying in here is just wasting time.

307
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,380
Let's change quickly and go.

308
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
This is great.

309
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,969
Jin Ju, can you ski?

310
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,650
No.

311
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,330
She'll just go on the ski chair lift.

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,660
- We can teach you how to ski.
- That's right.

313
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,080
Uncle Kyu Han.

314
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,650
Yeo Jun.

315
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,670
How did this happen?

316
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,930
Isn't it Hyo Eun's idea?

317
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,630
Hyo Eun!

318
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,920
Kyu Han owes me a favor,

319
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,750
so just take it as repaying me.

320
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,180
Instead of repaying,

321
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,960
I feel like I owe you another favor.

322
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,630
Well then repay me double with
those bright shiny things.

323
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,750
Hey!

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,330
You don't have to.

325
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,890
You're joking, right?
Bright and shiny things!

326
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,420
Why ask hyung for it?!

327
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,150
Then you get me some.

328
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,130
The more presents, the merrier.

329
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,020
Does grandfather know about this too?

330
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,260
I forgot to tell him,

331
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,520
but I didn't lie to him.

332
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,590
Hyo Eun, when we get back to Seoul,

333
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,710
I'll surely buy you a
bright and shiny thing.

334
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,430
I'm very happy with you for this.

335
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,260
Thanks.

336
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,560
Why must you buy bright and shiny
stuff for someone else's girl?

337
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,260
If you dare accept it, you're dead.

338
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,870
I dare you to try.

339
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,620
Hey! I told you no.

340
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,590
Oh, this feels great.

341
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not skiing. I'll take
chair lift rides with Jin Ju.

342
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,160
Mom, I'd like to ski.

343
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,490
But you can't ski.

344
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,490
Jin Ju, you ski with me.

345
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,470
Be careful.

346
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,150
You're ready, let's go.

347
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,700
Look here.

348
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,200
Use your leg.

349
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,750
Left, yes, right.

350
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,830
<i>Very good.</i>

351
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,080
Why this expression?

352
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,030
<i>Don't tell me you can't do this?</i>

353
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,960
No.

354
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,170
She can but she doesn't look nice on it.

355
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,050
That's right, you can't ride
things which sway, right?

356
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,710
We need to get to the top,
how do we get you up?

357
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,390
<i>Shall we walk?</i>

358
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,930
No,

359
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,620
I'll take the chair lift.

360
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,770
How?

361
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,840
Clinging to it like a lunatic,
with her eyes closed tight.

362
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,120
Since you have Yeo Jun oppa now,
just cling onto him will do.

363
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,390
Let's go, take your time, unni.

364
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,180
See you later.

365
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,150
Is this how you ride every time?

366
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,210
- I give up with you.
- Oh, my.

367
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,610
That's good.

368
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,390
You're not afraid coming down?

369
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,240
I told you, right? I'm fine
if I'm on the ground.

370
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,860
What's that fella doing?

371
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,920
Are you all right?

372
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,170
Let's take a break, want some coffee?

373
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,670
It's nice and warm.

374
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,410
It's been such a long time, you know?

375
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,140
Nothing I can do about it.

376
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,020
Grandmother and grandfather
oppose so strongly.

377
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,680
Are things okay with your mother?

378
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,550
Just so-so.

379
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,140
What about you, Yeo Jun?

380
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,240
You're doing all right with your mother?

381
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,390
I'm... still fighting.

382
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,360
Don't worry, I'm close to winning.

383
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,740
Really?

384
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,190
Of course.

385
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,630
I don't play games in which I lose.

386
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,440
I have never and I won't start neither.

387
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,660
My grandfather...

388
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,920
says he will object to it all the way.

389
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,050
Well... if this goes on,

390
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,180
I'll have to come up with something else.

391
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,240
You're not tired of it, are you?

392
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,500
Not yet.

393
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,500
That's fine then.

394
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,210
Father, how do you feel?

395
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,450
I'm not dead yet.

396
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,250
You don't have to worry about the company.

397
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,040
We've taken care of the urgent matters,

398
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,840
no other problem has come up yet.

399
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,660
Why are you here?

400
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,240
I'll wrap things up

401
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,280
and...

402
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,680
return there.

403
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,420
To be with my family.

404
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,385
I don't care about what you want to do.

405
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,630
Without you, nothing will happen
to the company anyway.

406
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,170
Father, most of the things
have been settled.

407
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,380
The vice president, the directors...

408
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,810
and hyung too,

409
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,400
they all worked very hard
at completing their tasks.

410
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,650
We're all doing what we should.

411
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,850
You can leave now.

412
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,730
I'm not dying yet.

413
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,520
All right.

414
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,970
Father feels a little different now.

415
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,810
Surely not, he's not
one to change so easily.

416
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,300
Are you going back to the office?

417
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,300
You're going too, aren't you?

418
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,650
Didn't you want to finish up quickly
so that you can go back?

419
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,650
Really.

420
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,070
- You're here.
- Is Sang Eun here?

421
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,420
She went skiing with her sister.

422
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,400
If I knew you were coming, you
could have gone with them.

423
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,660
No.

424
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,530
The young ones went together,

425
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,650
if I tagged along, I'd be a bother to them.

426
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,790
A bother?

427
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,460
Sang Eun's not so good with strangers,

428
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,890
she'll be fine soon.

429
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,630
- I found it.
- Yes.

430
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,640
This one is on Sang Eun.

431
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,530
Can I take a look?

432
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,990
We got this for you to take a look.

433
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,920
We made this in case such a day came along,

434
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,260
so please have it.

435
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,700
I'm so grateful.

436
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,660
Why say that?

437
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,660
We're the ones who are grateful instead.

438
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,250
What we have is not just photos,

439
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,940
we have the real person and even
feelings for one another too.

440
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,680
Who could it be at this hour?
We're not expecting anyone.

441
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,100
Let me go take a look.

442
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,300
Where is Sang Eun and Yeo Jun?

443
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,070
Down there,

444
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,900
I don't think they've had enough yet.

445
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,480
It's the first time I've
seen Doctor Kim so happy.

446
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm happy too.

447
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,800
Mom, I'm feeling so happy today.

448
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,400
It would have been better if dad was here.

449
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,540
<i>Right, mom?</i>

450
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,440
Mom, when will dad be here?

451
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,510
When he finishes his work.
I told you that, remember?

452
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,100
<i>When will he finish?</i>

453
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,260
Unni, aren't you going out?

454
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,800
It's a rare opportunity out here.

455
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,290
I have to put Jin Ju to bed.
She's very tired already.

456
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,130
I'm not tired.

457
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,090
But it's time for bed.

458
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,030
You guys go.

459
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,890
Then oppa, you'll be here too, right?

460
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,690
What?

461
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,990
<i>Kyu Han oppa,</i>

462
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,600
surely you can't leave unni here
and go ski by yourself, right?

463
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,200
No.

464
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,960
Then we two will just go.

465
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,770
Let's go, oppa.

466
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,320
<i>Ah!</i>

467
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,240
We will be back very, very late.

468
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,900
Make sure you wait up for us.

469
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,310
We don't want to be light bulbs here.

470
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,410
Let's go!

471
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,940
Hey...

472
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,550
We're in trouble.

473
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,590
Why?

474
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,180
If we go back,

475
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,970
Kyu Han hyung won't be happy.

476
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,560
<i>If we're out here,</i>

477
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,950
Doctor Kim Yeo Jun won't be happy, right?

478
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,510
What are we to do tonight?

479
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,580
We'll just drink coffee
throughout the night then.

480
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,710
Cappuccino?

481
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,800
Cappuccino!

482
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,460
This is Sang Eun's mother. This is...

483
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,560
Yeo Jun's... no,

484
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,850
I'm the father of Yeo Jun
who's engaged to Sang Eun.

485
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,650
What engaged! It was called off, right?!

486
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
Hey, father.

487
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,830
Hello.

488
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,940
Why are you still here and not leaving?

489
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,010
No matter what you say,

490
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm not leaving.

491
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,710
It's my fault that the children's
engagement was called off.

492
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,750
No, it's not like that.

493
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,320
That family has been weird
and inhuman all along.

494
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,450
Luckily, they're not married.

495
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,080
<i>Otherwise, our Sang Eun
will lose out a big deal.</i>

496
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,940
I'm sorry, it's all our fault
for thinking like that...

497
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,890
Sorry, my foot.

498
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,980
So like this,

499
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,300
if you kill someone, you'll
just say sorry, that's all?

500
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,350
Oh, father-in-law,
it's not like that, right?

501
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,890
But... what brings you here?

502
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,040
Well, since the kids are all out,

503
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,030
I thought of having some drinks with you.

504
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,160
You came empty-handed and
suggest having drinks?

505
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,100
But... you said the kids are out?

506
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,840
Where did they go?

507
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,720
What? So...

508
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,420
Hyo Eun and Sang Eun went skiing too?

509
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,070
Yun Hee said they'll be there too.

510
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,860
Don't tell me...

511
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,610
Hyo Eun...

512
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,800
I told you something was up.

513
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,800
But maybe they went there separately.

514
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,340
Try to make some sense when you talk.

515
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,560
See what I'll do when they get back.

516
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,500
Well, we don't know what they're up to yet,

517
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,230
but I certainly won't allow the marriage,

518
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,700
is that clear?

519
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
Earlier...

520
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,980
my wife...

521
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,330
made a mistake, please forgive us.

522
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,770
It wasn't her mistake,

523
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,070
it was my fault.

524
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,500
If only I didn't appear...

525
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,880
What fault?

526
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,660
Search everywhere for a
girl like our Sang Eun,

527
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,630
you search with a lantern and you still
can't find anyone like our Sang Eun.

528
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,060
Yes, well, all of this... 

529
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,790
is because we're short-sighted.

530
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,470
Of course that's the case.

531
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,310
But the engagement is indeed off.

532
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,600
Are you all right?

533
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,030
It hurts.

534
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,570
<i>Are things all right with your mother?</i>

535
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,520
I'm not so mean to her now.

536
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,710
I don't mean that.

537
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,730
Then what?

538
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:51,170
No matter what happens, don't be sad again.

539
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:57,340
Are you troubled about something?

540
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,700
Nothing, just thinking about today.

541
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,810
We're here so what's there to think about?

542
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,760
When I see those people,
I think about it naturally.

543
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,800
You don't think about me?

544
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Of course I won't forget
you even for a moment,

545
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,600
you won't let me anyway.

546
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,650
It's been awhile since we're together.

547
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,700
Are you cold?

548
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,120
No.

549
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,850
I'm fully awake now.

550
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,490
So many stars.

551
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,740
Yes, it's beautiful.

552
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,680
Sang Eun,

553
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,550
will you marry me?

554
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
What?

555
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,440
If we're married,

556
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,680
we can eat together,

557
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,260
even if we stayed out late,

558
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,240
no one will complain about us.

559
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,400
Let's get married.

560
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,060
If we're sick, we'll
worry for each other,

561
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,160
If we're afraid, we'll
keep each other company.

562
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,220
Something good happens,
we'll share it together.

563
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,150
<i>From now on...</i>

564
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,900
<i>we'll face everything together.</i>

565
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,810
Really, this doctor doesn't know
how to create the right ambience,

566
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,090
Kiss her, just kiss her.

567
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,900
You think Yeo Jun oppa is some wolf,

568
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
just kiss anyhow?

569
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,750
All men are wolves.

570
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,240
You're so smart but you didn't know that?

571
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,660
What did you say?

572
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,660
Really.

573
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,020
Hey, you pervert!

574
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:08,480
Is Jin Ju asleep?

575
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,940
She said she wasn't tired but
fell asleep right away.

576
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,580
Don't you want to be out there?

577
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,170
You haven't skied for a long while, right?

578
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,120
It's been a longer time that
I haven't been with you.

579
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,760
Didn't you miss me?

580
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,730
I was busy with the franchise business.

581
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,910
You're so strong even without me around.

582
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,570
That's not what I want.

583
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,340
All mothers are strong.

584
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,330
No,

585
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,580
even without Jin Ju,
you have been strong.

586
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,380
So strong that I can't do anything about it.

587
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,970
Is that so?

588
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,180
That's good then.

589
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,170
Can't you be less strong?

590
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,550
So that I can hold onto you.

591
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,340
I would like that too,

592
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,630
but no matter what how
hard I think about it,

593
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,330
I can't let that happen.

594
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,290
Why is it we're thinking
about the same thing,

595
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,820
but our answers are different?

596
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,180
This time round, my answer is correct.

597
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,340
Up until now.

598
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,460
You go rest, I'm tired too.

599
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,520
<i>Noona,</i>

600
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,710
do you think of me as a
younger brother like Yeo Jun?

601
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,420
A younger brother whom I
like very much, that's all.

602
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,840
Did you know?

603
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,590
A guy will control until he can't
anymore then he'll pounce.

604
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,550
You're not like that.

605
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,800
Am I interrupting something?

606
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,730
No, who says you're interrupting?

607
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,440
Hey, what did you say I did to you?

608
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,280
Others will get the impression
that I'm diseased or something.

609
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,040
You're diseased, all right.

610
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,720
Why pretend to be so pure?

611
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,690
Is this your first kiss?

612
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,720
Yes, it's my first! You jerk!

613
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,920
Hey!

614
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,620
You saw that?

615
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,120
When men can't control it
anymore, they'll pounce.

616
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,120
Oh really.

617
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm off.

618
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,520
So you mean they went skiing together?

619
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,430
It seems so.

620
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,150
Crazy! Crazy!

621
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,900
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

622
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,900
Should we just leave them be?
What if something happens?

623
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,400
You think they're some kindergarten kids?

624
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,880
If they had intended to, something
would have happened earlier.

625
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,080
It's not like you can chase
them around 24 hours.

626
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,520
That's right.

627
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,920
The kids are so good,

628
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,560
they said they'll wait
for the elders' assent.

629
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,610
Good?

630
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,240
If they're so good, would they be there?

631
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,620
Kyu Han and Yun Hee are
there too, is that all right?

632
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,770
But that is...

633
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,140
That is...

634
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,370
Nothing to say, right?

635
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,760
They all say parents are selfish.

636
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,520
But I just don't know if you're the
naive one or am I the complicated one?

637
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,810
Aigoo...

638
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,060
Did Sang Eun and Yeo Jun go out so early?

639
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,850
They didn't waste a minute.

640
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,130
They were suffering for so long before this.

641
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,600
Mom,

642
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,950
can't I go skiing too?

643
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,100
Once you wash up and eat, you can ski too.

644
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,490
With Jin Ju here, all of
you will get so tired.

645
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,880
We're fine.

646
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,760
Since we bluffed the elders,
we should at least do that.

647
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,220
Uncle.

648
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,260
How dare you come in here!

649
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,470
I'm here to eat breakfast.

650
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,440
Anything I can help with?

651
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,360
Let me know too.

652
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,190
Is there anything we can do?

653
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,800
Oh forget it.

654
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,480
It'll be more troublesome. Just sit here.

655
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,010
Hello?

656
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,670
Dad.

657
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,150
At the ski resort.

658
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,920
With mom, uncle and unni.

659
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,929
<i>What about you?</i>

660
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,890
I'm at the office.
Are you having fun?

661
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,070
It's fun.

662
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,630
It'll be better if you were here.

663
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,890
Dad, I miss you.

664
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,290
Yes,

665
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,760
I wish I can be there too.

666
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,590
I miss you too, Jin Ju.

667
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,150
Then you should come.

668
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,240
Mom, it's dad.

669
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,420
I see, it's dad.

670
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,080
Yes.

671
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,000
We're all together.

672
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,830
Nothing much.

673
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,880
All right.

674
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,800
What? You worked overnight again?

675
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,710
Yes, I had something to settle.

676
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,610
You chair the morning meeting.

677
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,520
And you?

678
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,830
I have something to handle.

679
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,280
I'll head straight to the airport later.

680
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,070
What's up?

681
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,920
Your father came to see me again?

682
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,840
<i>No,</i>

683
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,740
my father has been settled.

684
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,630
He will no longer come looking for you.

685
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,280
I came to tell you this.

686
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,020
Is that so?

687
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,190
So one thing's settled,

688
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,260
then what about us dating?

689
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,480
That again?

690
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,170
I'm talking about dating, that's all.

691
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,490
If it doesn't work out,
we'll just break off.

692
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,110
Is this how you love Han Sang Eun too?

693
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,600
I love her more than this, I think.

694
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,550
Then why do you talk to me like this?

695
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,230
I don't want to date like this.

696
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,520
Even though we start to date now,

697
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,680
we still have other people in our hearts.

698
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,190
Who knows?

699
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,220
<i>We start off like this,
what will happen later on?</i>

700
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,810
But...

701
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,830
I don't know if my father will
give his approval so easily.

702
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,580
What a joke.

703
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,110
Why must I be approved by your father?

704
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,560
It is you who must be approved by me.

705
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,730
My father...

706
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,080
is quite a tough character.

707
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,380
Actually...

708
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,030
I have no time to go on dates,

709
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>and you might have to wait
a long time for me.</i>

710
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,880
But if it's all right with you,

711
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,420
let's start dating.

712
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,050
Forget it.

713
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,340
I'm not sure if I can wait for you.

714
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,600
Waiting for someone...

715
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,910
just once is more than enough.

716
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,040
Or you could wait for me.

717
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,910
I'm not that free.

718
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,410
Han Hyo Eun.

719
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,380
You're upset at such small matters.

720
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,930
I told you not to follow me.

721
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,400
Mom, when will we come again?

722
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,510
We're not leaving yet but you're
thinking of coming again?

723
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,310
Dad!

724
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,590
What brings you all the way here?

725
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,210
I missed Jin Ju.

726
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,820
Even so,

727
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,750
don't tell me you started
out early this morning?

728
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,650
Yes.

729
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,980
I thought you might have left.

730
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,480
We can meet up in Seoul, right?

731
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,280
I don't have time.

732
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,540
After I send Jin Ju back,

733
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,620
I have to make a trip to China.

734
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,380
We should go too.

735
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,440
You drive.

736
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,380
What's going to happen to those three?

737
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,930
Including Jin Ju, it'll be four.

738
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,070
Let's go.

739
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,720
Dad, when will you come again?

740
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,350
After my trip, I'll come see you right away.

741
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,590
Right away is how many days?

742
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,380
Maybe a week, fastest will be 5 days.

743
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,620
Okay. Dad, goodbye.

744
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,110
Bye.

745
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,290
After I've handled the company matters,

746
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,100
I'll be right back.

747
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,220
I won't disappear again without any notice.

748
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,660
Let me help you.

749
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,840
Ah umm...

750
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,760
I'll call you tomorrow.

751
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,540
Forget it.

752
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,720
Brother-in-law, thanks for today.

753
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,430
It's nothing. I have to thank you instead.

754
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,550
You should go.

755
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,450
No matter what the elders say,
don't put it to heart.

756
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,090
And don't be sad either.

757
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,740
I know.

758
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,890
You should go or else you'll get scolded.

759
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,560
Doctor.

760
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,410
Hyung-nim.

761
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,220
Get your role sorted out.

762
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,260
I've not acknowledged you yet.

763
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,570
I don't care even if you haven't.

764
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,860
Maybe we might get married before you.

765
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,780
No way.

766
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,790
If you dare touch Hyo Eun,

767
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,170
you can stop dreaming about anything,
not to mention marriage.

768
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,080
So it means Hyo Eun,

769
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,130
you had me in the dark the whole time?

770
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,130
Sorry, grandfather.

771
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,250
Nothing to do with you.

772
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,910
Surely this is all Hyo Eun's idea.

773
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,120
How many times have I said it?
You mustn't be with him.

774
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,900
The elders don't have to
meet up, that will do.

775
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,430
What?

776
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,570
Why must you break them up?

777
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,660
That's because for your unni's sake...

778
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,790
How can that be for unni's sake?

779
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,400
Han Hyo Eun!

780
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,970
So you're saying,

781
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,890
you want to see your sister marry
into that family and suffer there?

782
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,230
So just let them get married and go
straight to America, won't that do?

783
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,710
Instead of worrying for her,

784
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,350
<i>you should just send her to a safe place.</i>

785
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,810
<i>Am I right?</i>

786
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,330
If you're done talking,

787
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,420
can we go to our room now?

788
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,730
I'm tired already.

789
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,060
Let's go.

790
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,460
Since when...

791
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,640
did Hyo Eun become so articulate?

792
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,300
I wonder.

793
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,790
Even if Yeo Jun did it,

794
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,460
how could you join in too?

795
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,630
It's because they truly love each other.

796
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,320
Why must you separate them by force?

797
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,580
You're the only kind-hearted
and soft-hearted one?

798
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,760
You think I'm doing this
because I hate Sang Eun?

799
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,500
<i>Son!</i>

800
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,020
Mother,

801
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,060
you're going out?

802
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,790
I think I should have a
talk with that old man.

803
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,560
Mother, what are you going to say?

804
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,050
We can't sit by as they going
about messing around.

805
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,310
Let's go.

806
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,720
Mother.

807
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,890
You came here because...

808
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,390
So what brings you here?

809
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,060
Didn't we agree not to be on talking terms?

810
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,400
Even though we agreed not
to speak to each other,

811
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,860
there are things we should
still settle and make clear.

812
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,700
Even if you apologize, it depends
whether we will accept or not.

813
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,210
A family like yours, which is
old-fashioned and unreasonable,

814
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,540
I have nothing to say.

815
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,260
Elder,

816
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,860
you've gone overboard when you say that.

817
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,860
Unreasonable?

818
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,580
What big sin have we committed?

819
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,530
Then why did you come here?

820
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,860
Our Sang Eun has always been a good child.

821
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,220
No matter who else speaks
badly about Sang Eun,

822
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,390
<i>you of all people
shouldn't hurt her like this.</i>

823
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,390
And Tae Soo,

824
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,380
no matter who says anything
bad about my family,

825
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:12,070
you of all people shouldn't
treat us like that, right?

826
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,300
You should stop when
you've reached the limit.

827
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,870
This matter has gotten this
far all because of you.

828
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,980
This makes me so mad,

829
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,190
I don't understand what I've done wrong.

830
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,020
If you had told us right from the start,

831
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
this matter wouldn't have gotten so serious.

832
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,910
What did you say?

833
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,910
Isn't that true?

834
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,600
You didn't trust me nor my son,

835
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,180
and you didn't trust Yeo Jun either,

836
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,720
<i>that's why I didn't agree to the marriage.</i>

837
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,390
You don't trust any of us,

838
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,010
why would you let your granddaughter
marry into our family?

839
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,500
What kind of reason is that?

840
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,050
Of course, Sang Eun is my granddaughter.

841
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,990
Revealing it is very serious
and create many problems,

842
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,460
that's why you didn't tell us,

843
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,540
isn't that right?

844
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,540
<i>If it were me,</i>

845
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,730
<i>at least I would have made it
clear before the engagement.</i>

846
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,280
<i>Old man, you should have told us earlier,</i>

847
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,760
and not let it leak out
little by little, right?

848
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,750
So you think we cheated you?

849
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,870
Otherwise,

850
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,320
you think I minded because Sang
Eun was an adopted child?

851
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,510
That makes me even more upset.

852
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,750
Don't I know Sang Eun by now?

853
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,840
But this is...

854
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,740
Kyung Tae, you!

855
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,740
You're like family to me,

856
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,810
I've never treated you like an outsider.

857
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,020
Even though the old man likes
to make big statements,

858
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,020
I still thought of you all as family.

859
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,350
But...

860
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,920
<i>in the end, I'm the only
one thinking like that,</i>

861
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,630
in the end, I'm the one who
got betrayed by you all.

862
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,370
This thought alone makes me
think how evil you are.

863
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,990
Are you going to insist on your innocence?

864
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,330
Mother, I'm very sorry,

865
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,450
I mistook your response,

866
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,710
it was totally my ignorance.

867
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,510
Enough.

868
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,660
I know what you're trying to say.

869
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,550
So then...

870
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,080
breaking the engagement...

871
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,100
is really not because of Sang Eun?

872
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,360
Old man!

873
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,910
If that is really what you thought,

874
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,210
then it was all our fault.

875
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,320
I'm not sure if you'd
be sad to hear this but,

876
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,520
<i>I really didn't make effort to think
of the problem from your angle.</i>

877
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,500
I only thought of Sang Eun,

878
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,330
and...

879
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,250
of my daughter, that's all.

880
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,130
Mother,

881
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,790
we'll carry out the marriage as planned.

882
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,620
No!

883
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,930
I will not agree to this marriage.

884
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,930
Daughter-in-law.

885
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,230
Daughter-in-law!

886
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,700
Mother,

887
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,760
he is my son.

888
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,080
You have to consider for me too.

889
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,080
<i>Honey!</i>

890
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:02,950
It has spread to the liver.

891
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,930
More tests are needed to tell
if a surgery can be done.

892
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,280
Even other doctors at our level,

893
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,180
it won't be easy to operate on this.

894
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,990
Mother,

895
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,320
I hope you can get warded for
more tests and treatment.

896
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,610
Forget it.

897
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,600
There's surgery, it's not
like there's no hope.

898
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,670
No, this is...

899
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,750
the punishment I deserve.

900
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,710
Then what about Sang Eun?

901
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,770
Yeo Jun, you're not to let her know.

902
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,210
I won't stay here for too long.

903
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,990
Please?

911
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,600
Please don't say thank you,

912
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,830
<i>and don't say sorry either.</i>

913
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,490
I myself chose to love you,

914
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,370
I didn't love you to make you like me.

915
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:30,750
<i>I don't want Sang Eun to put up
with people's gossips over here,</i>

916
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:34,170
<i>so please take her away.</i>

917
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,190
Your mother is sick,

918
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,570
<i>very sick.</i>

919
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,590
Mom.

920
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,320
<i>I...</i>

921
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,370
<i>even for one day,</i>

922
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,900
<i>I want to live it with Sang Eun.</i>

923
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,680
Mom.
