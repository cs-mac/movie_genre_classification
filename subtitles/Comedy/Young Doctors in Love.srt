00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,401
<i>- Gently now, don't hurt me.
- It won't hurt.</i>

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,641
It hurt.

3
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,042
Is this working?

4
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,162
Good morning. I am Dr. Joseph Prang.

5
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:50,642
Chief of Staff, Chief of Surgery,
Chief of busting balls.

6
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,522
I'm sure you've all come here
with high hopes.

7
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,282
<i>Scalpel. And wonderful dreams.</i>

8
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:58,962
<i>You there with the turtleneck on.
What do you hope to get out of all this?</i>

9
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,763
<i>Walter Rist, New Jersey, Hoboken.</i>

10
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:05,443
<i>I wanna be a psychiatrist...</i>

11
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,483
<i>because I wanna help people
put their twisted, wretched minds...</i>

12
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:10,043
<i>in a more peaceful place.</i>

13
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:11,843
Not a chance, Doctor.

14
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:15,563
<i>Thurman Flicker, Coon Valley, Wisconsin.</i>

15

<i>- Gynecology, I think.
- Next.</i>

16
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,084
<i>Charles Litto. Chicago:</i>

17

<i>Anesthesiologist. I like to pass gas.</i>

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,124
That's wonderful, Dr. Litto.

19
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:28,404
We're down here trying
to save a man's life...

20
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:30,845
and you're up there making fart jokes.

21
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:37,525
<i>My name is Milton Chamberlain,
Miami, Florida.</i>

22
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,085
Proctologist?

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,006
<i>No, sir. Pediatrician.</i>

24
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,565
Young lady, how about you?

25
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,445
<i>Hi.</i>

26
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,365
Hi.

27
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,045
<i>I'm Stephanie Brody, and I'm from Vermont.</i>

28

<i>I want to specialize in rural medicine...</i>

29
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,846

<i>Buck DeVol.

00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>- Yeah. Sports medicine.

33

Phil Burns.

34
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:07,007
And I am from the really ugly part
of Rego Park in Long Island in Queens.

35
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,007
<i>And I had, like, a hideous childhood...</i>

36
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,847
Wait a minute. Excuse me, Burns.

37
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:13,248
Dr. Stevens, who is that?

38
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,568
That's Dr. Byner. He's assisting today.

39
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,687
- Why is he wearing a white cap?
- Excuse me?

40
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:20,888
He's wearing a white cap.
I'm wearing a white cap.

41
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,928
Everybody else is wearing blue caps.

42
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:26,689
Well, we were all out of blue caps,
so I gave him a white cap.

43
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,889
Get him out of here.

44
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,248
I'm sorry, Burns.
You were saying, ugly, hideous...

45
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,568
<i>Yes. To support myself...</i>

46
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:39,129
<i>see, I'm working two jobs to become
an allergist and be somebody.</i>

47
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,329
<i>Thank you.</i>

48
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,689
And the one in the back there.

49
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,849
What's your dream, young man?

50
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:48,529
<i>Dr. Simon August. Beverly Hills, California.</i>

<i>I'm going to be the greatest surgeon
the world has ever known.</i>

52
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
Oh, God, he's gonna want a white cap.

53
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,890
Think fast.

54
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,690
I can promise you all two things.

55
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,411
One: This will be the worst year
of your lives.

56
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:12,371
<i>Two: Those of you who finish
will be the best doctors in the state.</i>

57
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,011
For the next 12 months,
you will learn to hate my guts.

58

<i>I may break some of you.</i>

59
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,372
But those of you who survive will thank me.
Get out of here.

60
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:26,252
That's better. I like your hat.

61
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:30,572
<i>Attention. New interns report for duty
on January 1.</i>

62
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,093
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

63
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:57,934

<i>No parking.</i>

66
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:28,095
I want to go back to the party.

67
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,976
- I'm telling you, we don't have any room.
- I know. Just get his history, Perez.

68
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,656
All right, let's go back in there.
We'll get that fly right out of your ear.

69
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,777
All right, Nick, come on.

70
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,417
Get these people to quit smoking.

71
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,857
- And find that duck.
- The duck?

72
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,257
I'm telling you, find me more help tonight.

73
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,778
Or find yourself a new chief resident.

74
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:00,458
Now, I've got this new intern here for you,
and I found three girls.

75
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:02,738
Three candy-striper volunteers.

76
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:06,178
Two of them are paramedics,
and one worked in publicity.

77
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,619
- I'll take the one with the tits.
- Linda.

78
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:16,779
City Hospital Emergency.
Nurse Chang speaking.

79
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,659
I'll talk to you later.

80
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:19,940
What happened?

81
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,339
- There's a fly in my ear.
- A fly flew into his ear.

82
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,899
A fly in your ear? Let's see.

83
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:28,420
Hello, City Hospital. Emergency.

84
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,580
Emergency in Room A, Dr. Jacobs.

85
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,740
Perez, take care of his fly.

86
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,940
- What the hell are you doing?
- Leave her alone, Mom.

87
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,741
Hey, what the hell's going on?

88
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,701
Tell Jacobs those new interns are here.

89
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:01,582
Good evening.

90
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:06,622
All right, doctors, I have got
an emergency room full of trouble.

91
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:07,622
Let's go.

92
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:11,503
Nurse, sorry, but the schedule says
"Let's Get Acquainted Party, Sunday night."

93
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,462
First day of duty, Monday.

94
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,903
It's still Sunday night. Happy New Year.

95
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,303
Wrong, Doctor.

96
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:21,223
It's 12:03 a.m. You're on duty.

97
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,943
- Let's go, doctors.
- Careful, don't step on Milton.

98
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:26,024
Who do we examine first?

99
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,184
Let's see, there we go, Room 5.

100
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,783
You missed a great party, Doctor.

101
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,504
I didn't become a doctor
to go to parties, Nurse.

102
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,824
I didn't become a doctor
to be called "Nurse."

103
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:39,464
Thank you, Nurse.

104
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:42,024
This is Mr. Langley.

105
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,544
Doctor, I can't piss anymore.

106
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:47,825
- How old are you?
- I'm 82 years old.

107
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,505
You've pissed enough.

108
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,745
For Pete's sake.

109
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,145
I was just joking. He didn't get it.

110
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,185
I didn't get it, either.

111
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:01,026
<i>Inside mob sources say
Godfather Sal Bonafetti...</i>

112

<i>Needless to say, they are
unavailable for comment.</i>

115
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,506
It's New Year's Eve.

116
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,346
I can't stand this fucking hiding anymore.
I wanna go out.

117
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,946
Angelo, listen to me, I wanna go out.

118
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:20,547
There's three fucking families
trying to kill you.

119
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,707
You got no brains? Can I have some coffee?

120
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:25,387
You shouldn't talk to your father that way.

121
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:26,867
Shut your mouth!

122
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,108
I want quiet.

123
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,988
I can't stand this no more. I can't take it.

124
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:40,228
All my life, always screaming.

125
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,908
I can't stand the screaming!

126
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,869
Stop screaming!

127
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,549
- What's the matter, Pop?
- Pop, spit it out.

128
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:56,030
Pop, it's me, it's Angie.

129
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:58,389
- Say something.
- He looks sick.

130
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,629
Will you shut up?

131
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,510
Keep your mouth shut!

132
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,270
We gotta get him to a hospital. Come on.

133
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,830
It's not safe to go out.
We gotta keep him in hiding.

134
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,830
But don't you think letting him die here
defeats the purpose?

135
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,030
He's right.

136
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,631
You disguise Pop, I'll disguise me.

137
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,711
It's gonna be all right, Pop, you'll see.
It's gonna be all right.

138
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,151
Have you got the ambulance yet?

139
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,592
Sir, I can't just get you an ambulance.

140
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,631
- I want the best doctor in the place.
- Does he have any mobility?

141
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,031
- What?
- Mobility?

142
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,272
- His arms, his legs, can he move?
- What are you talking about?

143
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,432
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

144
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,672
He's all better now. Now do me a favor.

145
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,392
Don't tell anybody that
Dr. Buck fixed your duck.

146
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,993
<i>Will one of the interns please report
to Room B?</i>

147
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,714
Then he cornered me
in the back of the bus...

148
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,233
and then he started pulling at my clothes.

149
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:02,794
Did he say anything?

150
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,113
Yeah, he did. He said:

151
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:08,034
"First I'm gonna lick you all over."

152
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:10,393
- Lick?
- Lick.

153
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:13,074
"And then I'm gonna..."

154
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,954
I can't say it.

155
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,474
Here.

156
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:22,235
Write down everything
he was going to do after "lick."

157
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,275
Hello, Rocco, yeah.

158
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:28,155
Look, we got here safe.
The disguises are perfect.

159
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,956
Yeah, but I don't trust nobody.

160
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,436
There's a rumor that the Gallentino family...

161
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:35,356
brought in a hit man from Rhode Island.

162
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,476
<i>Attention. Starting Monday,
all nurses must wear underwear.</i>

163
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,156
- Next time you'll know better.
- But I was...

164
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,916
No, Dr. Prang won't let us break the rules.

165
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,597
- What's your name?
- Salvatore is his name.

166
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:04,398
- Does he have Blue Cross?
- Yeah, he's got everything.

167
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,318
Are you the wife?

168
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,437
Is this "This is Your Life" or something?

169
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:10,678
Would you please find a room for him, lady?

170
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,638
Don't have any rooms. He'll go in the ward.

171
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,558
- Check first.
- I just checked. We're full.

172
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:17,558
Please, lady,
would you call the room people?

173
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,519
There might have been a cancellation.

174
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,918
I'm a doctor, you're cured.
Get the hell out of here.

175
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,998
Who are you?

176
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,879
That's my cousin Guido.
And this here's my husband.

177
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,479
- Nice to meet you.
- Get the other guy.

178
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,159
My name is Mickey Callaghan,
and I paid for this room.

179
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,919
Yeah, so what? Who cares?

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
Get out of here.
You're going home, you're all better.

181
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,960
Are you my doctor?

182
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,079
Yeah, my uniform's in the laundry.

183
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,200
Hello, hospital?
Yes, there's an empty room now.

184
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,920
- You can send up Mr. Bonafetti.
- You're always on the phone.

185
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,880
It's amazing. There is a room.

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,401
It's a miracle.

187
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:51,960
Excuse me.

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,081
How long has he been like this?

189
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:56,081
Since the war. Who gives a damn?

190
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,321
Have you seen Valerie or Bunny,
those girls in the red striped dress?

191
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:03,161
- We're over here, Miss Chang.
- We're over here.

192
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,841
Nurse Sprockett is looking for you.

193
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,202
Here's what he said.
Now don't read it out loud.

194
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,643
"I'm gonna suck...

195
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,322
"And then I'll...

196
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,203
"...your brains out."

197
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:27,283
A sick, perverted human being.

198
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,563
He ought to be hung up by his things.

199
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,763
Nurse Chang.

200
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:36,403
Get this woman a place to lie down
until she's ready to go home.

201
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,723
Thank you.

202
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,723
Just wait till I tell you
what happened to me on the bus.

203
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:43,964
Officer, thank you.

204
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,964
These are neat.

205
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,764
Are you a waitress?

206
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,604
No. I'm a prostitute.

207
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,724
I just wear these to turn on the guys.

208
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,685
How far along is she?

209
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,764
Well, she doesn't know exactly,
but she's huge.

210
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,445
All right, young lady, you'll have
a beautiful baby in no time.

211
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,285
I don't think so, Doctor.

212
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,086
What? What are you talking about?

213
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:10,565
Hysterical pregnancy.

214
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,046
She wants a straight life so badly,
she's convinced herself she's pregnant.

215
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,486
Doctor, this girl is in heavy labor.

216
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,846
It's just not so, Doctor.

217
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,526
Get out.

218
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:28,807
Thank you, Doctor.

219
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:31,967
- What happened? Was that a balloon?
- Next.

220
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,647
Poor kid.

221
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:40,327
I never knew it was possible
for a medical doctor to be so unfeeling.

222
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,447
It sounds to me
like you're falling in love with him.

223
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,568
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

224
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,648
I'm 27.

225
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,409
Hold me, like you held that duck.

226
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,249
We're gonna take good
care of your dad. Okay?

227
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,890
Yeah, that's nice of you.

228
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,730
You don't have to worry
your pretty face about it.

229
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:51,652
<i>Dr. Pepper, please report
to the Diabetes Ward at once.</i>

230
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:09,253
Sal? Is that you?

231
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,973
It is you.

232
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:19,214
Got yourself a big private room, huh?

233
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:22,053
All alone.

234
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:23,814
That's nice.

235
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,695
I got a little something for you.

236
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:31,294
A goodbye kiss from the Gallentino family.

237
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:37,735
The Gallentino family
always kisses on the nose.

238
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,615
Not in my hospital.

239
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,855
What did you put up there?

240
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,616
Move and you'll be shitting glass for a week.

241
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,336
Thank you, ladies.

242
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,376
What's your name?

243
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,256
- Malamud.
- Where are your records?

244
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:56,936
I don't know, I lost them.

245
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,256
Well, I'll find them. What's wrong with you?

246
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:01,456
I'm sick, okay?

247
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,256
You sure are, pal.

248
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:09,057
And so, without further fuss,
I give you the ever-diligent...

249
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:12,017
Dr. Oliver Ludwig.

250
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,338
- Doctors.
- Hello.

251
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,017
Welcome.

252
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:23,338
Here in Pathology, we consult the dead...

253
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:26,898
and ask them how we may cure the living.

254
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:31,019
Here we interpret the messages
the body sends us.

255
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:34,538
Messages found in substances...

256
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,739
the uninformed find disgusting.

257
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,259
They are not disgusting, they are beautiful.

258
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:44,219
They are the literature of pathology.

259
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,699
The human being emits, oozes, secretes...

260
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,100
excretes, salivates, urinates,
menstruates, lactates...

261
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,700
evacuates, expectorates...

262
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,820
and ejaculates.

263
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,221
You left out regurgitates.

264
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,500
Don't help me, Kurtzman.

265
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:08,780
Now, there are more than
twenty vital bodily fluids.

266
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,981
And I'm proud to say that I have
tasted every one of them.

267
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:14,541
This urine, for example.

268
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,461
What will it tell us?

269
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:26,302
Definite sugar taste.

270
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:30,142
Now I don't need a battery of tests
to tell me...

271
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,582
that the patient has a slight
pre-diabetic condition.

272
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,663
Doctor, will you confirm my findings?

273
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,902
No, thank you, I'm trying to cut down.

274
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,262
That's an order, Doctor.

275
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,503
I know my limit.

276
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,624
No sugar.

277
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,624
No sugar taste, the doctor says.

278
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:59,024
Just my little way of showing you that...

279
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:03,064
there's something far more important
to the pathologist than taste.

280
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:05,784
That is the power of observation.

281
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:09,625
If you had been observing, Doctor,
you would have seen that I put...

282
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,984
this finger in the urine,
but I put this finger in my mouth.

283
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,825
Lesson number one, Doctor.

284
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:22,106
Yes, but if you had
tasted the specimen, Doctor...

285
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,986
you would have noticed
a dangerously high level of fractoids.

286
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:28,065
This patient has pituitary thrombosis.

287
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,546
Well, let me see that.

288
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,466
Tastes like plain old piss to me, Doctor.

289
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:47,907
With a slight metallic flavor,
indicating a high level of zinc.

290
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,507
Doctor, here, you try.

291
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,868
No, wait. Just a minute.

292
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,347
I didn't really taste the urine.
I was just kidding.

293
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,348
You what?

294
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:07,348
I did the same thing he did.
I switched fingers. I thought it was obvious.

295
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,429
Can I have a word with you, Doctor?

296
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:13,628
You might have made a fool
out of some of my colleagues...

297
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,029
but you'll have to get up early
to put one over...

298
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,629
on Dr. Oliver Wendell Ludwig.

299
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,789
Now you look at this face, what do you see?

300
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,709
I see alcohol poisoning...

301
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,069
and prosiasis in the tertiary stage.

302
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,430
Get out.

303
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,510
- Out! All of you!
- I think we've been dismissed.

304
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,630
Get out, every one of you.

305
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,430
- What did I say?
- Come on.

306
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
Where's the little guy?

307
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,151
What are you doing tonight, Simon?

308
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,111
I thought I might learn some of this stuff.

309
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,070
Drop out? You okay, man?

310
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,871
Who is in charge of pills and drugs
here at this hospital?

311
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,071
Nurse Sprockett.

312
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:54,712
Do you think she can get me
some speed or some uppers?

313
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,912
I guess she might, if she likes you enough.

314
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,432
She likes me?

315
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,832
You won't believe the note
that she gave me. Read that.

316
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,592
You know, some of these words have never
been said in the State of Wisconsin.

317
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:11,632
She's an animal.

318
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,273
Hi, remember me?

319
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:18,072
I'm the doctor you saw
when you were first admitted.

320
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:21,393
I'm sorry. Walter Rist.

321
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:26,713
Anyway...

322
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:32,954
Yes, I know, and I'm sorry.
But it was the only bed available.

323
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,394
And I knew you'd prefer it
to the Mental Ward.

324
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:42,875
Okay, I'm gonna give it to you straight.
You're paralyzed with fear.

325
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,755
But then again,
maybe you already knew that.

326
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,515
You're safe here. Nobody can harm you.

327
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,275
I promise you that.

328
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,836
<i>In them old cotton fields back home</i>

329
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,396
<i>Well, it was down in Louisiana</i>

330
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,317
<i>just about a mile from Texarkana</i>

331
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:19,516
<i>In them old cotton fields back home</i>

332
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,237
Where do you want me to lick you first?

333
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:37,518
<i>When them cotton balls get rotten</i>

334
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,958
<i>You can't pick very much cotton</i>

335
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:45,038
- I'm glad you asked me out, Stephanie.
- You fascinate me, Simon.

336
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,719
I've never been out
with such an insensitive genius.

337
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,678
Thank you. Now, tell me
all about Burnaby Mountain.

338
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,559
It's where I live. It's in Vermont.

339
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,839
My father was the only doctor.

340
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,199
He used to work 24 hours...

341
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,920
and half the time
people couldn't even pay him.

342
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
They used to give him chickens
and stuff like that.

343
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,320
Anyway...

344
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,800
when he died, everybody knew
that he wanted me to be a doctor.

345
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,240
So they took up a collection
to send me to medical school...

346
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,201
to return to Burnaby Mountain...

347
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,720
to take up where my dad left off.

348
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:21,081
They're all praying for me, Simon,
the whole town.

349
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,521
They paid him with chickens?

350
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:27,681
Why would anyone
practice in a silly place like that?

351
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:34,561
Stephanie? What did I say?

352
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:40,882
Stephanie.

353
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,883
Stephanie, what is it?

354
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,242
It's nothing. I'm fine.

355
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:52,643
You, get your hand out of there.

356
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,322
- Check, please.
- I had two salads.

357
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:59,123
Curtain time. Good morning, Sal.

358
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:01,883
Here's your breakfast.

359
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:12,404
Stop fooling around.

360
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:15,764
Now get back in that bed.
Today's your lucky day.

361
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,764
- What day?
- Your surgery day.

362
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,085
We found your records.

363
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,485
What surgery? What records?
I ain't getting no surgery.

364
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,885
What are you doing to me?

365
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:27,845
Now, Mr. M. Callahan.

366
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:29,485
Who's Callahan?

367
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,885
- Malamud Callahan.
- What?

368
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:36,885
Now, lots of people lead
perfectly normal lives with only one kidney.

369
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,566
What?

370
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,805
All right, ladies. Moving out.

371
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,486
One kidney?

372
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,166
Wait!

373
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,247
Here it is.

374
00:22:57,286 --> 00:23:00,847
Okay, see if you can
raise the bed now, Emilia.

375
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,048
No good.

376
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,688
This is a 35-year-old woman.

377
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:13,488
- Who did the workup?
- Me.

378
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:16,168
She has all the symptoms
of a thyroid disease.

379
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,649
She has a very strange pain in her nose.

380
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,328
We'll have to examine her.

381
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,968
All right,
you wanna spread your nostrils for me?

382
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,408
Any more mystery pains, Stephanie?

383
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,408
Everyone gets dizzy once in a while, Simon.

384
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:30,289
Destroying an entire restaurant?

385
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,169
This is no small matter.

386
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,209
No snow up there.

387
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,769
If it bothers you, we won't go out.
I have other dates.

388
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,850
Litto asked me out,
Thurman Flicker asked me out.

389
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,850
Back on your box.

390
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,570
I hope you turned them down.

391
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,410
- You do?
- Yes.

392
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:56,851
Involvement with hospital staff
could only end in disaster.

393
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:01,011
Any romance now would be ludicrous,
and counterproductive to our studies.

394
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:02,851
Terrific.

395
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:07,251
We'll spend every single moment studying,
all year long.

396
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,771
You'll make a fine doctor, Stephanie.
Keep up the good work.

397
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,051
Yes, simple vitamin A deficiency.

398
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,852
I think you get that from carrots.

399
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:22,372
What? Vitamin A, or the deficiency?

400
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:25,532
- Burns.
- Hemorrhoids.

401
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:29,933
I know you're holding a couple of jobs
to pay your way through here.

402
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:32,173
If you can't handle it, get out.

403
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:35,053
Yes, Mr. Fitkin.

404
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:39,294
Doctors, we have here a man
who was admitted with severe...

405
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,653
abdominal pains and back spasms.

406
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,213
What is your diagnosis?

407
00:24:43,294 --> 00:24:44,813
I'd say gallbladder.

408
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:47,413
- You say gallbladder?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:50,654
Dr. Litto, your gallbladder is located here.

410
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:52,694
Appendix here.

411
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:55,854
Spleen, liver, kidneys!

412
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,455
It's important you learn to tell
one from the other.

413
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:03,535
Now, this patient is suffering
from a simple kidney infection. Next.

414
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:13,655
Here we have general malaise,
hair falling out...

415
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:16,416
pain in the extremities,
disgusting appearance.

416
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,896
Dr. August, what is your diagnosis?

417
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,576
Myasthenia chroepsis.

418
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:24,176
That's very good. Can you prove that?

419
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:27,616
No sir. Neither can you. No one can.

420
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:28,657
Why not?

421
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,377
We won't know for sure until the autopsy.

422
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,096
I don't believe you, Simon.

423
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:35,016
That was real sensitive.

424
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:38,337
- What did I say?
- Think, Simon.

425
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,497
I don't know if he'll ever be... Hi, Milt.

426
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:47,338
I don't know if he'll ever be
the warm, loving dad...

427
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:50,578
that you so desperately need,
but we'll give it a try.

428
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:54,538
You know, in a sense,
we're all to blame for Sal.

429
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:56,698
<i>Your attention please.</i>

430
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:01,019
<i>Due to a mix-up in Urology,
no apple juice will be served this morning.</i>

431
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,779
Hi.

432
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,219
Just mellow out.

433
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,499
I'm sorry about what happened
the other day.

434
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,419
You gave me that note, what do you expect?

435
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:14,900
What note?

436
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:16,380
In Emergency.

437
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,660
I didn't write that note.

438
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:32,861
Do I smell Bal de Versailles?

439
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:35,861
You might.

440
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,700
It's my scent.

441
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,981
I thought so. Here.

442
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,022
It's my way of saying that I'm sorry.

443
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,661
Don't play with a nurse's affections, Doctor.

444
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:49,902
I mean it. If I didn't have three jobs,
it would be very different for me.

445
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,062
Three jobs?

446
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,222
Is that why you're so tired all the time?

447
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:57,222
Intern, umpire, and dancehall guy.

448
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,822
$1 a dance. $1.50 for the rumba.

449
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:03,743
Well, you poor man.

450
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,463
How do you do it?

451
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:08,702
Basically it's a box step.
I'd like to share it with you.

452
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,184
Walk.

453
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,584
Back.

454
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:25,384
Walk.

455
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,584
Now, see the sun.

456
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,185
Now feel the space, turn.

457
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,704
Now up and dip.

458
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:42,425
Yeah, that's good.

459
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:46,386
Now come on, show me where your
mother lives. Yeah, right there, come on.

460
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,706
Remember "The Pony"?

461
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,347
Why are we stopping?

462
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:07,546
I am so tired, I have no energy.
I can't do anything.

463
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,707
- I'm falling apart.
- You poor man.

464
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:11,747
- It's terrible for me.
- Perhaps...

465
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:15,387
An upper would be so friendly right now.

466
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:17,147
So if you have anything...

467
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,788
it would be so lovely.

468
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:21,947
- Do you always wear that key?
- I'm married to this key.

469
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,428
- Okey-dokey.
- What a selection.

470
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:29,148
- Now just one.
- One.

471
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,588
- I feel better already.
- Yeah.

472
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,148
"Guajina" is the bird.

473
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:52,149
The dance ends with a big finish.

474
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,229
It's one, two, three, and up.

475
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,910
That was really good, what you did there.

476
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,470
I believed it, you danced,
you used the space, it was terrific.

477
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,071
It was nice.

478
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:16,071
"N. Sprockett."

479
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:18,032
What does the "N" mean?

480
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:19,991
Norine.

481
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:22,871
- Can I call you Norine?
- Sure.

482
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,471
- Doctor...
- Phil.

483
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:28,952
Phil.

484
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:31,112
Norine?

485
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:34,792
I think I could learn to be crazy about you.

486
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:50,313
Phil.

487
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,753
<i>Good morning. City Hospital.</i>

488
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:56,034
Ready for surgery, Doctor?

489
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,793
Tell me, did Elizabeth Taylor call?

490
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:02,754
Elizabeth Taylor did not call,
and you are not ready for surgery.

491
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,594
That's funny. I thought sure she'd call.

492
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,794
I met her at the wedding. She looked at me
with those big violet eyes.

493
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,795
- I thought she would call.
- Would I tell you wrong?

494
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:13,194
You wouldn't be jealous, would you, Nurse?

495
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:15,955
<i>City Hospital. Happy Valentine's Day.</i>

496
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,675
- How are you feeling?
- Lousy. My laryngitis is killing me.

497
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,755
Couldn't find a doctor.

498
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:25,116
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Yes?

499
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:26,915
- Is the doctor around?
- No.

500
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:35,036
- Excuse me, Miss, is the doctor around?
- No.

501
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:39,316
<i>Good morning, Happy Saint Patrick's Day.</i>

502
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:41,236
Let me see if I have this straight.

503
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:44,397
You were shaving, you slipped,
you cut your nose off.

504
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,517
Then you dropped your razor
and cut your toe off.

505
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,638
Doctor made a mistake,
he sewed your toe onto your face...

506
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:52,717
and your nose onto your foot.

507
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:57,237
And your complaint is that every time
you sneeze, you blow your shoe off.

508
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:58,757
That's silly.

509
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,678
<i>City Hospital. Happy Easter.</i>

510
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,918
<i>Attention, at exactly 3:00 p. M...</i>

511
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:13,318
<i>all hospital electricity
will be turned off for five minutes.</i>

512
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,318
<i>At 2:59 p.m. All patients in oxygen tents...</i>

513
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,959
<i>- should take a deep breath and hold it.
- Where's Dr. Rist?</i>

514
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,319
<i>- Thank you.
- He's right over there.</i>

515
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,280
Hello, Doctor.

516
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,359
- No, don't get up.
- Angela.

517
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,600
It's all right, I'll find a place.

518
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,160
Excuse me, sir.

519
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,400
Could you move over there,
give me a chance?

520
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,520
The light's better over there.

521
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,761
Could you hold this for a second?

522
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,761
All right, that's it. Over here.

523
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,841
Thank you. You're very cute.

524
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:52,521
- Thank you very much.
- This is for my father.

525
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:53,561
I knew that.

526
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:55,481
- Please sit.
- No, after you.

527
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,641
No, please. Sit down, will you?

528
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:03,802
It's good to see you, Angela.

529
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,122
How's my pop?

530
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:07,922
- The same.
- The same?

531
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:12,442
Hello, Stephanie. How's everything?

532
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:15,882
<i>Your attention please.</i>

533
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:18,243
<i>ET, phone home.</i>

534
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:24,203
I don't get a chance to be alone too much
because I have a large family.

535
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:28,523
I like cooking, cooking is nice.
And I read a book once.

536
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:32,084
I like to go to the ballgame.
What about you?

537
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:33,123
Me?

538
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:36,164
Well, I guess...

539
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:39,844
I'm basically into sharing.

540
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:45,204
Sunsets on wintry beaches, cats...

541
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:48,525
and relating over a fine bottle of wine.

542
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,685
What about you, Angela?

543
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:53,165
Me?

544
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:56,485
My father didn't take me out a lot.

545
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,085
There was the track, and there was Vegas.

546
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,726
But like a fucking museum
or a fucking concert, like fucking forget it.

547
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,685
- I like music.
- Music? Yeah?

548
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:11,006
I thought I heard a song in your heart.

549
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,527
No, what I meant was...

550
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:18,566
I thought that you were musically inclined.

551
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,887
Did you ever sing, or play any instrument?

552
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:23,487
Fucking guitar.

553
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,967
Is that a special kind of guitar?

554
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:31,047
- No, it's regular.
- All righty.

555
00:33:32,088 --> 00:33:33,288
I studied when I was a kid...

556
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,687
but I broke it on my brother's head
and went to work.

557
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:38,488
Do you ever feel sad...

558
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:41,568
that you were denied some of those things?

559
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:43,648
No, you know...

560
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:47,409
you grow up fucking insensitive.

561
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,169
Yeah.

562
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,930
Okay, turn.

563
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,650
Jump.

564
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,810
Stephanie.

565
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,250
You can turn that off a minute.
I'll be right back in just one minute.

566
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,730
Stephanie, I'm not always that quick
on the uptake as regards...

567
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,451
It seems to me like,
in the last couple of months...

568
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,771
your attitude towards me has undergone
something of a change.

569
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:32,251
You noticed?

570
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,411
It's called the cold shoulder, Simon.

571
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:37,372
And it's exactly
what the doctor prescribed, Doctor.

572
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,771
I don't follow you.

573
00:34:39,972 --> 00:34:43,852
"A romance now would be ludicrous,
and counterproductive to our studies."

574
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:47,612
I guess that might have sounded
a little stuffy, Stephie.

575
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,653
- Slightly, Simon.
- Look.

576
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,133
Do you think a couple of tickets
to the ballet might help?

577
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,893
You bought those tickets?

578
00:34:56,973 --> 00:34:58,893
No, they were given to me by a patient.

579
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,573
Close enough. You were a rotten first date.

580
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,973
But I'm willing to give it another try.

581
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,854
How are you on the second date?

582
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:09,253
I don't know. I've never had one.

583
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:12,894
- Cut out the mushy stuff.
- Let's dance.

584
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,054
Okay.

585
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:24,655
Clap.

586
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:27,614
Jump.

587
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:44,176
- Stephanie.
- This is a dumb dance.

588
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,616
- What is it?
- I think it's supposed to be punk.

589
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,856
I'm fine. It's okay.

590
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,296
I just get dizzy sometimes, that's all.

591
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:53,696
Let's go jump in the lake.

592
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,576
Yeah, let's go swimming.

593
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:56,777
Thank you, orphans.

594
00:35:57,057 --> 00:36:00,497
These dizzy spells are not normal.
I'd like to do some tests on you.

595
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:01,817
I'm sure it's nothing.

596
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:05,858
Come on.

597
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:08,698
When you were a kid,
did you play "Spit in the Lake"?

598
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,618
No. Why would anyone play that?

599
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:15,498
The idea is to see who can spit the farthest.
I used to be the champ.

600
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:19,018
- You play games?
- Yeah, I play games.

601
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,939
I bet I could beat you.

602
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:24,818
No. It's the only game my father
would let me play, I'm very good at it.

603
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,939
We'll see. You go first.

604
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:29,819
Okay.

605
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,659
Forget it. You can't win.

606
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,499
Awfully cocky.

607
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,460
Simon, I want that back.
Give me my spit back.

608
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,100
No. Sorry.

609
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,741
At least tell me what you think I have.

610
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:59,780
No. Because I could be wrong.

611
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,901
Simon, you're never wrong.

612
00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:03,581
That's true.

613
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:07,461
Do you think you could just hold me?

614
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,262
<i>Good morning. Medication time.</i>

615
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,742
<i>Attention. Dr. Prang has refused
to meet with our strike committee.</i>

616
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,422
<i>So we urge nurses not to work very hard.</i>

617
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,143
Take this spit.

618
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:30,382
Whose is it?

619
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:32,543
I don't know. Baryshnikov.

620
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:39,383
No, this is Stephanie Brody's spit here
on the ballet ticket, I see...

621
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:41,304
that Dr. August keeps on bugging us about.

622
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:42,303
Who's that?

623
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,504
That brilliant young intern,
who figured out with the two fingers.

624
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,624
- That smartass, yeah.
- That's right.

625
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:51,264
I see here he wants a Nederlander's,
a trilateral myopia.

626
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:53,504
He wants a Lastfogel's process.

627
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:57,664
Wait a minute.
You know about that Lastfogel test?

628
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:58,824
Sure.

629
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,465
I haven't seen anything about it
in the "National Enquirer."

630
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:03,585
No, it was in "People" magazine.

631
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,185
With the trilateral myopia...

632
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:09,145
and the Nederlander's,
you can only be pretty sure.

633
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:13,146
But with this Lastfogel's test,
you are 100% sure.

634
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,345
<i>Paging Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.</i>

635
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,667
Dr. Prang's office.
Miss Pendergast speaking.

636
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:30,586
No, I do not want to talk to the nurses.

637
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,226
No, they'll never strike.

638
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:35,187
They're dedicated people,
for God's sake. Yes?

639
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,107
Sarah.

640
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:41,587
Sarah, you've got to understand,
I am supervising 20 interns.

641
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:46,028
I am running the surgery department of
one of the largest hospitals in the country...

642
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,068
and I'm sitting on 12 medical committees.

643
00:38:48,147 --> 00:38:52,068
Now, I don't have time to talk to you
or your divorce attorney. Is that clear?

644
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:53,948
Good! Hello?

645
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:56,548
Oscar? What did E.F. Hutton say?

646
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:00,828
What do you mean,
another $200,000, Oscar?

647
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:03,069
Where is it coming from, Oscar?

648
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,349
Where is it coming from, man?

649
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,309
I was told you wanted to see me, Doctor.

650
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,869
Dr. August, come in.

651
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:16,390
You didn't want to use
the telephone, did you?

652
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:18,229
- No.
- Good.

653
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,110
I've been hearing a great deal about you
from your fellow interns.

654
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,910
Evidently they think you're quite an asshole.

655
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,190
- I like that.
- Thank you, sir.

656
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:33,391
Doctor, I've decided to let you take out
an appendix, a gallbladder, whatever.

657
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,031
Something wrong?

658
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,831
No. Nothing.

659
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:42,951
The whole idea is to see whether you have
what it takes to do your residency with me.

660
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,471
I'm very anxious to see how you cut.

661
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:50,912
Pendergast. Excuse me.

662
00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:58,152
Hello? Yeah. Milton, it's for you.

663
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:03,673
You guys hear the scuttlebutt?
Prang is gonna let Simon cut.

664
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,193
Why is he chewing on a ball?

665
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,113
He broke up with Julie.

666
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,393
You know, relationships can be hard.

667
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:18,234
- Take Angela for instance...
- She's a hooker.

668
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:19,273
She is?

669
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,193
Julie, she's a hooker.

670
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,514
Her voice is changing all the time.

671
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:30,114
My mom and dad,
they went to church every Sunday.

672
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,714
Her father murdered her mother.

673
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:34,675
- Murdered?
- He's in prison.

674
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:39,155
I like her. She's a good kid.
She brings me presents.

675
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,675
She wants to give up hooking but...

676
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:45,276
I don't know. I'm a doctor.

677
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:49,995
I can't hang around with hookers.
Do you ever have any relationships?

678
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:52,636
Relationships? Yeah, I've had a few.

679
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,796
But then again, too few to mention.

680
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:58,876
I don't know.

681
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:05,516
I saw that.

682
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,317
So what? Are you a cop?

683
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,717
I'm a stranger. Don't look at me.

684
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,837
- Can you get some more of those?
- More of what?

685
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:17,397
Pills, man. Reds, whites, whatever.

686
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:20,877
Might mean a little extra scratch for you.

687
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:22,678
Pay off a loan or two.

688
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:24,237
How do you know about that?

689
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:25,998
All interns have loans.

690
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:30,158
Meet me here same time next week
with the goods, all right?

691
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:33,358
I'll be in disguise, but you'll know me
by the password:

692
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:34,919
- Vanilla.
- Manila.

693
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:36,878
- No, vanilla.
- Vanilla.

694
00:41:38,678 --> 00:41:40,558
Can I look at you now?

695
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,080
You look beautiful.

696
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,840
You really look nice.

697
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:26,482
Seven months, I've been in this
stinking hospital, Sal.

698
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:30,122
The Gallentino family's losing money.

699
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:35,882
Do you realize the hell I've been
going through since I've been here?

700
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,803
They've made me drink chalk.

701
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:44,203
They stuck a tube up my ass.

702
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:46,002
They took x-rays.

703
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:49,843
They got this little camera on a wire.

704
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:53,163
They stuffed it up my wang.

705
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:56,644
I've had a lot of things
done to the old wang...

706
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:58,923
but Roto-Rooter ain't one of them.

707
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,164
Should I try it?

708
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:08,164
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have here a 46-year-old male...

709
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:10,004
with an inflamed appendix.

710
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,085
It will be removed by a 27-year-old male.

711
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:14,964
With an inflamed ego.

712
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,445
Do you really think that's funny?

713
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:19,085
Dr. August.

714
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,725
Well?

715
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:24,885
Well, what?

716
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:26,925
Start slicing.

717
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:33,806
<i>Yes.</i>

718
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:54,527
Doctor, if you plan to remove the appendix,
you will have to break the skin.

719
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:06,408
Simon's really starting to look like a doctor.

720
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:09,208
Lyle, he should be playing football.

721
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,009
Don't be silly, June.

722
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:13,648
He'll save his hands for surgery,
just like I did.

723
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:16,489
Doctor, it's time for your birthday party.

724
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:19,249
We lose the room in an hour, Doctor.

725
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:22,409
- You're a great surgeon, Dad.
- You're a great surgeon, too, my boy.

726
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,089
Simon's going to be a great surgeon.

727
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,609
Simon, show all your doctor friends
how you operate.

728
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:29,209
- Cut out the pinata's appendix.
- Yes, Father.

729
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,089
Show Grandpa how you cut.

730
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,130
Cut him.

731
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,530
Cut, Simon.

732
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:46,371
No, I can't.

733
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:49,691
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:52,731
This is the world's greatest surgeon?

735
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:59,452
Some people call it rookie-itis.

736
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,412
Some people call it intern nerves.

737
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,972
Me? I call it chickenshit.

738
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,412
We will all remember Spot Moscowitz...

739
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:14,332
because when he was alive,
he remembered all of us.

740
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:18,653
A devoted father, beloved husband,
and could catch a Frisbee in his mouth.

741
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,334
Do you come here often?

742
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:39,614
Yes.

743
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:42,694
Yes, I come here to see our mistakes.

744
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:47,134
It inspires me to think
that I could have saved some of these lives.

745
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,934
They made fun of me, Stephanie.
They laughed at me in the operating room.

746
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,895
They said I was no good.

747
00:45:53,255 --> 00:45:55,775
Simon, there are other careers in medicine...

748
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:58,255
that don't require surgical technique:

749
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:02,376
Radiology, cardiology,
dermatology, endocrinology.

750
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:04,255
I have to be a surgeon!

751
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,856
I know that I can overcome this fear of mine.

752
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:12,096
It's going to take some time.

753
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:16,576
Will you help me, Stephanie?

754
00:46:21,337 --> 00:46:23,737
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't ask.

755
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:38,257
There's no other place to go, Simon.

756
00:46:38,497 --> 00:46:39,938
Look, I just...

757
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:42,498
I just don't think I'm...

758
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:46,019
I think I have a problem in this room.

759
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:49,699
I just don't think that I'm gonna be able to...

760
00:46:50,298 --> 00:46:52,819
That I'm going to be able to function.

761
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,339
There's only one cure for that.

762
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:57,579
Me.

763
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,179
I'm as scared as you are.

764
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:06,139
I'm even more scared than you are.

765
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,060
I've never even been in this room
with my regular clothes on before.

766
00:47:31,341 --> 00:47:32,581
What is it?

767
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,621
Heimlich maneuver. Come on, relax.

768
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,542
Take it easy. One, two, three.

769
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,862
You got it?

770
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:46,542
Please, be careful what you swallow.

771
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:49,462
I'll sew it on for you tomorrow.

772
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:14,344
Put that phone down.

773
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,864
You're always on the phone.
Who are you talking to?

774
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:19,504
- I'm tired of hiding.
- I'm tired of you.

775
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:22,504
- Angelo.
- What?

776
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:24,785
You're spending a lot of time at the hospital.

777
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:27,465
My father's in there. I'm sacrificing myself.

778
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,585
Suppose I get killed looking like that.
It could ruin my reputation.

779
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:32,705
That Dr. Rist called again.

780
00:48:33,065 --> 00:48:34,825
- When?
- This afternoon.

781
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:38,825
- What did he sound like?
- He sounded like a doctor.

782
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:40,745
He's a very good doctor.

783
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:43,706
- Angelo.
- What?

784
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:47,146
Are you getting funny?

785
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,707
I'll give you funny. Come over here.

786
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,586
Where'd you put my purse?

787
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,867
I'm glad I dragged you in here.

788
00:49:07,507 --> 00:49:09,987
I guess I can function in this room.

789
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:14,187
I was never worried about that.

790
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:18,388
I was worried about the tests.

791
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:21,508
But now, no matter what happens
with the tests...

792
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:23,988
I will have had sex with you.

793
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,148
<i>You call that sex?</i>

794
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:33,549
<i>Now let's try it again,
and stop chatting so much.</i>

795
00:49:33,629 --> 00:49:36,349
- Dr. Ludwig!
- How long have you been there?

796
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:40,189
<i>Let's just say I loved it
when you bit his buttons.</i>

797
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,949
Doctor, what are you doing up there?

798
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,870
<i>I've been looking all over for you two.
I have the test results.</i>

799
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,830
<i>- And?
- Negative. Every one.</i>

800
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,830
You did the Lastfogel's process
and everything?

801
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,590
<i>I did everything, even the Lastfogel.</i>

802
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,471
Thank you, Doctor.

803
00:50:13,871 --> 00:50:15,472
Was there anything else?

804
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:18,712
<i>No, go right ahead.
I'll just stay here and observe.</i>

805
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:20,912
Beat it, Doctor.

806
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:26,112
No, I didn't mean that. I mean, leave.

807
00:50:32,913 --> 00:50:34,753
<i>Will you stay with me, Stephanie?</i>

808
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:37,313
<i>I can't stay in Beverly Hills, Simon.</i>

809
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:40,553
<i>They're waiting for me in Burnaby Mountain.</i>

810
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:53,954
But you didn't do the Lastfogel's test.

811
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:58,434
<i>Good morning, Happy Labor Day.</i>

812
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:01,435
No pulse.

813
00:51:02,075 --> 00:51:03,435
We lost him.

814
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,714
He's alive.

815
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:10,555
I've got to get this watch fixed.
Welcome back.

816
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,675
<i>Good morning, Happy Halloween.</i>

817
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:17,235
Mrs. Bauer, I don't like the way
your husband looks.

818
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:20,596
I don't either, but he's good to the children.

819
00:51:20,675 --> 00:51:22,596
<i>Good afternoon. Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

820
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:25,196
I looked in your mouth...

821
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:27,836
checked your breasts...

822
00:51:28,076 --> 00:51:30,316
probed every part of your body.

823
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:32,677
Well, what's wrong with me?

824
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,877
How should I know? I'm a lawyer.

825
00:51:35,517 --> 00:51:37,757
<i>Merry Christmas. City Hospital.</i>

826
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,437
You need a dime?

827
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:49,038
Here, I got it. Put it right in there.

828
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:50,798
Thank you very much.

829
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:52,357
You know, I was wondering...

830
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:55,118
there's this big party tonight
at Dr. Prang's home.

831
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:56,638
A lot of broads?

832
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:01,158
There'll be a lot of, you know,
other women there to chat with.

833
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:03,119
I love fucking chatting.

834
00:52:03,238 --> 00:52:04,718
- You do?
- Yeah.

835
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:07,158
Come on, pick up the fucking phone.

836
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,159
I thought maybe you'd want to go.

837
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:12,759
- Yeah, sure.
- You would?

838
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:14,799
- It's not much of a notice.
- That's all right.

839
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:16,839
Pick up the fucking phone.

840
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,040
Hello, Rocco, this is Angie.

841
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,559
Pop's fine.
He's gonna have a peaceful Christmas.

842
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:26,360
That's good.

843
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,561
Seven operations, Sal.

844
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:40,721
Forty-two stitches.

845
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,641
A year in this crummy hospital.

846
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:47,681
This Mr. Callahan was a sick man.

847
00:52:57,722 --> 00:52:59,362
Okey-dokey.

848
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:06,322
Have a nice trip, Sal.

849
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:26,244
It must be difficult for Dr. Prang
after his divorce.

850
00:53:26,323 --> 00:53:28,244
I hear he throws a wild party, though.

851
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:30,724
I want it to be a nice, cozy party.

852
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:34,964
You know, the kind
with chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

853
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,924
Hi, welcome to Dr. Prang's party.

854
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,804
- Hello.
- How do you do?

855
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,085
You should have that dark mole removed.

856
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:43,405
- You mean this one here?
- The light ones can stay...

857
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:45,525
- Simon.
- Do you get keloids?

858
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:49,685
- Where's Dr. Prang?
- He's in his room, resting.

859
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:55,486
Doctor.

860
00:54:00,726 --> 00:54:03,366
- I knew it.
- What?

861
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:06,966
- I'm fucking overdressed.
- No you're not. You look beautiful.

862
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,127
Now you can say anything you want.

863
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:21,087
I want to grease down...

864
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:26,168
and slide all over your body like a snake.

865
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,128
I'd like that.

866
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,168
"Drink to me only with thine eyes."

867
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,968
Relax, take off your key.

868
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,129
Look, the margaritas are ready.

869
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:49,009
You're a doctor, aren't you?
You must make a lot of money.

870
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,330
No, actually I'm an intern.

871
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:52,769
Goodbye.

872
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:55,329
Excuse me, are you rich?

873
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:59,169
If we don't get our checks by the end
of the week, we're going on strike.

874
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,570
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

875
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,490
Let me ask you a question.

876
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,210
If you could go to any show,
in any theater, anywhere...

877
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:08,211
what show would you pick?

878
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,290
Ice Capades.

879
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,971
- Ice Capades?
- Ice Capades. I like the Ice Capades.

880
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:16,251
You know, I think
Ice Capades are in Cleveland.

881
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,651
Yeah, or Holiday on Ice.

882
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,131
Holiday on Ice?
I can definitely get a couple of tickets.

883
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,691
- Did you see those tits over there?
- I'm sorry.

884
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:27,652
Don't be sorry. Santa Claus' helper
over there without a shirt?

885
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:30,092
- Are you embarrassed by that?
- Embarrassed? No.

886
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:31,492
- Dr. Prang always...
- Fuck Prang.

887
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:34,252
- Did you see those tits over there?
- Try not to notice them.

888
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,932
- Let's talk about Holiday on Ice.
- Fuck Holiday on Ice.

889
00:55:37,012 --> 00:55:38,372
A bunch of fags skating.

890
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:41,292
Did you see those tits on that lady there?
Gorgeous.

891
00:55:41,373 --> 00:55:43,853
- Can I get in here?
- I don't think so.

892
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:49,253
- Hi, Bucky.
- Julie!

893
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,253
What are you doing here?
You're not working the party are you?

894
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:55,293
- Of course not.
- Then what?

895
00:55:55,573 --> 00:55:57,533
I have a surprise for you.

896
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:01,333
I'm really pregnant this time.

897
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:06,734
I want to be sexual with you,
do you hear me?

898
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:08,134
I hear you, Phil.

899
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:10,495
I want to be physical with you.

900
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:16,414
I want to make
the beast with two backs with you.

901
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,375
Don't get Kinney, Phil.

902
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:22,055
Kinky.

903
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:25,095
Kinney is where America shops for shoes.

904
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:30,175
<i>The latest from Wall Street.</i>

905
00:56:30,255 --> 00:56:33,056
<i>Blue chips showed an upward trend
on the New York Exchange...</i>

906
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:35,496
<i>with the prime lending rate
rocketing to 25%...</i>

907
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:37,536
<i>with little improvement shown.</i>

908
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:38,936
Dr. Prang?

909
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,696
I'm Jyll Omato, from the gift shop.

910
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:44,456
I'm your Christmas present from the staff.

911
00:56:45,057 --> 00:56:47,097
<i>Speculators who were heavily leveraged...</i>

912
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:50,817
<i>were particularly affected
as brokers called in their margins.</i>

913
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,497
<i>Consumer confidence fell...</i>

914
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:53,737
Not now.

915
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,697
<i>Industrials are down 30 points,
Chemicals leveled off at 16...</i>

to a low of 43.</i>

917
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:08,058
Okay, now.

918
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:11,178
Simon.

919
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:15,339
You're out here all alone.

920
00:57:15,418 --> 00:57:18,978
Sure. Before you came along,
I was always alone, Stephanie.

921
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:22,179
I believe in you, Simon.

922
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,539
I've made a very important decision.

923
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:29,379
Simon, I'm ready
to give up Burnaby Mountain...

924
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:32,939
if it means I can be
with the man I love in Beverly Hills.

925
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,580
You love a man in Beverly Hills?

926
00:57:40,621 --> 00:57:42,020
Simon, think.

927
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:44,540
Concentrate.

928
00:58:24,623 --> 00:58:28,423
<i>Everyone, quiet please.
I have an announcement I'd like to make.</i>

929
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:36,584
<i>Stephanie Brody and I
are going to be married.</i>

930
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:41,704
Congratulations, Stephanie.

931
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:48,345
<i>Let me call you sweetheart</i>

932
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,745

<i>I'm in love with you</i>

934
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,705
Move out of the way. Thank you.

<i>Let me hear you whisper</i>

936
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:05,746

00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:13,546

<i>with you</i>

942
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:38,828
- Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
- Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

943
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,947
Actually, I'm a lab technician.

944
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:43,588
- Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
- It's all right, we're doctors.

945
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,308
Someone call an ambulance!

946
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,509
It's all right, we're doctors.

947
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:53,028
Goddamn you.
Why didn't you do the Lastfogel?

948
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:56,909
I don't need a battery of tests
to tell me if a patient has saxafragia mitosis.

949
00:59:56,988 --> 00:59:58,949
I knew it the first time I laid eyes on her.

950
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,989
Why did you tell us the tests were negative?

951
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:03,950
What did you want me to do?
Say she's a goner?

952
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:07,589
Sorry, doc. I wanted you kids
to have a nice Christmas.

953
01:00:07,669 --> 01:00:10,189
She's not a goner.
It's been cured by surgery before.

954
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,230
Once! Once out of 6,000 cases.

955
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,230
It's the most complex surgery there is.

956
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:18,510
There's only one doctor in the world
that's ever done it successfully.

957
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,111
I'll go find that doctor
and make him do it for her.

958
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,071
You won't have to go far.
He's right here in this hospital.

959
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,630
- Who?
- Dr. Prang, as a matter of fact.

960
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:29,671
- He can perform an operation.
- What operation?

961
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,951
It's a paraglobular underpass...

962
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:35,151
with a subarachnoid angulation
of the sphenoid wing.

963
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:37,471
Will he do it?

964
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:39,271
I spoke to him briefly this evening.

965
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:43,312
He said he'd get back to me
as soon as he got the girl off his face.

966
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:46,312
- Fine.
- I'll check in later, okay?

967
01:00:48,192 --> 01:00:49,752
Merry Christmas.

968
01:00:51,673 --> 01:00:53,232
Who was the girl?

969
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:56,152
- Jyll Omato.
- Omato.

970
01:00:57,033 --> 01:00:59,033
You say Omato, I say Omato.

971
01:01:03,433 --> 01:01:06,433
<i>I want a lover with a slow hand</i>

972
01:01:06,514 --> 01:01:09,033
<i>I want a lover with an easy touch</i>

973
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,354
Your daughter Angela is a very lovely girl.

974
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:18,514
And she cares about you a lot.

975
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:21,114
I've got an idea.
Why don't I get these flowers...

976
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:25,275
you give them to Angela and let her know
how much you care about her?

977
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,395
- Mrs. Greschler?
- What?

978
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:33,355
Could I please have some carnations?

979
01:01:33,435 --> 01:01:35,555
- You want carnations?
- Please.

980
01:01:35,635 --> 01:01:38,435
- I've got lovely mums.
- You don't want any mums, do you?

981
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:40,435
- You don't want any mums?
- No. Carnations.

982
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:43,276
- You don't want mums?
- No, I think carnations.

983
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:45,956
Nobody wants my lousy mums.
Got to be carnations.

984
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,596
The ones down at the end are fine.

985
01:01:47,675 --> 01:01:49,996
I've got some right down here.
I'll get them for you.

986
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:53,116
- Thank you, Mrs. Greschler.
- Just a minute. These are lovely, too.

987
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:55,796
Not as lovely as mums, but they're good.

988
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:58,796
- Thank you, Mrs. Greschler. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

989
01:01:59,076 --> 01:02:01,477
Rist, have you heard anything
about your residency?

990
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:02,677
Not yet, Litto.

991
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:05,597
I guess you could say
I'm the kind of guy who's tuned in.

992
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:08,037
Tuned in to holistic psychiatry.

993
01:02:14,157 --> 01:02:15,517
No smoking.

994
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:19,038
All right, Mr. Callahan.

995
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,598
It's time for our bodily function.

996
01:02:21,678 --> 01:02:23,118
Mrs. Greschler.

997
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:28,958
- I'd like to buy some chrysanthemums.
- I've got some mums.

998
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:07,161
<i>Attention please.</i>

999
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,881
<i>Anyone who has had contact with
the gift shop candy-striper Jyll Omato...</i>

1000
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:13,201
<i>please report to the VD clinic.</i>

1001
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:20,961
Let me tell you about this operation, kid.

1002
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:23,242
It's a maze, do you understand?

1003
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:25,442
You have to shut off three arteries.

1004
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:27,523
You have to regulate four enzyme flows.

1005
01:03:27,602 --> 01:03:31,002
You have to replace two fluids
and a blood supply, twice.

1006
01:03:31,043 --> 01:03:32,922
One teeny weeny little mistake...

1007
01:03:32,963 --> 01:03:36,643
and you might as well piss on the fire
and call the dogs 'cause it's all over.

1008
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:39,283
- I will be there to assist you, Doctor.
- You?

1009
01:03:39,363 --> 01:03:41,924
I wouldn't let you
take a splinter out of a rat's ass.

1010
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:45,243
- Look, you've done the operation before.
- Yes. But no more.

1011
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,323
This one is not meant to be.

1012
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:51,683
Dr. Prang, I've appealed to you
as a physician, and as a man.

1013
01:03:52,404 --> 01:03:55,204
There's only one other way
to put this to you.

1014
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:57,684
Will you operate on Stephanie Brody?

1015
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:58,724
No.

1016
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:02,524
Okay. We'll need an anesthesiologist.

1017
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:05,445
We'll need an endocrine person.
We'll get all the best people.

1018
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:07,845
We'll work with them
till they can do it blind-folded.

1019
01:04:07,925 --> 01:04:09,765
We'll have fun with it.

1020
01:04:10,085 --> 01:04:12,005
Emilia, press the button.

1021
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:13,125
Okay.

1022
01:04:17,006 --> 01:04:19,285
Now she's in somebody else's bed.

1023
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:41,527
I really appreciate this, Dr. Prang.

1024
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:44,167
Okay. Just don't hit me anymore.
Who's that on the end?

1025
01:04:44,207 --> 01:04:45,727
That's Dr. Quick, Doctor.

1026
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:48,767
Doppenheimer's out of town.
He recommended Quick himself.

1027
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:51,408
Never mind. All right. Everybody ready?

1028
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:53,407
Scalpel.

1029
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:57,248
- Ready with the dialysis retractor?
- On. Counting now, Dr. Prang.

1030
01:04:57,328 --> 01:05:00,208
- Give it to me in fives. X-ray?
- Fifty.

1031
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:01,448
Blood count?

1032
01:05:02,928 --> 01:05:06,048
Fifteen on twelve.

1033
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:09,608
- Heart?
- Normal.

1034
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:11,329
- X-ray?
- Twenty-five.

1035
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:12,889
- Moving. No shadow.
- Twenty.

1036
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:14,849
- Renostomy count, quickly.
- 25 over 20.

1037
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:15,929
Fifteen.

1038
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:18,089
- Platinum wire.
- Platinum wire.

1039
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:22,610
Seventeen, damn it!

1040
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,289
Seventeen, damn it!

1041
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,730
- Time?
- Ten seconds.

1042
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,210
- Five.
- Nope. We're in trouble.

1043
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,930
- Nine seconds.
- We're losing her.

1044
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,370
- Eight seconds.
- I've reopened the scarpoid valve.

1045
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,291
- Seven seconds.
- Oxygen.

1046
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,490
Oxygen.

1047
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:38,491
- Counting down.
- Four seconds.

1048
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:41,731
Two seconds.

1049
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,211
- Gattling frappe, quickly.
- One second.

1050
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,731
- Zero, Doctor.
- That's it.

1051
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,331
No, never mind!

1052
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:49,971
We've lost her.

1053
01:05:50,131 --> 01:05:51,611
We killed her.

1054
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:56,492
We'll have to do better than that, won't we?

1055
01:05:56,972 --> 01:05:59,092
All right, let's try it again.

1056
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:01,932
Only this time, let's practice on him.
You son of a...

1057
01:06:03,732 --> 01:06:07,532
<i>Dr. Prang, you just had
a very urgent call from your accountant.</i>

1058
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:09,812
Oscar? What did he say?

1059
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:11,612
<i>He said you're broke.</i>

1060
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:13,333
Broke?

1061
01:06:13,893 --> 01:06:16,613
<i>Attention. Tomorrow Dr. Prang
will perform...</i>

1062
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:20,413
<i>a saxafragia mitosis operation
on our very own Stephanie Brody.</i>

1063
01:06:20,494 --> 01:06:23,614
<i>Tickets are still available.
The public is invited.</i>

1064
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:28,134
Don't worry, Emilia.

1065
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:31,134
We'll fix this bed outside,
so you won't hit the ceiling.

1066
01:06:31,214 --> 01:06:32,654
Ice cream.

1067
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:39,015
Vanilla ice cream. We have established that.

1068
01:06:39,054 --> 01:06:41,534
Did I hear you say
you wanted some vanilla ice cream?

1069
01:06:41,615 --> 01:06:43,455
Vanilla ice cream, yeah.

1070
01:06:44,374 --> 01:06:47,615
When last we met,
I quoted you $20 on these.

1071
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:48,735
You've got it.

1072
01:06:48,815 --> 01:06:50,855
As we speak,
people grow badly addicted to them.

1073
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:53,816
I'm gonna have to ask you for $40
and I'll throw in water pills.

1074
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:56,016
- I'd rather have the bag.
- Fine, you can...

1075
01:06:57,936 --> 01:07:00,456
I'm a doctor! I worked hard for this.

1076
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:04,336
This is typical.

1077
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:12,177
We'll get your buddy.

1078
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:14,257
Don't worry.

1079
01:07:14,337 --> 01:07:15,457
Phil?

1080
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:18,017
Can I talk to her?

1081
01:07:18,097 --> 01:07:19,497
For a minute.

1082
01:07:24,057 --> 01:07:25,577
Freeze!

1083
01:07:29,738 --> 01:07:32,338
Let's go. It's going to be a car chase.

1084
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:34,538
Door's locked. No chase.

1085
01:07:38,898 --> 01:07:40,059
Freeze!

1086
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:42,739
Am I pointing this at you?

1087
01:07:44,178 --> 01:07:45,698
Good job, Blind Officer.

1088
01:07:45,779 --> 01:07:47,939
- Did we get them?
- We got them.

1089
01:07:48,339 --> 01:07:50,099
Hi. What's your name?

1090
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:53,500
I'm sorry, Phil, but it just had to be this way.

1091
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:54,899
I guess so.

1092
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,420
Listen, when you tell people about this...

1093
01:07:57,499 --> 01:07:59,699
and I want you to tell a lot of people...

1094
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,459
use me as a warning.

1095
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,180
You worked so hard to be a doctor.

1096
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,420
Do me a favor.

1097
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,700
Tell medicine that I'm no good for it.

1098
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,221
Did you like me?

1099
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:25,221
Yes.

1100
01:08:29,621 --> 01:08:32,382
- Why did you do it, anyway?
- Reaganomics.

1101
01:08:34,062 --> 01:08:37,422
<i>Attention, all nurses
report to the picket line outside.</i>

1102
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:39,542
<i>We're going on strike, baby.</i>

1103
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:41,302
Hi.

1104
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,182
Nurses unite!

1105
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:51,863
- Out of our way, Doctor.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1106
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:54,023
Out! As of this minute,
the nurses are on strike.

1107
01:08:54,103 --> 01:08:55,663
You can't walk out now.

1108
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:59,263
Stephanie is due in surgery.
If we don't operate, she might not make it.

1109
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,584
- Talk to Dr. Prang.
- He hasn't paid us in two months.

1110
01:09:03,584 --> 01:09:05,464
You're taking this very well, Stephanie.

1111
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:06,944
Hello, excuse me.

1112
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:09,824
You were just visiting someone
at this hospital, weren't you?

1113
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:10,904
That's right.

1114
01:09:10,985 --> 01:09:13,624
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure, go right ahead.

1115
01:09:13,664 --> 01:09:16,384
What do you think of this nurses' strike?

1116
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,064
I got nothing to do with this at all.

1117
01:09:20,665 --> 01:09:23,185
Hey, asshole, get off the car!

1118
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:25,185
You hear?

1119
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:26,585
Listen, excuse me.

1120
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:29,626
I don't give a fuck about this,
but there's an asshole on my car.

1121
01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:31,585
- Thank you very much.
- Come here!

1122
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:35,826
Get off the fucking car. Fucking pleasure.
I'm gonna rip your nose off.

1123
01:09:36,546 --> 01:09:38,226
They're not coming, are they?

1124
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:41,066
We're just running a bit late, that's all.
They'll be here.

1125
01:09:41,146 --> 01:09:44,506
We've got to help Simon.
He's stuck up there without any nurses.

1126
01:09:44,587 --> 01:09:48,547
Remember, this is why we want
to be doctors in the first place. Okay?

1127
01:09:48,626 --> 01:09:51,147
Rist, your patient Sal's going home.

1128
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:55,707
Okay, the three of you should help.
I'll meet you there.

1129
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,827
<i>Dr. Prang, you're wanted in surgery.</i>

1130
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:04,188
Sal, it's finally time to go home.

1131
01:10:04,227 --> 01:10:07,107
Hospital policy, you have to
take your last ride in a wheelchair.

1132
01:10:07,188 --> 01:10:09,348
Hey, "ragazzo," I don't need no chair.

1133
01:10:09,428 --> 01:10:11,828
- Okay, we'll change the policy.
- Change the policy.

1134
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:14,068
- This is for you.
- For me?

1135
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,469
It's from your daughter.

1136
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:21,668
<i>My dear Walter.</i>

1137
01:10:21,749 --> 01:10:24,189
<i>It would be foolish of me to deny...</i>

1138
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:28,389
<i>that you have aroused in me
certain feelings that I thought I never had.</i>

1139
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:32,990
<i>Your sensitivity, kindness, and care
have moved me deeply.</i>

1140
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,030
<i>But for various fucking reasons...</i>

1141
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,990
<i>ours is a relationship that cannot be.</i>

1142
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:42,910
<i>If there's ever anything I can do for you,
please let me know.</i>

1143
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,550
<i>Thank you for everything. Angie.</i>

1144
01:10:45,631 --> 01:10:48,430
Rocco, make sure the car's ready, all right?

1145
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,990
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Get me out of here!

1146
01:10:56,071 --> 01:10:58,791
Fill out this affidavit.
It's a malpractice affidavit.

1147
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:00,911
- English?
- Yeah, in English.

1148
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:13,152
This isn't gonna work...

1149
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:16,112
because there's things about me
that you just don't know.

1150
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:19,032
What? We've always been
honest with each other.

1151
01:11:19,073 --> 01:11:21,553
If it's the fact
that you curse all the time, I can...

1152
01:11:21,632 --> 01:11:24,873
I can control that.
I don't give a fuck about that. Listen to me.

1153
01:11:24,953 --> 01:11:27,153
Here, feel that. Go on, feel that.

1154
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:28,793
- It's pretty.
- Not that!

1155
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,273
When you look at me, what do you see?

1156
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,713
I see a beautiful human being.

1157
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,233
I'm married.

1158
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:40,514
Married?

1159
01:11:48,394 --> 01:11:52,955
Please, don't hate me, Walter.
I couldn't stand it.

1160
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:02,635
Are you happily married?

1161
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:17,436
<i>Dr. Prang, Dr. August is waiting.</i>

1162
01:12:19,396 --> 01:12:21,836
Oscar, what do you mean, indictment?

1163
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:24,036
They made me turn over
the hospital records.

1164
01:12:24,117 --> 01:12:25,477
So what? I'm clean.

1165
01:12:25,556 --> 01:12:28,077
Guess again, Joseph.
You know the $400,000 loss?

1166
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:31,157
That was recorded
as surgery you never performed.

1167
01:12:31,237 --> 01:12:33,437
Why, you slimy little wimp wart.

1168
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:37,077
I had to do it, Joseph.
You needed money for the condos.

1169
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:40,318
Why don't you just cash in
the pension plan, reimburse Medicare?

1170
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,318
You don't have a pension plan anymore.

1171
01:12:42,397 --> 01:12:45,478
I had to cash that in
to cover your losses in the silver market.

1172
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:48,158
Silver? I was never into silver.

1173
01:12:48,518 --> 01:12:51,878
Yes, you were. It was supposed to be
a surprise for your anniversary.

1174
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:55,158
And then Sarah zapped you,
and the bottom fell out of the market.

1175
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:56,999
That's why they call it risk capital.

1176
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,359
Joseph, it'll be all right. What the heck?

1177
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:03,039
You're a brilliant surgeon.
We'll declare bankruptcy. We'll sell the...

1178
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,319
Joseph, don't do it to yourself.

1179
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:08,599
Myself?

1180
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,839
Joey, no!

1181
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,880
Oscar, you're through as my accountant.

1182
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,560
Don't, Joey! God, Joey, you hurt my hand.

1183
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:20,960
You hurt my... Joseph, please! No!
Don't do it!

1184
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,760
<i>Five minutes before the operation.
We're letting the audience in.</i>

1185
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:28,801
Meet your volunteer scrub nurses.

1186
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,601
Chamberlain.

1187
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:34,281
Litto. My friend Flicker.

1188
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:37,601
Stephanie, look... She's...

1189
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,761
Where's Dr. Prang?

1190
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:42,602
Well, don't worry.
He's probably just going over his notes.

1191
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,162
Get out of the way, you sick bastard.

1192
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:52,642
Welcome to City Hospital.

1193
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:54,842
Everyone, remain in your assigned seats.

1194
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:57,403
No standing, and no flash photography.

1195
01:13:57,482 --> 01:13:58,763
<i>Attention.</i>

1196
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:02,763
<i>No one will be seated
during the last 10 minutes of the operation.</i>

1197
01:14:05,363 --> 01:14:08,043
<i>Attention, Dr. Prang. Report to Surgery.</i>

1198
01:14:09,523 --> 01:14:13,203
Think of what you're doing.
This isn't rational. Joseph!

1199
01:14:13,964 --> 01:14:15,764
I'm calling the police.

1200
01:14:19,884 --> 01:14:24,324
Due to the nurses' strike,
we're being staffed today by new volunteers.

1201
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:27,644
Would those among you
who have had first-aid training...

1202
01:14:27,725 --> 01:14:30,764
come to the desk and get
some Band-Aids that I've laid out there?

1203
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:34,525
The rest of you will just take a number,
and we'll get to you as soon as possible.

1204
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:38,165
- Call the police!
- Sir, you'll have to take a number.

1205
01:14:38,566 --> 01:14:40,005
He's got a gun!

1206
01:14:41,485 --> 01:14:44,885
<i>Dr. Prang, this is Dr. August.
Report to Surgery.</i>

1207
01:14:56,046 --> 01:14:57,006
Hi.

1208
01:15:00,846 --> 01:15:02,007
Sorry.

1209
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:09,207
Don't worry.
He's just some crazy honky with a gun.

1210
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:12,527
Be honest with me. What are my chances?

1211
01:15:14,247 --> 01:15:15,448
That bad?

1212
01:15:19,408 --> 01:15:21,647
Prang, you're wanted in Surgery!

1213
01:15:23,888 --> 01:15:25,248
You'd better scrub up. Come on.

1214
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:28,889
- No, I'm going to wait for Dr. Prang.
- Don't wait for Prang.

1215
01:15:28,968 --> 01:15:30,728
- Pardon?
- Don't wait for Prang.

1216
01:15:30,769 --> 01:15:31,769
Why?

1217
01:15:31,848 --> 01:15:34,249
We got a problem. Dr. Prang is very upset.

1218
01:15:34,288 --> 01:15:36,328
Upset? Let me tell you something, Simon.

1219
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,769
I don't think the man
is in the mood for surgery.

1220
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:41,009
- Kurtzman, please.
- I'm sorry.

1221
01:15:41,049 --> 01:15:44,370
What about the other doctors?
What about Stevens? What about Byner?

1222
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:47,930
They won't come if Prang isn't there.
They say it's completely useless.

1223
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:51,050
- Go ahead, tell him.
- What I'm trying to say is...

1224
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,530
that you're gonna have to
do the operation, son.

1225
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:57,330
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm sure you're well aware of my reputation.

1226
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:00,731
And I'm gonna be right there with you
every step of the way.

1227
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,970
And me.

1228
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,531
Don't worry, there'll be no pressure.

1229
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:08,690
It'll just be like any other operation
that you've never done before.

1230
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,131
- Kurtzman, could I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.

1231
01:16:22,092 --> 01:16:24,331
They told me what's going on.

1232
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:29,492
You have to do it, Simon.
You have to substitute for Prang.

1233
01:16:29,572 --> 01:16:33,053
We need an anesthesiologist.
We need an endocrine man. Nurses.

1234
01:16:33,132 --> 01:16:34,892
Listen, we can do all those things.

1235
01:16:34,932 --> 01:16:37,932
Not to mention a small matter
of a couple of competent surgeons.

1236
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:39,733
Simon, you can do it.

1237
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:44,214
You can. Listen,
you watched Prang rehearse it, right?

1238
01:16:44,573 --> 01:16:46,453
And besides, you got all of us.

1239
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:50,013
Litto is a great anesthesiologist.
He can knock anybody out.

1240
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:53,094
And Milton knows the stomach inside out.

1241
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:55,094
He'll come in handy.

1242
01:16:55,254 --> 01:16:56,934
Then we got Ludwig.

1243
01:16:57,854 --> 01:17:00,734
Ludwig has opened up more people
than anybody.

1244
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:04,335
Of course, you know, they were all dead.

1245
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:08,094
So, you see, you can do it.

1246
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:09,695
We can do it.

1247
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:12,095
For Stephanie.

1248
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:16,655
Or, you know, we could go home and eat.

1249
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:19,255
Nice chatting with you again.

1250
01:17:23,215 --> 01:17:24,896
Do you believe in me?

1251
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:28,456
You're kind of a pecker-head...

1252
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:32,936
but I believe in those.

1253
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:34,937
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1254
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:38,217
<i>Dr. Prang will not be
performing the surgery today.</i>

1255
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:39,857
"He went" meshuga.

1256
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,017
Let's go to work, doctors.

1257
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:58,938
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
there has been a change in the program.</i>

1258
01:18:03,418 --> 01:18:07,938
<i>The saxafragia mitosis operation
will be performed by Dr. Simon August.</i>

1259
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:13,658
- Let's go.
- No. Are you crazy?

1260
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,260
This is a saxafragia mitosis operation.

1261
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,059
All right, doctors.

1262
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,380
We've got 20 minutes to find
that saxafragioid nerve and reduce it.

1263
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,820
- And she's off.
- Yeah!

1264
01:18:34,901 --> 01:18:36,980
Then we're ready, gentlemen.

1265
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:39,460
Scalpel.

1266
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,181
<i>Simon, show all your doctor friends
how you cut.</i>

1267
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,221
<i>You're a great surgeon, Dad.</i>

1268
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:52,501
<i>And you're a great surgeon, too, my boy.</i>

1269
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:55,261
<i>Simon's gonna be a great surgeon, too, Dad.</i>

1270
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:57,342
Do you hear voices?

1271
01:19:04,502 --> 01:19:06,902
<i>I guess I can function in this room.</i>

1272
01:19:11,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Well, you did it. A perfect cut.

1273
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:16,383
Blind shithouse luck. But you did it.

1274
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:19,263
Heart?

1275
01:19:23,503 --> 01:19:24,704
Normal.

1276
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,984
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1277
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:30,024
- Then take it back.
- Sorry.

1278
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:33,184
- How's my time?
- T-minus 33 and counting.

1279
01:19:33,224 --> 01:19:34,664
Hang on, Stephanie.

1280
01:19:34,744 --> 01:19:35,824
Easy.

1281
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:36,864
Damn!

1282
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,384
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?

1283
01:19:38,464 --> 01:19:40,784
The obstruction. I can't reach it.

1284
01:19:40,865 --> 01:19:43,065
My damn hands are just too big.

1285
01:19:43,104 --> 01:19:46,664
If only one of the nurses were here.
Their hands are small.

1286
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:49,225
They can reach into tiny...

1287
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:51,905
- Chamberlain.
- Thurman, help me.

1288
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:55,826
<i>Substitution. Dr. Chamberlain in
for Dr. August.</i>

1289
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:59,585
Do you see it? Right there. That's it.

1290
01:20:02,106 --> 01:20:04,986
Dr. Ludwig, I'm nearing
the saxafragioid nerve.

1291
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:06,146
So?

1292
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:08,666
- Heart?
- Normal.

1293
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:10,546
Sprockett.

1294
01:20:11,867 --> 01:20:16,067
This strike ain't for me.
I'm a nurse, and I go where I'm needed.

1295
01:20:17,347 --> 01:20:19,387
It looks like I'm needed here.

1296
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:22,588
- I admire your dedication.
- It ain't all dedication.

1297
01:20:22,627 --> 01:20:25,427
My little brother Elmer,
he was an air traffic controller.

1298
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:28,507
- Really?
- Yeah, he was incredible.

1299
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:31,547
We're trying to save a life here, remember?

1300
01:20:33,148 --> 01:20:34,348
Suction.

1301
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,669
Get it off.

1302
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,268
Suction, Doctor, please.

1303
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:51,589
Forget the suction. Thank you very much.

1304
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:53,909
- Blood pressure?
- It's dropping.

1305
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:55,230
Sixty, fifty, here we go.

1306
01:20:55,269 --> 01:20:58,829
You got to stop now. If her erzemine level
drops to 20, we're gonna lose her.

1307
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:01,309
- Will you shut up, Kurtzman?
- Quiet!

1308
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:03,030
Careful.

1309
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,470
Taffler's serum. Five cc's.

1310
01:21:05,669 --> 01:21:08,550
Erzemine 30. Injecting Taffler's.

1311
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:10,950
I see it. Hold her steady.

1312
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:14,230
- Renostomy level dropping.
- Give me a count.

1313
01:21:14,711 --> 01:21:16,950
- 40 over 13.
- Respiration weak.

1314
01:21:17,031 --> 01:21:18,391
- Heart?
- Irregular.

1315
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:19,551
I don't like it.

1316
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:22,191
You don't have to like it.
Just do as you're told.

1317
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:24,751
- We can't stop now.
- It's all right. He's an asshole.

1318
01:21:24,831 --> 01:21:27,031
- Blood pressure falling.
- Almost there.

1319
01:21:27,111 --> 01:21:28,871
- Twenty-five.
- Got it.

1320
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:32,031
Please hurry, Doctor. Don't taste it.

1321
01:21:32,112 --> 01:21:35,272
We've got five minutes
to reduce it and put it back.

1322
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,352
Now we wait.

1323
01:21:41,512 --> 01:21:44,792
How about those Lakers the other night?
Did you see what they did...

1324
01:21:44,873 --> 01:21:47,913
- Come on.
- I'm trying to focus here.

1325
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,713
Found it!

1326
01:21:53,273 --> 01:21:55,113
Reduced two millimeters.

1327
01:21:59,274 --> 01:22:01,754
- All right, reopen the scarpoid valve.
- It won't open.

1328
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,593
Cut it! I need that scarpoid fluid.

1329
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:05,913
- Scissors.
- I've lost the renostomy level.

1330
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:07,194
It's in.

1331
01:22:07,273 --> 01:22:08,914
- My end's attached.
- Mine, too.

1332
01:22:08,994 --> 01:22:10,194
- Ditto.
- Okay.

1333
01:22:10,274 --> 01:22:12,195
I've lost the heartbeat.

1334
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:15,674
The body's rejecting it.

1335
01:22:15,755 --> 01:22:17,594
- Adrenalin!
- She's not responding.

1336
01:22:17,675 --> 01:22:20,555
Pickering fluid, 50 cc's. Noserin 20 cc's.

1337
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:22,955
- Oxygen.
- Oxygen.

1338
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,875
I'm afraid she's sliding
into home plate, Simon.

1339
01:22:28,955 --> 01:22:31,595
Noserin. Gattling frappe.

1340
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:37,995
Come on, Stephanie, hold on.

1341
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:50,356
Sorry, Simon.

1342
01:22:57,717 --> 01:22:59,397
It's just an operation.

1343
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:20,439
All right, let's close her up.

1344
01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:22,079
- Suture.
- Suture.

1345
01:23:22,799 --> 01:23:24,638
- Wait a minute, her eyes are open.
- What?

1346
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,559
- She's looking around the room.
- Look, she's breathing!

1347
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:29,079
Look, she's smiling.

1348
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,359
Somebody kicked the plug out of the wall.

1349
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,120
Who pulled the plug?

1350
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,880
The machines are working.

1351
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,120
- I've got a heartbeat.
- I've got an oxygen level.

1352
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,240
- I've got a live patient.
- Oxygen.

1353
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:50,880
- Are we going to save her?
- Yes!

1354
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:54,601
Yes, the strike is over.
Nurses report back on duty.

1355
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:58,561
We've just received temporary funding
from the Chubb Insurance Group.

1356
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,641
Doctors, over here, please.

1357
01:24:00,721 --> 01:24:02,641
Welcome, new interns, to City Hospital.

1358
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:05,401
- Happy New Year!
- Doctor, you're on duty.

1359
01:24:06,162 --> 01:24:07,561
Meet me after.

1360
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:12,762
- Stephanie?
- Who?

1361
01:24:16,002 --> 01:24:19,203
Would you please all make yourselves
known to Dr. Jacobs because...

1362
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:25,962
No, not now.

1363
01:24:28,883 --> 01:24:31,243
Simon! We've got to find Simon to tell him...

1364
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:34,844
before he marries some bimbo
on the rebound. Where'd he go?

1365
01:24:35,163 --> 01:24:37,523
Listen, I really admire your work.

1366
01:24:38,644 --> 01:24:40,243
And your eyebrows.

1367
01:24:40,483 --> 01:24:43,204
You're staying here
at City Hospital, aren't you?

1368
01:24:43,284 --> 01:24:45,324
Yes, I am, Nurse Sprockett.

1369
01:24:47,364 --> 01:24:50,084
- Norine.
- Walter.

1370
01:24:55,405 --> 01:24:56,684
Simon!

1371
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,925
Take her to the smartass.
She wants to talk to him.

1372
01:25:06,246 --> 01:25:09,966
<i>Keep the love-light glowing</i>

1373
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:15,045
<i>in your eyes so true</i>

1374
01:25:16,886 --> 01:25:18,406
Over here, schmuck.

1375
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:23,127
<i>Let me call you sweetheart</i>

1376
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:27,406
<i>I'm in love</i>

1377
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:31,767
<i>with you</i>

1378
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:36,687
- You did it, boy!
- I can't believe it.

1379
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:39,728
Hi!

1380
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:42,247
I love you.

1381
01:25:42,328 --> 01:25:45,688
You are the greatest surgeon in the world.

1382
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:50,928
I think they want to be alone.

1383
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:55,128
Thank you. Thank you all so...

1384
01:25:57,009 --> 01:25:58,528
Stephanie, wait!

1385
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:03,969
What did I say?

1386
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:37,651
Now.

1387
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:44,491
<i>Simon and Stephanie opened...</i>
