1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,530
I told you, I'm only keeping
it if you finish it with her.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,340
Go and tell her now, or that is it.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,660
- Did he love her?
- He was the one that finished it.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,180
That doesn't change anything.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,660
They started last night.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,140
Sometimes people write things
like this on the internet.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,142
- Why?
- Someone wants to get at Mum.

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,743
- Who?
- I'll deal with this.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,580
I found these in your flat.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,420
You're going on holiday.
But stay there a while.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,940
You understand, don't you?
I can't do this for ever.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,700
I can't have this conversation.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,300
I'm afraid, last night,
she died in her sleep...

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,220
I've changed my mind.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,820
We're all right.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,060
We're going to try again.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,040
Do we have any butter?

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
Mate, I used it this
morning. Let me have a look.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
Did you try the fridge?

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,080
Hey, presto...

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,880
The butter!

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
What did your last servant die of?

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,960
- Cholera?
- What's cholera?

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,560
Cholera is like typhoid.

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,000
"What's typhoid?"

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,280
- Typhoid is what?
- Typhoid?

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
- Typhoid, it's very serious.
- What's Thai food?

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
- Do you want lemon curd?
- I thought you said, "Typhoo".

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,520
Typhoo is a brand of tea.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,080
Thai food is... quite nice.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,080
Lemon curd!

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
- So, he still hasn't admitted it?
- I doubt he ever will.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,120
- And you haven't told him, that you know?
- We're just moving on.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,680
With this massive secret sat
underneath the relationship?!

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,800
- Can I speak with you?
- Sure.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,880
Two minutes.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,720
Excuse me.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,440
You're sure you're OK?
It's just very sudden.

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,120
After everything, how can
you simply take him back?

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Because we have a child together,

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,520
a life together, 14
years under our belt,

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
so if there's any way of keeping
all of that, I have to try.

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
And you honestly think that he's
never going to see her again?

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,640
I'm told when they broke
up, it was very final.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,840
- Nick?
- There's been a complaint.

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Fantastic! Another one.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,080
The power of the internet.

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,400
The latest yesterday
was that I don't dress

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,320
appropriately for a senior doctor.

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
He was annoyed I wore a skirt.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,640
Um, this one's not online.

52
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,030
He came in and asked to
speak to me personally.

53
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,031
Who is it?

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,840
He's requested anonymity
for the time being.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,000
- I'm speaking to the GMC.
- Why the GMC?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Doctors get complaints all the time.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Yes, but as you say, there's
also the comments on the website,

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,240
and, um, what... what happened
with your mother-in-law.

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,080
My mother-in-law took her own
life, I don't know why everyone...

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,360
It's as much about protecting you
as anything. This new complaint.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,440
He talked about your
personal life, your marriage.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,400
Wait.

63
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,669
You really can't tell me who this is?

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,440
Sorry.

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,040
Fine.

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,160
_

67
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,561
_

68
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,200
_

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
Come in.

70
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
Gordon!

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,440
Long time no see!

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
- You're not normally sarcastic.
- Sorry?

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,550
"Long time no see." That's
what I expect from the others.

74
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,960
Sorry. Come on.

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,520
Come in, sit down.

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,480
Let's start again.

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
What's wrong?

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
My shoes don't fit any more.

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,640
- Your shoes?
- Yes.

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,960
There must be something
wrong with my feet.

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,480
- So, were you sick?
- I don't think you're picking up

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,960
- on the right bit of the story.
- Yeah, Mum just said,

83
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,985
when you and her met,
you had a few too many.

84
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:46,980
Me? No. Only one of us
was tipsy that night.

85
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,281
Oh, shit.

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,960
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
You want to be careful with alcohol.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,320
Makes you say things you
shouldn't, and... stand on chairs.

89
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you mean?

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,760
- I think we need to tell him the whole thing.
- Fine.

91
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,760
It was your mum who'd
drunk too much that night.

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,520
She stood on this chair,
looked around, and then saw me,

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,358
pointed, and said I was the
best-looking man in the room.

94
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,980
- You?
- Your dad was younger then,

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,400
and the room was not
in a very nice pub...

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,160
- That's true, there wasn't much competition.
- So, then what?

97
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
They started to play ABBA,

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,000
I tried to dance on
the chair, but fell off.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,920
Your dad helped me up and said
that maybe I should have some food.

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
We got a curry.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
And that's how we met.

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Oh, God! It's today.

103
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
That's why you were
talking about it. Ah... !

104
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,640
- Um...
- I'm an idiot.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
Don't worry.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,760
- I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,520
Every year, since then, on the
26th of May, your mum makes a curry.

108
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,720
And I get her a card.

109
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
And you forgot?

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,920
Dad, you are RUBBISH sometimes.

111
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah. Well...

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,440
Honestly.

113
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
It's OK. You've been busy.

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
Simon!

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
Um...

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,600
um...

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
oh!

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,520
You liar!

119
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Oh, look!

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
- Can I see?
- NO!

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,120
Thank you.

122
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Everything's going wrong at work.

123
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Can I do anything?

124
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,960
Yeah, will you beat them up?

125
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,720
Tuesday?

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
Perfect.

127
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,640
Everything all right?

128
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Yeah. Just, it's a problem.

129
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,440
At work?

130
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

131
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

132
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,360
Ah.

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
- Sorry, can you sit on this side?
- There's only three of us Nick,

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,960
- I'm not sure it matters.
- We should take it seriously.

135
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,720
- Here?
- Thank you.

136
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,760
You've got the outline
details of the complaint there

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,080
that you threatened to burn
this man with a lit cigarette.

138
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm assuming you deny it?

139
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,100
Of course.

140
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:57,501
As you know, normally there
are internal procedures.

141
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
There are.

142
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
But, er,

143
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,520
I spoke to the GMC this morning

144
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,160
and they indicated that we should
consider the wider context...

145
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,200
- What's going on?
- Gemma, if you let Nick finish, he'll explain.

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,960
Obviously, the online
comments are anonymous

147
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,920
but we can't ignore them entirely.

148
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,660
To an outside eye, they
might appear to have...

149
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,800
a pattern of behaviour.

150
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Also we've had the police here,

151
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,640
asking questions about the
death of your mother-in-law.

152
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,420
Who talked to them?

153
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,680
- Luke, mostly, he was...
- "Mostly"?

154
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,160
They asked about some things
to do with procedure, as well.

155
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,760
Do you think that I've
done anything wrong?

156
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,280
- There needs to be a process.
- No, but...

157
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,040
- You, personally, Nick. What do you think?
- Well...

158
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,840
You have been going through
a lot lately, in your life.

159
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,400
- How is that relevant?
- You said we were talking personally.

160
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,280
The GMC have suggested we mutually agree

161
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,760
you take a leave of absence, informally,

162
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,560
while the complaint is investigated
and we look at the website.

163
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,300
It would help, as well, wouldn't
it, to have some time off?

164
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,301
No.

165
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,840
What if I don't agree?

166
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Then we'd have to look
at a temporary suspension.

167
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,440
And, Gemma, that would be so much worse.

168
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,320
When?

169
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,720
When do you want me to stop, then?

170
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,960
Immediately.

171
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
You don't have to pack up.
It's only a couple of weeks.

172
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
Presumably, while I'm away,
you'll become senior partner?

173
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,860
You think I want you to go?

174
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,300
We're following professional advice.

175
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,700
It's not my fault.

176
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,460
I helped you!

177
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,740
I told you everything about Kate
and the baby, I spoke to Simon,

178
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,460
did everything you asked.

179
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,220
Then suddenly you're giving him
another chance which is up to you,

180
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,940
but forgive me if I
stop trying to keep up

181
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,260
and take a step back,
and act professionally.

182
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,460
Gemma!

183
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,580
Whatever's going on, some time off
would be a good idea, wouldn't it?

184
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,620
What did you tell the police?

185
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,860
- What?
- You said they asked about procedure?

186
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,681
- Yes.
- Something was said to them here

187
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,610
to make them suspect me.

188
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,380
All right, well, er, they
asked about our access to pills.

189
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,500
- And I told them what I found in your bag.
- Why were you looking in my bag?

190
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
I wasn't looking!

191
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,100
I needed some hand gel and your
bag was there on the side and open,

192
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,260
and when I found it,
I saw that there was...

193
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,500
a bottle of sleeping pills with
some anti-sickness medication.

194
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,420
And then, the next day, your
mother-in-law did what she did...

195
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,980
- They were Jack's.
- So, I...

196
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,700
Jack's?

197
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,460
He wanted to kill himself.

198
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,300
I took them off him.

199
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,740
You still have them, then, in your bag?

200
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,620
Yeah.

201
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,020
I have.

202
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,900
I don't know where
they've gone, I had them...

203
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,001
- Oh, Gemma... !
- Don't!

204
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,220
Don't make me feel stupid.

205
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,700
They were there.

206
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,340
I'll tell the police I made a mistake.

207
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,620
But take this time.

208
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,580
- They said I have to see someone else.
- Yes.

209
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,770
The other doctors laugh at me.

210
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:47,771
- They don't.
- They do.

211
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,180
- You know they do. What's happened?
- Google me and you'll find out.

212
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,180
Sorry.

213
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,420
Hi.

214
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
That's what I thought.

215
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,060
- You're back with Carly?
- Yeah, not drinking any more.

216
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,660
I was suspended today
because of your complaint.

217
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,060
You know why I came round that day.

218
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,594
- She needed help.
- No...

219
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,490
You found out what
your husband was doing.

220
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,420
You were angry, you took it out on me.

221
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,300
- Look, I'm pleased if you've sorted yourself out.
- Not "if".

222
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,620
- Carly's given you a second chance.
- Yeah.

223
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,300
Give me a second chance, too?

224
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,851
Carly showed me the website.

225
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,652
- You're out of control.
- No.

226
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,820
I've been through a lot
in the last few weeks,

227
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,020
but things are better now.

228
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,060
Please. I... I can't
stop working. I need it.

229
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,060
Carly?

230
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,580
They've suspended her.

231
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,700
Um...

232
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,060
OK, Dan, maybe you should tell
them not to go forward with this.

233
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,380
Have you admitted it?
Said that... What happened?

234
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,780
They'd start a disciplinary
procedure and I can't...

235
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,540
How much?

236
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,780
How much to withdraw the complaint.

237
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,580
You really need to
stop offering me money.

238
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,820
Yeah.

239
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,220
OK.

240
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,380
Come on, son.

241
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,740
Go on, Tom.

242
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,660
- Leave it with me. Hey! My favourite doctor!
- Hi.

243
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,060
Hi!

244
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,220
Hi.

245
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,100
Well, your husband's
taking this very seriously.

246
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Well, he was never very good at
sports himself, so it matters.

247
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,860
He's just the same!

248
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,220
How are you?

249
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,340
Good, thanks.

250
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,900
You going out?

251
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,980
- What?
- She's talking about the skirt.

252
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,260
- I had the same question, but she's 20 something...
- 23.

253
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,660
- Yeah, well, apparently I don't get a vote.
- I like it.

254
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,980
- Yeah, I'm sure the boys do, as well!
- Yeah, shut up, Dad!

255
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,060
Get up! At least I could
run in a straight line!

256
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,420
Get up! That's better.

257
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,060
I've been meaning to
say, it is ridiculous

258
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,380
that we haven't all got
together, the four of us.

259
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,900
- It's what happens when you leave it to the men.
- Sounds fun.

260
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,580
I'll e-mail you.

261
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,281
- Bye.
- Bye.

262
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,500
Oh, so close!

263
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
Come on, Tom.

264
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,100
Nice ball.

265
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,180
- I thought you were at work?
- I wanted to see our son.

266
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,780
Come on, Tom!

267
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,300
Simon, the, uh...

268
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,020
... the partners at work...

269
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,620
um, have asked me to take some
time off pending an investigation.

270
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,803
- You mean?
- Suspended me, effectively.

271
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:09,804
Why?

272
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:11,755
There's been a formal complaint

273
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,540
that I went to the home of a patient

274
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,180
and... assaulted him.

275
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,260
Assaulted him? You?

276
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,180
Ros, she... she's a partner.

277
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,220
- Can't she?
- There's been the stuff on the internet,

278
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,140
and the police have been around
asking questions about your mum.

279
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,820
Apparently, that...

280
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,900
"paints a picture". Sorry!

281
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,060
It's all right.

282
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,980
OK, OK, it'll be all right.

283
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,340
Thank you.

284
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you.

285
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,140
- That was you.
- Yeah.

286
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,700
Right, sorry.

287
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,220
I didn't want to...

288
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,060
- Who is it?
- Work.

289
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,260
OK.

290
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,940
Are you not going to reply?

291
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,500
I don't mind if you want to.

292
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
What?

293
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,020
What's going on?

294
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
When you got the text, your...

295
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,060
... your body went tense.

296
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,580
I was surprised. That's what
people do when they're surprised.

297
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,540
- OK. Honestly. You can reply.
- You still...

298
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,420
You still...

299
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,780
You think I'm lying?

300
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,740
You still don't trust me?

301
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,900
Look, do you want to see the text?

302
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,780
Time, date, details of the supplies
for the foundations. Here. Look.

303
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,980
No. It's fine.

304
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,940
Well done!

305
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,260
We lost.

306
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,940
Only just,

307
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,900
and not because of you.

308
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,340
Right. Two cars. Who
are you going to go with?

309
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,260
No offence, Mum, but you
don't know much about football

310
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,900
and me and Dad have to talk.

311
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,540
Where to? Somewhere to celebrate?

312
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,900
Celebrate what?

313
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
- You, of course!
- Oh.

314
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,380
Pizza?

315
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,460
Yeah, actually, that
would be really good.

316
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,020
Simon? Pizza?

317
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,700
Argh, really sorry.

318
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Crisis.

319
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,260
What?

320
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,980
The thing with the supplies.

321
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,620
We need to talk about
options, today, sorry.

322
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,460
Boring. Um, I'll just be a couple
of hours. I'll join you later.

323
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,300
Pizza is a great idea. You can
teach Mum about the offside rule!

324
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, why can't you come now,
and sort out your problem later?

325
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,460
Sorry, mate. It just
doesn't work like that.

326
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,270
I'll be around tonight and
we can catch up then, yeah?

327
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,871
OK.

328
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,540
You already know the offside rule.

329
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,540
Yeah.

330
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,700
Is there anything you don't know?

331
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,940
Quite a lot.

332
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,220
Dad!

333
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,420
He works really hard, doesn't he?

334
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,780
Mum!

335
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,180
Mum!

336
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,660
Mum!

337
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,460
You're going the wrong way!

338
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,900
I need five minutes with your dad.

339
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,580
You said we were having pizza.

340
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,740
Do your homework.

341
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,580
I want to come in!

342
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,940
You can't.

343
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
- Oh, shit...
- What?

344
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,740
Your face.

345
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,820
I, um... I didn't know
you were coming over.

346
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,060
They normally buzz up.

347
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,300
I told them that I wanted
to surprise my husband.

348
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm not having a good
day. Is he in there?

349
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,260
He's on the phone. Gemma, are you... ?

350
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,220
You're holding something back.

351
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,740
I mean...

352
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,180
I mean, you've been doing
that for a long time, but...

353
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,460
... something's changed.

354
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,896
You've suddenly become
really bad at lying.

355
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:16,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,340
Does my husband bully you?

357
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,060
I mean, not physically,

358
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,820
but he patronises you.

359
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,420
I suppose, that's why men
want female assistants.

360
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,860
So, they can push at
least one woman around.

361
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,100
- You've been covering for him for years.
- I don't... cover.

362
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,687
- I'd like to believe that.
- Well, you should.

363
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:40,780
But your face.

364
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,180
Look, if you take a seat,
when he's off the phone,

365
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,620
- I'll let him know that you're here.
- I wanted his support.

366
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,420
I've basically just lost my job,
but from the expression on your face,

367
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,020
I think he's off having
sex with Kate Parks again.

368
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,260
You split with your husband.

369
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,100
So, you can imagine
something of what I'm feeling.

370
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,020
I've known for a while.

371
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,580
They have no idea.

372
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,540
Well, they will now.

373
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,300
I assume it's not locked.

374
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,940
Where is he?

375
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,660
His car's outside.

376
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,380
Well?

377
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,100
What?

378
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,340
He was always worried that someone
might follow him or see him.

379
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,380
They had a system.

380
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,220
You can get out from
the back of the building.

381
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,780
They're back together.

382
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,980
He'll never leave her.

383
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,820
I kept telling him to stop.
I HATE what he's doing.

384
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,100
You went on holiday with them.

385
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,220
- He said he needed me, that they'd be working...
- Where did you go?

386
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,500
Kate's dad has a house in France.

387
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,540
Said she could use it for friends.

388
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,700
Her dad wasn't there?

389
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,860
No. They don't know about Simon.

390
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,740
He'd kill him if he did.

391
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,620
- Show me pictures.
- What... ?

392
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,780
Of the holiday. On your phone.

393
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,620
You, him, her. Neil,
Anna. I want to see.

394
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,980
Why would you want to see?

395
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,100
I thought that I had a
chance to sort this out,

396
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,340
but, clearly, I'm delusional!

397
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,620
Look, not that it matters
but, yeah, you're right.

398
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,740
He can be horrible.

399
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,980
- Especially when he's stressed.
- Can you e-mail these to me?

400
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:03,981
I...

401
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,220
If you want.

402
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,660
- And don't tell him I know.
- Why not?

403
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,580
I want to do it myself.

404
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,780
- But not now.
- Do what?

405
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,860
- I told you to stay in the car.
- Where's Dad?

406
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,860
Mum, what's wrong with you?
You're so weird at the moment.

407
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,580
Mum!

408
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,650
Why are you such a mad bitch?

409
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,970
It's scary.

410
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,570
Your dad's gone out
for a couple of minutes.

411
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,810
You know Becky, don't you?
Becky, could you text Simon,

412
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,970
tell him that his son's
waiting in his office

413
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,410
and needs some pizza before going home?

414
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,410
And then, when he gets
back, could you explain

415
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,250
that I've forgotten that I need
to go to a conference... tonight.

416
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,490
I need to leave immediately.

417
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,730
- Be gone a few days.
- What?

418
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,410
Your dad'll look after you.
You can talk about football.

419
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,810
- A conference? It's always work!
- Yes?

420
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,810
OK.

421
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,890
Good.

422
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,730
Bye, then.

423
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,730
Bye.

424
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,970
Mum!

425
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,450
You're too clever! All right.

426
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,130
Look, there is no conference.

427
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,930
That's a lie Becky and I
are going to tell your dad,

428
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,890
because I just can't deal
with everything at the moment

429
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,970
so I need to go away
for a couple of days.

430
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,010
And I don't want him to worry,
so... I'm making an excuse.

431
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,690
Now, you have a choice.

432
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,490
You can tell Dad the truth,
or you can join me and Becky

433
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,250
and tell him it's a conference.

434
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,010
It's up to you.

435
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,370
Don't do that!

436
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,490
Your dad does that.

437
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,410
What do you mean, you
can't deal with everything?

438
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,210
Life's hard sometimes.

439
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,770
- How long are you gone for?
- Couple of days.

440
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,690
- OK.
- Good boy.

441
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,370
See you soon.

442
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,970
Shit!

443
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,490
I'm fishing.

444
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,050
Saw it in a film.

445
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,250
Doesn't work.

446
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,330
You OK?

447
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,810
Mary!

448
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,850
Visitor!

449
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,290
My husband used to shout
at me. Now he's dead!

450
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,970
Those two things might
not be connected, Jack,

451
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,770
but are you sure you
want to take the risk?

452
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,010
- Oh.
- Hi.

453
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,290
Jack, make some tea.

454
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,810
- What's happened? You look upset. Where's Tom?
- With Simon.

455
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,210
- Did you tell her?
- No.

456
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,410
What? What's going on?

457
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,850
Can I stay?

458
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,530
Well, I've got no clean towels.

459
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,730
I'll find some. Course. You
can stay as long as you like.

460
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,290
Sit down.

461
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,170
- I thought you didn't have mobile reception.
- Oh, they put a mast up.

462
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,770
I wrote a letter, it made no difference.

463
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,370
He cheated on me.

464
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,410
All right.

465
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,690
Where's that tea?

466
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,050
There. KEYPAD TONES

467
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,290
Problem solved.

468
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,450
Thanks...

469
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,410
for taking Jack in.

470
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,450
He's a pain in the
neck, but, like you said,

471
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,490
he's useful round the house.

472
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,090
- Sorry he's so rude.
- It's the right thing to do, so it must be done.

473
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,250
He's stuck in the past,
that's been his problem.

474
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,410
- He was with David a long time.
- I know.

475
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,410
When you lose someone like that...

476
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,290
when you're going through hell,

477
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,330
you've got to keep going.

478
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,570
Can I help?

479
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,290
No, thank you.

480
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,170
- Don't suppose you have any wine?
- What do you think?

481
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,410
And Jack shouldn't so
don't you dare buy it.

482
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,770
You can have another cup of
tea or there's some squash.

483
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,370
Was it advice you wanted?
Is that why you're here?

484
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,590
- No.
- You'd never be told before.

485
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:31,091
I just needed to get away.

486
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,570
I see.

487
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,810
You'll want to get back for
Tom, soon, though, of course?

488
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,770
You'll want to get back for him.

489
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,090
I might just... get some air.

490
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,370
Dinner's 20 minutes.

491
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,130
You're addicted to those things.

492
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,610
Same as David, he was
never off his iPad.

493
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,730
- How did you get these?
- His assistant.

494
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,450
You grew up around here.

495
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,490
Yeah.

496
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,370
Mary helped us out.

497
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,010
Picked me up from school.

498
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,530
When my mum and dad
died, she was all I had.

499
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,890
What happened to your
parents? She wouldn't say.

500
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,490
Car accident. When I was 16.

501
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,130
I stayed with Mary
for a year, but she...

502
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,770
I was bored of people feeling
sorry for me, so I went to London.

503
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,290
A levels, medical school, met Simon.

504
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,290
Moved.

505
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,090
Started a new life.

506
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,690
Had a child, then we got the house.

507
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,930
I love that house.

508
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,650
How's this working out for you?

509
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,090
Well, off the booze,

510
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,970
health's improved,

511
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,690
and she's got someone
to do the gardening.

512
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,370
- So, you'll stay a bit longer, then?
- Forever.

513
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,890
But not with her.

514
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,210
Moving on, Gemma.

515
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,490
I can recommend it.

516
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,930
Get Tom on a train up here.

517
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,850
- You don't need to stay in that place.
- Why should Simon win?

518
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,050
Who cares about winning?

519
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,170
Be happy.

520
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,610
I understand all that

521
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,850
but you made a commitment.

522
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,650
She can't stay there.

523
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,570
- Come on!
- Better or worse!

524
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,850
Rubbish! You need to leave.

525
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,050
But it's my town. I've got friends.

526
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,210
It's Simon's town, and if
you're talking about friends,

527
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,970
you could do a lot better.

528
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,610
- It's not fair.
- "Fair"! Gemma, not to be mean,

529
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,970
but that's the sort of thing

530
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,930
you were saying when you were
a little girl. Life isn't fair.

531
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,410
It's how you deal with it.

532
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,610
I was thinking in the car...

533
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,090
what if I never came back?

534
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,010
Women do that sometimes.

535
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,530
Tom would be upset, but
he'd have his dad, friends.

536
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,570
Maybe it'd all work out.

537
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,690
Who would actually miss me...

538
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,930
if I...

539
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,050
vanished?

540
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,970
You shouldn't say things like that.

541
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,170
- You know what it's like to lose a parent.
- I coped.

542
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,610
And he would too.

543
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,890
What do you mean, "vanish"?

544
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,370
You thought about it.

545
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,210
Those pills.

546
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,410
The one person in my
life that ever loved me...

547
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,930
... had gone forever.

548
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,770
- It's completely different.
- I agree.

549
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,130
Right.

550
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,010
- What's happened to me is worse.
- Now, you're being ridiculous!

551
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,690
David died in pain, coughing
up liquid... desperate.

552
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,130
There was nothing I could do...

553
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,210
- At least the time you had together was real.
- You can't compare the two!

554
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,130
It isn't like Simon's just
gone. He never existed.

555
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,890
Every moment that we spent together
was false, because he was never

556
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,290
the person that I thought he
was. Gemma, he's made a mistake,

557
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,570
that doesn't mean he's a
completely different person.

558
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,210
And my parents died, also in pain,

559
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,650
and I don't know exactly
what happened in the crash,

560
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,090
but I bet it wasn't
instant like everyone said.

561
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,730
So, I... know what it's
like to be left behind.

562
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,770
But I'm...

563
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,130
... really sorry, Jack,

564
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,530
I loved David, too, but...

565
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,970
... what's happened to me is
so much harder to deal with,

566
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,010
I promise you.

567
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,730
I'm going to bed.

568
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,130
You need to be careful
when you're upset.

569
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,650
- You've always known.
- What?

570
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,290
Exactly how to hurt people.

571
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,850
Yeah.

572
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,810
- Hi.
- Hi! Where are you?

573
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,890
In a hotel.

574
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:38,170
The conference. Didn't Becky say?

575
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,530
But you just... left.
I've been trying to call.

576
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,330
I'll be back in a couple of days.

577
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,010
You just forgot about it?

578
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,050
Things have been difficult...

579
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,690
... recently, so, yeah, I forgot.

580
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,090
You asked about that text.
I thought you might've...

581
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,850
- What?
- ... been upset.

582
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,010
- How are you?
- I couldn't sleep. I was worried.

583
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,410
Any news?

584
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,890
What news?

585
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,650
Anything you want to tell me?

586
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,290
No.

587
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,610
OK. Well... look...

588
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,570
I'll call you tomorrow?

589
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,930
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

590
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,810
Gemma!

591
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,450
Gemma!

592
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,290
Gemma!

593
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,450
Shit!

594
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,450
Gemma!

595
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,690
What are you doing?

596
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,170
It's freezing!

597
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,810
I wanted to drown.

598
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,850
I told you, that's...

599
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,090
not...

600
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,570
But then I thought...

601
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,930
No.

602
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,490
What do you mean?

603
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,770
Best put this on before
you get hypothermia.

604
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,970
Gemma, stop.

605
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,050
Wait!

606
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,530
Where are you going?

607
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,170
Home.

608
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,410
I thought you were away?

609
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,650
Simon asked me to pick up Tom.

610
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,970
I need your help.

611
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,290
What do you mean?

612
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,010
You owe it to me.

613
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,450
You're back.

614
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,170
Hey! I saw your car. You said two days.

615
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,450
I changed my mind. I
didn't want to be away.

616
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,650
I'm all over the place at
the moment. Can you tell?

617
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,690
That's why I was worried.

618
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,370
Are you ready?

619
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,010
- What for?
- Dinner.

620
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,290
We're due at half seven.

621
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,050
What? Who with?

622
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,610
Go and get a shirt on.

623
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,170
It's mad living with you sometimes!

624
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,690
What about Tom, who's... ?

625
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,050
- Becky's looking after Tom tonight.
- Gemma called,

626
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,650
said she was coming back, and
wanted to keep this dinner,

627
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,170
but the short notice meant she
didn't have childcare, so I offered.

628
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,250
Thanks.

629
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,050
You really won't tell
me where we're going?

630
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,090
You used to be into surprises.

631
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,410
Fine.

632
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,690
Do I like these people?

633
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,250
You love them.

634
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,890
It's the Parks.

635
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,410
They invited us yesterday.

636
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,930
At the football?

637
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,290
Gemma...

638
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,570
I can't.

639
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,850
What? Why not?

640
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,050
Oh, hi!

641
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,530
Hi!

642
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,170
- What?
- Gemma...

643
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:11,770
Oh, God. What's going on?
You're not expecting us...

644
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,930
Hello, Fosters!

645
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,010
- What's this? You're... ?
- I think you're a week early.

646
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,690
Really? But this is the... ?

647
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,330
- I thought... You said "Thursday" in your e-mail...
- I meant next week.

648
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:28,230
- Oh, I'm so sorry... it's my mistake!
- Oh!

649
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,470
- Ah... Come in anyway!
- No, it's fine.

650
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,510
- We'll head back, we're tired actually...
- No! Nonsense!

651
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,550
We can rustle something
up. You're here now.

652
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,230
- That'll be all right, won't it, Susie?
- Absolutely.

653
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,670
For these two, we will make
it work, come on! Come in!

654
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,330
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

655
00:52:43,331 --> 00:52:44,331
Honestly, I think we should go.

656
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,550
We've got the kids in tonight
so there'll be plenty of food,

657
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,510
it'll be fun!

658
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,960
- I'm really not...
- Come on!

659
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:51,961
God, it's gorgeous.

660
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,550
You have a place in
France? What's it called?

661
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,630
- The house?
- Does it have a name?

662
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:08,990
We'll talk.

663
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,190
Gemma, help yourself.

664
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,310
How's your love life?

665
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,190
There's been a complaint
made against me.

666
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,950
- What's the complaint?
- Chris!

667
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,910
A man says I threatened to
burn him with a lit cigarette

668
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,990
unless he left his girlfriend alone.

669
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,230
You don't mind me opening up about
the difficulties we've experienced?

670
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,280
