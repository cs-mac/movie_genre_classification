1
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,253
What's wrong with this city?

2
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:10,455
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,287
Why doesn't someone say something?

4
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:16,194
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,359
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,896
Let's bring this reckless act to an end.

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:24,338
Smoking at public places is prohibited.

8
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:26,638
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,745
Don't smoke.
Or let others smoke.

10
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,839
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,640
'Bang-Bang'
'When something really wild & exciting is about to happen'

12
00:01:58,669 --> 00:01:59,636
Colonel Nanda.

13
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:00,794
Jai Hind. - Jai Hind.

14
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,463
This is Richard Parker, MI6.

15
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:03,870
You have a gift for my country.

16
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:05,601
Indeed.
- Please come.

17
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,471
How was he apprehended?

18
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:10,138
At Heathrow airport, carrying fake documents.

19
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:13,839
Omar Zafar, India's most wanted criminal.

20
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,981
We've been looking for him for many years.

21
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,620
What was he doing in London?

22
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:21,051
There's a private island near the Russian Coast.
We heard he was here to buy it.

23
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,990
The business of terrorism has no recession, right?
- Thankyou Sir.

24
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:30,488
Yes mom. - Viren?
- Yes... - You arrived?

25
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,227
I'll call you back soon.
- Everything Ok? - Yeah, all Ok.

26
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:39,403
Wearing your sweater? - Yes mom...
- I'm sure you're not. - How did you know?

27
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:45,441
I really know my sons. Listen Jai said...
- I'll call you back, bye.

28
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,821
Permission granted.

29
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,931
Good luck. - Thanks.

30
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,177
The Kohinoor diamond is ours!

31
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,741
Bring back our Kohinoor!

32
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,377
The Kohinoor diamond is ours!

33
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,648
Bring back our Kohinoor!

34
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,648
Permission granted.

35
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:28,952
Ahh..

36
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,160
Welcome Colonel Nanda.

37
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,531
Your search for me has been very intense.

38
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,293
I would've stood up and saluted you.

39
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:42,562
But as you can see, I'm having pizza..

40
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,871
..and I'm a little tired today.

41
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,942
Would you like a slice?

42
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,641
No.

43
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,274
You eat it.

44
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:55,879
Once you get to Tihar..

45
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,517
..your next pizza will be on the day of your
execution.

46
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,881
As your last wish..

47
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,893
..with extra cheese.

48
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,393
Wake up Colonel.

49
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,604
This isn't your Delhi, it's London.

50
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,296
Tell me something..

51
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,604
..how many criminals have actually been..

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,371
..extradited to India from London?

53
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,980
None. Not even one.

54
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,680
A new extradition treaty is being prepared as we
speak.

55
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,621
According to which, any criminal..

56
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,618
..will be extradited to his homeland within 72
hours..

57
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,386
..without an appeal.

58
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,652
Very soon you're going to be begging for mercy..

59
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,828
..in an Indian court of law, Omar Zafar.

60
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,930
And then.. then what?

61
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,338
This for the public prosecutor.

62
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,870
This for the judge.

63
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,107
And this, for the police and ministers.

64
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,881
Your country is starving, Colonel..

65
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,113
..and it's full of corrupt people.

66
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:07,749
A country where everyone's begging for something.

67
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:12,594
And your ministers are always willing..

68
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:17,056
..to forsake their integrity
and sell their souls.

69
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:22,361
So tell me, what are you?

70
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,635
Are you corrupt like them or just faithfully
following orders?

71
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,611
Welcome to the Omar Zafar show.

72
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,823
Permission granted.

73
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,405
Any last wish?

74
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:36,001
Maybe some pizza with extra cheese, huh!

75
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,805
But you don't have 30 minutes.

76
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:44,149
Because the countdown to your end has begun.

77
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,556
Those who serve their country..

78
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,958
..start the countdown to their death from their
very first breath.

79
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,831
You must have taken many lives, Zafar.

80
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,665
But take a good look in these eyes.

81
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,802
There is no grief..

82
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,471
..or fear of death.

83
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,836
There's only pride.

84
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:16,319
Soon, you'll see your death in similar eyes.

85
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,845
Your countdown will begin..

86
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,214
..as soon as you press the trigger.

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,584
10

88
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,525
9

89
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,921
8

90
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,158
ZERO

91
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,551
Would you like to speak to your mother for the
last time?

92
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,987
Hello? Viren, I was saying...

93
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,293
Viren?

94
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,156
Viren what happened?

95
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,396
Are you alright?

96
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,257
Viren, are you alright?

97
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,593
Viren?!

98
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:08,167
Viren!

99
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,365
Viren I can't hear you son.

100
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:12,869
What's wrong?

101
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,438
Hello?!

102
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,902
Hello? Noone is saying anything...

103
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,609
Viren!

104
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,114
Viren talk to me!

105
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,047
Pankaj!

106
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,717
Something has happened to Viren!

107
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,687
Viren talk to me my son!

108
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:31,616
Viren?!

109
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,797
Talk to me!

110
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:41,531
Viren?!

111
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,087
Have you heard about the new treaty?
- I have.

112
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,698
Our men won't be safe anywhere,
if this treaty is signed. - It won't be signed.

113
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:22,400
There's an old wound which hasn't healed yet.
We'll just revive it.

114
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,506
The Kohinoor!

115
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,011
Stealing the Kohinoor is impossible.

116
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,144
Make it possible.

117
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,214
I want the Kohinoor!

118
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,216
And the thief should be Indian.

119
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:44,385
In a population of 1.2 billion, there must be
someone who can do this job.

120
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,309
Find him!

121
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,050
So we now have official confirmation..

122
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:05,110
..that the Kohinoor has just been
stolen from the Tower of London.

123
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,982
How was it possible?

124
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,755
The Kohinoor was stolen despite
the Tower of London's heavy security.

125
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,695
There are reports of a leak in
the Tower of London's security.

126
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,631
But the MI6 is denying any such rumours.

127
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,601
When the collection was
opened for inspection..

128
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,603
..they realized that only
the Kohinoor was missing.

129
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,367
The footage from around 500 CCTV
cameras is being inspected.

130
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,635
This investigation will hopefully
clear up a few details of the theft.

131
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:28,608
And now we would like to show you..

132
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,111
..the amazing Kohinoor's colourful history.

133
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,944
It is believed that the Kohinoor
was discovered in Tamil Nadu..

134
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,416
..and was then owned by
rulers from the Delhi, Rajput..

135
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:38,351
..Mughal, Afsharid,
Durrani and Sikh dynasties.

136
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,321
When the British ransacked India..

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,585
..and Queen Victoria was declared the Empress of India.

138
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,286
Against everyone's wishes..

139
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:47,694
..India's beloved Kohinoor was
sent all the way to Great Britain.

140
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,824
Sorry for the interruption.

141
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,699
There was one unidentified male
found in the Tower of London..

142
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,737
There are neither fingerprints nor images.

143
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,898
This isn't the work of a common
thief but of a criminal mastermind.

144
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,737
The thief is being touted
as the 'Hero' of neither fingerprints.

145
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,208
So who is this man?

146
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,108
Invisible Thief, 'Kohinoor Thief'.

147
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,976
These are some of the
names people are calling him.

148
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,809
Who is this?

149
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,975
Who will win this game between
the thief and the police?

150
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,849
This century's biggest robbery
and there is no lead..

151
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,852
..but the entire world is..

152
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,889
..waiting with bated breath to
get a look at the thief's face..

153
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,153
..who managed to steal
the Kohinoor with great skill.

154
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,286
Who is he? How did he disappear?
When will he be caught?

155
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,386
The police search is on.

156
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,522
But noone knows where he is.

157
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,101
Harleen!

158
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,938
Oh.. you're bathing!

159
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,807
Grandma, go out.

160
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,175
Grandma, please go out.

161
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,182
Quiet.

162
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,509
I've seen you grow up.

163
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,919
I've bathed you, changed your nappy.

164
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:55,917
Grandma,
I'm not a kid anymore. Go out!

165
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,357
That's what you think.

166
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,224
Don't miss the spot behind your ears.

167
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:00,728
Grandma..

168
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,929
Listen, did you know that..

169
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,201
..someone has stolen the Kohinoor.

170
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,198
Please pass me the towel.

171
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,072
Jewel thief!

172
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,441
It's hard to find such
youngsters these days.

173
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:17,840
Ashok Kumar,
Dev Anand.

174
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,946
I just want to meet a man like that..

175
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,376
..someone, who steals diamonds and hearts.

176
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:30,383
He has stolen my dream..

177
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,786
So then please go to his bathroom.

178
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,489
Hand me my towel.

179
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,962
The Kohinoor is India's property!

180
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:42,162
If someone returns this jewel to India..

181
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:46,708
..then, he should be honoured
with the 'Bharat Ratna'.

182
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,312
Bless his soul, whoever stole it!

183
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,245
Grandma, you're completely crazy.

184
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,284
I wish you were crazy too, like me.

185
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,479
You're so boring. You're always alone.

186
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,113
While all the girls your age
have a boyfriend.

187
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:04,057
Grandma,
I haven't found the right guy yet, Ok?

188
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,124
But why are you so choosy?

189
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:10,528
When I was your age,
I had at least 30 affairs.

190
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,961
Excessive quality control isn't good.

191
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,867
I don't want to deal
with complications of love.

192
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,373
You don't know what love is.

193
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,434
Love is..

194
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,108
..when your heart skips a beat,
when your eyes lock..

195
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:28,875
..and someone steals your invaluable heart.

196
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,622
Morning, boss.

197
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,665
Who stole it?

198
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,702
Sir, when you spread the word..

199
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,908
When you spread the word..

200
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,476
..about a reward on the Kohinoor..

201
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,169
..he was the only one who replied.

202
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,842
Through whom?
- Shoaib!

203
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,573
He said Sayeed sent him.

204
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,775
Wasim knows him.

205
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,682
And he's also done a job for Saqlain.

206
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,618
I am not asking about
Pakistan's batting line up.

207
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:08,781
Is he Indian?

208
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:11,686
Only an Indian can perform such a miracle.

209
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,754
Feeling patriotic?

210
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:16,758
Sorry.

211
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,966
He'll contact us as soon as
the diamond reaches India.

212
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:20,900
Price?

213
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,369
5 million dollars.

214
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:25,666
Fine.

215
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:26,800
Should we pay by cash?

216
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,105
Sure.

217
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,974
Load it in a truck and take it. - Yes.

218
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,677
Bloody fool.

219
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,480
Open an anonymous account in Mauritius.

220
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,483
As soon as you get the diamond
transfer the payment into his account.

221
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:36,882
Don't open your mouth.

222
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,813
Get to the bank and open an account.

223
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,019
Hello madam.

224
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,360
Thankyou Harleen.

225
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,004
No problem.

226
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,164
Hey Harleen, thanks for the coffee.

227
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,407
You're welcome.

228
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,240
Hello, Bank of Shimla.

229
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:09,248
Speak here please.

230
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:20,687
Hello.

231
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:22,825
Bank of Shimla.

232
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:27,860
Sorry.

233
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:28,926
How can I help you?

234
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,506
Which way is the vice-president's office?

235
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,802
It's the third cabin in the corridor,
to the right.

236
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,071
But he has resigned.

237
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,403
There's noone in the cabin.

238
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,504
Now there will be.
- Who?

239
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,707
Me. Karan Saxena.

240
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,352
Bank of Shimla's youngest vice-president.

241
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,445
And anyway, this is my uncle's bank.

242
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,114
Oh, I am so sorry, Sir.

243
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,215
No problem.

244
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,652
Name?
- Harleen Sahani.

245
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,455
Married? - No.

246
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:56,295
Boyfriend?

247
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:57,833
No.

248
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,424
Wouldn't have mattered if you had one.

249
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:00,628
Come to my cabin.

250
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,534
We need to discuss the finance strategy.

251
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,132
Strategy?

252
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,336
But.. I am a receptionist.

253
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,706
Do you want to be
a receptionist all your life?

254
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,175
Making the right friends..

255
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,769
..is also a strategy, darling.

256
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,246
Understood.

257
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,981
If you want to turn your luck around,
then come see me.

258
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,564
Sitting all alone with icecream..

259
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,437
..while your friends are at a
romantic candlelight dinner..

260
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,008
..with Mr. Right, right now?

261
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,172
But you don't worry..

262
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,544
..because your life is about to change.

263
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,106

00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,866
..like that tub of icecream.

269
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,679
Friends, Mrs. Sharmin Kapadia..

270
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,875
..is finally retiring from
our bank after 30 years.

271
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,849
Miss..
- What?

272
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:25,885
Miss Kapadia.

273
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,285
Who's that?
- That's me!

274
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:31,355
You aren't married yet?

275
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,659
Wow!

276
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:36,463
Here.

277
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,603
She had no time for marriage.

278
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,774
She spent her entire life in the bank.

279
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,812
Never took a day off in 30 years.

280
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:58,077
She never came late and
she never left early.

281
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,055
She stayed single all her life.

282
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:02,751
And she'll be single for
the rest of her life.

283
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,313
Harleen! Harleen!

284
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:33,511
What is it, grandma?

285
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:35,147
Come here quickly!

286
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,629
What happened, grandma?
- Look.. the jewel thief.

287
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:07,750
So it's you.

288
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,389
If you have what I think you have..

289
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,359
..then I am who you think I am.

290
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,234
Abdul's here.. with your order.

291
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,297
Roasted mutton, kebabs, halim..

292
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,241
..and our favorite, firni.

293
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,309
Did you order this?

294
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,613
Hey, Abdul,
you're serving the wrong people again.

295
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,776
That order's for table No. 7.

296
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,979
Mistakes can happen. Sorry.

297
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:49,058
5 million dollars is waiting for you..

298
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,224
..in an account in Mauritius.

299
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,827
One swipe of my finger..

300
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,335
..and your fate will change forever.

301
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:17,090
What's the hurry?
Let's discuss a few things first.

302
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,754
I am hungry too.

303
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:20,520
Let's eat something.

304
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,698
Abdul!

305
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:29,333
Grandma,
I am not going to fight a war.

306
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,871
I'm just going on a date.

307
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,430
You're finally settling down.

308
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,271
Now I can die in peace.

309
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,868
Enough! I'll be late.

310
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,272
Look.

311
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:40,973
Here you go.

312
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:42,981
Grandpa's car!

313
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,981
It was your grandpa's
most prized possession.

314
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,351
Yes, grandma, I know.

315
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,857
You two went on your first date
in this car.

316
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,520
I found my true love in this car.

317
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,497
And today you'll find
your true love in this car.

318
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,929
Bye grandma, Ok?
- Bye!

319
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,273
You can eat after we leave.

320
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,673
I can't think on an empty stomach.

321
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,938
What's there to think about?

322
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,274
The price has been decided.

323
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,904
Give with one hand and take with the other.

324
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:15,308
My hands are dirty.

325
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,223
Threats can be expensive.

326
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,622
How expensive?

327
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,885
5 million for each.

328
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,589
All three of you made a mistake..

329
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,990
..so now the price is 20 million dollars.

330
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,225
Wrong.

331
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,427
Now the price is zero.

332
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:38,170
Quietly hand the diamond over to us.

333
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,609
Wipe your noses all of you.

334
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,341
There's a drug in your buttermilk.

335
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,175
In exactly 5 seconds,
your mouths will be frothing..

336
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,309
..and you'll all be unconscious!

337
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:54,847
Oops!

338
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,721
I mixed up the orders.. again!

339
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,192
You ordered the buttermilk, right?

340
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,285
Thankyou Abdul.

341
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,031
Get him!

342
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,014
There he is!

343
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,819
On the roof! Shoot him!

344
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,917
There he is.

345
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,065
Get him!

346
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,132
Hey stop!

347
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:40,654
He's trapped.

348
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,021
Yes Sir. Sure.

349
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,260
We're under pressure from
the Prime Minister's office.

350
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,489
Even the opposition
is extending their support..

351
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,759
..on the Kohinoor issue.

352
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,268
This is going to affect
our Extradition Treaty.

353
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,737
They are fools!

354
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,603
The Extradition Treaty can't be
put on hold at any cost.

355
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:36,836
Sir..
Finding the Kohinoor diamond is imperative.

356
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,671
Sir.

357
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:43,149
Sir, there's been firing
on Mall Road in Shimla.

358
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,049
So. That's the police's problem.

359
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:49,752
But Sir, you should take a
look at the CCTV footage.

360
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:08,466
Yes ma'am. How may I help you?

361
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,569
Umm.. I'm Harleen.

362
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:11,335
I..

363
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:14,007
You're here to see Mr. Vickie, right?

364
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,446
Right. How do you know that?

365
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,543
We have a tie-up with trueluvv.com

366
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,554
This way, please.

367
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,419
Have a seat.

368
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,090
If you want to know anything..

369
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:30,131
..about your special friend, then..

370
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,364
..this.

371
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,162
Have a nice time ma'am.

372
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,788
Ladies and gentlemen..

373
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:03,662
..are you ready to win the Shimla Dance Festival?

374
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,597
Be there tomorrow at 7pm.

375
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,431
Bring your partner.

376
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:09,232
Have a great time.

377
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,254
Vickie?

378
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,920
Hi, I'm Vickie.

379
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:08,054
Harleen.

380
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,189
Hi Harleen. Nice to meet you.

381
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,428
You're very late.

382
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,968
And you're very beautiful.

383
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,266
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,740
I'm so late I...
Please sit.

385
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:30,480
So.. have you done this before?

386
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,752
What?

387
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,791
In a restaurant.. with a beautiful girl?

388
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:40,895
Once or twice.

389
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:43,158
Internet dating.

390
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,194
trueluvv.com

391
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:48,935
trueluvv.com?

392
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,904
Well, no..

393
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:56,967
First time.

394
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,273
It's my first time.

395
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,212
Mine too.

396
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,681
So why did you choose me?

397
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,147
Really?

398
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,190
Look at you.

399
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:13,894
But.. I didn't post my photo.

400
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,489
Aha.. ofcourse.

401
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:22,035
But the way you described
yourself so beautifully, I was just..

402
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:24,899
I just wrote two words.

403
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,166
Bank receptionist.

404
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:28,901
Exactly.

405
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:33,609
There's a story hidden behind
those two words.

406
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:35,613
Whose story?

407
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:39,118
My.. grandma's story.

408
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,889
My grandma.. was a bank receptionist too.

409
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:49,520
She made a living receiving calls at the bank..

410
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,160
..and raised all of us.

411
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:58,204
And then one day,
after transferring her last call..

412
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,871
..she passed away.

413
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:08,974
I'm so sorry.

414
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,551
What would you like to drink?

415
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,489
Some wine?

416
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,626
Thankyou.
- You're welcome.

417
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,219
Shimla.

418
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,463
Ahh.. French!

419
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,401
It's Indian, Sir.

420
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:07,934
From Nasik.

421
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:10,275
Pour it.

422
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:14,881
Enjoy, madam.
- Thanks.

423
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:16,641
So you travel around a lot.

424
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:17,946
I have to.

425
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:19,743
To save the world.

426
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:21,353
Huh?

427
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,052
From mosquitoes.

428
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,849
I work for Odomos.

429
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:28,493
And you?

430
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:30,258
Do you travel?

431
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,892
No.

432
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:35,770
I was 10 years old..

433
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:38,067
..when grandma brought me here from Canada.

434
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,908
My mom and dad passed away
in a road accident.

435
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,012
I've been here since.

436
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:47,979
Never been anywhere.

437
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,278
But one day I want to quit my job..

438
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,417
..get a round-the-world ticket and travel.

439
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:57,323
One day.

440
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,186
One day.

441
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:06,027
But how will you know that your
'one day' is here?

442
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,501
I live in a small city.

443
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:15,239
It's not easy to do what I want.

444
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,611
I live with my grandma.

445
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,847
She's my responsibility.

446
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:23,443
One day.

447
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,719
One day.

448
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,680
So you like dancing?

449
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,157
Yeah!

450
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:33,616
Well..

451
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,195
Here?
- Yeah!

452
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,458
No way.

453
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:39,864
I just dance sometimes when I am alone.

454
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,267
Harleen.

455
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:44,562
Come closer.

456
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:48,967
Come closer.

457
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:54,172
A little more.

458
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:02,287
Don't you think
that your 'one day' means never?

459
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:05,953
Today it's your grandma
you're responsible for..

460
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,491
..tomorrow it'll be your husband..

461
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,294
..and the day after, your children.

462
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:15,066
I think you should do what
you want right now.

463
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,941
I treat every day as my last.

464
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,945
So all I have is.. one day.

465
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,980
The day you start your bucket list..

466
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,911
..that day will be your 'one day'.

467
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,815
But..

468
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,618
Close your eyes.

469
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:39,958
Huh?

470
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,489
Close your eyes.

471
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:45,957
Trust me!

472
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:53,499
Harleen!

473
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,676
This one's for you!

474
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,575
Such a breeze has blown..

475
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:10,621
..that it took my breath away
from me and towards you.

476
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,890
And then I had this feeling that..

477
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:21,994
..you've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

478
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:29,340
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

479
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:32,471
How did this happen?

480
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:37,413
Neither I nor you have any idea.

481
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,680
But my heart has started
saying for some time, that..

482
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:50,925
..you've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

483
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:57,938
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

484
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,940
Neither I nor you know..

485
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,498
..how this miracle has happened.

486
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,339
What I had has gotten lost.

487
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,710
It seems as if I've gotten
something that's yours.

488
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:12,583
When my heart got to know that..

489
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:19,719
..you've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

490
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:27,098
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

491
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:51,887
Sometimes my heart says..

492
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,929
..this is the only atmosphere..

493
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:59,160
..the only way in which I want to live.

494
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:02,462
That I live every moment to the fullest.

495
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:05,768
In which this strange world
comes and embraces me.

496
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:09,366
In which you walk and the
whole world walks with you.

497
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,641
And the night softly
whispers in your ears!

498
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:17,113
That now it seems as if..

499
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:23,920
..you've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

500
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:31,325
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

501
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:34,661
Such a breeze has blown..

502
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:41,538
..that it took my breath away
from me and towards you.

503
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:45,943
And then I had this feeling that..

504
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:53,044
You've started..

505
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:59,685
You've started..

506
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:07,598
You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

507
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:14,734
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

508
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:23,674
You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours.

509
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:31,215
I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine.

510
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:00,883
He's so cute.

511
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,989
All the girls at the bank
will be so jealous.

512
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:11,525
Don't you think that your 'one day'
means never?'

513
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:19,868
I think.. you should do
what you want right now.

514
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:24,506
Vickie.

515
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,914
He's so calm..

516
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,011
..so simple..

517
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:40,859
..so cultured.

518
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,062
Yes Harleen Sahani.

519
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:48,424
He's right.

520
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,031
This moment will never come again.

521
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:04,876
Where is he?

522
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,384
Thankyou trueluvv.com!

523
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,195
What's all this?

524
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,704
It's your trueluvv.com, madam.

525
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:28,940
trueluvv.com?

526
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:31,474
Harleen?
I'm Vickie.

527
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:33,244
So sorry.

528
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,975
My mobile had a flat tire..

529
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,017
..and my car battery died.

530
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,678
But where's the other Vickie?

531
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,689
The other Vickie left this bill.

532
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:47,888
So long.

533
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,357
Who's going to pay for the furniture?

534
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,763
Your uncle?

535
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,195
You'll have to pay up, madam.

536
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,795
And anyway, this bank belongs to my uncle.

537
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,100
Uncle..

538
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,707
My uncle.

539
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:04,103
This is his card.

540
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:05,237
He'll pay you.

541
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:07,208
Sorry.

542
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,052
trueluvv..

543
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:19,919
If he ever shows up,
I'll run him over with this car!

544
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,057
Oh shit!

545
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:27,660
Oh..

546
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:29,194
I'm sorry!

547
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,136
Are you Ok?

548
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:34,039
Yeah. I'm good. I'm good.

549
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,773
You! - Hi.

550
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:39,377
Rajveer.
- What?

551
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:41,711
My name.
- Yeah, sure.

552
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,814
Like I am going to believe
you after all the lies.

553
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,350
I lied about my name, but I swear..

554
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,754
..everything else was true.

555
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,761
Ok. Don't move. One second.

556
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,898
You need a doctor!

557
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,591
I don't need a doctor.

558
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:01,699
Maybe..

559
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,028
Maybe what?

560
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:04,432
..a kiss.

561
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:06,065
Kiss?!

562
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,837
You're crazy.

563
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,036
I'm leaving.

564
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,375
I seriously think you need a doctor.

565
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,574
They saw you at the restaurant with me.

566
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:16,845
Who?

567
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,610
They think you know something.

568
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,313
What do I know?
- Nothing.

569
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,445
But they don't know that.

570
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,046
They don't know that I don't know anything.

571
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,489
No, they think you know something..

572
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,355
..but they don't know that
you don't know anything.

573
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,190
What do I know? - Nothing.

574
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:29,855
So do they know that?
- Stop!

575
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,392
This bullet won't kill
me but this confusion will.

576
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:39,973
Harleen Sahani.

577
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:46,037
So you're saying that
the girl was with him.

578
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:47,403
Yes Sir.

579
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,473
And this is her uncle's card.

580
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:52,284
Sir, please help us recover our money.

581
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:55,015
Karan Saxena.

582
00:42:58,526 --> 00:42:59,754
Listen to me.

583
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:03,794
I stole something.

584
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:04,865
What?

585
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:09,626
I took the bullet out.
You just need to stitch it up.

586
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:10,728
Stitch?

587
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:15,242
So.. hold this torch,
point it right here.

588
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,108
Here.

589
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,505
I can't do this.

590
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,072
Ofcourse you can.

591
00:43:20,148 --> 00:43:21,115
Come on.

592
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:21,841
Help.

593
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,144
Hold on.

594
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,542
Ok.

595
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:29,314
Steady... Steady.

596
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:36,461
Perfect.

597
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:38,766
Excellent.

598
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:43,001
I have never seen anyone hold
the torch so perfectly before.

599
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:44,697
Thanks.

600
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:51,173
Steady. Steady.
- Done?

601
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:52,705
Steady.

602
00:43:54,616 --> 00:43:56,049
Almost done.

603
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:57,148
It's really good.

604
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:58,912
Thankyou so much for helping me.

605
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:01,479
Ok.

606
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:02,712
Done.

607
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:04,958
Here. Drink this.

608
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,822
What was in this?

609
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:40,555
Who are you?

610
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:44,324
Rajveer Nanda, international criminal.

611
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:47,027
Pathologically, psychopathic schizophrenic.

612
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,431
I need psychiatric help.

613
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:51,930
What?

614
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:54,737
I don't, but that's
what they're going to say.

615
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,243
What was in the water? - Sedatives.

616
00:44:58,346 --> 00:44:59,506
Why?

617
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,041
Now listen to me.

618
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:04,212
Two kinds of people will approach you.

619
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:06,643
First the government agents.

620
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:08,845
And second, those who aren't
government agents.

621
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,882
They'll both ask you about me.

622
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:13,053
When you don't tell them anything..

623
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:16,289
..they'll say that they're
taking you to a 'safe' place.

624
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:19,190
Why are you stressing on 'safe'?

625
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:20,256
Listen to me.

626
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,429
There will be a gun hidden in the car..

627
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,764
..which they'll use to transport you.

628
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,030
Gun?

629
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:28,473
If it's a Skoda,
it'll be under the left seat.

630
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,108
And if it's a Toyota,
then it'll be under the right.

631
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:32,107
Ok.

632
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:36,980
Take the gun out and use it
to scare them and escape.

633
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:38,416
Escape?

634
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,883
And if they ask about me..

635
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:45,483
I don't know..

636
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:47,860
You don't know me.

637
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:51,859
I don't know you..

638
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,594
Perfect.

639
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:55,593
Perfect.

640
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,805
Perfect.

641
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:02,870
Perfect.

642
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:08,476
I don't know anything.

643
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:10,107
Let me go!

644
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:11,515
Where is Shoaib?

645
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:13,986
I don't know any Shoaib.

646
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,917
Forgive me!

647
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,020
I swear on my uncle!

648
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:20,023
And he's still alive!

649
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:21,652
What does this code mean?

650
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:23,924
Harleen, bank receptionist.

651
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:26,360
What code?

652
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,467
Harleen?

653
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:30,466
That's not a code word.

654
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,836
Our bank receptionist is named Harleen.

655
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:33,874
Yes.

656
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:45,311
Good morning ma'am.

657
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,444
Absolutely.

658
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:49,485
Boss...

659
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,557
We can transfer the funds.

660
00:46:56,664 --> 00:46:58,757
The consignment will be there.

661
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:15,707
Goodbye.

662
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,082
What's this nonsense?

663
00:47:20,154 --> 00:47:21,781
Boss he got away from us!

664
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:25,017
Got away?
Who wanted to catch him?

665
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:27,222
You just had to pay him and
take the diamond!

666
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:27,989
That's it.

667
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:29,689
Shoaib tried to take it with force, but..

668
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,095
But.. he couldn't.

669
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:33,099
Boss, there was a girl with him.

670
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:03,461
Don't you think that your 'one day'
means never?

671
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:11,930
The day you start your bucket list..

672
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,135
..that day will be your 'one day'.

673
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,147
What's the matter?

674
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:31,252
What time did you get home last night?

675
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:41,333
I am not old-fashioned
like your parents, silly!

676
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,664
Who was it?

677
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,529
Rajveer.

678
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,270
I lied about the name, but I swear..

679
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,674
..everything else was true.

680
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:53,839
I don't know.

681
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:55,439
Don't know?
How strange!

682
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,508
You spent the night with him
and you don't know his name!

683
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:00,520
Even I am not that modern.

684
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:04,450
I get it.

685
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:08,393
Your heart's finally been stolen.

686
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:27,710
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

687
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:30,784
Ahh, you came and acquired it without rent.

688
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,877
I couldn't say a thing.
How is this helplessness?

689
00:49:33,955 --> 00:49:37,322
Thus silently came an uninvited guest.

690
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,360
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

691
00:49:40,428 --> 00:49:45,024
I don't know when nor how he came.

692
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:51,168
What did he whisper to the heart?

693
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:57,869
I don't know when nor how he came.

694
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:04,148
What did he whisper to the heart?

695
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:09,881
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

696
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:12,983
You came and acquired it without rent.

697
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,029
I couldn't say a thing.
How is this helplessness?

698
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:19,624
Thus silently came an uninvited guest.

699
00:50:19,734 --> 00:50:21,292
Ahh, in my heart..

700
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:23,302
In my heart..

701
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:26,204
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

702
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:45,958
What would you make me do in dreams?

703
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:51,464
How many colours should
I change for no reason?

704
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:55,494
My poor, foolish heart flutters
in the skies like a balloon.

705
00:50:55,603 --> 00:50:58,800
Gently you called.
Wherever you go, it follows.

706
00:50:58,873 --> 00:51:00,431
It just went with eyes closed.

707
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:01,998
Slowly following you.

708
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:04,704
Little by little it pulls you.
Whether you look or not.

709
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:09,307
I don't know when nor how he came.

710
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:15,484
What did he whisper to the heart?

711
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:34,435
To say, it's because of you..

712
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,671
..the whole world seems to be a new place.

713
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,837
To say, it's because of you..

714
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:44,017
..the whole world seems to be a new place.

715
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:47,315
Everyone knows and everybody has an idea..

716
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:49,150
..what ever happened to us.

717
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:56,561
See, now you also stop giving excuses.

718
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,190
Give me the gift of heart for heart.

719
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:06,471
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

720
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,636
I don't know when nor how he came.

721
00:52:12,947 --> 00:52:17,145
What did he whisper to the heart?

722
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:22,419
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

723
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,115
Ahh,
there was a little empty space in my heart.

724
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:26,524
Oh madam!

725
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:28,185
Oh madam, what's going on?

726
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:30,028
This is the office, not your home.

727
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:32,031
The phone's ringing, answer it.

728
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:41,263
Hello, Bank of Shimla.

729
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,973
No Sir, wrong number.

730
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,877
Hi, how can I help you?

731
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:55,712
Open..

732
00:52:56,624 --> 00:52:57,682
What?

733
00:52:57,992 --> 00:53:01,120
A big account needs to be opened.

734
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:03,757
Sorry, Sir.

735
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:07,196
Since you must have been paid big money..

736
00:53:07,902 --> 00:53:09,699
..for what you did last night.

737
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:11,397
Excuse me..

738
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,838
..what nonsense!

739
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,409
Maybe.

740
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:19,938
Maybe to get rid of your loneliness..

741
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:22,380
..you visited that site..

742
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,342
trueluvv.com

743
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:28,187
What happens on this site?

744
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,217
I visited that site once.

745
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,783
It gets really interesting at night.

746
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:36,662
No.. it was only for the investigation.

747
00:53:36,764 --> 00:53:38,891
Investigation.
Nothing more.

748
00:53:42,203 --> 00:53:44,831
Zorawar Kalra, government agent.

749
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,771
We need to have a little chat
about what you did last night.

750
00:53:48,876 --> 00:53:50,366
Some Q & A.

751
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:54,278
But, if you prefer, we can talk right here..

752
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:55,874
..in front of everyone.

753
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:05,456
Ms. Sahani,
the man you were with last night..

754
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:07,460
..is an international criminal.

755
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:10,495
Mentally unstable and pathologically..

756
00:54:10,598 --> 00:54:12,293
Psychopathic schizophrenic?

757
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,295
He told me you would say that.

758
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:21,233
Just like I thought. He's too smart.

759
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,276
He's using you.

760
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:25,071
Just have a look.

761
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,618
Criminals like him are very charming.

762
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:40,756
He can drug you.

763
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,963
He can kill you. Take your life.

764
00:54:47,801 --> 00:54:48,597
Excuse me.

765
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:51,866
Sir.. we passed the police station.

766
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:52,564
Yes.

767
00:54:52,673 --> 00:54:56,905
Your life's in danger,
so we're taking you to a safe place.

768
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:01,808
Safe place?

769
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:07,353
Yes, but why are you saying it like that?

770
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:10,354
No reason.

771
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,528
If it's a Skoda,
it'll be under the left seat.

772
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,199
And if it's a Toyota,
then it'll be under the right seat.

773
00:55:21,702 --> 00:55:23,294
What car is this?

774
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,629
It's a Honda.
- Why do you ask?

775
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:28,369
It's nice.

776
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,437
What's the mileage?

777
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,502
10-12 on the highway.

778
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,404
It also depends on the driving.

779
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:35,709
If we're chasing someone..

780
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:37,375
..we use the brake and accelerator more.

781
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:39,442
In a situation like that the
mileage drops to around 7-7.5

782
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:42,118
Yes, Sir.
- Are you trying to sell it?

783
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:43,655
No, Sir.

784
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:44,918
Sorry, Sir.

785
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:48,154
Yes.. we're just getting there.

786
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:49,962
Stop the car!

787
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:52,927
The girl's got a gun.

788
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,791
Where did you get that gun?

789
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:55,800
Stop the car!

790
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,995
Keep driving, she won't do anything.

791
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,071
Come on, give me that gun!

792
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,474
I didn't do that!
- Give me the gun!

793
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:03,736
I don't know how to fire a gun!
- Come on.

794
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,278
Sir, that bike's missing a rider.

795
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,911
Oh God!

796
00:56:25,032 --> 00:56:26,021
Where did he go?

797
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:28,128
Where did he go,
Sir?

798
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:31,729
There he is, Sir.

799
00:56:37,378 --> 00:56:38,208
Hey!

800
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:42,013
Stop that girl.

801
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:43,276
Hey girl.

802
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:45,741
Stop her! Stop her!

803
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,980
I will kill you. Stop!

804
00:56:58,465 --> 00:56:59,523
Mummy, mummy.

805
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,760
What is it, son?

806
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:13,906
Hey... Harleen!

807
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:15,813
Hey trueluvv.

808
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:17,140
What?

809
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:20,152
Closer! Come on, you can do it.

810
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:21,183
What?

811
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:22,414
Flip..

812
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:23,620
What?

813
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,447
Come on!

814
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,590
Hey!

815
00:57:43,243 --> 00:57:44,073
The wire.

816
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,137
Careful.

817
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,753
Hurry up.

818
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:04,729
Left.

819
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:08,466
Drive faster!

820
00:58:30,057 --> 00:58:31,490
Mind if I drive?
- Huh?

821
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:32,684
Shift Harleen.

822
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,660
Trust me. Shift!
- Hold on a second.

823
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:42,359
What's up?

824
00:58:52,513 --> 00:58:53,673
Are you crazy?

825
00:58:58,552 --> 00:58:59,484
Ram him!

826
00:58:59,553 --> 00:59:00,986
Don't let him get away.

827
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,563
What are you doing?

828
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:41,751
Please, stop the car!

829
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,394
Rajveer, stop the car!

830
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:56,006
Have you lost your mind?

831
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,770
Rajveer..

832
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,710
Don't get out of the car.

833
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:10,885
Help!

834
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:13,426
This man's crazy.
I am not with him.

835
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,922
I'm with you.
I'm with you.

836
01:00:16,997 --> 01:00:18,658
I'm with you.

837
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,364
What did I say?

838
01:00:21,468 --> 01:00:22,457
Don't get out of the car.

839
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:24,366
What did you do?
- I got out of the car.

840
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:26,565
Harleen, understand.

841
01:00:26,907 --> 01:00:30,274
Either you're safe with me..
or 'safe' with them.

842
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,574
Safe or.. - Safe. Safe.

843
01:00:32,646 --> 01:00:34,375
Good. Hold this.

844
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:35,545
Shift a bit.

845
01:00:39,653 --> 01:00:40,483
Thankyou.

846
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,249
Please stop killing people!

847
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:43,983
Please stop killing people!

848
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:45,718
Please stop killing people!

849
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:46,823
Please..

850
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,991
You're in shock.
I understand.

851
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,225
Wait here, and I'll go explain
a few things to them.

852
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:56,360
Yes.

853
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,402
Ok.

854
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,167
Actually you know what, I won't lie.

855
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:02,299
I'm just going to shoot them.

856
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:07,640
By the way,
you drive really well.

857
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:09,179
I mean..

858
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:10,544
You saved our lives today.

859
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:12,915
I just.. I want you to know that.

860
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:14,547
I'm really impressed.

861
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,987
Wait here,
I'll.. I'll be back.

862
01:01:57,531 --> 01:01:58,657
Safe.

863
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,934
Harleen!
- Karan.

864
01:02:05,005 --> 01:02:06,996
Harleen, Harleen.
I've been looking for you.

865
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:07,938
Karan I'm in big trouble.

866
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:08,871
Trouble?

867
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,738
They slapped me because of you!

868
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,142
I was shot at!

869
01:02:12,212 --> 01:02:14,112
They drank my expensive champagne.

870
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:15,842
Who?
- Government agents.

871
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:18,417
But why?
- Because you work for Shoaib.

872
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:19,877
Who's Shoaib?

873
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,486
Omar Zafar's right-hand man!

874
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:23,146
Who's Omar Zafar?

875
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,089
Excuse me,
who are you?

876
01:02:28,195 --> 01:02:29,093
That's him.

877
01:02:29,196 --> 01:02:30,493
He's the reason you were slapped..

878
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:31,962
..and I was shot at.

879
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:33,624
Rajveer, what are you doing here?

880
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,667
Rajveer?

881
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,559
Rajveer who?

882
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:39,863
The one that's going to smack
you if you don't shut up.

883
01:02:43,577 --> 01:02:45,169
Now listen carefully.

884
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,168
I'm taking your car.

885
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:48,441
Hello..

886
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:52,315
Rajveer Zafar,
don't you dare look at my car..

887
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:53,886
..or I'll break your hands.

888
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:55,818
I am a green-belt in kung fu karate.

889
01:02:55,889 --> 01:02:59,825
My flying kick is so fast that
I can knock a flying bird out of the air.

890
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:02,420
Oh uncle..

891
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:03,258
You shot him!

892
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,854
You shot me!

893
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:06,193
Harleen, get in the car.

894
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:08,962
Why did you shoot him?
- Why did you shoot me?

895
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,868
Harleen, get in the car.
- Don't get in the car Harleen.

896
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:14,837
Harleen, get in the car.

897
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:20,603
Flesh wound.

898
01:03:21,248 --> 01:03:22,738
Nowhere close to the bone.

899
01:03:24,117 --> 01:03:24,879
Good shot huh?

900
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,953
Very good. But why?

901
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,647
You were about to use your
flying kick on me.

902
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,186
Couldn't take a chance.

903
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:31,716
Now listen.

904
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,458
Count to 100 after we leave.

905
01:03:35,262 --> 01:03:37,059
Then you can call the police,
ambulance, everyone.

906
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:38,324
Ok.

907
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:40,329
If you call them before you count to 100..

908
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:42,294
..I'll come back and shoot you.

909
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:44,303
But how will you know?

910
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:46,769
I'll shoot you even if
you ask stupid questions.

911
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:49,842
I'll count to 200.. swear on my uncle.

912
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:51,332
Good.

913
01:03:56,817 --> 01:03:58,751
Please fasten your seatbelt.

914
01:03:59,953 --> 01:04:01,511
One.. uncle..

915
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:02,847
Two..

916
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:04,182
Three.. uncle..

917
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:15,365
By the way,
I didn't want to shoot him.

918
01:04:15,902 --> 01:04:17,062
Then why did you?

919
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:20,664
Those who don't want to shoot, don't shoot.

920
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:23,266
That bullet's going to make him..

921
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,637
..the hero of this city.

922
01:04:25,812 --> 01:04:27,074
You're crazy.

923
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,078
You're insane.

924
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:30,649
You just shoot at anyone.

925
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,049
That's just not normal.
That's not normal by any definition.

926
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:36,355
I know what I'm doing.

927
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,885
Please stop the car.

928
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:39,420
I want to go home.

929
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:40,887
Away from you.

930
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,263
Relax Harleen.
Just calm down.

931
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:46,525
Maybe I was safe with them.

932
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,102
What did you just say?

933
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:55,002
And you're scared to be with me?

934
01:04:56,443 --> 01:04:58,434
I should never have trusted you.

935
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:01,811
Really?

936
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,848
Oh.. Ok.

937
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:10,450
Ok then.

938
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:34,577
Megha, listen to me.

939
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:36,105
Listen to me.

940
01:05:36,216 --> 01:05:37,615
I don't want to talk to you. - Why not?

941
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:38,911
I don't want to talk to you. - Why?

942
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:41,283
I don't want to.
- Ok, I am sorry.

943
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,286
Please.

944
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:44,021
Excuse me.

945
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,018
Excuse me!

946
01:05:46,393 --> 01:05:48,725
How can you just leave me like this and go?

947
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:50,318
Answer me!

948
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,294
Why did you shoot Karan
if you didn't need me?

949
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:55,727
And why are you stealing that car?

950
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:58,100
Why did you steal this one,
if you didn't need it?

951
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,298
And you say you're not crazy?

952
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,534
What do you want?

953
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:05,935
You've a problem if I'm with you.

954
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,971
Now I'm going away,
and you still have a problem.

955
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:11,209
Look, I am really sorry
that we have to be together..

956
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:13,752
..but it's only to ensure you stay alive.

957
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:16,314
If I'm not with you, you're dead.

958
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:18,787
Do you understand that? Dead!

959
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:21,589
And maybe you'll find this strange..

960
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,693
..but I've other things to do
apart from saving your life.

961
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,899
And they are quite important.

962
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:29,330
And..

963
01:06:31,638 --> 01:06:32,570
You know what?

964
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:35,339
I don't really care any more.

965
01:06:36,609 --> 01:06:38,839
Here's the key, there's the car.

966
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,069
Drive home.

967
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,817
A for Assam, J for Jammu.

968
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:22,252
7739

969
01:07:22,322 --> 01:07:25,155
Check every white BMW in the city.

970
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:28,786
The suspect is in HP-51-AJ 7739.

971
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:02,592
Look...

972
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:05,993
To this day I've never been the..

973
01:08:07,634 --> 01:08:09,534
..cause of death of an innocent person.

974
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,737
I don't want you to be the first.

975
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,104
Especially when you've been
waiting for that 'one day' all your life.

976
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:23,272
Your dreams would've died with you.

977
01:08:31,124 --> 01:08:32,182
Are you hungry?

978
01:08:35,662 --> 01:08:36,856
Let's eat.

979
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:50,535
Do you have money?

980
01:08:53,012 --> 01:08:54,479
Don't you work in a bank?

981
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,015
That's so stupid.

982
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,550
What if I worked at a hospital?

983
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,150
Would I be carrying medicines?

984
01:09:02,455 --> 01:09:03,649
Now what?

985
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:07,651
Shoot someone.

986
01:09:09,596 --> 01:09:11,826
You like that, don't you..
shooting people?

987
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:15,292
If he doesn't give you free food,
shoot him.

988
01:09:16,302 --> 01:09:18,202
Again? Really?

989
01:09:19,172 --> 01:09:21,163
I shot them to save your life.

990
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,868
Please can we move on from that now?

991
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,639
I never asked for your help.

992
01:09:25,812 --> 01:09:27,211
I can manage.

993
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:28,705
Can I take your order, Sir?

994
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:31,716
My life was perfect until I met you.

995
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:34,046
Perfect?!

996
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,719
No wonder you were begging on the internet.

997
01:09:38,191 --> 01:09:39,658
Me Harleen, bank receptionist.

998
01:09:39,726 --> 01:09:41,591
Please meet me. Please.

999
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,492
Somebody please. Internet hello, help.

1000
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:44,790
Hello. Please somebody help!

1001
01:09:44,864 --> 01:09:47,264
Hello? Anybody out there? Hello?
Please somebody?

1002
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,732
Nobody? No?

1003
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,711
We can't decide between
thin crust or stuffed crust.

1004
01:09:58,811 --> 01:09:59,641
That's the problem.

1005
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:01,805
Why don't you try a pan pizza?

1006
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:03,306
What would you like honey?

1007
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:04,474
Don't call me honey!

1008
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:06,348
Then gimme some money.

1009
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:11,451
Actually you know what,
I'll just shoot him.

1010
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,226
What am I thinking?
I should just do it. Yeah.

1011
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:15,261
Don't.

1012
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:16,492
Here's the money.

1013
01:10:16,563 --> 01:10:18,360
Just don't shoot anyone, please.

1014
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:21,959
Two pan pizzas, please.
And two Mountain Dews.

1015
01:10:23,403 --> 01:10:25,098
And we're with Karan Saxena..

1016
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:28,163
..who risked his life to try and
catch a dangerous criminal.

1017
01:10:28,274 --> 01:10:31,505
He shot at Harleen.. but I intervened.

1018
01:10:31,578 --> 01:10:33,011
But the bullet hit your leg.

1019
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:34,636
It was a kung-fu style jump.

1020
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:41,176
My flying kick is so fast,
I can kick a flying bird in the air.

1021
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,724
What have you done that so
many people are gunning for your life?

1022
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:11,348
Do I need to solve that to get an answer?

1023
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:21,358
Nice.

1024
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:22,959
What is it?

1025
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:24,593
Don't you read the papers?

1026
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:38,404
Please tell me this isn't something
that starts.. with the letter K.

1027
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,015
Are you crazy?

1028
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,046
That's the...

1029
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:50,855
You're a thief!

1030
01:11:51,591 --> 01:11:54,827
I thought you were on a mission..

1031
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:57,456
..to save the country. The world!

1032
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:02,059
I can't believe I trusted you.

1033
01:12:03,269 --> 01:12:04,634
You still trust me.

1034
01:12:04,704 --> 01:12:06,103
Yeah, right.

1035
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:09,107
That's why you haven't raised your voice yet.

1036
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,840
You can expose me whenever you like.

1037
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:15,509
But why did you steal the Kohinoor?

1038
01:12:15,682 --> 01:12:16,774
For Omar Zafar.

1039
01:12:23,323 --> 01:12:25,086
There are women and children around.

1040
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:27,756
Let's talk peacefully..

1041
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:35,263
Omar Zafar.

1042
01:12:35,702 --> 01:12:38,865
The No. 1 criminal on Interpol's most wanted list.

1043
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,273
As soon as he put a reward on
the Kohinoor, Rajveer stole it.

1044
01:12:45,712 --> 01:12:47,907
The restaurant has been surrounded.

1045
01:12:48,715 --> 01:12:49,977
Escape is impossible.

1046
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:54,083
So if you come with us quietly..

1047
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,720
..it'll be good for everyone.

1048
01:12:59,192 --> 01:13:03,185
As far as I know, he isn't going to
come with us quietly.

1049
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:05,163
So you decide.

1050
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:10,898
Do you want to stay safe
with us or die for this thief?

1051
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:15,572
Decide now.

1052
01:13:18,778 --> 01:13:19,904
ls it true?

1053
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:28,151
You know, even after
everything that's happened..

1054
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:31,355
..my heart was telling me
you're a good guy.

1055
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:38,297
Crazy.. but not a criminal.

1056
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:42,595
I was wrong.

1057
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,598
I am leaving.

1058
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,500
I'm sorry Harleen.

1059
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:52,472
But I can't let you go.

1060
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:58,944
Boys!

1061
01:14:12,965 --> 01:14:14,557
What a jump, Sir!

1062
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:19,362
By the way, that's a one-way ticket to heaven.

1063
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:24,001
He won't die so easily.

1064
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:27,902
Someone is watching over him.

1065
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:44,595
Don't worry Harleen.

1066
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:46,359
We're safe.

1067
01:14:57,043 --> 01:14:58,442
Time to jump!

1068
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,273
Trust me!

1069
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:03,711
Conquer your fears!

1070
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,666
Who are you?

1071
01:16:39,672 --> 01:16:40,661
Hey!

1072
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:42,901
Good morning.

1073
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:44,942
You shot me!

1074
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:46,671
Ssshhhh!

1075
01:16:47,013 --> 01:16:47,877
Ssshhhh!

1076
01:16:47,947 --> 01:16:49,141
Don't 'ssshhhh' me!

1077
01:16:49,382 --> 01:16:51,213
You shot me!

1078
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:54,647
If I had shot you, I wouldn't need
to 'ssshhhh' you.

1079
01:16:57,624 --> 01:16:59,785
It was a dart. A dart.

1080
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,518
A tranquilizer.

1081
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:05,926
Whatever it was, why did you shoot me?!

1082
01:17:06,633 --> 01:17:07,497
Hey!

1083
01:17:07,533 --> 01:17:09,228
I'm talking to you!

1084
01:17:09,602 --> 01:17:13,094
It was a tranquilizer dart.
I could've died!

1085
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:14,431
Ssshhhh!
- Ssshhhh!

1086
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,030
What the hell do you think of yourself?

1087
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:17,603
I'll show you Ssshhhh!

1088
01:17:17,944 --> 01:17:20,010
I'll show you Ssshhhh!

1089
01:17:25,051 --> 01:17:27,542
I sedated you for your own good.

1090
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:30,715
If I hadn't saved you...
- They would've killed me.

1091
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:31,620
Right?

1092
01:17:32,392 --> 01:17:33,222
Right.

1093
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,887
By the way you're looking good
in these clothes I bought you.

1094
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,427
Now go to the room and dry these clothes..

1095
01:17:39,432 --> 01:17:41,327
..because we don't have any more clothes.

1096
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:45,695
My clothes?

1097
01:17:46,606 --> 01:17:48,164
Who changed my clothes?

1098
01:17:48,508 --> 01:17:49,998
Relax, I changed them myself.

1099
01:17:50,376 --> 01:17:52,105
You?
- I swear.

1100
01:17:52,745 --> 01:17:54,142
You changed my clothes.

1101
01:17:54,347 --> 01:17:55,939
Yes. Oh.. oh.

1102
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:57,643
I see.

1103
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:00,345
Come on Harleen.

1104
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,516
If I can evade 50 guards,
100 security cameras..

1105
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:06,024
..and steal the Kohinoor
from the Tower of London.

1106
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,984
So, why can't I change your clothes
with my eyes closed?

1107
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:12,359
I'm not admitting that my eyes were closed, but..

1108
01:18:12,765 --> 01:18:13,697
I deserved that.

1109
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,994
Ok..

1110
01:18:15,135 --> 01:18:16,830
Wo...

1111
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:24,135
Look Harleen. You're really good at martial arts..

1112
01:18:24,878 --> 01:18:26,072
..but save it for later.

1113
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:28,378
I'm hungry right now.

1114
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:30,174
Can we eat?

1115
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:32,575
Let's eat.

1116
01:18:52,438 --> 01:18:53,962
Can you tell us where Harleen is?

1117
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,974
We want to know where Harleen is.

1118
01:18:58,444 --> 01:19:00,844
I cannot answer any of your questions..

1119
01:19:00,947 --> 01:19:02,642
..without first consulting my lawyer.

1120
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:05,878
Grandma, please stop watching American serials.

1121
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:08,951
Hello!

1122
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,421
Grandma!
- Who? Harleen!

1123
01:19:11,491 --> 01:19:12,185
Harleen.

1124
01:19:12,258 --> 01:19:14,283
Look, Harleen's on the line!

1125
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,224
Hello?

1126
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:17,522
Grandma! Grandma!

1127
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,009
Sir, we've traced the location.

1128
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:46,891
Have you finished sightseeing?

1129
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:51,056
It's a pretty big island.

1130
01:19:53,499 --> 01:19:57,731
If you want to kill me,
then please kill me.

1131
01:19:58,204 --> 01:20:00,468
I don't want to kill you Harleen.

1132
01:20:01,174 --> 01:20:04,075
I just want to finish cooking dinner.

1133
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:07,545
Come on.

1134
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,312
You can cook too?

1135
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:17,913
Cooking was my third subject in school.

1136
01:20:19,492 --> 01:20:21,016
Which school did you go to?

1137
01:20:21,261 --> 01:20:22,159
DPS.

1138
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:23,852
Delhi Public School.

1139
01:20:24,364 --> 01:20:25,558
Dehradun Public School.

1140
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:30,893
Who are you?

1141
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:34,399
A thief.

1142
01:20:38,044 --> 01:20:39,602
So it is true.

1143
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:43,014
You stole the Kohinoor for Omar Zafar.

1144
01:20:43,616 --> 01:20:44,605
Yes.

1145
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,949
But did I ever say I'm giving it to him?

1146
01:20:49,022 --> 01:20:50,284
Then why did you steal it?

1147
01:20:50,356 --> 01:20:52,517
So that noone else steals it.

1148
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:55,091
It's 'safe' with me.

1149
01:20:55,428 --> 01:20:57,191
Why don't you hand it over to the police..

1150
01:20:57,297 --> 01:20:58,730
..or the government?

1151
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:02,965
You girls are so cute.

1152
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:04,965
Why don't you hand it over to someone?

1153
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:08,138
Harleen, Omar Zafar..

1154
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:10,773
..has contacts within the
police and the government.

1155
01:21:11,944 --> 01:21:13,605
Noone can be trusted.

1156
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:17,648
Right?
- Right.

1157
01:21:18,017 --> 01:21:18,984
Right.

1158
01:21:20,386 --> 01:21:21,614
Then what's the plan?

1159
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:22,847
Plan?

1160
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,554
There's no plan.

1161
01:21:29,562 --> 01:21:32,053
Right now everyone's
trying to figure out my plan.

1162
01:21:32,565 --> 01:21:34,863
And they must be trying
to make a counter-plan.

1163
01:21:35,568 --> 01:21:37,195
But, if I don't have a plan..

1164
01:21:37,403 --> 01:21:39,030
..how will they catch me?

1165
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,376
That is the stupidest thing I ever heard.

1166
01:21:44,977 --> 01:21:46,001
Yeah!

1167
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,313
So.. is this your hideout?

1168
01:21:53,252 --> 01:21:54,879
Yes. One of them.

1169
01:21:55,488 --> 01:21:57,149
How many more do you have?

1170
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:59,282
12. No.. 11.

1171
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,293
The one in Burma blew up last month.

1172
01:22:06,532 --> 01:22:09,933
You say a lot of bullshit!

1173
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:16,165
Who are you? And what do you really do?

1174
01:22:18,311 --> 01:22:19,710
I'll never know.

1175
01:22:21,247 --> 01:22:22,544
There he is!

1176
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
Harleen!

1177
01:22:33,259 --> 01:22:34,624
How's it possible?

1178
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:36,789
Noone saw us coming here.

1179
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:38,696
And I didn't make any calls.

1180
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:40,327
And you..

1181
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:44,031
I.. made a call..

1182
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,361
..from your phone. Sorry.
- Oh Harleen!

1183
01:22:58,684 --> 01:22:59,844
Come on let's go!

1184
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:23,338
Hands up!

1185
01:23:28,414 --> 01:23:29,608
What should I kill you for?

1186
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:32,011
For trying to catch me, or..

1187
01:23:32,852 --> 01:23:34,786
..for bringing along only
four men to catch me?

1188
01:23:36,823 --> 01:23:38,381
I stole the Kohinoor dude!

1189
01:23:39,358 --> 01:23:40,791
Show me some respect.

1190
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:43,186
Hand over the Kohinoor..

1191
01:23:43,262 --> 01:23:45,059
..or Zafar will not spare you.

1192
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:47,899
And where do I find this Zafar?

1193
01:23:48,267 --> 01:23:49,564
I don't know.

1194
01:23:50,002 --> 01:23:51,060
Speak up!

1195
01:23:51,237 --> 01:23:53,262
Zafar never meets anyone.

1196
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:56,875
Then who were you going to
hand over the Kohinoor to?

1197
01:23:58,211 --> 01:23:59,200
Huh?

1198
01:24:01,347 --> 01:24:02,678
Tell me!

1199
01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:05,843
Zafar won't care if you're dead.

1200
01:24:06,352 --> 01:24:08,377
Gul. Hamid Gul.

1201
01:24:09,188 --> 01:24:12,021
My job was to hand over
the Kohinoor to Hamid.

1202
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:13,850
Wonderful.

1203
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:16,385
And where can I find him?

1204
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:23,961
Think about it.

1205
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:28,297
Gul or.. death!

1206
01:24:29,509 --> 01:24:31,374
I'll tell you!

1207
01:24:31,711 --> 01:24:33,406
Bel Air.. Prague.

1208
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:34,611
Bel Air.

1209
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:38,778
He's there!
- Everybody move!

1210
01:24:44,557 --> 01:24:46,388
She's over there!
- Chase them!

1211
01:27:42,835 --> 01:27:44,166
Welcome to Prague.

1212
01:27:51,811 --> 01:27:53,608
We can't stay here too long.

1213
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,206
So we should ahh...

1214
01:27:57,116 --> 01:28:00,017
You know, my life was really simple.

1215
01:28:01,587 --> 01:28:03,578
Just me and grandma.

1216
01:28:04,023 --> 01:28:05,615
Bank and home.

1217
01:28:06,525 --> 01:28:09,085
I never imagined life beyond that.

1218
01:28:10,096 --> 01:28:12,030
Since I've met you..

1219
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:14,825
..life has turned into an action film.

1220
01:28:16,435 --> 01:28:18,460
God knows what will happen next.

1221
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:23,002
But I'm not scared now.

1222
01:28:25,644 --> 01:28:27,077
I trust you.

1223
01:28:34,086 --> 01:28:36,884
You've made my dreams come true.

1224
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:40,482
And you?

1225
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:44,062
What is your dream?

1226
01:28:48,134 --> 01:28:49,624
We should go.

1227
01:28:50,269 --> 01:28:51,930
What's your 'one day'?

1228
01:29:02,815 --> 01:29:03,713
Home.

1229
01:29:06,652 --> 01:29:08,313
After it's all over..

1230
01:29:10,689 --> 01:29:12,088
..home sweet home.

1231
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:18,690
One day...

1232
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:28,537
Where are we going?

1233
01:30:05,778 --> 01:30:10,215
The desires of the heart were a little less.

1234
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:16,183
All my prayers were also a little light.

1235
01:30:16,755 --> 01:30:20,589
But when you put your head on my shoulders..

1236
01:30:22,428 --> 01:30:26,159
..it was as if you tied the thread in the shrine.

1237
01:30:28,133 --> 01:30:32,365
Without asking, I've gotten everything.

1238
01:30:32,438 --> 01:30:38,070
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1239
01:30:38,143 --> 01:30:43,740
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1240
01:30:43,849 --> 01:30:49,116
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1241
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:06,338
Let me take your hands in mine..

1242
01:31:06,405 --> 01:31:11,638
..so that I can read my fate.

1243
01:31:12,244 --> 01:31:17,580
I look for the wishes, hiding in your eyes.

1244
01:31:17,683 --> 01:31:23,144
So that as you think of a wish, I'll fulfill it.

1245
01:31:24,423 --> 01:31:27,256
Just a while ago I was incomplete.

1246
01:31:27,326 --> 01:31:29,920
Now that I am in front of you I am complete.

1247
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:31,485
I can't even see..

1248
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:34,999
..where I end and where you begin.

1249
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:39,436
When your eyes fall on me..

1250
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:45,203
..then only am I able to sleep.

1251
01:31:45,978 --> 01:31:49,709
For a few days I've been feeling..

1252
01:31:51,684 --> 01:31:55,313
..you are my worship and you are my faith.

1253
01:31:57,189 --> 01:32:01,148
Without any reason, out of nowhere..

1254
01:32:01,694 --> 01:32:07,291
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1255
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:12,837
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1256
01:32:13,072 --> 01:32:18,442
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1257
01:32:41,567 --> 01:32:44,400
God has created everyone.

1258
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,938
But who should go and tell God that..

1259
01:32:47,006 --> 01:32:51,807
..only while dying for you, I breathe.

1260
01:32:52,911 --> 01:32:55,812
The prayers that I make to God..

1261
01:32:55,914 --> 01:32:58,348
..all of them reach you now.

1262
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:04,184
If you hear them, then God has heard them too.

1263
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,925
The world doesn't know, even I don't know, where..

1264
01:33:08,027 --> 01:33:10,461
..both of us got united.

1265
01:33:10,729 --> 01:33:15,564
It's true that there's noone like you.

1266
01:33:15,634 --> 01:33:19,968
You are the destination to all my roads..

1267
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:25,777
..in this life, and in every life.

1268
01:33:26,578 --> 01:33:30,070
Let's try and stop time now.

1269
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:35,843
Let's teach it the meaning of love.

1270
01:33:38,057 --> 01:33:41,857
It'll surely stop being stubborn and agree to us.

1271
01:33:42,361 --> 01:33:47,890
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1272
01:33:48,133 --> 01:33:53,196
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1273
01:33:53,872 --> 01:33:58,900
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1274
01:33:59,578 --> 01:34:04,641
God has showered his benevolence upon me.

1275
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:30,397
Where are we going?

1276
01:34:30,943 --> 01:34:32,570
Not we, just me.

1277
01:34:33,278 --> 01:34:34,472
You stay here.

1278
01:34:34,546 --> 01:34:36,173
Order something from room service.

1279
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:38,806
I believe the sushi's really good.

1280
01:34:39,451 --> 01:34:42,147
I'll be back soon, Ok?
- No.

1281
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:45,980
You don't know this, but you need me.

1282
01:34:47,493 --> 01:34:48,687
We're a team now.

1283
01:34:50,028 --> 01:34:51,120
Harleen.

1284
01:34:51,196 --> 01:34:55,326
Take me along, or I'll follow you.

1285
01:34:59,037 --> 01:35:01,130
Get ready.
- Ok.

1286
01:35:57,729 --> 01:35:58,923
Police.

1287
01:36:11,944 --> 01:36:13,912
Don't try to kiss me.

1288
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:16,446
It never crossed my mind.

1289
01:36:17,282 --> 01:36:18,271
Liar.

1290
01:36:18,984 --> 01:36:20,144
You did.

1291
01:36:20,986 --> 01:36:22,044
No.

1292
01:36:23,855 --> 01:36:24,981
Did you?

1293
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:27,380
No.

1294
01:36:31,096 --> 01:36:32,961
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1295
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:36,390
Ofcourse I have.

1296
01:36:37,202 --> 01:36:38,100
Really?

1297
01:36:38,904 --> 01:36:39,802
When?

1298
01:36:40,906 --> 01:36:42,100
In school?

1299
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:44,197
No.

1300
01:36:44,776 --> 01:36:46,175
After that.

1301
01:36:47,946 --> 01:36:49,243
Impossible.

1302
01:36:54,586 --> 01:36:57,680
See? I do know how to kiss.

1303
01:36:59,358 --> 01:37:00,985
You call that a kiss?

1304
01:37:02,527 --> 01:37:03,425
Yes.

1305
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:05,594
Why?

1306
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:09,996
This.. is a kiss.

1307
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:16,757
What do we do now?

1308
01:38:17,202 --> 01:38:19,466
I need to find someone
to give the Kohinoor to.

1309
01:38:19,871 --> 01:38:21,270
Who?

1310
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,637
Hamid Gul.

1311
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:24,773
Excuse me.
- Yes ma'am.

1312
01:38:24,876 --> 01:38:26,434
I'm looking for Mr. Hamid Gul.

1313
01:38:26,712 --> 01:38:27,440
There he is ma'am.

1314
01:38:27,546 --> 01:38:29,036
See, there's Hamid Gul.

1315
01:38:29,147 --> 01:38:30,341
Hold on.

1316
01:38:31,683 --> 01:38:35,175
Please just.. leave this to me, Ok?

1317
01:38:35,787 --> 01:38:37,084
You're jealous.

1318
01:38:37,322 --> 01:38:39,483
You're jealous because
I'm better than you.

1319
01:38:39,591 --> 01:38:42,219
And you didn't want to bring me here.

1320
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:44,492
Beginner's luck.

1321
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:50,058
Now Agent 000.. let's try our luck.

1322
01:38:51,703 --> 01:38:52,635
14 Red.

1323
01:38:52,738 --> 01:38:55,104
Wow! That's a lot of money.

1324
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,167
Changing 50,000.

1325
01:39:00,746 --> 01:39:02,714
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.

1326
01:39:03,982 --> 01:39:05,677
I don't know how to play.

1327
01:39:06,051 --> 01:39:08,178
Bet everything on No. 31.

1328
01:39:08,253 --> 01:39:09,720
All of it?

1329
01:39:10,489 --> 01:39:11,888
All of it.

1330
01:39:16,061 --> 01:39:17,323
No more bets.

1331
01:39:23,735 --> 01:39:25,396
31 black. Congratulations!

1332
01:39:26,972 --> 01:39:27,930
We won!

1333
01:39:28,306 --> 01:39:29,468
We won!

1334
01:39:29,574 --> 01:39:30,973
Congratulations Sir.

1335
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:35,603
Now?

1336
01:39:35,714 --> 01:39:37,147
Place your bets please.

1337
01:39:37,349 --> 01:39:38,543
26.

1338
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:40,178
Ok.

1339
01:39:46,091 --> 01:39:47,524
The winner is 26 red.

1340
01:39:47,993 --> 01:39:50,154
We won again!

1341
01:39:51,396 --> 01:39:53,425
Ok.
- Can I just take this one?

1342
01:39:53,665 --> 01:39:54,432
Thankyou.

1343
01:39:55,634 --> 01:39:57,665
Here you go Sir, congratulations.
- Enough of this... - Thankyou.

1344
01:39:57,935 --> 01:40:00,201
Are people hot as this?! Come on, let's go.

1345
01:40:00,472 --> 01:40:01,969
Let's go. - 17.

1346
01:40:03,942 --> 01:40:05,136
No...

1347
01:40:05,477 --> 01:40:06,535
No. 17.

1348
01:40:06,611 --> 01:40:07,976
Are you sure?

1349
01:40:09,281 --> 01:40:10,179
Ok.

1350
01:40:10,248 --> 01:40:11,272
17.

1351
01:40:13,251 --> 01:40:14,616
No more bets.

1352
01:40:16,855 --> 01:40:18,516
The winner is 7 red.

1353
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:20,057
Oh yeah!

1354
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:21,489
No!

1355
01:40:23,762 --> 01:40:25,320
That confirms it.

1356
01:40:25,397 --> 01:40:26,989
17 means danger.

1357
01:40:27,065 --> 01:40:28,555
Then why did you say 17?

1358
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,292
A minute ago I was rich.

1359
01:40:30,402 --> 01:40:32,666
A minute ago you didn't know
how to play roulette.

1360
01:40:32,904 --> 01:40:34,337
I should never have listened to you.

1361
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:35,337
Ahaa...

1362
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,634
Everything was fine when you were winning.

1363
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,140
You were hugging and kissing me.

1364
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,609
You girls are all the same.

1365
01:40:39,945 --> 01:40:41,207
How dare you?

1366
01:40:41,413 --> 01:40:43,005
Perfect.
- What?

1367
01:40:43,114 --> 01:40:44,547
Hit me.
- No.

1368
01:40:44,616 --> 01:40:46,550
Just hit me.
- I'm sorry.

1369
01:40:46,651 --> 01:40:48,312
I can't slap anyone without a reason.

1370
01:40:48,386 --> 01:40:50,820
You can't slap, you can't kiss,
what can you do?

1371
01:40:50,922 --> 01:40:52,014
Beg for romance over the internet?

1372
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:53,557
Ooh, bank receptionist.

1373
01:40:55,193 --> 01:40:56,421
Good. Very good!

1374
01:40:57,829 --> 01:40:59,262
Good. Now go to the bathroom..

1375
01:40:59,364 --> 01:41:00,228
..and when he gets there..

1376
01:41:00,332 --> 01:41:01,765
..tell him you will meet him in 5 minutes.

1377
01:41:01,867 --> 01:41:03,266
Alone. Go, go, go.

1378
01:41:06,304 --> 01:41:07,498
Go to hell.

1379
01:41:12,811 --> 01:41:14,278
Excuse me. I'll be back.

1380
01:41:22,454 --> 01:41:25,014
Unfortunate are those people..

1381
01:41:26,658 --> 01:41:28,091
..who do not know the worth..

1382
01:41:28,193 --> 01:41:30,286
..of a diamond they own.

1383
01:41:34,432 --> 01:41:36,866
Not a diamond but the Kohinoor.

1384
01:41:38,403 --> 01:41:39,734
The Kohinoor!

1385
01:41:40,138 --> 01:41:41,469
The Kohinoor can't be stolen.

1386
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,308
That depends on the thief.

1387
01:41:45,844 --> 01:41:47,209
Hamid Gul.

1388
01:41:48,446 --> 01:41:49,777
And the thief's intentions?

1389
01:41:50,115 --> 01:41:51,082
Stealing.

1390
01:41:51,683 --> 01:41:53,048
The Kohinoor's desire?

1391
01:41:54,653 --> 01:41:56,086
Some fresh air.

1392
01:41:57,556 --> 01:41:59,456
In 15 minutes, two glasses of champagne..

1393
01:41:59,524 --> 01:42:02,049
..and a thief will be waiting
for you on the terrace.

1394
01:42:03,328 --> 01:42:04,352
5 minutes.

1395
01:42:04,863 --> 01:42:07,423
Or someone may steal the Kohinoor.

1396
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:12,864
Nice.

1397
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,499
Well done!

1398
01:42:20,912 --> 01:42:22,209
Now go back to the hotel.

1399
01:42:22,614 --> 01:42:23,945
I'll meet you there.

1400
01:42:25,016 --> 01:42:29,146
And after this.. you.. me.

1401
01:42:30,689 --> 01:42:32,850
I mean.. we..

1402
01:42:34,426 --> 01:42:36,326
Y'know, you're completely crazy.

1403
01:42:39,898 --> 01:42:41,331
I'll be waiting.

1404
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:07,581
Whiskey on the rock huh!

1405
01:43:11,262 --> 01:43:12,991
Greetings, Hamid Gul.

1406
01:43:18,103 --> 01:43:19,695
How did you find me?

1407
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,433
I stole the Kohinoor dude,
show me some respect.

1408
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:24,470
But if you really want to know..

1409
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:25,600
..your man Robert gave me..

1410
01:43:25,677 --> 01:43:27,235
..your address.

1411
01:43:29,014 --> 01:43:30,208
Just the address.

1412
01:43:32,617 --> 01:43:33,948
But the modus operandi was all mine.

1413
01:43:35,654 --> 01:43:38,316
You're a thief..
but not a very smart thief.

1414
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:40,615
You were never going to be paid anyway.

1415
01:43:40,992 --> 01:43:43,688
But now you'll lose the diamond and your life.

1416
01:43:43,928 --> 01:43:46,556
If it was about the money, why would I
sell the Kohinoor to you?

1417
01:43:47,766 --> 01:43:49,233
What do you really want?

1418
01:43:50,568 --> 01:43:51,796
Omar Zafar.

1419
01:43:54,005 --> 01:43:56,200
So why the Kohinoor?

1420
01:43:56,574 --> 01:43:58,508
Who are you?

1421
01:44:21,266 --> 01:44:22,597
Where is Zafar?

1422
01:44:24,436 --> 01:44:25,425
Tell me!

1423
01:44:25,737 --> 01:44:26,567
Hey!

1424
01:44:31,409 --> 01:44:32,774
Tell me where Zafar is.

1425
01:44:32,877 --> 01:44:34,208
Tell me!

1426
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:38,445
You'll never find Zafar.

1427
01:44:41,853 --> 01:44:42,945
Hey you! Hey!

1428
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:20,086
Look, Rajveer only wants
to keep the Kohinoor safe.

1429
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:22,126
The Kohinoor was safe in London..

1430
01:45:23,027 --> 01:45:24,858
..until he stole it.

1431
01:45:25,196 --> 01:45:27,494
If he hadn't, someone else would have stolen it.

1432
01:45:27,565 --> 01:45:28,691
Oh really?

1433
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:30,794
If it was that easy, then..

1434
01:45:30,902 --> 01:45:33,097
..why didn't anyone steal it for 150 years?

1435
01:45:33,872 --> 01:45:35,965
What else did he tell you..

1436
01:45:36,274 --> 01:45:37,571
..which could be true?

1437
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,911
He said that you will kill me.

1438
01:45:44,215 --> 01:45:45,739
But you're still alive.

1439
01:45:48,019 --> 01:45:49,577
Where is he right now?

1440
01:45:51,289 --> 01:45:52,847
He's with someone called Hamid Gul.

1441
01:45:52,957 --> 01:45:54,686
Hamid Gul is dead.

1442
01:45:55,927 --> 01:45:57,258
He's dead.

1443
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:02,464
Internal Secret Service Chief,
Mr. Narayanan.

1444
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,729
Kohinoor's desire.

1445
01:46:10,308 --> 01:46:11,639
Open air.

1446
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:15,101
In 15 minutes, two glasses of champagne..

1447
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:17,444
..and a thief will be waiting
for you on the terrace.

1448
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:19,542
5 minutes.

1449
01:46:19,617 --> 01:46:23,144
And we found his body
on that same terrace.

1450
01:46:24,689 --> 01:46:26,657
Do you know what this means?

1451
01:46:30,461 --> 01:46:34,090
Ms. Harleen, you're an international criminal now.

1452
01:46:35,366 --> 01:46:37,698
Killing you will be easy for us.

1453
01:46:38,303 --> 01:46:40,237
But we know the truth.

1454
01:46:40,572 --> 01:46:42,005
Ms. Harleen..

1455
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:46,472
..you have an opportunity..

1456
01:46:46,578 --> 01:46:48,341
..to get your life back.

1457
01:46:49,147 --> 01:46:51,240
To go back to your grandma.

1458
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:55,586
And that opportunity is
sealed in this transmitter.

1459
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:08,755
'You're an international criminal now.'

1460
01:47:11,202 --> 01:47:12,464
'I trust you.'

1461
01:47:15,073 --> 01:47:17,871
'What else did he tell you which could be true?'

1462
01:47:31,222 --> 01:47:32,780
Come with me. We can't stay here now.

1463
01:47:32,891 --> 01:47:33,823
Let's go.

1464
01:47:44,235 --> 01:47:45,793
You left a long while ago from there.

1465
01:47:46,237 --> 01:47:47,363
Where were you?

1466
01:47:47,972 --> 01:47:50,566
Do you want the truth or
should I lie like you.

1467
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,507
What did I lie about?

1468
01:47:54,112 --> 01:47:55,875
You lied about everything.

1469
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,708
About you.
About us.

1470
01:47:59,317 --> 01:48:00,944
About Hamid Gul.

1471
01:48:01,986 --> 01:48:03,510
You killed him, didn't you?

1472
01:48:05,123 --> 01:48:06,385
Who told you that?

1473
01:48:06,457 --> 01:48:07,651
Zorawar.

1474
01:48:13,731 --> 01:48:16,063
So you still have the Kohinoor.

1475
01:48:56,374 --> 01:48:58,604
Why did you pretend to be Vickie that day?

1476
01:49:01,646 --> 01:49:03,739
You should have left me alone.

1477
01:49:06,517 --> 01:49:09,077
Why did you let me live out my dreams..

1478
01:49:09,654 --> 01:49:11,246
..and show me new ones?

1479
01:49:13,224 --> 01:49:15,055
I will fulfill all of them.

1480
01:49:18,129 --> 01:49:19,391
Trust me.

1481
01:49:21,432 --> 01:49:22,729
Enough.

1482
01:49:24,102 --> 01:49:25,660
I don't want to any more.

1483
01:49:29,774 --> 01:49:31,298
Then what are you waiting for?

1484
01:49:41,986 --> 01:49:43,510
Stay, don't move!

1485
01:49:43,621 --> 01:49:45,111
Your hands in the air..

1486
01:49:45,189 --> 01:49:46,156
..now!

1487
01:49:47,692 --> 01:49:49,523
Go go go go go!

1488
01:49:55,867 --> 01:49:57,095
Rajveer!

1489
01:50:13,885 --> 01:50:16,410
If the bullet doesn't kill him, he'll drown.

1490
01:50:20,691 --> 01:50:22,955
You've got your life back.

1491
01:50:25,496 --> 01:50:26,656
Go on.

1492
01:51:35,066 --> 01:51:38,627
Thank God, you're back
home safe and sound.

1493
01:51:39,403 --> 01:51:42,463
This house doesn't feel the same without you.

1494
01:51:47,211 --> 01:51:50,044
After it's all over, home sweet home.

1495
01:51:50,982 --> 01:51:52,279
Which school did you go to?

1496
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,578
Dehradun Public School.

1497
01:52:33,724 --> 01:52:34,816
Hey!

1498
01:52:35,793 --> 01:52:37,090
What are you looking for?

1499
01:52:37,195 --> 01:52:39,629
Actually Sir, I.. - Pankaj, what?

1500
01:52:39,697 --> 01:52:40,493
Excuse me.

1501
01:52:40,598 --> 01:52:41,496
What are you doing?

1502
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:43,260
She was snooping around like a thief..

1503
01:52:43,367 --> 01:52:44,698
..and you're questioning me?

1504
01:52:44,769 --> 01:52:49,103
No no Sir.. you ordered these books
on the internet.

1505
01:52:49,207 --> 01:52:50,868
I didn't order any books.

1506
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:54,870
Oh Pankaj, you never remember anything.

1507
01:52:54,946 --> 01:52:56,470
Now put that stupid gun inside.

1508
01:52:56,547 --> 01:52:58,276
Come in my dear.

1509
01:52:58,616 --> 01:52:59,583
Come.

1510
01:53:04,188 --> 01:53:05,815
You have a lovely home.

1511
01:53:10,328 --> 01:53:12,091
How long have you been living here?

1512
01:53:12,463 --> 01:53:13,930
In this house?

1513
01:53:14,298 --> 01:53:15,287
Can't remember.

1514
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:18,061
Pankaj, must be 40 years right?

1515
01:53:18,669 --> 01:53:19,533
Here. - Thankyou.

1516
01:53:19,604 --> 01:53:21,299
For as long as we've been married.

1517
01:53:21,405 --> 01:53:22,702
It's beautiful.

1518
01:53:22,807 --> 01:53:24,672
Everything seems so new.

1519
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:27,708
Yes.. Pankaj won the Lottery for the second time.

1520
01:53:27,812 --> 01:53:29,837
You won the lottery twice?

1521
01:53:31,482 --> 01:53:32,949
Yeah he's really lucky.

1522
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:34,412
Right Pankaj?

1523
01:53:35,319 --> 01:53:36,650
So lucky that...

1524
01:53:36,721 --> 01:53:38,552
Yes yes, I know.

1525
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:40,616
He'll say he doesn't remember..

1526
01:53:40,691 --> 01:53:42,420
..when he bought a lottery ticket.

1527
01:53:42,493 --> 01:53:43,425
Like he doesn't remember..

1528
01:53:43,494 --> 01:53:45,428
..when he took part in the bank's lucky draw.

1529
01:53:45,496 --> 01:53:46,929
And, he also doesn't remember..

1530
01:53:47,031 --> 01:53:49,158
..when he ordered these books on the internet.

1531
01:53:49,367 --> 01:53:50,925
Let me get some tea.

1532
01:53:54,438 --> 01:53:55,427
Sir..

1533
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,572
..this is Rajveer's hideout right?

1534
01:54:00,544 --> 01:54:01,772
Excuse me?

1535
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,738
What do you mean?

1536
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:07,711
What? What's going on?

1537
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:11,347
Nothing. I was just..

1538
01:54:12,723 --> 01:54:13,747
I should be leaving.

1539
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,805
Our sons.

1540
01:54:32,643 --> 01:54:33,905
Our brave sons.

1541
01:54:36,681 --> 01:54:38,171
This is Viren.

1542
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,979
Died in the line of duty.

1543
01:54:41,485 --> 01:54:43,715
And him.. he's Jai.

1544
01:54:45,856 --> 01:54:47,289
He was in the army too.

1545
01:54:48,326 --> 01:54:51,625
Or maybe he's still in the army. I don't know.

1546
01:54:52,363 --> 01:54:54,263
He was posted in Kargil..

1547
01:54:54,398 --> 01:54:55,922
..when he heard about Viren.

1548
01:54:56,467 --> 01:54:57,661
And since then..

1549
01:54:58,035 --> 01:55:00,902
..they say that he was on a mission and..

1550
01:55:01,806 --> 01:55:05,139
..the lake was really deep and...

1551
01:55:05,242 --> 01:55:06,732
He's absolutely fine..

1552
01:55:07,878 --> 01:55:09,402
..no matter what people say.

1553
01:55:16,887 --> 01:55:18,354
He won this trophy in..

1554
01:55:18,823 --> 01:55:20,984
..the state swimming championship.

1555
01:55:22,293 --> 01:55:23,521
He was the only one..

1556
01:55:24,095 --> 01:55:26,928
..who could swim across the lake in one breath.

1557
01:55:27,631 --> 01:55:29,758
I refuse to believe he's dead.

1558
01:55:49,754 --> 01:55:50,686
Hello?

1559
01:55:51,188 --> 01:55:52,519
Hello!

1560
01:55:52,757 --> 01:55:53,883
Anybody there?

1561
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:59,596
Harleen.

1562
01:56:01,132 --> 01:56:03,430
Excuse me. Who are you?

1563
01:56:04,168 --> 01:56:06,398
I'll ask the questions, not you.

1564
01:56:07,938 --> 01:56:09,200
Where is the Kohinoor?

1565
01:56:09,407 --> 01:56:12,399
I don't know, please let me go.

1566
01:56:16,247 --> 01:56:17,407
Zafar.

1567
01:56:17,915 --> 01:56:19,644
I am Omar Zafar.

1568
01:56:29,193 --> 01:56:31,058
How did you get this?

1569
01:56:31,262 --> 01:56:32,957
Not how, but why did I get this?

1570
01:56:33,898 --> 01:56:35,456
Why do I have it?

1571
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:40,397
If you didn't want it,
why steal it in the first place?

1572
01:56:40,738 --> 01:56:42,831
Where's the real Kohinoor?

1573
01:56:43,541 --> 01:56:44,735
That was a fake?

1574
01:56:44,942 --> 01:56:48,400
The real one would've shattered the hammer.

1575
01:56:50,981 --> 01:56:53,006
She spent a lot of time with Rajveer.

1576
01:56:53,584 --> 01:56:55,552
Baktawar?
- Zorawar.

1577
01:56:55,686 --> 01:56:57,278
So she won't tell us so easily.

1578
01:56:57,354 --> 01:56:58,651
You're with him?

1579
01:56:59,957 --> 01:57:02,357
I gave him the Kohinoor I had.

1580
01:57:02,626 --> 01:57:04,491
I don't know where the real one is.

1581
01:57:05,796 --> 01:57:09,027
Quiet! Or else...

1582
01:57:09,233 --> 01:57:10,598
Get it?

1583
01:57:11,435 --> 01:57:12,402
Yes.

1584
01:57:12,736 --> 01:57:14,601
That's like a good girl.

1585
01:57:20,444 --> 01:57:21,570
Ow!

1586
01:57:24,648 --> 01:57:28,243
No more wisecracks from you.

1587
01:57:36,227 --> 01:57:39,492
Now you'll only speak the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1588
01:57:39,864 --> 01:57:40,888
Tell me.

1589
01:57:41,665 --> 01:57:43,496
Tell you what? - The truth.

1590
01:57:45,069 --> 01:57:48,038
Honestly speaking Mr. Bhatnagar...
- Zorawar!

1591
01:57:48,906 --> 01:57:50,669
With that moustache..

1592
01:57:50,908 --> 01:57:52,876
..you look like a South-Indian hero.

1593
01:57:52,943 --> 01:57:54,308
What? - Yes.

1594
01:57:56,647 --> 01:57:59,207
And you know, my grandma's life..

1595
01:57:59,283 --> 01:58:00,875
..is more exciting than mine.

1596
01:58:00,951 --> 01:58:01,918
Quiet!

1597
01:58:03,053 --> 01:58:05,283
Just tell us where the Kohinoor is.

1598
01:58:05,656 --> 01:58:06,884
Kohinoor.

1599
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:16,695
Rajveer has the Kohinoor.

1600
01:58:17,968 --> 01:58:19,492
But Rajveer is dead.

1601
01:58:22,006 --> 01:58:24,031
No.. he's alive!

1602
01:58:36,287 --> 01:58:38,016
He planned all of this.

1603
01:58:53,103 --> 01:58:55,571
He wants me to think that he's dead..

1604
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:57,764
..so that you think he's not alive.

1605
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:06,347
But he doesn't know that I know he's alive.

1606
01:59:06,584 --> 01:59:09,212
He thinks that I think he's dead.

1607
01:59:09,453 --> 01:59:11,284
Understand Mr. Zindagi Ek Safar?

1608
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:20,653
If he's alive, I'll be absolutely fine.

1609
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:28,565
You two are such fools.

1610
01:59:29,139 --> 01:59:31,903
That day on the bridge,
he pressed the transmitter himself.

1611
01:59:36,947 --> 01:59:38,505
He could've escaped.

1612
01:59:38,716 --> 01:59:41,378
But he intentionally gave me the fake Kohinoor..

1613
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:54,661
..so that you would bring me here..

1614
01:59:54,732 --> 01:59:56,927
..and he could come after you.

1615
02:00:21,325 --> 02:00:22,986
Rajveer, Hi.

1616
02:00:23,193 --> 02:00:24,524
Not bad Harleen.

1617
02:00:24,828 --> 02:00:27,388
You turned out to be a lot
smarter than these fools.

1618
02:00:36,874 --> 02:00:43,245
I can't imagine the wit,
courage and obsession..

1619
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,311
..one needs to get here.

1620
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:47,850
Not as much as you think.

1621
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:54,753
Luckily, neither you nor
your men are too smart.

1622
02:01:01,131 --> 02:01:05,534
Who's smart and who isn't
won't be decided so fast Rajveer.

1623
02:01:09,673 --> 02:01:14,076
That will be decided when one of us is dead..

1624
02:01:14,344 --> 02:01:16,209
..and the other one has the Kohinoor.

1625
02:01:31,195 --> 02:01:32,856
The question now is..

1626
02:01:33,097 --> 02:01:35,031
..how much pain can you endure..

1627
02:01:35,365 --> 02:01:37,162
..before handing over the Kohinoor.

1628
02:01:40,871 --> 02:01:43,271
Tell me.. where is the Kohinoor?

1629
02:01:43,841 --> 02:01:47,436
Otherwise, it'll be Harleen's
turn to endure the pain.

1630
02:01:47,878 --> 02:01:49,140
Tell me!

1631
02:01:49,847 --> 02:01:52,645
The Kohinoor is where it should be.

1632
02:01:55,085 --> 02:01:56,347
In London.

1633
02:01:57,054 --> 02:01:58,453
You're lying.

1634
02:01:59,089 --> 02:02:01,956
The Kohinoor's been stolen.
Everyone knows that.

1635
02:02:02,059 --> 02:02:04,619
Because we said it's been stolen.

1636
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:07,327
What do you mean?

1637
02:02:07,397 --> 02:02:08,728
This was a joint operation..

1638
02:02:08,832 --> 02:02:11,266
..of the Indian Secret Service and London's MI6.

1639
02:02:12,569 --> 02:02:14,764
When you asked for the Kohinoor..

1640
02:02:15,739 --> 02:02:17,536
..we made our plan.

1641
02:02:19,543 --> 02:02:22,205
The Kohinoor is safe in its place, Zafar.

1642
02:02:25,716 --> 02:02:30,517
But unfortunately, you're not so safe.

1643
02:02:31,054 --> 02:02:34,387
You mean.. the Kohinoor was never stolen.

1644
02:02:38,428 --> 02:02:40,487
Brilliant, Rajveer!

1645
02:02:40,564 --> 02:02:41,826
Brilliant.

1646
02:02:43,033 --> 02:02:47,026
Not everyone is fortunate enough
to hear their eulogy before dying..

1647
02:02:47,871 --> 02:02:49,429
..but what's the point?

1648
02:02:51,241 --> 02:02:52,936
How will you save yourself now?

1649
02:02:54,011 --> 02:02:57,310
Because the countdown to your death
has already begun.

1650
02:02:57,815 --> 02:02:59,112
Those who serve their country..

1651
02:02:59,216 --> 02:03:02,481
..start the countdown to their
death from their very first breath, Zafar.

1652
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:07,653
Take a good look in these eyes.

1653
02:03:08,592 --> 02:03:10,150
There's no grief..

1654
02:03:11,295 --> 02:03:12,762
..or fear of death.

1655
02:03:15,365 --> 02:03:17,060
There's only pride.

1656
02:03:18,435 --> 02:03:23,065
Soon.. you'll see your death in similar eyes.

1657
02:03:24,441 --> 02:03:25,738
Remember anything?

1658
02:03:28,045 --> 02:03:29,342
Colonel Nanda.

1659
02:03:30,347 --> 02:03:32,144
How are you related to him?

1660
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:37,218
I am his brother.

1661
02:03:39,857 --> 02:03:42,724
The countdown to your death started that day,
Zafar.

1662
02:03:44,027 --> 02:03:46,621
And it ends.. today.

1663
02:03:48,765 --> 02:03:49,697
10!

1664
02:03:55,005 --> 02:03:55,972
9!

1665
02:03:58,775 --> 02:03:59,639
8!

1666
02:04:02,112 --> 02:04:03,374
Aye!! Go out and see what's happening!

1667
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,606
7!

1668
02:04:05,849 --> 02:04:07,077
6!

1669
02:04:08,018 --> 02:04:09,110
5!

1670
02:04:10,254 --> 02:04:11,221
He's not alone.

1671
02:04:11,288 --> 02:04:12,755
Who else is with you?

1672
02:04:12,856 --> 02:04:13,823
4!

1673
02:04:16,293 --> 02:04:17,317
3!

1674
02:04:18,562 --> 02:04:20,120
You won't get out alive either.

1675
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:21,394
2!

1676
02:04:21,665 --> 02:04:23,724
You'll die just like your brother.

1677
02:04:24,134 --> 02:04:25,032
1!

1678
02:04:36,713 --> 02:04:37,645
Bang-Bang!

1679
02:05:00,170 --> 02:05:02,695
They gave me an injection because of you!

1680
02:05:06,643 --> 02:05:07,974
That injection won't kill you.

1681
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:09,636
You'll just speak the truth, that's all.

1682
02:05:09,713 --> 02:05:10,805
Ok? Let's go.

1683
02:05:18,188 --> 02:05:20,850
The truth is I wasted my entire life.

1684
02:05:21,725 --> 02:05:23,056
They're shooting, Harleen. Let's go!

1685
02:05:24,661 --> 02:05:26,128
All those boys..

1686
02:05:26,229 --> 02:05:29,721
..Dilip, Jaggi, Harbhajan.. all the same..

1687
02:05:30,167 --> 02:05:31,464
..boring, boring, boring.

1688
02:05:31,535 --> 02:05:32,524
Duck!

1689
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:37,463
But not you.

1690
02:05:37,541 --> 02:05:39,509
You're very hot and exciting!

1691
02:05:40,077 --> 02:05:41,066
Jump!

1692
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:48,247
You really excite me.

1693
02:05:48,518 --> 02:05:49,507
Good.

1694
02:05:49,619 --> 02:05:51,416
That's good. Shall we go now?

1695
02:06:02,566 --> 02:06:06,024
Your muscles are so strong.

1696
02:06:06,436 --> 02:06:08,529
I want to tear your clothes off.

1697
02:06:08,905 --> 02:06:10,736
But I can't..

1698
02:06:10,974 --> 02:06:13,033
..because I am not exciting enough.

1699
02:06:13,443 --> 02:06:15,536
Harleen! We have to go.

1700
02:06:20,817 --> 02:06:22,375
Do I look sexy to you?

1701
02:06:22,686 --> 02:06:23,675
A lot.

1702
02:06:24,921 --> 02:06:26,582
Then why didn't you do something?

1703
02:06:26,857 --> 02:06:27,721
What?

1704
02:06:27,791 --> 02:06:29,383
Why didn't you do something?

1705
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,089
Thank God you won't remember anything.

1706
02:06:32,429 --> 02:06:34,522
I will remember everything.

1707
02:06:34,598 --> 02:06:37,362
The truth is, you don't love me.

1708
02:06:37,968 --> 02:06:39,595
You find me boring.

1709
02:06:40,904 --> 02:06:41,893
Rajveer.

1710
02:06:43,306 --> 02:06:45,467
Harleen get on the bike. Come on hurry up!

1711
02:07:14,738 --> 02:07:16,205
Soon we'll part ways.

1712
02:07:16,573 --> 02:07:18,234
You'll go on to live your exciting life..

1713
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:20,475
..and me, my boring life.

1714
02:07:24,815 --> 02:07:27,079
Why would you be with a boring girl?

1715
02:07:28,218 --> 02:07:29,742
You're not boring Harleen.

1716
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,978
Then what am I?

1717
02:07:34,324 --> 02:07:35,222
Tell me!

1718
02:07:35,559 --> 02:07:36,548
What am...

1719
02:07:38,161 --> 02:07:41,858
You're sexy, exciting, crazy, and right now.. alive.

1720
02:07:41,998 --> 02:07:43,590
Let's keep it that way, Ok!

1721
02:07:44,634 --> 02:07:45,601
Unzip me.

1722
02:07:48,939 --> 02:07:49,564
Now?

1723
02:07:49,606 --> 02:07:50,595
Hug me.

1724
02:07:54,678 --> 02:07:55,645
Did you find my guns?

1725
02:07:58,582 --> 02:08:00,106
You're very exciting Harleen.

1726
02:08:00,450 --> 02:08:02,475
Now take the guns out, and shoot!

1727
02:09:04,948 --> 02:09:05,846
Rajveer!

1728
02:09:06,416 --> 02:09:07,474
Enough! - Get up!

1729
02:09:07,551 --> 02:09:08,779
Rajveer. - Let's go.

1730
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:11,985
Shoaib died because of him.

1731
02:09:12,556 --> 02:09:15,024
He killed Hamid Gul and took the Kohinoor.

1732
02:09:15,125 --> 02:09:16,524
Here's the Kohinoor.

1733
02:09:17,961 --> 02:09:19,588
If you can get to me, then..

1734
02:09:20,063 --> 02:09:22,122
..you can get the real Kohinoor as well.

1735
02:09:22,866 --> 02:09:24,128
When you have the real Kohinoor..

1736
02:09:24,234 --> 02:09:26,725
..you can come and exchange it for her.

1737
02:09:33,076 --> 02:09:35,943
I am sure you will find me.. again.

1738
02:09:36,813 --> 02:09:37,939
Goodbye.

1739
02:09:38,448 --> 02:09:39,039
Come on!

1740
02:09:39,115 --> 02:09:40,309
Take this.
- Rajveer!

1741
02:09:42,552 --> 02:09:43,712
Rajveer!

1742
02:10:54,357 --> 02:10:55,189
Help!

1743
02:11:33,963 --> 02:11:34,759
Help!

1744
02:11:34,864 --> 02:11:35,990
Somebody.
- Hey!

1745
02:11:38,535 --> 02:11:41,095
The next bullet will hit your face,
if you're not quiet.

1746
02:12:14,904 --> 02:12:16,531
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

1747
02:12:37,827 --> 02:12:40,421
And listen, I want the Kohinoor at any cost.

1748
02:13:47,697 --> 02:13:48,664
Oh my God!

1749
02:13:48,731 --> 02:13:50,961
The plane has been hit!
- David, check what's happening.

1750
02:13:51,034 --> 02:13:52,592
We have to land the plane!

1751
02:15:03,139 --> 02:15:04,367
Rajveer!

1752
02:15:05,341 --> 02:15:06,535
Rajveer!

1753
02:15:07,844 --> 02:15:09,141
Rajveer!

1754
02:17:39,028 --> 02:17:40,120
Well done.

1755
02:17:40,897 --> 02:17:41,955
Thankyou Sir.

1756
02:17:43,766 --> 02:17:46,132
Your parents have led a strange life.

1757
02:17:47,503 --> 02:17:50,529
One son sacrificed his life for his country..

1758
02:17:51,774 --> 02:17:54,902
..and the other is dead for them,
even though he's alive.

1759
02:17:58,581 --> 02:18:00,412
Harleen has been sent home.

1760
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:03,218
And she has been instructed..

1761
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:05,947
..not to see you again.

1762
02:18:07,523 --> 02:18:11,323
You know.. that Jai is 'dead'
for the sake of this mission.

1763
02:18:11,661 --> 02:18:13,424
Now you are Rajveer.

1764
02:18:15,198 --> 02:18:17,428
By joining the Internal Secret Services..

1765
02:18:17,533 --> 02:18:19,865
..you signed over your life to us.

1766
02:18:20,937 --> 02:18:23,405
Harleen can prove to be a threat for you.

1767
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,208
She could be your weakness.

1768
02:18:27,877 --> 02:18:31,335
Anyway, you'll be transported
to a safe place tomorrow.

1769
02:18:39,622 --> 02:18:41,852
Till then, get some rest.

1770
02:19:06,082 --> 02:19:07,276
What did I just have?

1771
02:19:13,322 --> 02:19:14,448
Harleen?!

1772
02:19:36,379 --> 02:19:38,108
Stop! Stop the car!

1773
02:19:38,632 --> 02:19:39,632
...Hey!

1774
02:19:41,717 --> 02:19:44,709
Don't worry Rajveer. We're safe.

1775
02:19:51,894 --> 02:19:53,156
Good morning!

1776
02:20:16,185 --> 02:20:17,516
Where are we?

1777
02:20:19,422 --> 02:20:21,652
Who changed my clothes?

1778
02:20:23,159 --> 02:20:25,650
You ask too many questions.

1779
02:20:26,562 --> 02:20:27,586
I did.

1780
02:20:28,097 --> 02:20:31,658
And if I remember correctly, my eyes were closed.

1781
02:20:33,669 --> 02:20:34,761
Maybe.

1782
02:20:39,308 --> 02:20:40,468
What day is it today?

1783
02:20:42,778 --> 02:20:43,870
One day.

1784
02:21:33,629 --> 02:21:35,096
Jai!
Viren!

1785
02:21:35,164 --> 02:21:36,927
Come on, dinner is ready.

1786
02:21:37,466 --> 02:21:39,730
Jai, mom's calling us!

1787
02:21:40,169 --> 02:21:42,069
Viren! I am coming.

1788
02:22:32,188 --> 02:22:33,246
Jai.

1789
02:23:43,459 --> 02:23:44,949
So, what now?

1790
02:23:45,261 --> 02:23:46,819
There's just one thing left to do.

1791
02:23:46,929 --> 02:23:47,896
What?

1792
02:23:48,064 --> 02:23:48,928
Bang-Bang!

1793
02:24:11,587 --> 02:24:16,957
Our nights have taken some decisions.

1794
02:24:17,726 --> 02:24:20,752
And as we have met now..

1795
02:24:21,664 --> 02:24:26,328
..some magic is about to happen.

1796
02:24:27,002 --> 02:24:32,167
Talks have happened between our eyes.

1797
02:24:33,242 --> 02:24:36,075
And as we have met now..

1798
02:24:36,979 --> 02:24:39,846
..some magic is about to happen.

1799
02:24:40,349 --> 02:24:44,149
Whatever is about to happen will happen.

1800
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:47,587
Something surely happens
when you meet someone.

1801
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:52,151
This is surely about to happen.
I've felt this after meeting you.

1802
02:24:52,228 --> 02:24:53,923
Are you feeling it tonight?

1803
02:24:54,029 --> 02:24:55,656
I'm feeling it tonight.

1804
02:24:55,731 --> 02:24:58,529
Bang Bang. Talk to me the whole night.

1805
02:24:58,601 --> 02:25:00,262
Come and walk with me.

1806
02:25:00,336 --> 02:25:03,328
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1807
02:25:03,405 --> 02:25:06,203
Bang Bang. Talk to me the whole night.

1808
02:25:06,275 --> 02:25:07,936
Come and walk with me.

1809
02:25:08,177 --> 02:25:11,078
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1810
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:16,345
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang.

1811
02:25:17,353 --> 02:25:18,786
I don't know why.

1812
02:25:18,888 --> 02:25:23,985
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang.

1813
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,550
I don't know why.

1814
02:25:26,629 --> 02:25:27,994
Bang Bang.

1815
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:36,594
Nowadays while roaming here and there..

1816
02:25:36,972 --> 02:25:38,530
..the eyes talk.

1817
02:25:38,941 --> 02:25:42,138
Today I'll get beguiled in the talks of the eyes.

1818
02:25:42,211 --> 02:25:43,803
Just do one thing..

1819
02:25:44,046 --> 02:25:45,877
..embrace me in your arms.

1820
02:25:45,948 --> 02:25:51,215
And all night long, this story of ours
will continue.

1821
02:25:51,487 --> 02:25:53,751
Yours and mine..
- Yours and mine..

1822
02:25:53,856 --> 02:25:56,620
The signs that our sights are giving.

1823
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:00,558
Let's understand all of them.

1824
02:26:01,397 --> 02:26:04,264
As I'm about to lose my consciousness.

1825
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:08,768
Whatever is about to happen will happen.

1826
02:26:08,871 --> 02:26:12,534
Something surely happens when you meet someone.

1827
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:16,737
This is surely about to happen.
I've felt this after meeting you.

1828
02:26:16,812 --> 02:26:18,370
Are you feeling it tonight?

1829
02:26:18,681 --> 02:26:20,308
I'm feeling it tonight.

1830
02:26:20,382 --> 02:26:23,078
Bang Bang.
Talk to me the whole night.

1831
02:26:23,152 --> 02:26:24,949
Come and walk with me.

1832
02:26:25,054 --> 02:26:28,023
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1833
02:26:28,090 --> 02:26:30,786
Bang Bang.
Talk to me the whole night.

1834
02:26:30,893 --> 02:26:32,690
Come and walk with me.

1835
02:26:32,795 --> 02:26:35,992
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1836
02:26:36,565 --> 02:26:41,400
Talk to me...  (Bang Bang)
...the whole night.

1837
02:26:42,037 --> 02:26:43,334
I don't know why.

1838
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:44,701
Bang Bang.

1839
02:26:45,808 --> 02:26:47,173
I don't know why.

1840
02:26:47,243 --> 02:26:52,579
Bang Bang... Bang Bang... Bang Bang.

1841
02:26:53,482 --> 02:26:55,450
I don't know why.

1842
02:27:05,027 --> 02:27:08,360
Bang Bang, take a little chance chance.

1843
02:27:08,464 --> 02:27:12,195
Do a little dance dance.
Now get your body moving.

1844
02:27:12,268 --> 02:27:14,964
Bang Bang.
Talk to me the whole night.

1845
02:27:15,070 --> 02:27:16,867
Come and walk with me.

1846
02:27:16,972 --> 02:27:19,839
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1847
02:27:19,942 --> 02:27:22,672
Bang Bang.
Talk to me the whole night.

1848
02:27:22,745 --> 02:27:24,576
Come and walk with me.

1849
02:27:24,647 --> 02:27:27,480
A spell has been cast on my heart,
I don't know why.

1850
02:27:27,583 --> 02:27:29,050
Bang-Bang!
