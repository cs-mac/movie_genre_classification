I mean, we might use Janet down the line.

All right. No Janet. Happy?

I just think the audience'll love
that Rachel has to get a job!

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,719
Jack, I thought we already discussed
this whole thing about Rachel.

Oh, no! Rachel stays in the show.

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,672
Listen, boychik, Laura's contract
is coming up. Do you have any idea

152
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,190
how much money those mamzers
at the William Morris office are asking?

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,471
She's worth it! Rachel works great
and so does my new bible!

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,229
Jack, if you'll excuse me,
part of your new bible works great.

155
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,115
We both love this Jack Gates character,
this Wolf of Wall Street. It's brilliant.

156
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,074
Great character, great.
But forget Rachel! She's out!

157
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,031
We got a good idea. Rachel is horseback
riding with Paul. The horse throws her.

158
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,674
Goodbye, Laura.
Goodbye, Morris Agency.

159
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,998
- No. Forget it. No.
- Or... or... we can give her a brain tumour.

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,829
Wonderful, a brain tumour! What's that,
the third brain tumour this season?

161
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,599
- So what?!
- Jack, it's a long season.

162
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,756
Oh, I don't believe this!

163
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,998
Come on! This sounds like the kinda crap
Arnie Fetterman would come up with!

164
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,749
You're bringin' in Arnie Fetterman,
aren't you? He's gonna rewrite me.

165
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,632
Absolutely not.

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,389
Are we gonna bring in hamburger
when we already have steak on the table?

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,751
You'll kill the show! You don't know
what the hell you're doing!

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,111
How dare you talk to us like that?
Do you hear the mouth he's opening?!

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,751
I'm sorry. I don't like fighting and arguing.
I just feel very strongly about this.

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,793
Who cares how you feel?!
This is a television show.

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,193
Arlene, he's talking feelings.
We have to listen.

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,678
I'll tell you what. You think about Rachel
and we'll think about Rachel. Is that fair?

173
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,031
- I guess.
- So what's with the long face?

174
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,310
We'll work things out.

175
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,916
There's a lot of love in this room, Jack.

176
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,237
We love you. And... we hope you love us.

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,550
- Of course I love you. It's just I still...
- We'll talk Monday.

178
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,309
- What about me? Don't you love me?
- I included you in that love.

179
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,829
- He meant you.
- I meant you.

180
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,438
Schmuck.

181
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,637
Ceil, get me Arnie Fetterman.

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,951
Yeah. Yeah, Arlene, I told you,
I'll work the Janet character into the story.

183
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,675
I'm getting rid of Rachel with
the horseback riding, even as we speak.

184
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,756
Now will ya stop nudging?

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,753
Quiet, everybody! Roll cameras.

186
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,075
<i>Billionaire patriarch Carter Hedison,</i>

<i>having recently recovered from</i>
<i>a brain tumour, battles death once again</i>

188
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,072

<i>Will she marry Dr Paul Kirkwood,</i>

190

193

Well, Paul? How's he doing?

194
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,990
These heart-lung-liver transplants are
almost routine. He'll be as good as new.

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,517
That you, Blake? Come over here, son.

- Dad.

Now, you do what Nurse Caldwell
tells you to, Daddy. I'll stop by later.

199
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,273
Blake, I'm so glad you're here.

- You look good, Dad.
- <i>(groans)</i>

202
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,112
I don't want Blake
to see my father any more.

203
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,798
What?!

204
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,429
If anything happens to the old fool, do you
want Blake taking over the company?

205
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,999
You're playing a dangerous game, Rachel.

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,949
They're the only kind worth playing.

207
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,752
- Cut it! Very nice.
- Was that big enough? I can give more.

208
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,952
- No, no, Dennis, that was fine. Thank you.
- Cos I got more!

209
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,390
- Am I good in this?
- Really, really good.

210
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,557
- Feels perfect. I feel very strong.
- No, it was perfect.

211
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,592
- It's strong. It's strong.
- It's not in the lines.

212
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,474
- You've gotta play the moment. That's it.
- You had some wonderful moments.

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,759
- I thought it was over between them.
- I think he just got his key back.

214
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,353
- Good scene. Really. Great scene.
- Oh, you think so?

215
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,393
- Oh, yeah. Do you have a minute, Laura?
- For you, always.

216
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,957
Thanks. I was wondering if you read the
new bible. With the Jack Gates character.

217
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,559
- Oh, yes. I love it.
- Really?

218
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,591
- It's very good.
- Great!

219
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,154
It works beautifully for the rest of the cast.

220
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,555
Oh, thanks. The rest of the cast?

221
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,999
To be honest, I don't think the audience
will accept Rachel as a working girl.

222
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,069
You said you wanted to do something
with more depth. It'd be good for you.

223
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,075
I hope you're not upset.

224
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,270
You're so... open.

225

Oh, come on!

227
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,988
And I can't thank you enough
for the refrigerator.

228
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,429
No problem. Are you kidding?

229
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,755
Jesus H Christ, Laura!

230
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,032
I thought you meant
one of those little office ones.

231
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,516
Is something wrong?
If it's gonna cause a problem...

232
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,754
No! No problem at all!

233
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,069
It's OK. It's a beauty.

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,038
I gotta get outta here.
Traffic's gonna be awful.

237

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,636
I found this Nat King Cole
on a farm in Pennsylvania.

- <i>(whispers)</i> Laura.

I can't. I just can't.

They're having an auction on old records.
You know my Nat King Cole collection.

250
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,277

- Oh, no!
- You better get 20 milligrams of Valium.

301
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,838
- Not on this show!
- Take it easy.

302
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,435
Please, not this show!

303
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,469
<i>(Whispers)</i> You said
we'd go to the mountains.

304
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,910
I'm sorry, Helen.
I've got to see Carter Hedison.

305
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,234
Carter?

306
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,275
Or Rachel Hedison?

307
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,597
Agh! I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm fine. I'm fine.

308
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,032
I'm OK. I'm, um...
just nervous in hospitals, that's all.

309
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,879
I'm in Ashford Falls.
I had a car wreck last night.

310
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,958
You're Dr Kirkwood.
And I panicked a little.

311
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,756
- Follow my finger.
- Sure. See? I've never felt better.

312
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,759
- Will you be quiet?
- OK, Doctor. Anything you say, Doctor.

313
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,030
- Doctor(!)
- All right, get your clothes on.

314
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,390
I wanna see you in my office
tomorrow morning.

315
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,195
No problem. I'll be in your dressing
room... your office at nine o'clock.

316
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,073
You better make it 10.30.
I'm in surgery all morning.

317
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,316
Oh, sure. No problem. Bye-bye!

318
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,277
Bye-bye!

319
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,595
Thank you both!

320
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,998
He's operating on people?!
He's an actor! He's not even a good one!

321
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,868
- I'm telling you, I can walk!
- And I'm telling you, hospital regulations.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,959
- You can walk when you're outside.
- Oh, this is ridiculous!

323
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,835
I'm gonna get your discharge papers.
Just stay put! Boy, what a pain!

324
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,196
Are you ready for this?

325
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,472
Dr Kirkwood is just stringing you along!
He's gonna dump you and marry Rachel!

326
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,352
Ha! Hm.

327
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,589
Lee, you think you got a small part now,
how would you like a brain tumour?

328
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,718
OK, we're outside. Can I stand up now?

329
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,909
I had your things taken to the hotel.

330
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,431
But I didn't use your real name,
just like you said in the letter. God!

331
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,235
- This is kind of exciting.
- Letter? What letter?

332
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,958
I used the name
that you gave at the hospital.

333
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,230
You know: Jack Gable.

334
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,635
That is my name!

335
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,958
We met at the office.
Don't you recognise me? I ran into you.

336
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,230
I crushed your hand.

337
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,118
I've never been to your office, Mr Gates.

338
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,357
Gates? You think I'm Jack Gates?

339
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,268
Oh, come on, let's get in the car.

340
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,029
Gosh, I am so excited.
You're buying my father's formula.

341
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,074
Daddy!

342
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,918
Daddy!

343
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,349
He's in the study, sir.

344
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,313
- Which one?
- The one to your right, sir.

345
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,031
What do you think, Blake? If we lose
the daycare centre and the playground,

346
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,675
we can park much closer to our office.

347
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,631
Great, Dad.

348
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,874
Daddy! I found out who Janet Dubois
is selling her father's formula to!

349
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
It's Jack Gates!

350
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,790
The Wolf of Wall Street?

351
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,072
I've been following Janet. She checked
this guy calling himself Jack Gable

352
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,509
- into the hotel...
- Get to the point, Ty.

353
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,590
Well... I saw his bags, Daddy.
They had the initials JG. JG, Jack Gates.

354
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,029
So they have the same initials.

355
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,039
Yeah, the same initials, and they're both
from New York, and he was with Janet.

356
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,831
That doesn't make him Gates.
Forget it, Ty.

357
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,396
We don't even know if Fletcher Dubois
came up with that formula.

358
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,750
But... what if he did, Dad?

359
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,032
It'd be just like Jack Gates
to buy it out from under us.

360
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,756
I think you're on to something, Blake.
Check into it right away.

361
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,159
I-I-I'm checking into it! I mean, why
does it always have to be Blake, Daddy?

362
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,716
- It was my idea in the first place!
- Lighten up, Ty.

363
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,516
You're just like your mother.
Too thin-skinned.

364
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,757
I suppose that's why
she committed suicide.

365
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,276
If it <i>was</i> suicide.

366
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,834
For the very last time,

367
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,839
I did not hire Dash Andrews
to kill your mother.

368
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,279
<i>(Blake whimpers)</i>

369
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,834
If she <i>was</i> my mother!

370
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,670
- Another one of those headaches, son?
- <i>(whimpers)</i> Uh-huh.

371
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,233
Awww.

372
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,750
I don't care what you think.
I am not Jack Gates!

373
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,155
And you are not Janet Dubois!

374
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,192
You can't be!
You're an offstage character!

375
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,880
- A what?
- We talked about bringing you into it,

376
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,993
but frankly, you weren't that interesting.
You're not even supposed to be here.

377
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,157
But I <i>am</i> here.
I came back to visit my father.

378
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,955
Ah, yes, your father. Fletcher Dubois,
the brilliant but unstable chemist

379
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,436
- who is developing a formula...
<i>- Is</i> developing a formula?

380
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,028
Mr Gates, my father died four weeks ago.

381
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,995
Oh, yeah. We had to get rid of him.
Because he couldn't remember his lines!

382
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,389
It's the Sherwoods! They did hire
Fetterman. They're messin' with my bible.

383
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,877
What bible? What are you talking about?
You agreed to buy my father's formula!

384
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,955
Oh, what's the use? I know you may
find this hard to believe, but I'm a writer.

385
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,313
Now, I know this may sound crazy...

386
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,195
but I created this whole town!

387
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,509
- I see. You created this whole town.
- Yes! Yes!

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,434
I'm getting out of here. Where's my car?

389
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,835
It's at Len's Garage.
It needed a new radiator.

390
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,317
Len? There is no Len.
We haven't used Len in two years!

391
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,035
What is happening to me?

392
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,038
Hey!

393
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,153
- Oh, God!
- What are you doing?!

394
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,630
This isn't a dream. I'm not dreaming. Ow!

395
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,355
Why are you playing these games
with me, Mr Gates?

396
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,553
For the last time, lady, I'm not Gates!

397
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,515
I'm a writer! Do you hear me? All I wanna
do is get outta this stinkin' little town!

398
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,033
Well, then, do it! I mean, you say
you're a writer. Then write your way out!

399
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,792
Operator? Yes, could you get me-this
ought to be rich - Len's Garage, please?

400
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,676
What a mistake Len was.
Boy, did we get letters.

401
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,716
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

402
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,436
Len here.

403
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,876
- Len?
- Like I told Janet, it needs a new radiator.

404
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,515
<i>It'll be a few days.</i>

405
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,359
Hey, mister, I can't work miracles.

406
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,558
Mm.

407
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,550
"Write your way out."

408
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,758
This is insane. Absolutely insane.

409
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,270
"Write your way out."

410
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,356
Fade... in.

411
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,759
Interior, Len's Garage. Day.

412
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,708
Len finds a new radiator

413
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,400
for Mr Gable's car.

414
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,509
Len calls Mr Gable

415
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,677
to let him know it is fixed.

416
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,756
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

Len? What?

419
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,833
You found a new radiator for my car?

420

You did wha...? You did? You found it?

Len, no! No, Len!
I'm not laughing at you! No!

No. Thank you!
I'm thanking you! Yes!

What the hell happened?

00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,878
I don't wanna know.
I just don't wanna know.

426
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,829
I gotta get outta here.

Is this man bothering you, Miss Hedison?

Men never bother me, Marco.

Pick me up in... half an hour,
I have to be at the Hunt Club.

I'm going riding with Dr Kirkwood.

Wait!

438
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,153
What's the rush? Where am I running?

No. No, it's out of the question.
I won't even discuss it.

442
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,715
But you're his doctor. Surely you
could increase Blake's medication.

443
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,594
It's an experimental drug.
It could have terrible side effects.

I'm sure Blake would try anything
to get rid of those migraines.

But even if Blake were out of the way,

446
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,469
your father will never leave
the company to you. What about Ty?

- I can always handle Ty.
- Rachel, I'm a medical doctor!

448
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,155
I can't do it!

449
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,515
You don't need your father's company.
We have each other.

Let's get married as we planned.

00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,598
I'm sorry, Paul, but I don't think
I'm ready for marriage yet.

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,629
All right. All right.
I'll increase Blake's medication.

453
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,796
Come on. I'll race you
to Winchester Cathedral.

454
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,198
Yeah.

455
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,956
Should be slow.

456
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,438
I'll make Rachel beg for me.

457
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,233
Let her suffer a little.

458
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,717
Let's see. She's going horseback riding
this afternoon, so I'II...

459
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,316
Horseback riding.

460
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,639
Horseback riding. Oh, my God. Fetterman
and the Sherwoods, they're gonna kill her!

461
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,678
And so no money had changed hands and
the cow was returned to its rightful owner.

462
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,470
That was told to me by a, uh...

- Bend over a little.
- Wait. Is it gonna hurt?

495
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,033
- It might hurt.
- No, forget it. Just leave it in. OK, OK, OK.

- Oh, it's beautiful. It really is.

499
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,829
So, Janet... just out of curiosity, uh...

500
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,474
tell me more about
your character-yourself.

501
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,196
There's not that much to tell. I got my PhD
at Ashford Falls Christian Normal.

502
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,834
- Good school.
- Then I went to Africa.

503
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,032
Africa? Where did that come from?

504
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,597
For the last two years
I've lived there with a colony of ants.

505
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,269
- You lived with ants?
- I do research. I chart everything they do.

506
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,597
Social organisation,
their movement, their mating habits.

507
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,757
Oh, I see. Like one of those
National Geographic specials.

508
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,668
No, I'll never be on one of those.
My friend Manu says I'm not big enough.

509
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,590
I don't have gorillas like Dian Fossey or
Jane Goodall with her precious chimps.

510
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,280
- Right.
- See, no one cares about ants,

511
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,678
but once you live with them, you see
their specialness, their individuality.

512
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,156
It's as though each one
has a personality all their own.

513
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,838
Really?

514
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,668
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

515
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,356
Rachel, Rachel.

516
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,109
You know we don't discuss
financial matters at the dinner table.

517
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,629
Father, I have the right
to know what's going on.

518
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,548
I will not be shut out of the business
by you or anyone else.

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,956
Yes, Ty?

520
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,638
When are you going to stop
this madness with Rachel?

521
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,991
- Nothing happened at the Mardi Gras.
- She's your sister!

522
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,192
All right, Rachel.
We are working on something.

523
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,993
How would you like to eat
whatever you want,

524
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,554
then take a pill
that speeds up your metabolism,

525
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,877
burning off all the sugar and fat?

526
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,754
We have a pill like that?

527
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,875
My God, I'll make a fortune!

528
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,549
Or lose everything
if someone beats us to the market.

529
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,995
It's possible that Fletcher Dubois
figured out the Meta Pill ahead of us.

530
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,997
That's what Jack Gates is after.

531
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,033
But I don't understand why he wants to
get his hand up your dress. I mean...

532
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,310
We all know what you meant, Ty.

533
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,034
Watch it, Blake, or I'll give you
a headache you won't forget.

534
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,948
- You lay one finger on him, Ty...
- Always protecting Blake, Daddy!

535
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,833
Sometimes I wish I wasn't your son.

- Oh, much better.

Paul doubled my dosage.
It seems to be working.

539

That's not the drug
we're still testing, is it?

540
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,429
- Mm-hm.
- Paul feels it's completely safe, Father.

541
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,191
Leave it all to me, Dad.

542
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,518

Fletcher Dubois got with his formula.

603
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,598
She was homecoming queen
all four years.

604
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,153
I remember once she wore
this beautiful white lace dress

605
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,430
and this gorgeous crown.

606
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,437
When she came down that stairway,
it was...

607
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,118
It was as if she were floating.

608
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,120
I wanted to be Rachel that night.

609
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,319
- When did this place open?
- Oh, a couple of hours ago.

610
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,518
And I hear they serve
a very good pastrami.

611
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,193
Pick-up!

612
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,029
Pastrami on a kaiser and, uh...

613
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,398
Lox and cream cheese
on cinnamon toast? Get it outta here!

614
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,235
Yeah, you're right.
It gets really Ionely out there.

615
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,558
Sometimes Manu and I are alone
in the bush for months at a time.

616
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,113
Thank you.

617
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,278
So are you tellin' me
you never met anyone out there?

618
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,870
I did get involved with a Frenchman.
He said he was an environmentalist.

619
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,798
- Turns out he wasn't.
- What was he?

620
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,036
- A poacher. They hung him.
- Ugh!

621
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,272
God, I always choose the wrong guys.

622
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,437
Not me. I always choose the right women.

623
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,949
I just can't get 'em
to go out with me, that's all.

624
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,038
But you're Jack Gates.
You can have anyone you want.

625
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,199
Of course! I meant before
I became ruthless and powerful.

626
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,232
So... maybe you'd like to come over
sometime. I'm really a pretty good cook.

627
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,475
- You don't wanna come.
- I didn't say that.

628
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,151
I understand. You're a busy person.
You've got hostile takeovers to take over.

629
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,113
- I understand.
- Do you want me to come over or not?

630
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,595
- Yes, definitely.
- I'd love to.

631
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,314
I guess this is why I live with ants.

632
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,153
Lox, cream cheese, on cinnamon toast?

633
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,594
- And you're actually eating that?
- Yeah.

634
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,278
Amazing.

635
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,792
<i>(Auctioneer)</i> The next item up
is this lovely Amish quilt.

636

such exquisite workmanship.

reach our goal.

Rachel, I'm not buying
any more of this crap.

641

Ooh!

642
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,592
I've been getting these hot flashes. Do you
think I should cut back on the medicine?

643
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,358
Hm.

644
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,153
Ooh, those gums don't look tiptop either.

Ah! Good. Good.

649
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,832
- You see? I told you it was Jack Gates.
- Be quiet.

650
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,669
- You were right, Blake.
- What do you mean, he was right?

651
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,758
It was me, Daddy! Me! I'm the one!

652
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,353
I'm just a visitor to Ashford Falls,
but I believe in a good cause.

653
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,598
Therefore I'm donating
my Ferrari to your auction.

654
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,199
- He certainly has style.
- Yeah. If you like a showboat.

655

very generous donation of this classic.

- The cable TV man is coming.
- But the stockholders' meeting.

You know how hard it is

it could've been flowers.

756
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,950
Or maybe he's just late.

757
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,149
- Yes?
- Where were you?

758
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,238
What?

759
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,034
You were supposed to meet me.

760
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,993
I'm Jack... Gates.

761
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,034
Next time I'll write myself
an automatic transmission.

762
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,272
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

763
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,356
<i>(Bells chime)</i>

764
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,754
Janet! What are you doing here?

765
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,232
Look, about the dinner. I can explain. I...

766
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,070
- Are you really Jack Gates?
- Of course I'm Jack Gates! Hey!

767
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,636
That's funny.

768
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,117
All my life... I've been Jack Gates.

769
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,276
Robert Wagner!

770
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,789
What are you doing in this part?
You don't do daytime TV!

771
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,038
Of course! The Sherwoods hired
Robert Wagner! It's Sweeps Week!

772
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,634
Robert Wagner! Wow!

773
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,159
This nebbish has been masquerading
as me, and you believed him?

774
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,239
I should have known.
I mean, gosh, the way he parked the car!

775
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,596
- This belongs to you, Mr Gates.
- Thank you, my dear.

776
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,357
Look out!

777
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,950
They're tryin' to kill me!
Goddamn you, Fetterman!

778
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,636
Oh, my God!

779
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,396
It's real blood.

780
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,720
He's dead! It can't be!

781
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,876
He's Robert Wagner!

782
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,831
I can't let him die.

783
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,952
I gotta bring him back.
I gotta bring him back.

784
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,035
Don't worry, Mr Wagner,
everything's gonna be fine.

785
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,035
He even looks good dead.

786
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,594
Jack's... hotel room.

787
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,716
This has gotta work.

788
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,440
I did it! It worked!

789
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,632
I brought him back! How're you feelin'?

790
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,716
A little dizzy.

791
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,470
- I don't understand what happened.
- You don't have to. Goodbye, Mr Gates.

792
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,036
"Goodbye... Mr Gates," he said.

793
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,872
- Get me a cab! I've gotta go to the airport.
- But you just checked in.

794
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,958
I don't care! I gotta go to...

795
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,878
Cleveland.

796
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,153
Jesus! I hate Cleveland!

797
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,234
You don't belong in Ashford Falls.

798
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,037
You're really a sweet kid.
You'll be a lot happier back in Africa.

799
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,998
Exterior.

800
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,676
Jungle clearing.

801
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,078
Night.

802
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,677
No. Must be day over there.

803
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,838
Goodbye, Janet. Have fun with your ants.

804
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,756
He's supposed to be
this ruthless tycoon, but...

805
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,759
- he seemed like a really nice guy to me.
- Sounds like the poacher again.

806
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,350
You should've seen the way
he rode a horse. Oh, it was so cute!

807
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,229
Oh, by the way, I nearly forgot.
This telegram came for you this morning.

808
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,954
A telegram for me? Wow!

809
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,115
Do you think it's from Jack?
Oh, I bet it's from Jack!

810
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,308
It's from Carter Hedison.
"A matter of life and death."

811
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,159
You can't just toss me aside, Paul.
Don't you see? Rachel's just using you.

812
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,795
She uses men the way
other women use... cotton balls!

813
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,115
- It's over, Helen.
- Paul!

814
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,198
Paul!

815
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,875
You've won again, Rachel.

816
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,315
But for the last time.

817
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:44,190
Paul, you're being childish.
Jack Gates doesn't mean anything to me.

818
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,474
- I wish you'd trust me.
- I do. It's just...

819
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,435
Then prove it.

820
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,115
Let's play a little game.

821
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,436
Please, miss...

827
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,394
I almost killed the woman I love!

828
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,476
It's all my fault!

829
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,354
No, it isn't. No, it isn't!

830

I can only control what <i>I</i> write, right?

01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,798
Right!

832
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,956
No, it's my fault.

I didn't write that. Who wrote that?

835
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,799
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm glad I caught you in.

836
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,114
Oh!

837
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,310
Hi! Argh!

838
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,996
My father's throwing a party
this weekend and he wants you to come.

839
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,033
- Oh, I'd be delighted.
- Jack, I can't talk long.

840
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,870
Your life is in danger. My father
will stop at nothing to get the formula.

841
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,636
Bring it to me.
It's the last place my father will look.

842
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,190
You really care for me, don't you?

843
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,757
Of course I do. That's why
I didn't want you to come to the party.

844
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,155
Huh?

845
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,716
My father's announcing
my engagement to Paul.

846
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,798
Oh, why did you have to
come into my life now?

847
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,160
Goodbye... my darling.

848
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,276
"My darling."

849
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,037
- He'll be there.
- What about the formula?

850
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,594
- He'll have it.
- Yes, but... will we?

851
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,038
Good point, Blake.
Is there something going on, Rachel?

852
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,277
It's never taken you this long
to get what you want from a man.

853
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,590
I don't know what it is.

854
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,713
When I'm with him, it's as if...
I don't have a mind of my own.

855
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,515
He has this... strange power over me.

856
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,158
Exterior.

857
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,837
Hedison...

mouse.

859
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,068
Not mouse. House!

860
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,156
Watch the typos.

861
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,753
I'm gonna be incredible this weekend.

862
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:43,989
This time it's comin' straight
from the heart. No blindfolds.

863
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,758
No trickery.

864
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,713
No flashy stunts. No.

865
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,195
I gotta be me!

866
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,236

- Is he gonna play all night?
- Shh!

868
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,714
- Oh! Miss Dubois!
- Hello, Edward.

870
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,871
Oh, yes. Do please go in.

871
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,595
Janet! What are you doing here?

872
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,598
What's going on, Ty?
Why does your father want to see me?

873
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,474
Golly, I've missed you. Remember the
time I was gonna ask you to the prom?

874
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,992
- And your father wouldn't let you.
- Uh, no. No, th-that's not true.

875
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,796
That was the time that I got...
I got, um...

876
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,672
- Amnesia, sir.
- Remember?

877
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,233
I thought you were announcing
our engagement.

878
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,511
- Why did you ask him to play the piano?
- I didn't.

879
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,235
I didn't ask him to sing
"Send In The Clowns", either.

880
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,916
Paul. Hi.

881
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,917
Excuse me, sir.

882
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,918
Miss Janet Dubois is in your study.

883
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,991
Oh, my God.

884
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,790
Water, no ice.

885
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,913
You were the first one
to drink a lot of water.

886
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,915
Now everybody's doing it.

887
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,593
So, Janet, while you're here,
maybe we could go horseback riding.

888
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,598
- I don't think so.
- Well, well, well!

889
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,673
Janet Dubois. How grown-up we are.

890
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,072
What's going on?
What's all this about life and death?

891
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,192
We can d... we can discuss it later.

892
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:54,155
Ty, show Janet to one of the guest rooms.
She can wear some of Rachel's clothes.

893
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,917
- You can have my room, Janet.
- You're not gonna be in it, are you?

894
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,516
I didn't send that wire.

895
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,835
But... if you didn't,

896
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,636
then who did?

897
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,996
Encore! Encore!

898
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,399
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You're wonderful. For me? Thank you!

899
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,874
- You brought tears to my eyes.
- I know.

900
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,639
Oh, Jack!

901
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,036
Jack! Jack!

902
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,791
Donna? Donna McKenzie, Lincoln High?

903
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,196
- Yeah!
- Oh, God, I couldn't have been that drunk.

904
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,074
- What else did I write last night?
- <i>(squeals)</i>

905
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,272
You were wonderful!

906
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,437
All those years,
your locker was right next to mine

907
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,393
- and I never even talked to you.
- I know.

908
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:05,469
How could I ever have been
in love with Greg Petula? Ugh! Barf!

909

Right.

975
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,870

- Just for a moment.
- Of all the people to give it to!

980
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,912

- It is what I think.

- I believed in you!

I'm sorry, Janet, but it's time it came out.

994
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,076
It's time Rachel learned that
she's not a high-and-mighty Hedison.

995
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,034
That she can't just take
what belongs to other people.

Dad, you're not gonna stop me this time.

with Janet, and that I always will be!

01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,916
Of course you're in love with her!
She's your sister!

01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,557
No, no, Marie.
Flats with that dress? Are you crazy?!

01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,556
I am... weak!

1007
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,719
I don't have Rachel.
I don't even have my self-respect.

1008
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,155
I have... nothing... to live... for!

Water!

Oh, my God! Look what I've done to you!

1013
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,354
Forgive me, Blake! Forgive me!

1014
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,437

01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,838
Rachel.

I'm going to New York with Jack Gates.

1021
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,679
I think there's something you should
know. This is going to come as a shock,

1022
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,155
but you are not a Hedison.

1023
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,479
- Janet is my real daughter.
- Oh, for Chrissakes, that is the corniest!

1024
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,237
It's Fetterman. He's goin' for
that baby-switching crap.

1025
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,670
This can't be true.

Oh, but it is.

1027
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,758
Little Miss Tummy Tuck.

1028
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,832
This house is mine now.
So pick up your bags and keep moving.

1029
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,070
- Bitch.
- Look, you little anteater...

1030
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:48,034
- Janet, what are they doing to you?
- By the way, our deal's off, Gates.

1031
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:52,035
The formula stays in the family
and I get... 80 per cent.

1032
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,514
She's a Hedison all right!

1033
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,995
Hold it. Hold it.

1034
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,635

into the story to replace Rachel!

1035
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,719
- Stay out of this, Jack.
- No! It's wrong! You're not like that!

1036
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,753
Fetterman's trying to change you
and I won't let him do it!

1037
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,190
Paul told me all about it, sister!

1038
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,553
Well, if I'm gonna die,

1039
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,035
I'm gonna shoot you first!

Oh, shit!

01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,869
Paul! Do something!
Janet's been shot! Edward, help him.

1044
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,389
I will call the paramedics.

- Can you stop the bleeding?
- Yes, stop the bleeding.

1047
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,114
She's ruining the parquet floor!

1048
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:54,358
You want bleeding? Huh? I'll show you
bleedin'. You want bleedin', huh?

1049
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,995
Is that what you want?
Cos I'll give you some bleedin'!

1050
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,076
Let me at her! Let me at her!

1051
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,830
Whoever you are...

1052
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,676
promise me...

1053
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,955
that you'll be there when I wake up.

1054
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,718
I promise.

1055
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,992
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

1056
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,868
She's not gonna take away what's mine.

1057
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,116
What's... ours.

1058
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,915
Just make sure Janet
doesn't survive that operation.

1059
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,078
But don't you see? If Janet is my sister,
then I still have a chance with Rachel!

1060

You're making a big mistake.

- She's not glitzy or glamorous.
- She won't be!

1132

She'll come in wholesome and innocent,
as a contrast to the evil Hedisons.

Well, we don't have to do it that way.
