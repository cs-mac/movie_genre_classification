- What do you want witnesses for?</i>

312
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:50,681
Hans, you know all about my life.
Why rake everything up again?

313
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:54,983
That's my profession. You accepted
to take part in this group analysis.

314
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:58,513
I know, I know. Somebody speaks
and the others listen.

315
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:01,390
But in the end, something
happens within one's self.

316
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:05,922
Something does.
First we were all afraid. Now we're not.

317
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,161
<i>And something else happens, Max.</i>

318
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:11,068
I play the devil's advocate
in all this, and to do so I...

319
00:44:11,138 --> 00:44:15,199
seek and I find
dangerous documentary evidence,

320
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:18,803
which I'll give to our colleague
so he can make a nice bonfire.

321
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:22,337
<i>I also have a nice list
of witnesses I keep an eye on.</i>

322
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:24,976
<i>And I keep a most
particular eye on them...</i>

323
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:28,419
because they're not as manageable
as a pile of papers.

324
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:31,185
Max, you must
have faith in Klaus.

325
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:33,385
Remember when we had
my trial here?

326
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,621
I felt as awful
as you feel now.

327
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:39,223
It did me good to speak,
to confess, to defend myself.

328
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,634
<i>It did me good to clash with Klaus
when he accused me pitilessly.</i>

329
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:47,071
<i>Remember?
When it was over, however,</i>

330
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:49,075
I felt a great relief.

331
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:53,239
Perhaps, also, because Klaus
burned some 30 documents concerning you.

332
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:55,373
Just as he burned yours, Kurt.

333
00:44:55,449 --> 00:45:00,182
Naturally. And now there's no trace of
us in any military archive. Right?

334
00:45:00,254 --> 00:45:02,518
It will be the same
for you, Max.

335
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,920
Klaus?

336
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:11,965
Klaus, perhaps there are
no living witnesses.

337
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:17,365
But if there are,
can't we leave them in peace?

338
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:19,372
Let them forget?

339
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:35,817
Even if it says 1,000 persons
on paper, 10,000,

340
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:41,658
it still makes less impression
than one witness in flesh and blood.

341
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:46,561
That is why they are
so dangerous, Max.

342
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:50,593
My task is to seek them out,
wherever they are,

343
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,730
and to see that they
are filed away.

344
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:04,784
Max, our trials
are held in private.

345

<i>They're also therapeutic, right?</i>

346
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:11,089
And the more shock value they have,
the more effect they have.

347
00:46:11,158 --> 00:46:14,093
<i>Only eyewitnesses can provoke this...</i>

348
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:18,029
because they go into details,
they blurt out everything.

349
00:46:18,098 --> 00:46:22,034
<i>You've seen it, haven't you? Only
confronted with their accusations...</i>

350
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:25,094
can we discover how far
we're able to defend ourselves.

351
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:30,173
<i>We have to defend ourselves.
The war is not over.</i>

the ranks we held.

354
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,515
