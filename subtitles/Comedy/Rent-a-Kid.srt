1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,900
"Have some milk."

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,100
And I lowered myself
beneath her swollen udder...

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
...and I sucked the sweetest milk
I had ever tasted.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
"Climb onboard," she said.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,700
And as a harvest moon
rose over Cyberland...

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
...we reared back,
we sprang into a gallop...

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
...leaping out of orbit.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I awoke, singing...

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,500
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,900
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,600
Only thing to do

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Only thing to do is jump

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,500
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,100
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,900
Over the moon

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,300
Over the...

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Moo with me.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes. Who is that? Come on.
Moo with me.

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,300
Yes. Come on, sir.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,100
Don't be shy. Let it go. Moo with me.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,600
Let it rip.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Yes. Let it go, New York City.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,100
Yeah.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey, get off, man.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Just calm down.
Take it easy now, all right?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Back off.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,700
Hey, hey, hey. Guys, it's okay.
It's okay. Just keep cool.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,300
Come on, move back.

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,400
- Take it easy, all right?
- This is supposed be a peace...

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
Officer, please.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,200
Look, just keep... Hey.
Please. Everyone, be calm.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Everyone, please.

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Stop it.

35
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,900
- Get off of me.
- Let go of him.

36
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,300
- Collins.
- Get off of her.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Get off of me.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,300
- Get off of me.
- Get off her.

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
- Let's get out of here. This way.
- Go, go, go.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
Everyone, be cool.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,000
Stop, this is peaceful.

42
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
Please.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Benny got exactly what he wanted.

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,400
He screws up my show,
he gets all these people arrested.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,500
Cops won't hold them for long.
They'll let them go in a few hours.

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,400
- Oh, there they are.
- You all right?

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
- Yes. Yes.
- Joanne?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
- Collins.
- Nice to meet you.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
- Angel.
- Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,700
- Oh, it's cold. Let's go inside, okay?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Hi, baby. Thank you.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait, where's Mark?

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't know, man. Let's wait for him
inside. Come on.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
Let's go.

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,100
- Hey.
- Hey. Are you all right?

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Tonight on the 11:00 news,
the lead story is gonna be your show.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,800
- How do you know that?
- They bought my footage of the riot.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
- They're gonna see the whole thing.
- Congratulations.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
- Thank you.
- Good work, Mark.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
- You serious?
- Yes.

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,000
How can I repay you?

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,500
Let the boy buy us dinner.

64
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,800
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
Please, no. No, not tonight.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,300
- Please leave.
- What? Why?

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,900
You sit here all night,
and you never order anything.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,700
That's a lie. Last week I had a tea.

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,400
You couldn't pay.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,300
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,200
Tonight we can. Come on.

72
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Fine. Just please
don't move the tables.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
Let's put these tables together.

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,000
- Slide this way. Put these together.
- No. No, no, no.

75
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,700
Hey, Doodles.

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Well, if you get back to me,
let's say by early next week...

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,700
...we can break ground,
I'm thinking, mid-January.

78
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,500
Benjamin Coffin III.

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,200
The enemy of Avenue A.

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
You got a whole lot of nerve
showing your face here...

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,900
...after what just happened.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,100
Listen, guys, this was not my fault.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,500
- Go to hell.
- Jerk.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,900
You put the cops on standby.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,900
- I didn't want it to get out of control.
- Why did Muffy...

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,300
Allison.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
- miss the show?

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
There...
There was a death in the family.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,100
Who died?

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,100
Our Akita.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
- Evita.
- Evita.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
You make fun

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Or do you really want
A neighborhood

95
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,500
Where people piss
On your stoop every night?

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,400
Bohemia
Bohemia's a fallacy in your head

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
This is Calcutta

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,700
Bohemia is dead

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
Dearly beloved

100
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:00,900
We gather here
To say our goodbyes

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,500
Here she lies

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,100
No one knew her worth

103
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,800
The late, great daughter
Of Mother Earth

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,700
On these nights
When we celebrate the birth

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,400
In that little town of Bethlehem

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,500
We raise our glass
You bet your ass

107
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,100
To

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,200

- La vie bohème
- To days of inspiration

114
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Playin' hooky
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
The need to express
To communicate

116
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,000
To going against the grain
Going insane

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,100
- La vie bohème
- Going mad

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
- La vie bohème
- To loving tension

119
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,600
No pension
To more than one dimension

120
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,400
To starving for attention,
Hating convention, hating pretension

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,500
Not to mention, of course
Hating dear old Mom and Dad

122
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,500
To riding your bike midday
Past the three-piece suits

123
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
To fruits
To no absolutes

124
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,300
To Absolut
To choice

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,100
To the Village Voice

126
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
To any passing fad

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,700
To being an us for once
Instead of a them

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,000
La vie bohème

129
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
La vie bohème

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,500
Hey, mister.

131
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,800
She's my sister.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
So that's five miso soup
Four seaweed salad

133
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
Three soy-burger dinner
Two tofu-dog platter

134
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,500
And one pasta with meatless balls

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
It tastes the same

136
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
If you close your eyes

137
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,700
- And 13 orders of fries, is that it here?
- Wine and beer

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000

Compassion

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,300
To passion when it's new

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,300

150
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,900

- To Uta
- To Buddha

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Pablo Neruda too

156
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,800
Why Dorothy and Toto
Went over the rainbow

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
To blow off Auntie Em

La vie bohème

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,500
- Sisters?

160
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Brothers

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
To empathy
Ecstasy

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Never playin' the fame game

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,100
- To marijuana
- To sodomy

172
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
It's between God and me

173
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,500
To S & M

174

- La vie bohème

175
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,700
In honor of the death of bohemia...

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,100
...an impromptu salon will commence
immediately following dinner.

Maureen Johnson,
back from her spectacular...

178
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
...one-night engagement
at the 11th Street lot...

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
...will perform tribal chants
backwards...

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
...through her vocoder, accompanying
herself on the electric cello.

181
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
Which she ain't never studied.

182
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,600
And Mark Cohen will preview
his new documentary...

183
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,600
...about his inability to hold an erection
on the High Holy Days.

184
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,300
And Mimi Marquez,
clad only in bubblewrap...

185

...will perform her famous
lawn-chair handcuff dance...

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,100
...to the sounds of iced tea
being stirred.

187
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,700
And Roger will attempt to write
a bittersweet, evocative song...

188
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
...that doesn't remind us
of "Musetta's Waltz."

189
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Angel Dumott Schunard will model
the latest fall fashions from Paris...

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,600
And Collins will recount
his exploits as anarchist...

192
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
...including his successful
reprogramming...

193
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,000
...of the MIT retro-reality
equipment to self-destruct...

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
...as it broadcasts the words:

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Actual reality. ACT UP. Fight AIDS.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Excuse me
Did I do somethin' wrong?

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,700
I get invited, then ignored
All night long

198
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
I've been tryin'
I'm not lyin'

199
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,100
No one's perfect
I've got baggage

200
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Life's too short, babe
Time is flyin'

201
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm lookin' for baggage
That goes with mine

202
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,000
- I should tell you
- I've got baggage too

203
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,800
- Should tell you... Baggage
- Baggage

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Wine and beer

205
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,900
AZT break.

206
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,700
You?

207
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,200
Me

208
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
You?

209
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,800
Mimi

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,200
I should tell you
I'm disaster

211
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,900
I forget how to begin it

212
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,800
Let's just make this part go faster

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,400
I have yet to be in it
I should tell you

214
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
I should tell you

215
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,100
I should tell you

216
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,500
I should tell you

217
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,500
I should tell I blew the candle out

218
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,400
Just to get back in

219
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I'd forgotten how to smile

220
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,400
Until your candle burned my skin

221
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
I should tell you

222
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
I should tell you

I know this something is

229
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,800
- Here goes

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Guess so, it's starting to

231

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,300

239
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,900
- Without a burn
- Without a burn

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
- Clinging a shoulder
- Clinging a shoulder

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600

242
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,700
- Stinging and older

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,900
Oh, no

247
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,300
- I know
- Oh, no

248
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,600
- Who knows where?
- Who knows where?

249
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,900

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,300
- That's right. Come on.
- Yeah.

257
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
- To dance
- No way to make a living

258
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,100
Masochism, pain, perfection

259
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,200
Muscle spasms, chiropractors
Short careers, eating disorders

260
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
- Film
- Adventure, tedium

261
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
No family, boring locations
Darkrooms

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,800
Perfect faces, egos, money
Hollywood and sleaze

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
- Music
- Food of love, emotion

264
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,800
Mathematics, isolation
Rhythm, power

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Feeling, harmony
And heavy competition

266
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
- Anarchy
- Revolution, justice

267
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Screaming for solutions
Forcing changes, risk and danger

268
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Making noise and making pleas

269
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,200
To faggots, lezzies, dykes
Cross-dressers too

270
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,600
- To me
- To me

271
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,900
To you and you and you
You and you

272
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,400
To people living with
Living with, living with

273
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Not dying from disease

274
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,700
Let he among us without sin

275
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,400
Be the first to condemn

276
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,900
La vie bohème

277
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,300
La vie bohème

278
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,700
- La vie bohème
- Anyone out of the mainstream

279
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
- La vie bohème
- Is anyone in the mainstream?

280
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,500
- La vie bohème
- Anyone alive with a sex drive

281
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,400
- La vie bohème
- Tear down the wall

282
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Aren't we all?

283
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,700
- The opposite of war isn't peace
- What is?

284
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
It's creation

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
La vie bohème

286
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,200
Viva la vie bohème!

287
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,100
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

288
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,500
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear

289
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,900
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,300
How do you measure
Measure a year?

291
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,600
In diapers, report cards
In spoked wheels, in speeding tickets

292
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,500
In contracts, dollars
In funerals, in births

293
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,300
In 525,600 minutes

294
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,300
How do you figure
A last year on Earth?

295
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,800
Figure in love

296
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,400
- Figure in love
- Eight, seven, six, five...

297
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,100
- Figure in love
...four, three, two, one.

298
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Measure in love

299
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,100
Seasons of love

300
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Seasons of love

301
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Hey, Mimi. Mimi.

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,500
Mimi, give me
your New Year's resolutions.

303
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm giving up my vices.
I'm going back to school.

304
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
Oh, that's very good.
How about you, Roger?

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
- Finish a song.
- Yeah, maybe this year?

306
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,200
And who are you two
supposed to be?

307
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,100
- Bond. James Bond.
- And Pussy Galore. In person.

308
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
Very nice.

309
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
What you want, huh?

310
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,500
Well, you can take the girl
out of Hicksville...

311
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,300
...but you can't take
the Hicksville out of the girl.

312
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,700
Heard you got a job offer.

313
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,100
No, it was just that sleazy news show
Buzzline wants to take a meeting.

314
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,500
We're gonna need an agent.

315
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,600
- "We"?
- Hey, listen, mister.

316
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,000
I am the reason you got on TV
in the first place.

317
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,500
Oh, my God. You know what?
We'll do another protest.

318
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,400
And this time you can shoot
the entire thing for the TV show.

319
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,100
No, I'm not interested, I'm sorry.

320
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
What? Why not?

321
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Because working for a show like
Buzzline, that's completely selling out.

322
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,100
Okay. But it's nice to dream.

323
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
- Well, maybe.
- Happy New Year.

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Happy New Year.

325
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
Give me that. I'm sick
and tired of you always...

326
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
- Maureen. You're gonna break it.
- Hi, Mark.

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
- Happy New Year.
- This is not my bar mitzvah.

328
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Give it back to me.

329
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Out of all the years
I've been in New York...

330
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
...I've never gone to Times Square
for New Year's.

331
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,500
- Really?
- I don't think I wanna do it again.

332
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,500
- I think that was enough.
- It was a little like a moo-fest.

333
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,500
- Mark.
- What?

334
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,100
Check out the door.

335
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,700
What the hell is that?

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,400
Guys, there's a padlock
on the door.

337
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
Benny.

338
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
Hold on. Hold this, honey.

339
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,500
I saw this on television. Watch.

340
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Baby, what you doing?

341
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
You'll see.

342
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,900
Be careful, now.

343
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,300
- You're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

344
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Okay, watch.

345
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,600
- That's so heavy.
- Watch your fingers.

346
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,100
That's my girl.

347
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,700
- Yeah.
- Nothing like Pussy.

348
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,100
- Let's go.
- Here you go, baby.

349
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
- Thank you.
- Door open.

350
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
- That's a full-service woman.
- That was great.

351
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,300
- Gonna put that trash can back?
- No.

352
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,300
Oh, damn.

353
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
Typical.

354
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,900
He took all our stuff.

355
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,300
Mine too.

356
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
What a fricking sweetheart.

357
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,800
What do we do now?

358
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,200
Well, technically,
now that you're inside...

359
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
...you're squatters.
You can't be arrested.

360
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,400
Benny can't throw you
out on the street.

361
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,000
It'll give you and Roger time
to get some money together.

362
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
There's always Buzzline.

363
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,500
Oh, my God,
my stomach doesn't feel right.

364
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,600
You'll be fine.

365
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Is what I'm wearing okay?
Does this look right?

366
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Yeah, you look really good.

367
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
Do you think this belt
is too much, though?

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
- I can't do this.
- Come on.

369
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,300
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can. I'll do all the talking.

370
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,800
- What are you doing?
- Stop fussing. We're late.

371
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,700
Oh, my God, look at this place.

372
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Yeah, it's corporate America.
Welcome.

373
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,800
- Hi. We're here to see Alexi Darling.
- Hi.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,100
- Your name?
- Joanne Jefferson and Mark Cohen.

375
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
I'm Maureen Johnson.

376
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Maybe you should wait out here.

377
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,500
- But I'm the one...
- We don't wanna come on too strong.

378
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Alexi, Joanne Jefferson
and Mark Cohen here to see you.

379
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay. Fine.

380
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,000
Whatever.

381
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,800
How much did I love your footage?

382
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
So much.
It reminded me of my Berkeley days.

383
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
Fighting the good fight.

384
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,500
- Kudos. Kudos.
- Thank you.

385
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,500
I wanted to let you know that I've also
been working on a documentary...

386
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,600
...about the homeless
and people with HIV.

387
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,100
Great. I love it. So fresh, edgy.

388
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Everything Buzzline's about.

389
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,400
- Really?
- We may dip into the tabloid side.

390
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,000
Guilty as charged.
But we are a news show.

391
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,900
And your client has a fresh eye
to bring real stories to an audience...

392
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,500
...and that's what we want.

393
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,200
We get the real programming...

394
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,600
...he gets the network exposure. Not a
bad way to start a career, by the way.

395
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
So, what do you think?

396
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,400
Yes. What about salary?

397
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
On commission.

398
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,900
On an escalating scale.
Start at $3000.

399
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,600
You're not gonna get
a better deal than that.

400
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,100
We'll take it.

401
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,000
Congratulations.

402
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,700
- I sold my soul.
- For 3 grand a segment.

403
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,000
You ain't got nothing
without my protest.

404
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,100
Does everything
have to be about you?

405
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,500
Me? You're the one
helping my ex-boyfriend.

406
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,000
He needed a lawyer.

407
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,800
I figured I could help out,
since you got them evicted.

408
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know what? Why don't the two
of you get an accountant's ledger...

409
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
...and a bottle of champagne
and go at it.

410
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,100
Invite the girl you were just flirting with
to join us and I will.

411
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,900
Oh, my God. Come on, Pookie.
I was just being friendly.

412
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
- My God.
- What do you want, huh?

413
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,400
I'll do anything.
You want me to be your slave?

414
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
You want me
to just obey your every wish?

415
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,100
Tell me what you want.

416
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Commitment.

417
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,900
That's all?

418
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

419
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,000
What?

420
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,300
All you have to do is ask...

421
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,800
...and I'm yours.

422
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,800
Will you commit to me?

423
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,400
To be with only me
for the rest of our lives?

424
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,900
I will.

425
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,600
I do.

426
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,200
This can't be happening.

427
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,000
I'd like to welcome everyone...

428
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
...and congratulate
my daughter Joanne.

429
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:03,400
On... On her wonderful choice
of a life partner, Maureen Johnson.

430
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
My husband and I would also like
to welcome Maureen's parents...

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,900
...Eddie and Nancy Johnson,
into our family.

432
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Would everyone please stand?

433
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,400
And let's raise a glass to toast
the future of Joanne and Maureen.

434
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,900
Hear, hear.

435
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Cheers.

436
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,900
I love you, baby.

437
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,400
Thanks, Mom.

438
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
You got engaged.

439
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,800
Thanks, Dad.

440
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

441
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

442
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

443
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800
- Congratulations.
- Hi. Thank you.

444
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,900
Got anything stronger than this?

445
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,500
Only champagne and wine,
unfortunately.

446
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
Hi.

447
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Thank you.

448
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,300
You know, Maureen didn't even
let me really congratulate her yet.

449
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,200
I know, because...

450
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,900
- Where'd you get this necklace?
- Oh, just downtown.

451
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Could you excuse me for a minute?

452
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
- Hi. Could you excuse us a minute?
- Hi, baby.

453
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,100
Thank you.

454
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
- What's up?
- What the hell are you doing?

455
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
What? We were just talking.

456
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,300
- Right.
- Pookie, we were just talking.

457
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,400
Maureen, please,
do not do this today.

458
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,900
Excuse me, sir,
can you hold this, please?

459
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

460
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,800
You know what, Miss Ivy League?

461
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,200
I can't take much more of this.

462
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
This obsessive-compulsive,
control-freak paranoia.

463
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
- What?
- I didn't pierce my nipples...

464
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,100
...because it grossed you out.

465
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,700
I didn't stay at the Kink Club last night
because you wanted to go home.

466
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
You flirted with
the woman in rubber.

467
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,300
There will always be women
in rubber flirting with me.

468
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
Give me a break.

469
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,300
Every single day
I walk down the street

470
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,900
I hear people say
"Baby's so sweet"

471
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,800
Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby

473
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,400
So be kind
And don't lose your mind

474
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,100
Just remember that I'm your baby

475
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,200
Take me for what I am

476
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,000
Who I was meant to be

477
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,400
And if you give a damn

478
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,900
Take me, baby, or leave me

479
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,100
Take me, baby, or leave me

480
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,900
A tiger in a cage
Can never see the sun

481
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,100
This diva needs her stage
Baby, let's have fun

482
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,900
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes

483
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,500
You love
The limelight too now, baby

484
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,600
So be mine
And don't waste my time

485
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,700
Crying, "Oh, honey bear,
Are you still my, my

486
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,700
- My baby?"
- Don't you dare.

487
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,400
Take me for what I am

488
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
Who I was meant to be

489
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,700
And if you give a damn

490
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,500
Take me, baby, or leave me

491
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,000
No way can I be what I'm not

492
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,400
But, hey, don't you want
Your girl hot?

493
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't fight
Don't lose your head

494
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,600
'Cause every night

495
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,100
Who's in your bed?
Who?

496
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Who's in your bed?

497
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,500
- Kiss, Pookie.
- It won't work.

498
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,400
I look before I leap

499
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,500
I love margins and discipline

500
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,600
I make lists in my sleep, baby
What's my sin?

501
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,500
Never quit
I follow through

502
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,000
I hate mess
But I love you

503
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,200
What to do
With my impromptu baby

504
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,200
So be wise
'Cause this girl satisfies

505
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,700
You've got a prize
But don't compromise

506
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,100
You're one lucky baby

507
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,300
- Take me for what I am
- A control freak.

508
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,200
- Who I was meant to be
- A snob, yet overattentive.

509
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,400
- And if you give a damn
- A lovable, droll geek.

510
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,600
- Take me, baby, or leave me
- An anal-retentive.

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,500
- That's it
- That's it

512
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,800
The straw that breaks my back

513
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,600
- I quit
- I quit

514
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,000
Unless you take it back

515
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,400
- Women
- Women

516
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,000
What is it about them?

517
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,300
- Can't live with them or without them
- Can't live with them or without them

518
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,100
- Take me for what I am
- Take me for what I am

519
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,900
- Who I was meant to be
- Who I was meant to be

520
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,500
- And if you give a damn
- And if you give a damn

521
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,800
You better take me, baby

522
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,700
- Oh, take me, baby
- Or leave me

523
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,400
Take me or leave me

524
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,100
- Take me, baby
- Take me, baby

525
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,700
- Or leave me
- Or leave me

526
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,700
- Guess I'm leaving
- Guess I'm leaving

527
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,700
- I'm gone
- I'm gone

528
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,000
Maybe now you two
can get back together.

529
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,000
- Well, actually, I'm...
- Come on, let's go.

530
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,000
Hey, guys, all our shit's back.

531
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,500
Benny, what's going on?

532
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,100
I'm here to put an end to this war.

533
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,800
- What changed your mind?
- Mimi did, actually.

534
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
We hadn't seen each other in a while.
So we had dinner, we talked...

535
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,800
...and she convinced me
to rethink the situation.

536
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Look, I regret
the unlucky circumstances...

537
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
Circumstance? Benny,
you padlocked our door...

538
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,200
...and you took all of our stuff.
- Right.

539
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
Which is why I'm here offering
a new lease. All right?

540
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,800

You might wanna get this on film.

541
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,100
Oh, I see,
this is a photo opportunity.

542
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,700
The benevolent god ushers
the poor artists back to their flat.

544

- Full story tonight on Buzzline.
- It's not like that, Collins.

545
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,000
Look, we don't need your charity.

546
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,700
Should cover us for a little while.

547
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,900
Where'd you get this?

548
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
It's my first advance.

549
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,200
Okay. Congratulations.

550
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,500
Excuse me.

551
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
Roger...

552
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,600
...nothing happened.

553
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,800
Benny and me, it's over.
We had a thing once...

554
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,300
...but it was two years ago.
- It doesn't matter.

555
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,900
- It was before I met you.
- I don't care.

556
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,700
Without you

557
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
The ground thaws

558
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,500
The rain falls

559
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,600
The grass grows

560
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,200
Without you

561
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,900
The seeds root

562
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,500
The flowers bloom

563
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,000
The children play

564
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,800
The stars gleam

565
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,700
The poets dream

566
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,000
The eagles fly

567
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,500
Without you

568
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,300
The Earth turns

569
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,900
The sun burns

570
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,100
But I die without you

571
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,200
Without you

572
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,100
The breeze warms

573
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,100
The girl smiles

574
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,500
The cloud moves

575
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,400
Without you

576
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,100
The tides change

577
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
The boys run

578
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,800
The oceans crash

579
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,700
The crowds roar

580
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,700
The days soar

581
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,500
The babies cry

582
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Without you

583
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
The moon glows

584
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,800
The river flows

585
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,400
But I die without you

586
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,400
The world revives

587
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Colors renew

588
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,900
- But I know blue
- But I know blue

589
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,500
- Only blue
- Only blue

590
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,200
- Lonely blue
- Lonely blue

591
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,900
Within me, blue

592
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,200
Without you

593
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Without you

594
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,600
The hand gropes

595
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,700
The ear hears

596
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,600
The pulse beats

597
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Without you

598
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,800
The eyes gaze

599
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,800
The legs walk

600
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,600
The lungs breathe

601
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,700
- The mind churns
- The mind churns

602
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,500
- The heart yearns
- The heart yearns

603
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,500
- The tears dry
- The tears dry

604
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,100
Without you

605
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,200
- Life goes on
- Life goes on

606
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,900
- But I'm gone
- But I'm gone

607
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:45,800
- 'Cause I die without you
- I die

608
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,500
Without you

609
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,400
Without you

610
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,800
- Without you
- Without you

611
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,800
It's right...

612
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,700
...that today's Halloween.

613
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,000
It was Angel's favorite holiday.

614
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
I knew we'd hit it off
the moment we met.

615
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,400
There was this skinhead
that was harassing her...

616
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,800
...and she just walked
right up to him and said:

617
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,100
"I'm more of a man
than you'll ever be...

618
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,100
...and more of a woman
than you'll ever get."

619
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
And then there was this time...

620
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,300
...he walked up
to this group of tourists...

621
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
...and they were petrified...

622
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,000
...because, A, they were
obviously lost...

623
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,700
...and, B, had probably never spoken
to a drag queen before in their lives.

624
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
And he...

625
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
She...

626
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,500
...just offered to escort them
out of Alphabet City...

627
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,300
...and then let them
take a picture with her...

628
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,600
...and then said she'd help them
find the Circle Line.

629
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,500
So much more original
than any of us.

630
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,900
You'd find an old tablecloth
on the street and make a dress...

631
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,200
...and then the next year,
sure enough...

632
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,100
...they'd be mass-producing
them at the Gap.

633
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,600
You always said how lucky
you were that we were all friends...

634
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
...but it was us, baby...

635
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,000
...who were the lucky ones.

636
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:38,600
Live in my house

637
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,100
I'll be your shelter

638
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,900
Just pay me back

639
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:01,300
With 1000 kisses

640
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:13,300
Be my lover

641
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:23,900
And I'll cover you
Yeah

642
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,800
Open your door

643
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,800
I'll be your tenant

644
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,700
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

645
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,700
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

646
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,100
I'll be there and I'll cover you

647
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,200
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love

648
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love

649
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,000
On life

650
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:12,300
All my life

651
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
I've longed to discover

652
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,800
Something as true as this is
Yeah

653
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,600
So with a thousand sweet kisses

654
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,100
- lf you're cold and you're lonely
- I'll cover you

655
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,900
With a thousand sweet kisses

656
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,600
- You've got one nickel only
- I'll cover you

657
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,700
With a thousand sweet kisses

658
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,000
- When you're worn out and tired
- I'll cover you

659
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,300
With a thousand sweet kisses

660
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,800
When your heart has expired

661
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,600
Oh, lover

662
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I'll cover you

663
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,400
Oh, lover

664
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,900
I'll cover you

665
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:12,400
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

666
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:21,900
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Seasons of

667
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:35,500
- Love
- I'll cover you, oh

668
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,900
It's true you sold your guitar
And bought a car?

669
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,400
It's true
I'm leaving now for Santa Fe

670
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,300
It's true you're with
This yuppie scum?

671
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,300
You said you'd never
Speak to him again

672
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,300
- Not now.
- Who said that you have any say

673
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,500
- In who she says things to at all?
- Yeah.

674
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,000
Who said that you should stick
Your nose in other people...?

675
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
Who said I was talking to you?

676
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,900
- We used to have this fight each night
- Calm down

677
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,600
- She'd never admit I existed
- Everyone, please

678
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,000
He was the same way
He was always

679
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,600
Run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

680
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,100
- She's in denial
- He's in denial

681
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,000
Didn't give an inch
When I gave a mile

682
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,500
- I gave a mile
- Gave a mile to who?

683
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,800
Come on, guys, chill.

684
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'd be happy to die
For a taste of what Angel had

685
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
- Someone to live for
- Someone to live for

686
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,300
- Unafraid to say "I love you"
- Unafraid to say "I love you"

687
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,300
All your words are nice, Mimi

688
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,200
But love's not a three-way street

689
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,500
You'll never share real love

690
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,900
Until you love yourself
I should know

691
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,200
You all said you'd be cool today

692
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,900
So please, for my sake

693
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,600
I can't believe he's gone

694
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,600
I can't believe you're going

695
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,400
I can't believe this family must die

696
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,700
Angel helped us believe in love

697
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,000
I can't believe you disagree

698
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,200
I can't believe this is

699
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,600
Goodbye

700
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,700
Don't breathe too deep

701
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,900
Don't think all day

702
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,200
Dive into work

703
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,200
Drive the other way

704
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
That drip of hurt

705
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,900
That pint of shame

706
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:55,100
Goes away
Just play the game

707
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,600
You're living in America

708
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,400
At the end of the millennium

709
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,800
You're living in America

710
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,100
Leave your conscience at the tone

711
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,900
And when you're living in America

712
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,500
At the end of the millennium

713
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,900
You're what you own

714
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,200
The filmmaker cannot see

715
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,100
And the songwriter cannot hear

716
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,400
Yet I see Mimi everywhere

717
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,800
Angel's voice is in my ear

718
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Just tighten those shoulders

719
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,100
Just clench yourjaw till you frown

720
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,100
Just don't let go

721
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,700
- Or you may drown
- Or you may drown

722
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,900
You're living in America

723
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,700
At the end of the millennium

724
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,100
- You're living in America
- You're living in America

725
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,500
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone

726
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,300
- And when you're living in America
- And when you're living in America

727
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,800
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

728
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,800
- You're what you own
- You're what you own

729
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,600
- So I own not a notion
- So I own not a notion

730
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,600
- I escape and ape content
- I escape and ape content

731
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,700
- I don't own emotion
- I don't own emotion

732
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,200
- I rent
- I rent

733
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:44,200
- What was it about that night?
- What was it about that night?

734
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,700
- Connection in an isolating age
- Connection in an isolating age

735
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,200
- For once the shadows
- For once the shadows

736
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,600
- Gave way to light
- Gave way to light

737
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:05,600
- For once I didn't disengage
- For once I didn't disengage

738
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,900
- Angel, I hear you, I hear it, I see it
- Mimi, I see you

739
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,500
- I see it, my film
- I hear it, I hear it, I hear it, my song

740
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,000
- Alexi, Mark. Call me a hypocrite...
- One song, glory

741
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,900
...I need to finish my own film. I quit.
- Mimi, your eyes

742
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,000
Dying in America

743
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,700
At the end of the millennium

744
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,400
- We're dying in America
- We're dying in America

745
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
- To come into our own
- To come into our own

746
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,400
- And when you're dying in America
- And when you're dying in America

747
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,500
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

748
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:51,000
- You're not alone
- You're not alone

749
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:58,300
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone

750
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:05,900
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone

751
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,700
- Speak.
- Speak.

752
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,000
Hey, guys, it's Benny.

753
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,400
Look, I was wondering
if you've seen Mimi.

754
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,300
I haven't seen her
in a couple of weeks.

755
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,700
She dropped out of rehab...

756
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,200
...and I'm afraid that she may
have started using again.

757
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,300
- lf you find out anything, let me know.
- Hi, Roger, Mark...

758
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
...it's Maureen. Still no sign of Mimi.
- I just wanna know if she's all right.

759
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,500
- Joanne and I printed up some fliers.
- Hey, it's Collins. Just checking in.

760
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,300
- I'll call back if we hear anything.
- You heard from Mimi?

761
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,300
Roger, I spoke to the manager
of the Cat Scratch Club.

762
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,800
- She hasn't shown up for work.
- Roger, are you there?

763
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,400
Look, I just went to the police station
and I filed a missing-persons report.

764
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
I spoke to a friend of Mimi's who
said she saw her three weeks ago.

765
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,600
She hasn't picked up
her AZT in a while.

766
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,000
- She's been living on the street.
- Couple of weeks.

767
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,100
It's Collins again. I should be heading
home, like, right around Christmas.

768
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,400
I'm really starting to get worried.
It's getting cold out there.

769
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,700
- It's too cold out there.
- How can she survive?

770
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,500
December 24th, 1990, 10 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

771
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,900
I can't believe a year
went by so fast.

772
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,200
- Speak.
- Speak.

773
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,000
- Hey, it's me, throw down the key.
- Hey, look who's home.

774
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Hey, Collins, don't get
your ass kicked this time.

775
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,200
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

776
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,300
Welcome back.

777
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,000
Come here.

778
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,700
Take your key. Hey, man.

779
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,500
Hello, Thomas. Merry Christmas.

780
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,900
- Hey, any word from Mimi?
- No.

781
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,200
You got the projector...
You finished your movie.

782
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,800
- I did.
- Well, I wanna see it.

783
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,500
Okay.

784
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,300
And I thought you guys could use
this to get some heat up in here.

785
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,400
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Thank you.

786
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,800
- Tutoring again?
- Nope.

787
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,200
- You back at NYU?
- Negative.

788
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,600
- Then how'd you get all this?
- I rewired the ATM...

789
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,300
...at The Food Emporium.
Now all you need is the code.

790
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,400
- The code? What code?
- A-N-G-E-L.

791
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,400
Cheers.

792
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,100
Merry Christmas.

793
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,900
Mark?

794
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,200
Roger?

795
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,100
Anyone? Help.

796
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,600
We can't get her up the stairs.

797
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
Hurry up, please.

798
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,800
Mimi.

799
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,400
She's been living on the street.

800
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,300
We found her in the park.
She wanted to come here.

801
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
No room on the couch.

802
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,000
Just clear off the table,
we'll put her there.

803
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,500
Up here.

804
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,000
Roger.

805
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,200
- You're back.
- I'm back. I'm back, baby.

806
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,900
Rog.

807
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,900
- We need some heat.
- Okay, I'll buy some wood and food.

808
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,800
- It's too late. I'm calling 911.
- Roger?

809
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,800
I'm right here. I'm right here.
It's okay.

810
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,600
I'm here. We got you.

811
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,700
We got you.

812
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,500
I should tell you
I should tell you

813
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,000
I should tell you
I should tell you

814
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,800
I should tell you Benny wasn't any...

815
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,500
I know.

816
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,700
I should tell you why I left

817
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
- It wasn't 'cause I didn't...
- I know.

818
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,900
- I should tell you
- I should tell you

819
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,100
I should tell you, I love you

820
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,600
Who do you think you are?

821
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,600
Leaving me alone with my guitar

822
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,000
Hold on, there's something
You should hear

823
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,500
It isn't much, but it took all year

824
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,200
Your eyes

825
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,300
As we said our goodbyes

826
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,900
Can't get them out of my mind

827
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,000
And I find

828
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,200
I can't hide

829
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,600
From your eyes

830
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,900
The ones that took me by surprise

831
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,800
The night you came into my life

832
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,400
Where there's moonlight

833
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,100
I see your eyes

834
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,600
How'd I let you slip away

835
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,800
When I'm longing so to hold you?

836
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,100
Now I'd die for one more day

837
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,700
'Cause there's something
I should have told you

838
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,200
Yes, there's something
I should have told you

839
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,600
When I looked into your eyes

840
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,900
Why does distance make us wise?

841
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,600
You were the song all along

842
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:16,600
And before the song dies

843
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,800
I should tell you
I should tell you

844
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,500
I have always loved you

845
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,500
You can see it in my eyes

846
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:55,500
Mimi

847
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,700
Mimi.

848
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,100
I was heading
towards this warm...

849
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,100
...white light.

850
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,800
And I swear...

851
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,800
...Angel was there.

852
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,100
And she looked good.

853
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,200
She said:

854
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,800
"Turn around, girlfriend...

855
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,900
...and listen to that boy's song."

856
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,400
You're drenched.

857
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,700
Her fever's breaking.

858
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,600
There is no future

859
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,100
There is no past

860
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:10,300
Thank God this moment's
Not the last

861
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,500
- There's only us
- There's only us

862
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,300
- There's only this
- There's only this

863
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,600
- Forget regret
- Forget regret

864
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,600
Or life is yours to miss

865
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,900
No other road

866
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,500
No other way

867
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:37,800
No day but today

868
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,600
- I can't control
- Will I lose my dignity?

869
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,900
- My destiny
- Will someone care?

870
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,600
- I trust my soul
- Will I wake tomorrow

871
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,100
My only goal

872
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,800
- Is just to be
- From this nightmare?

873
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,500
- Without you
- There's only now

874
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,800
- The hand gropes
- There's only here

875
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,200
- The ear hears
- Give in to love

876
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,200
- The pulse beats
- Or live in fear

877
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,500
- Life goes on
- No other path

878
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,800
- But I'm gone
- No other way

879
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,800
- 'Cause I die without you
- No day but today

880
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:36,300
- I die without you
- No day but today

881
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:42,800
- I die without you
- No day but today

882
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,700
- I die without you
- No day but today

883
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:55,800
- I die without you
- No day but today

884
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,800
- I die without you
- No day but today

885
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,500
No day but today
