LOSING MOVE:
A BAD MOVE TO CAUSE THE DEFEAT

5
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:16,109
You have 30 seconds left.

6
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,605
30, 29, 28...27, 26, 25...
, 23, 22...

7
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,557
Put up an umbrella.

8
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,094
Is it you?.

9
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,197
I saw your game.

10
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,733
One false move ruined it.
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,678
Fight like a man.
Never back off.

12
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,842
Where have you been?.

13
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,116
We can chat later.
I've got a favor to ask you now.

14
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,619
Play a guidance game for me.

15
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,421
Guidance game?.
With whom?.

16
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,889
Don't ask too much.
It won't take long.

17
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,438
Can we just go home today?.

18
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,602
I have a bad feeling for this.

19
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,072
Don't worry. We'll win.

20
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,049
What kind of game is it?.

21
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,517
Play as you always have.
Will be easy.

22
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,313
Do you dabble in gambling?.

23
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,020
None of your business.

24
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,184
Tae-seok!

25
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:49,961
Tae-seok! Tae-seok!

26
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,633
Wait! Tae-seok!

27
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,242
Listen to me.
Remember one thing.

28
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,746
Do not ever lose.
Understand?.

29
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,213
Gotta win.

30
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,776
Just trust me.

31
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,851
Nothing bad will happen.

32
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,078
On 5 and 1 2.

33
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,142
Your skill's improved drastically.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
It's just luck.

35
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,421
You're sweating.
Why don't you take the jacket off?.

36
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,626
True dandies can sweat to death
for the sake of fashion.

37
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,272
Is it so?. Don't get it as I'm a swagger
only in winter.

38
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,744
Wow, he is the tough match!

39
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,142
He has a sharper's move.
A real pro.

40
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,322
Take over.

41
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,722
Boss, I can handle this.

42
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,025
Sit.

43
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,573
On 1 2 and 1 2.
Stretch.

44
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,388
On 6 and 6.
I can't hold it.

45
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,049
Will be right back.
You go on.

46
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,121
Brother.
Can you hear me?.

47
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,636
On 9 and 1 2.
Attack.

48
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,570
On 1 3 and 8. Escape through
Large Knight's move.

49
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,838
On 7 and 4.

50
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,756
- How's it going?.
- It's strange.

51
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,986
- Why?.
-He suddenly got much stronger.

52
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,858
How come the Black is
suddenly moving so fast?.

53
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,940
Holy cow!
What is wrong with me?.

54
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,534
I'm sorry. Need to
go to toilet again.

55
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:58,489
I can't see the board right now.

56
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,521
Wait a bit.
Do not make any move.

57
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,753
You're slower than usual today.

58
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,199
Can you hear me?.
Just linger over.

59
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,341
No, that's the wrong spot!

60
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,187
Don't put it there.
Please don't!

61
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,458
Finish it.

62
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:49,008
Brother, something's wrong.
Come out right now!

63
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,476
You hear me?.

64
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,610
Get out of there!

65
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,374
Tae-seok!

66
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:33,019
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:39,390
You little prick.

68
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,188
Having a shadow player
at a gentlemen's game?.

69
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,387
You should at least
keep your manners!

70
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,872
Even the money is fake.

71
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,804
You know the rules for that?.

72
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,841
Please, don't!

73
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,813
Quiet.

74
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:07,119
I'm sorry, sir!

75
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:11,324
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive us.

76
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,451
- Shut the fuck up!
- Brother!

77
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,860
Brother!

78
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,878
Wait! We're not done yet.

79
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,370
Brother!

80
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,747
Eat the stones up.
Or your lovely brother is dead.

81
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,202
If you win,
I'll let your brother go.

82
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,510
Start.

83
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,174
You can't retreat a move.

84
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,151
It just dropped!

85
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,152
I call the rules.

86
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:51,223
That's nonsense...

87
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:56,160
Please let me retreat one move.
Just one move.

88
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:02,301
Please...
Do not kill my brother.

89
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,828
I'm sorry.
Please do not kill him.

90
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,401
My brother...

91
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,341
I.... I'm done!

92
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:26,158
There's one left!
GO and life are quite similar.

93
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,126
One false move can
lead you to death.

94
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:39,902
Brother!

95
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,479
Look at the true dandy stabbed to death!

96
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,705
Only stones on the board
revive once they get killed.

THE DlVlNE MOVE

105
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,053
Mr. Director, I'd like to have
a couple of days' leave-time.

106
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,683
Leave-time?.

107
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,794
Need to check the regulations
Should be quite tight on mops.

108
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,242
You know, Japanese police
once investigated

109
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,747
a sample of 500 criminals

110
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,017
and found one common point.
Can you guess what it was?.

111
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,122
Not a single one played GO.

112
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,057
What should it mean?.

113
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,424
That the criminals who play GO
seldom get caught.

114
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,755
The ones playing GO
seldom get caught.

115
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,733
Why?.
They're ahead in moves.

116
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,503
In that sense, I can say
you're one of two cases.

117
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,529
Whether you cannot play GO,
or are very dumb.

118
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,633
A week will do.

119
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:03,408
Win a game against me,
then I'll let you go out.

120
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,246
A large group got captured.

121
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,556
Did he catch me here?.

122
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,661
It seems so, bro.

123
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,425
It's like I'll go dying
stuck in this prison.

124
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,892
Not yet.

125
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,135
Let him come near.

126
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,600
A large group of stones
is seldom captured.

127
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:04,871
Play a game with a man here.
He's quite good.

128
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,679
No one's ever beaten him.

129
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,744
You damn fucker.

130
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,623
I like you!

131
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,861
I got bored to play
with the dumpsters.

132
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,555
One more game!

133
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,758
And don't forget to make a bet.
He's addicted to it.

134
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,837
Please do me a favor if I win.

135
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,541
Tell me.

136
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,880
I want beer, cigarette and
free time till I serve my sentence.

137
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,543
Wanna play for stakes?.

138
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,786
Only if you allow me.

139
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,946
Then what's your bet?.

140
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,309
You won.

141
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,814
Request for Ieave-days
GRANTED

142
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,211
But you'll have one month
in solitary cell for being cocky.

143
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,043
A gae, please?.

144
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,354
On 7 and 3.

145
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,256
On 5 and 1 2.

146
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,222
On 1 2 and 9...

147
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,785
Who are you?.

148
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,358
Let me at least
know your name.

149
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,109
Your company obliterated
my Ioneliness. Thanks.

150
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,134
Look for Drinking Christ
at Gwancheol when you go out.

151
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,111
Thanks for your trouble.

152
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,522
Now I'll have some free time.

153
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,152
Please train me how to fight.

154
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,811
Wow! Unbelievable.

155
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,379
Help yourself!

156
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,754
I got the first prize!

157
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,985
Wanna work for me
when you go out?.

158
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,228
Got a work to do.
Please do me one favor.

159
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,425
I need some money.
Will pay you back.

160
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,870
It's me who owed you.

161
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,428
Will buy a drink.

162
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,772
As long as you are alive
till I get out.

163
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,182
Was a tough search.
She's a real treasure.

164
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,658
He had a hard time to trace it.

165
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:41,868
Two.

166
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:43,835
He asks for two million.

167
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,134
You've got 1 0mins. Test her.

168
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,310
It would be too short.

169
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,011
Those are questions of
life and death. You know it?.

170
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,480
Ten mins to solve everything.
Understand?.

171
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,554
You take the black.
Get the white.

172
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,739
Changing the amount.

173
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,014
Pay three million.
Fuck off if you can't pay that.

174
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,003
He now wants 3M.

175
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,715
Wait!

176
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,917
Call me any time when
you have good stuff.

177
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,934
Go kill them.

178
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,515
But bring the girl alive.

179
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,695
Bring Navel in.

180
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,032
Could you play a game with me?.

181
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,413
This is not a ladies' game.

182
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,839
Play by territories?.

183
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,048
No, let's do it by games.
All in.

184
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:38,098
Master Noh, You'd better focus on training
the young now that you retired.

185
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,802
Who the hell are you?.

186
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,739
You don't belong here.

187
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,983
You're still okay, I guess.

188
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,880
Don't eat too much.
Chubby girls aren't charming.

189
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,758
Do you offer a special service to boss?.

190
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,282
He treats you too well.

191
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:07,566
You can play a game
for your life if you dare.

192
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,828
You can put stones
on two points first.

193
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,863
Guess you're intimidated.

194
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,845
Thought of putting
a special service as a bet.

195
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,837
Oh, I forgot
you can't come.

196
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,619
Stick to what you are.

197
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,315
Using your dumb brains
should make you ill.

198
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,589
Don't you agree?.

199
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,019
Thanks for the advice.

200
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,563
Damn, I can surely come.

201
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,267
Good job.

202
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,875
Take that kid.
Wash and feed her.

203
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,424
I'm not really into parenting.

204
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,994
I'm hungry.

205
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,832
How old are you?.

206
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,041
Seven?.

207
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,583
Eight?.

208
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,611
You're ten years old.

209
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,323
Your name?.

210
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,633
Liang Liang?.

211
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,675
PLACEMENT: PUT A STONE
ON THE BOARD

212
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,038
When's your mom coming?.

213
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,882
Why?.

214
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,986
Dead.

215
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,130
Do you play GO?.

216
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,535
No, Five in a Row.
Grandma said she'll kill me if I play GO.

217
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,011
Are you really my uncle?.

218
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,619
See you soon.

219
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,413
I cannot read
the moves well today.

220
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,716
I was just lucky.

221
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:00,421
Sir, can I play a game
with the gentleman there?.

222
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:07,437
Mr. Cho, he wants
to play a game with you.

223
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,436
You have similar levels.

224
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,248
I lost this time too.

225
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,250
One more game?.

226
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,196
Aren't you broke?.

227
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,561
Think I got $500 left.

228
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,121
Why don't you save it
for rainy days?.

229
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,931
Then how about
flicks on the forehead?.

230
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,774
Wait a bit more.
Just one hour.

231
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,517
Have you collected money?.

232
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,354
- Of course! Perfectly done.

233
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,123
I'm playing with a pushover

234
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,692
I ribbed off him $1 0K already.

235
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,361
This broke blockhead
lost his temper

236
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,491
and wants to put the bashes
with knuckles as a bet!

237
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,564
Sir.

238
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,729
Why don't you go out
and drink while we play?.

239
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,314
Alright! Well...
Shall we count?.

240
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,558
Let's see.

241
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,150
I won by half a territory.

242
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:44,702
I can see you're good at counting.
Then...

243
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,294
Let me see.

244
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,443
You keep the change
as the winner's tip!

245
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,914
We had one more bet.

246
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,415
What?.

247
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,578
Ten blows with the knuckles.

248
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:14,323
You are mad as you lost a lot today?.
You're quite persistent.

249
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,066
Got it.
Give me a blow!

250
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:20,968
Then....

251
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,701
You should at least
keep your manners!

252
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,228
Hit me.

253
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,947
Are you fucking crazy?.

254
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,290
You fucker, where shall l
put your dead body on?.

255
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,555
The left corner or right?.
Or on the center of the board?.

256
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,991
Son of a bitch!

257
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:39,150
Untie right now!
Do you hear me?. Hey!

258
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,019
What the hell!
Who are you?.

259
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,257
Guess you didn't study over.

260
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:53,823
What?.
What are you talking about?.

261
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:17,815
You little prick.
I can see you surely grew up.

262
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,994
So what do you want me to do?.

263
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,224
What shall I do for you?.

264
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:33,101
What are you doing?.

265
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,573
Oh, I see.
Hit me! I'm not afraid!

266
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,872
Two more blows to go.

267
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,769
Son of a bitch.
You can go to hell doing this.

268
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:15,546
I'm wondering if your brother
digested all by now.

269
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,309
The stones in his stomach.

270
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,742
The real game starts from now.
You play with your hand, not your tongue.

271
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,169
It's Atari!

272
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,969
Can you just shut up
and play?.

273
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,842
Damn, I should've noticed this trick.

274
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,880
What trick?.
My life's been all about fair play.

275
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,046
There are black stones all over.
It's like the coal mine.

276
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,523
Hello?. Wait there.

277
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,424
It won't take long
as I'm inside the building.

278
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,494
Didn't you lie about
your level, did you?.

279
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,793
If I were any better,
I should go pro.

280
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,764
I never lie about two things.
My GO level and my stamina.

281
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,467
Thanks for the good match.

282
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,699
Catch that prick!

283
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,203
Help me! Help!
Please help me. Do not kill.

284
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,933
You tried to cheat us?.

285
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,509
It was a fair game...

286
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,544
Wanna cough up the money
or the blood in your body?.

287
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,206
Money, of course!

288
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,208
Can I have him for a while?.

289
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,547
What?. Are you with him?.

290
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,134
You know Woo-seok?.

291
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,601
No.

292
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,042
Mr. Song Woo-seok.

293
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,010
Who are you?.

294
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:40,621
I know! I know, I know him!
I remember you!

295
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,256
Younger brother of Woo-seok!

296
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,262
So you were alive?.

297
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:56,507
Wow it's thrilling.
My first time to team up with a pro.

298
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,810
Wow, look at this place.

299
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,647
It's more like a blockbuster.

300
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,944
How did you meet my brother?.

301
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,548
You really don't know?.

302
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,513
We were the same team.
A team to survive.

303
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:18,395
Your brother was a well known devil.
I mean, a professional gambler.

304
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:26,426
Poor Woo-seok.
He shouldn't have died like that.

305
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:31,830
Have you seen this guy?.

306
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,620
You know, I pulled out of
the league long time ago.

307
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,086
You go on your own.
I'm out of this.

308
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,993
Join me if you change your mind.
You'll get the half of the profit.

309
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,258
3 million.

310
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:04,369
I am back not because of the money!
But because I want to repay

311
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,702
your brother's kindness!

312
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,514
I got you, right?. I'm good at acting,
I know.Am I in?.

313
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,822
Hey, Big Move.

314
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:28,032
What kind of GO master
plays at a place like this?.

315
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,727
No way! Not a chance.

316
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,803
Listen. Just two of us can have it all.
We don't need more players.

317
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,294
It gets too complicated.

318
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:46,410
You're stubborn as a mule.
Wait, master Song!

319
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,020
Is this stone dead or what?.

320
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,664
Guess I had a better luck.

321
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,634
How come the large group die?.
Damn!

322
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,602
Don't tell me it's THE master.

323
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,431
Excuse me, sir.

324
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:16,302
Could you please have
a hand talk with me?.

325
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:21,352
Don't know how to talk with hands
but surely know how to talk with drinks.

326
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,150
The bet is a bottle of drink.

327
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,254
Please teach me a lesson, sir.

328
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,170
I lost by half a territory.

329
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:21,510
You're much stronger than me.
Why sounding me out?.

330
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,269
Let's have a drink.

331
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:29,686
Okay. Let's get baptized
by the sacred water.

332
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,985
Now I know why people
call you Drinking Christ.

333
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,155
It's so good.

334
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,734
Have we met before?.

335
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,202
Definitely not.

336
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,692
What happened to your eyes?.

337
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,463
Was an accident.

338
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,436
I also lost my eye
in the accident.

339
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,039
I've got a plan.

340
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,255
Just take care of
the other eye.

341
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,415
We can win.

342
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,390
That blind belief
drives people to death.

343
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,818
Will you join us?.

344
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,934
Thank you for the drink.

345
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,240
Does the blind
dream a dream?.

346
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,653
Sure, mostly a nightmare.

347
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,621
How about when you're awake?.

348
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,482
The nightmare continues.

349
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,391
Guess she's your daughter.

350
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,901
How does she look?.

351
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,259
Good and sound.

352
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,109
Why don't you decide?.

353
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,373
What's your name?.

354
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,113
You can call me Big Move.

355
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,221
You call me Agnus Dei!

356
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,150
Let's go.

357
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:38,410
Are you here, Carpenter?.

358
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,786
I think you've got lost.

359
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:53,453
It's been a while.
Can we talk for a minute?.

360
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,890
Guess you're still drunk.
You go your way.

361
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,912
Can I have water?.

362
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:17,752
Here you are.

363
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,466
Why?. You thought I lost
both of my hands?.

364
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,542
I'm sorry.

365
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:49,549
We were quite okay once.

366
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,855
The happy ending's not
for the gamblers.

367
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,160
What brings you here?.

368
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,268
I'll fight against them again.

369
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,908
Then this is the last time
that I see you alive.

370
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,288
Help us.

371
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,633
OPENING: ENCAMP FOR THE BATTLE

372
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,501
I've been to gambling house
run by Killer.

373
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,763
It's perfectly organized.

374
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,243
He's Player.

375
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,712
He's good at acting
in addition to GO itself.

376
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:53,012
He's more like a manger
of the house.

377
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,710
Gamblers around the nation
gather here and play.

378
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:59,482
Cannot cheat each other...

379
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,319
as everyone is better than average.

380
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,489
Some games have huge bet.

381
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,658
That's the VlP room,
they get 1 0% of the bet as fee.

382
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,802
Player induces some rich people
to play with him.

383
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,272
Mainly the rich businessmen
or ones in specialized jobs,

384
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,975
who have high pride
and are very competitive.

385
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,170
We got the real pushover!

386
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,109
Once trapped, it would take
less than a month to go broke.

387
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,214
That snake-like old man is a kibitzer.

388
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,723
He's Master Wong.

389
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:37,494
He runs a calligraphy academy
but it's just a front.

390
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,497
The monthly tuition is $50 for
children and $70 for adults

391
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:44,991
but the term begins from 3-month-course.
So greedy.

392
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,805
Skills are great.

393
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:54,366
That ugly son of a bitch
in flower shirt is Atari.

394
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:59,675
He's the collector and looks after
illegal online gambling, too.

395
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,251
The meanest of all
is this one, Killer.

396
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,158
Damn violent
son of a bitch.

397
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,122
Hey Big Move!
Can we leave him alone?.

398
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,502
Who's that girl?.

399
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,765
Damn. Attention everyone!
Open your eyes, Drinking Christ.

400
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:29,068
Have you heard of Goddess Bar?.
25-year-old Kwon runs it.

401
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,983
She turned pro at 1 5.
Gold medalist at Doha Asian Games.

402
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,219
World Champion in 2006.

403
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:40,316
But retired and disappeared
when she became only 20.

404
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,285
And ta-da, she now runs this bar.

405
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,931
They call her Navel.

406
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,760
Navel is another term
for flower point in Go.

407
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,870
I think she belongs to Killer.

408
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,446
I need to go after this game.

409
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,949
Let's play for one more hour.
Finally the game starts to go well.

410
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,509
Sorry sir.
My wife is pregnant.

411
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:13,682
What?. Why did you make
such a bad move?.

412
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:22,194
Well, I won this time too.
$600 each, please.

413
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,959
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

414
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,136
- It's your lucky day.
- I guess so.

415
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,704
Hey, young man!
Come and join us if you are here to play.

416
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,280
What do you do for a living?.

417
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,591
I did some research in school.

418
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:56,934
Research?.
You mean a professor?. What major?.

419
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,701
Math.

420
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,203
Math! Which university?.

421
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,296
I have a friend
at Seoul National Univ.

422
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,237
He had a stroke
while playing mah-jong with me.

423
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,315
But when I said we were
short of one to play,

424
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,112
he suddenly woke up
and played again!

425
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,547
Anyway, great to meet you.

426
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,654
You know what is most difficult
in playing mah-jong?.

427
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,227
Nine Gates?. Hell no.

428
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:29,795
To gather four to play a game.
Such a hassle.

429
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,431
How did you find this place?.

430
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,906
I've been here long before.

431
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,239
Don't recall. I'm quite good
at remembering faces, though.

432
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,846
I was much different then.

433
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,252
You also play GO?.

434
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,324
More as a hobby.

435
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:05,697
I also play it a bit.
Let's play together someday.

436
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,943
Have we met before?.

437
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,378
Well...

438
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,479
Thank you for the talk.

439
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,942
I can't do it!

440
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,654
What is Carpenter doing?.

441
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:58,678
Making a chair or what?.

442
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,252
Give it to me.

443
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:08,390
Wow, you can make
this kinda stuff, too!

444
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,438
You look a bit awkward.

445
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,566
What can you see?.

446
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,036
Driver's License
YOOK Jong-duck

447
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:31,343
6 Ducks Entertainment!
I can feel a sexy vibe.

448
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,701
Lost again!

449
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,833
This seat is ill-fated!

450
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,149
This seat too! And this, too!
I'm getting ripped off!

451
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:01,778
Where is the lucky place?.

452
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,650
Hey, the cigarette!
Going broke!

453
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,826
- One more game!
- No problem!

454
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:17,000
You don't have 1 mm?.
You wanna suffocate me

455
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,935
with strong nicotine?.
One more game!

456
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,966
You have it all!

457
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,102
- One more game. Wait here. Do not move!
- I won't.

458
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,609
Wait right there!

459
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,110
I need some money here.

460
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:51,630
You! You don't look like
a brainy type.

461
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:56,968
You can read the face?.
Then change your job.

462
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:12,415
My brain cells are all dead!

463
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,769
- What is he doing?.
- Making adult videos.

464
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:30,969
How much did he spend?.

465
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:35,478
Hundred thousand.
Low in skills but high in pride.

466
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,608
A perfect target for us.

467
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:45,121
HAENGMA: EXPAND THE STRENGHT
IN HARMONY

468
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:48,784
Carpenter, did you have a test on this?.
Not a cheap stuff?.

469
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,925
I need additional amount
for risking my life.

470
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,260
The smoking will kill me
even if I don't get stabbed.

471
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,841
Stop drinking!
How can you kibitz?.

472
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,845
Low level player worries much.

473
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,610
You haven't thought
I could be a master in disguise?.

474
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,257
I sometimes think so
seeing you

475
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,225
regard this world
as a playground.

476
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,096
As this world is a playground
for the mater

477
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,997
and a living hell
for the low player.

478
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,138
Then I should be
the bottom of the lowest.

479
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,368
For me, the world
is the endless hell.

480
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,589
Go for a fast attack. Divide
wedge through the center of the left.

481
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,228
Approaching on 3 and 6.

482
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,700
Lower Pincer by one space.

483
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,305
On 1 2 and 1 2.

484
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:24,683
On 1 6 and 9.

485
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:28,451
On 1 0 and 9.

486
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,061
Good job.

487
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,085
Hey!
Search this bastard.

488
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,120
What are you talking about?.

489
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,131
Losing temper for losing once?.
I had lost enough here!

490
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:12,227
Let go of me, shitheads!

491
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:28,115
Found nothing?. Then I have to see
the manager. I'm clear. Poor you!

492
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,721
Losing is painful,
you know that now?.

493
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,124
You petty bastard!

494
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:39,084
I will kill you, son of a bitch!
You're dead today!

495
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,028
What the hell are you?.

496
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:52,233
Mind your own boards!
Mind your own games, I said!

497
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:56,709
Sir.

498
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:10,493
- Would you have a game with me?.
- I'm not in the mood.

499
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,396
Don't let a petty bastard
ruin your mood.

500
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,531
How strong are you?.

501
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,728
What matters is not the level,
but the condition of the day.

502
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,829
Right, just like making love.

503
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,675
Let me get some fresh air first.

504
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,505
Sure.

505
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,988
I hate cigarettes.

506
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,006
Have I told you already
how much I'm amazed

507
00:57:57,006 --> 00:58:00,498
by your marvelous survival skills?.

508
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,566
Speak for yourself.

509
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:04,914
Not many options
for low lives like us.

510
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,314
I'm not like you.

511
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,215
I'm playing in the center stage.

512
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,914
We're in different leagues, dude.

513
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:20,024
Center or corner, the last man
standing gets all the bets.

514
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,998
A hell of disguise...

515
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,706
Fuck off!
Such a rat.

516
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,142
Here we are again.

517
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,148
We're meant to
live like this, I guess.

518
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,421
Have you seen a divine move?.

519
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,685
No, I haven't.

520
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:54,130
Is there such a move
in our life?.

521
00:58:54,130 --> 00:59:00,136
A move so divine that can change
our life drastically.

522
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,604
Only God has the answer.

523
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,332
For what would you use
such a move?.

524
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,874
I will save my wife.

525
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,981
And get your arm back.

526
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,744
There's a better move.

527
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,755
Use it to go back to when
you didn't play for money.

528
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,127
I won.

529
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:35,305
Congratulations.
It's your jackpot day.

530
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,607
I'm done here.

531
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:41,077
What's up again today?.
My luck's finally getting in.

532
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,979
It's my wedding anniversary.

533
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,506
Damn the anniversaries.

534
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,122
Mr. Oh, come join us.

535
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,859
How can you make a living
as you quit teaching?.

536
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,700
I'm building a program.

537
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,206
A program?. What kind?.

538
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,408
Kind of algorithms for GO.

539
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,036
Al...what?.

540
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,781
A computer program
that can beat humans

541
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,450
in GO games.

542
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:26,422
What's the use for computers
to win humans in GO anyway?.

543
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,448
Like it's not hard enough for us.

544
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:38,765
I won.

545
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:46,376
What the hell?.
Nine Gates?.

546
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,647
It's a once a lifetime luck!
Congratulations, really.

547
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:55,351
Thank you.
Let me buy you the dinner.

548
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,979
Of course, you should!

549
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:04,015
I have to go, sorry.

550
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,567
You should not go home today.

551
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,903
It'd bring you bad luck.
You should play all night.

552
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:18,975
Where should we go?.
I know a good lamb place.

553
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,306
You'd better go home.

554
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,607
I won first.
But passed for you.

555
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:35,024
- Didn't know that.
- Better watch out.

556
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:39,893
As you had once a lifetime luck today,
you might die anytime soon.

557
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,966
I was dead already.

558
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,763
I've got no more life to lose.

559
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,370
Caller ID: Killer

560
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:53,503
Hello.

561
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,573
What is he?.

562
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,651
He really is a programmer.

563
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,291
His hands look too rough
for a computer guy.

564
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:11,094
He may smash keyboards
when pissed off.

565
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,188
Feel like joking?.
Guess the date was fun.

566
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,468
Partners shouldn't have secrets.

567
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,629
No partnership is eternal.

568
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:26,676
And your bad fortune this year
could affect the business.

569
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:30,179
I saved your mother.
Now you forgot the terms?.

570
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:34,016
It's a lifetime deal.
Terminates only when you're dead.

571
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:38,248
You never know.
Your death could also terminate it.

572
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,820
You always commit errors
in the final moves.

573
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:52,168
Don't try too much.
You're a dead-end ladder.

574
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,899
You'll end up dead
how hard you try.

575
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:03,008
Watch out the ladder breaker
when you kill. You could miss it.

576
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,744
A common mistake for low ranks.

577
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,561
It's not easy...

578
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:25,726
Hopeless bastard.
How did it go?.

579
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:30,339
What keeps you so busy?.
Share the fun stuff with us.

580
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,838
How was it today?.

581
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,279
Christ had hell of good moves.

582
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,715
Masters never hesitate on moves.

583
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:40,838
Go by yourself tomorrow.

584
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,353
You want me to walk alone
into the lion's den?.

585
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,753
Don't worry.
He will let you win.

586
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:53,293
What does that mean?.
Hey, tell me!

587
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,538
Today's not the day for me.
Thanks for a good game.

588
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:10,346
- It's for your fare.
- That's alright.

589
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,370
Indeed a cool guy!

590
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,710
How about betting bigger next time?.

591
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,487
Why not?.

592
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,963
You're a dead meat!

593
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:38,074
DANSOO [ATARI]: ONE MOVE AWAY
FROM CAPTURING OPPONENT'S STONE.

594
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:43,079
It's what I do.
Target market is China.

595
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,105
It's the second biggest
movie market.

596
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,879
Care for a sneak preview?.

597
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,385
Let's start the game.

598
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,717
- Right away?.
- Sure.

599
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,326
I'll have to take a leak first.

600
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,390
Try this in your mouth.
It gives you a vibe.

601
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,734
This business is in recession, too.

602
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:49,679
People watch porn on their mobile
nowadays. So it doesn't earn any dime.

603
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,417
Movies must have soul in it.

604
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,853
But it's all about groaning now

605
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,548
What will the youngsters
learn from it?.

606
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:06,156
Can't help but worrying
about this country's future.

607
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,281
Are you OK with this place?.

608
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,584
Feel sorry that I chose
my home grounds.

609
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:33,889
- Let's keep it quiet.
- This is how I loosen up.

610
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,759
- How about having a smoke?.
- I quit.

611
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:41,564
Lung is such a delicate organ
that can be compared to a lotus...

612
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,532
Keep your mouth shut, I said.

613
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,617
Oh my God, what's this?.

614
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,847
I thought I lost but
I won by one and a half territory?.

615
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:09,353
I will keep this in custody.
It's heavy.

616
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,559
Show some respect, dude.

617
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,365
How much did you lose?.

618
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,266
Two large bills.

619
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,598
How large?.
2millions?.

620
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,773
Since when did you become

621
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:27,675
such a pushover in this field?.

622
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,275
Don't get on my nerves.

623
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:37,053
There's a saying.
Pride goes before a fall.

624
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,044
Never be off guard
at this level of games.

625
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:40,956
Shut up and help me tomorrow.

626
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:45,461
By the way...
Does Killer know about this?.

627
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,430
Don't wag your tongue.

628
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,864
What's the split?.

629
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,766
60, 40 as always.

630
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:51,528
Let's do 50, 50.

631
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,737
Trying to negotiate with me?.

632
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,104
Well, I'm not the one
who's cornered now.

633
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,443
Greedy ones can never
get old graciously.

634
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:10,715
If you look at me like that again,
I'll make sure you're dead.

635
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,331
- You don't have to count?.
- No need.

636
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:25,267
It feels better counting at home.

637
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,326
You won't have to
count anything today.

638
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:37,379
It's Dansoo, Atari!

639
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,507
I can see it.
Shut your mouth.

640
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:45,276
Who's this bastard?.
He's not taking the bait!

641
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:52,257
On 5 and 9.

642
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,632
Don't exhale right to my face.

643
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:11,711
Tons of trick moves...
I recognize this play pattern.

644
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:15,412
Long time no see, you kibitzer.

645
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,886
Take the bait,
you son of a bitch!

646
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,159
Bastards!

647
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,040
Didn't you quit?.

648
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,441
I quit quitting.
I got dumped by a chick.

649
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,643
I am getting curious
how big your mouth could be.

650
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:51,654
This son of a bitch!
He's now playing me?.

651
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,519
Player, on 6 and 4.

652
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:56,782
He's pushing forward.

653
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,664
Women are scary creatures.

654
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,366
We've been together quite long

655
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,502
but she cut me off at once.

656
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,165
Quite similar to GO.
When they cut you off,

657
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,333
This motherfucker
is totally playing me!

658
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,133
they do it mercilessly.

659
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:23,319
They're messing with us!

660
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:28,655
Screw the game!
You didn't hear me?. Screw it!

661
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,859
What the hell!

662
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:52,541
Please don't kill me!
I beg you.

663
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,446
Make sure to give me
additional share!

664
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,955
I don't think I invited you.

665
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:07,455
Use the dagger if you want.

666
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,936
Came for a brain game
but now forced to use the body.

667
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,072
It's a part of the game, too.

668
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,340
Beat him to death!

669
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,652
I'll have to let you
play alone, Player.

670
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,273
What the hell!

671
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,115
Hold on tight!

672
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:04,101
SPIN AROUND ATTACK:
ATTACKING BY SERIES OF FATAL MOVES

673
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,478
The rule is simple.

674
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,114
Only winner can get out.

675
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,456
What's all this about?.

676
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,226
Let's play a quick game
as it's cold in here.

677
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:33,172
You should play a move before
the sandglass is done. After you.

678
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,440
Come on!

679
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,983
Look at the winter swagger
frozen to death.

680
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,088
Look at the true dandy
stabbed to death!

681
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:09,796
This is case of life and death.
Only one point to make the stones live.

682
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,140
That's the padlock code.

683
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,875
I need a drink.
A warm one.

684
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,516
You look terrible.

685
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,357
How about playing a game?.

686
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,357
For fun or for a bet?.

687
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,300
Well, you'll get more fun
by betting on something.

688
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,507
So what should be the bet?.

689
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,608
Granting a wish?.

690
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,212
Too childish.

691
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,451
Childish, but of tradition.

692
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,897
The board is unique.
Are they goddesses?.

693
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:45,424
Goddess of fortune and
goddess of destruction.

694
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:51,500
- Which one's for me?.
- Destruction suits you better.

695
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,339
The width of board is 45cm.

696
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:59,514
The perfect distance
to share feelings.

697
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,741
How can people
share the feelings?.

698
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,977
It would be more like
making you mine.

699
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,020
Dansoo.

700
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,048
I won't be easy.

701
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,053
Good move.

702
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,767
I was just lucky.

703
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,038
Be careful making a wish.

704
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,253
You're definitely
getting my attention.

705
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,414
How about playing a game?.

706
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,425
It'd be exciting
to put our lives as bet.

707
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,828
I like it.
Can't wait to see you.

708
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:23,565
I left you a gift
at the calligraphy academy.

709
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,192
Also turn off the freezer.

710
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,200
And open the cabinet.

711
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,194
Open the cabinet!

712
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,714
Untie him.

713
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:55,018
What took you so long?.
Hurry!

714
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,057
Log on with ID: Master Wong
PW: QWER34

715
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,967
Boss, I saw him!

716
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,001
Sit here.

717
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,077
Let go of me, bastards.

718
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,713
What's going on?.
I didn't do anything!

719
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:15,479
Player forced me to do it!
I didn't steal the money!

720
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,592
AII in with 6M. I only need
his tongue in exchange.

721
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:27,562
Do not listen to him.
I'll pay off the shortfall.

722
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,298
We're partners!

723
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,732
Don't be fooled by him!

724
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,533
CARPE DIEM requested a game.
Press ACCEPT or DECLINE.

725
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:40,401
Please, don't do this to me!

726
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:42,707
Accept it.

727
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,844
It's a trap!

728
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,144
I told you to accept.

729
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:55,821
Good, I will crush this bastard!

730
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,339
Got a cigarette?.

731
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:46,699
Do you know why I like GO
of all the games?.

732
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:52,206
Because it's a brain game.
Petty skills don't work.

733
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,617
It's the smart ones who win.

734
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,484
Isn't it beautifully simple?.

735
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:06,324
Give me some water, assholes!

736
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,991
Point counting requested.

737
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,932
Accept.

738
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:54,902
Congratulations!
The White won by half a territory.

739
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,408
Still going over the game?.

740
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,779
Turn the board around.

741
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,615
Turn the board around.

742
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:13,120
See a hole?.
It's called blood flow.

743
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,559
A hole to fill with the blood
from the kibitzer's tongue.

744
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:26,298
Please, I will get him.
I promise!

745
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,699
I will get him to you!

746
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:36,149
I' ll get him!
Please don't do that!

747
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,363
Out of mouth comes evil.

748
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,870
I can see the sign board
is missing a Ietter.

749
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:38,646
It smells fantastic!
Is it cooked yet?.

750
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:41,513
Come on, Big Move!
Let's have some feast!

751
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,744
Do you guys know
why I play GO?.

752
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:50,985
Confucius once said, ""It's better
to play GO than to play nothing."

753
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,689
You should listen to the sages.

754
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:02,335
Christ, how could you become such a
master when you can see nothing at all?.

755
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,270
Share us the secrets!

756
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,533
I saw behind others' backs.

757
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:19,018
Seriously, come on!
I want to know the secret!

758
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:24,183
When I was selling junks
on the street,

759
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,624
someone came to me.

760
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:31,659
He told me he'd seen me before.
And invited me to play GO.

761
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:36,204
I told him I couldn't play
because I'm blind.

762
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,365
Then he gave me a present.

763
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,541
Stone checkers for the blind.

764
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:46,410
Since that day,
we played GO every day.

765
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,818
He was a true master.
A real one.

766
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:55,154
And after exactly one year,
he stopped showing up.

767
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:02,185
He might be the one who
let me know about you.

768
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,357
Have you seen him?.

769
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,301
No.

770
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,907
When I was in the solitary cell,

771
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:17,367
we used to play GO
over the wall. I lost every time.

772
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,582
Who's there?.
Tell me who you are!

773
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:36,564
But there was no chalk trace

774
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:39,167
in his cell.

775
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:44,839
It's simple.
He never marked anything.

776
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:47,103
You mean he played
the blind game?.

777
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:52,780
He played the entire game in his head
and beat the pro?. Can't be true.

778
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:58,082
I heard that
there's one in Busan.

779
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:03,350
They call him the Ghost.

780
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,323
Ghost?.

781
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:25,947
Cheater, do you have a minute?.
Please do me a favor.

782
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,283
I won't shop drinks for you.

783
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,614
I quit drinking.

784
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,922
Why don't you tell me
you can see things now?.

785
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,389
What do you want?.

786
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:52,465
Christ, you're damn good looking!
You blushed.

787
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:55,775
It's too funny.

788
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:14,658
Oh my God!
Chicks will be all over you!

789
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:22,003
Don't worry too much.

790
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,334
Your daughter must be glad.

791
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,742
Well... it seems like
we need some running.

792
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:44,584
This way!

793
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,529
Wait.

794
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,694
You damn bastard.

795
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,171
Not today!
It's a big day for us!

796
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,410
Bring it on!

797
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,621
WEAK GROUP: ENDANGERED STONES
CHASED BY THE OPPONENT

798
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:19,389
Life is full of surprises
that we meet again like this.

799
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,290
I prepared a fun game.

800
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:30,038
One of my men died
because he couldn't solve

801
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,062
this life and death question.

802
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,903
You will have three moves.

803
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:40,410
Can I play seated?.
Seems like my toes have broken.

804
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,088
Game on.

805
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,569
Two moves left.

806
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,417
Please have mercy.

807
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,282
Game on again.

808
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:45,742
The last move.

809
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:11,865
Please, I beg you.

810
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,004
Guess it's your luck day.

811
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:31,819
Rest in peace, my Iove.

812
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:37,565
I recognize you now.
Thought you're dead.

813
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:41,501
I was dead, but born again.
Now I'll change your fate, too.

814
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:46,806
The bet is 6M on top of
your buddy's head.

815
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,210
Can't wait to see
who will win.

816
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,380
Try your damn best, as we have
the gallery. Your life is on it.

817
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:02,413
How about betting
my life instead of his?.

818
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,023
Christ...

819
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:09,622
Cheer up.
Let's have a drink after this game.

820
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:18,632
But I don't have tools
for the blind here.

821
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,073
I will play the blind GO.

822
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:27,715
No, Christ, you shouldn't!

823
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:28,682
Blind GO?.

824
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:33,350
No, you can't!

825
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:39,884
- You should help me.
- Christ, please don't!

826
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,624
Playing a blind game?.

827
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,862
Why?.
You can't beat a blind man?.

828
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:58,174
I'll show mercy to end
your life as fast as I can.

829
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:03,973
Flower point on upper left corner.

830
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:18,197
Strong opening for an old man.
Quite provocative.

831
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,715
Low 3-4 point on lower left corner.

832
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:38,742
Can't fight back
against the elderly.

833
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:43,881
Let me dodge.

834
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,885
Opposite 3-4 point
on upper right corner.

835
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,162
Flower point on lower right corner.

836
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:55,401
Declaring the war?.

837
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,533
Right 3-4 point on upper right corner.

838
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,912
I don't want to fight.

839
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:08,871
I will cut your throat if I win.

840
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,517
Knight's approach
on upper right corner.

841
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:22,519
Don't fight back.
Large Knight on upper right corner.

842
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:31,201
Whatever you wish,
I will go my own way.

843
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:34,231
Large Knight stretched
on lower left corner.

844
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,476
Lower Pincer by 3 spaces
on upper right corner.

845
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:43,716
You scared me,
I will run away.

846
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,379
Center, cover the cap.

847
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:55,218
On 1 0 and 1 0.
Dodge.

848
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,087
He's the one who struggles,
not us.

849
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:03,938
Diamond on the zenith.

850
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,771
Choke lower side by a territory.

851
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:12,273
Knight's move
on right side of center. Attack now.

852
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:19,576
Knight's move
on left side of center.

853
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:32,456
On 1 4 and1 3. Cut it!

854
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:45,312
Got him!
We got him!

855
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:47,803
You're a dead meat, motherfucker!

856
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:54,185
On 7 and 7

857
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,720
- He just cut it.
- Move forward!

858
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:02,257
Better be prepared to die.

859
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:52,507
How come a scumbag like you
could play like that?.

860
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,173
Quite nice moves
for a blind man.

861
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,613
Listen, Cheater.

862
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,722
The world isn't a playground for me.

863
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:14,190
I'm sorry.
The drinks should wait.

864
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:39,656
Go over the game
in your grave.

865
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:10,153
Drinking Christ is nailed
to the board, sorry.

866
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:15,830
If you win the game,
I will spare your friend's life.

867
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:21,894
Big Move...Do not worry.
I can't make it anyway.

868
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:27,237
- I will come back.
- No, don't!

869
01:37:56,003 --> 01:38:02,033
Don't play the game.
You can't win.

870
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:10,949
He can't be beaten. The moves
are too supple to capture.

871
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:19,793
It must be a kid playing.
An innocent one.

872
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:43,842
Better do your best
if you want a happy ending.

873
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:47,342
Spare the kid out of this.

874
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:53,288
- Kill them both if I lose.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:01,357
How many handicaps you'd take
playing against god of GO?.

876
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:02,532
Two.

877
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,934
- If your life's on it?.
- Three.

878
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:12,936
If there's a god of GO,
it must be a child, isn't it?.

879
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,475
Stop here.

880
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:19,682
- Are you worried of me?.
- You can never win.

881
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:35,935
LIFE AND DEATH:
CROSSROAD OF LIVING AND DYING

882
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:01,692
Kill the Carpenter.

883
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:17,469
Same provocation as the blind man.

884
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:29,853
3-3 point?.
Crawling from the first move?.

885
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:31,791
Cover on the flower point.

886
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:47,997
Double 3-3 point?.
You don't want to win.

887
01:40:56,150 --> 01:41:00,314
Care for a fight by now?.

888
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:10,287
You should go with us.

889
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:15,832
Let me think
if there's a way out for me.

890
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:23,107
Life and death
is always difficult.

891
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:28,639
That's why it always causes the fight.

892
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:34,017
Let's see who lives
and who dies.

893
01:41:35,222 --> 01:41:39,716
You'll regret it.
'Cause I'll make you die in pain.

894
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:18,093
Are you throwing a stone,
or making a move?.

895
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:19,363
It's a move.

896
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:25,934
Do you know
she dies if you win?.

897
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:37,648
Don't even think about it.
What're you waiting for?.

898
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:23,021
On 8 and 1 0, cap on center.
Attack.

899
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:58,762
He made the losing move.
On 1 and 2, move forward.

900
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:09,742
On 3 and 3, connect.

901
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:24,853
On 4 and 1.
Bend.

902
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:38,672
It's Eternal Life.
We're even.

903
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:40,435
We can play forever
or you can yield.

904
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:59,353
What if I don't want to yield?.

905
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:05,124
Then we're even.

906
01:45:11,204 --> 01:45:14,799
Being even isn't part of my plan.

907
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,277
Then we should
fight a final match.

908
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:26,180
It gets interesting.
Can't get any better than this.

909
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,447
Bring that bitch.

910
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:41,123
How do we try conclusion?.

911
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:47,874
Have you seen all the stones
on the board get captured?.

912
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:50,968
Take a close look.
You'll witness that.

913
01:47:08,722 --> 01:47:10,757
Wearing a protection?.

914
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:12,987
How manly...

915
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:50,940
COUNTING: CALL VICTORY AND DEFEAT
AFTER THE GAME

916
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:53,407
I worked for your father.

917
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:57,010
He left something for you.

918
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:27,480
How have you been?.

919
01:51:37,457 --> 01:51:44,021
Keep this.
And call me three times a day.

920
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:07,380
Isn't it too cold to work outside?.

921
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:14,225
My hands don't feel cold.

922
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:17,397
Christ once asked me

923
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:19,592
if there's a divine move in life.

924
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:25,069
I now understand
there's never such a move.

925
01:52:25,472 --> 01:52:31,240
The best move we can make
is surviving every day.

926
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:40,540
Where are we heading now?.

927
01:53:41,347 --> 01:53:42,405
To Busan.

928
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:57,127
THE DIVINE MOVE
Life and Death
