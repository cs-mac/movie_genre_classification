1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,621
Did you guys hear
what happened to Mary Ellen Tobin?

2
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,172
Total humiliation.

3
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:54,646
She found out that her boyfriend
is part Italian.

4
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,276
I bet I know which part, too.

5
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,780
I've always wondered.
What are you, Kate?

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,626
Me?

7
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,840
Erm, we're New Yorkers, originally.

8
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:25,958
Well, Miffy tells me that the two of you
room together at Radcliffe.

9
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,293
Five iron.

10
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,630
I was at Harvard Law.
I'm very surprised we never met.

11
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:35,889
Well, I just transferred last year
from Michigan.

12
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:40,227
I knew someone
who once went to Michigan.

13
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,447
I think it was our maid.

14
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,213
Kate, I am just kidding.

15
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:06,579
- Outstanding.
- Marvellous.

16
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,498
Marvellously outstanding.

17
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,886
Kate.

18
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:19,056
Caddy, could you please run
and get me a diet root beer?

19
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:23,691
Er... The nearest soda machine
is way back at the snack bar.

20
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:26,663
Er, yeah,
I know where the soda machine is.

21
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,256
Snotty little bitch.
I may never come back.

22
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,392
I know you thlnk

23
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,698

00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:58,091
Back to the shack

27
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,728
Huh, huh, yeah

28
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,442
And nothlng sults me better than that

29
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:08,408
If tlme has taught me anythlng

30
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,578
Got to learn to be the ball

31
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:19,633
And I can't keep
from laughlng at It all

32
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,094
I'm gonna laugh

33
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:24,441
I'm golng all the way

34
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:28,356
Sooner or later gotta love somebody

35
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,996
Don't care how long It takes

36
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:36,666
You can turn up the heat
But I'm playlng It cool

37
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:40,139
I know It's hard to belleve
I aln't nobody's fool

38
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:44,019
- I'm golng all the way
- All the way

39
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,937
- Sooner or later gotta love somebody
- I don't care

40
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:51,411
Don't care how long It takes...

41
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,163
Ah, good morning, Mr and Mrs Mannings.

42
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,172
I've not gone to school

43
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,920
Baby, Ilke It or not
I aln't nobody's fool

44
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,514
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

45
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,438
Yeah.

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,288
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. Pardon me. No, no!

47
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:15,667
My halluclnatlon

48
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,420
May come as some surprlse

49
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:23,091
You may try to deny It

50
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:28,023
You're amazed when the clown
slaps you In the face

51
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:33,867
Leaves you dumbfounded there
In hls way, yeah

52
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,418
- I'm golng all the way
- Yeah

53
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:41,466
- Sooner or later gotta love somebody
- Love somebody

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,301
Don't care how long It takes

55
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:49,522
Llke a shock to the heart
I've got news for you

56
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:53,325
Maybe I'm not so smart
But I'm nobody's fool

57
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:58,001
- I'm golng all the way
- Oh, yeah

58
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,627
Hup. Excuse me.

59
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:06,596
- I'm golng all the way
- I'm nobody's fool, baby...

60
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,150
One diet root beer.

61
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,666
This... was really good.

62
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:23,964
Thank you.

63
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:34,402
I won't be a caddy all my life. I'm
going to car-wash school in the fall.

64
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,743
Back to work.

65
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,306
Ah-ha.

66
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,673
Why don't you girls run along
and I'll take care of the caddies?

67
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,594
- Thank you, Todd.
- Great round, Kate.

68
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,185
Thanks.

69
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,276
All right, hunchbacks, listen up.

70
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:20,703
The club recently purchased 50
Cushman electric Golf Master golf carts,

71
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,044
which means that once they're delivered

72
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:26,426
your services as caddies
will no longer be required.

73
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:29,048
Does this mean that we're fired?

74
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,310
That's very good.

75
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,981
Pass it on to your brethren, won't you?

76
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,190
Just so there are no hard feelings

77
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:40,243
I'll see what I can do
about letting you keep those coveralls.

78
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,705
Why don't you ask your father
to join Bushwood?

79
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:50,549
Imagine how much fun we could have.
All the tournaments we could win.

80
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,643
Oh, that would be great.
I would love that.

81
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,697
But I'm not sure
how my father would feel about it.

82
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,035
Oh. Well, maybe if he saw how dignified
and elegant everything is here...

83
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,542
Dignified and elegant.

84
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,843
Yeah. He'd fit right in.

85
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,978
Well, make up your mind.
You want to play or you want to fold?

86
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:20,066
Either you play or fold. If you're not
gonna play or fold, you're gonna sit.

87
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:23,789
Between me and you,
there's more comfortable places to sit.

88
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,293
Hello. Did you pass away?

89
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,128
Come on, hurry up. I'm talking to you.
Are you still living?

90
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,675
Blink twice if you can see me.

91
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:46,333
I should call you. Low-life phoneys
is what I should call you.

92
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,878
I'm out.

93
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,606
How do you like that?
Wiped out again.

94
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:02,948
What are you doing gambling on a
job site anyway? I should fire you all.

95
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:06,083
I'm gonna do something better.
Make you go back to work.

96
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:08,966
OK, sweetheart, blow the whistle.

97
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,031
For 20 years
he thinks I speak Spanish.

98
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:28,497
- You don't speak Spanish?
- No, but I listen fluently.

99
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:32,299
God bless him. He gives that
cockamamie Spanish hell, doesn't he?

100
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:35,005
- His cheques don't bounce.
- You got that right.

101
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:38,975
Jack, why do you let him win?

102
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:41,518
- How did you know?
- I saw your hand.

103
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,780
You had him beat. You had a full house.

104
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:46,154
I got a full house.
He had a real full house.

105
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,664
Every time I walk in there
I see 24 kids.

106
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,587
You're a soft touch.

107
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,090
Don't tell him that.
I don't want him to know.

108
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:56,723
If he thinks I'm a wonderful person
he'll try to become my partner.

109
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,597
- Hello. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jack.

110
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,860
Take chances, I'm insured.

111
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:06,575
What the hell is happening down there?

112
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,365
You in that tractor!
Can you hear me?

113
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,213
Not those people again!

114
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:15,009
I told them, you want to save a crummy
house that's about to fall down,

115
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,216
come over to my place.

116
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:22,770
Sometimes I'm tempted to say "To hell
with it, it's not my field".

117
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,742
But this is your field.

118
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,872
You bought this field. And that field.

119
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,077
You must be worth about $50 million.

120
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,134
It's nobody's business.
I'm worth a lot more than that.

121
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,551
- See you downstairs.
- Wait for me.

122
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:39,139
Let me talk to 'em. I hate those people!

123
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,929
Then hurry up.

124
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:47,740
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
This is private property.

125
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,539
Please let me handle this.
It requires a little diplomacy and tact.

126
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,673
Lady, please, get lost.

127
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:59,016
People are working. Can't you see that?
You look like you never had a job.

128
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:02,477
- Mr Hartounian, I presume?
- Yes.

129
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,480
We represent
the Historical Preservation Society.

130
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,358
I have a temporary injunction...

131
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:11,411
restraining you from demolishing any
structures on the Armstrong Estate...

132
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,582
until the City Planning Commission
rules on our appeal.

133
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,087
What are you talking about?
This is nothing but an old dump!

134
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:22,638
This building is over 70 years old.
It's part of our heritage.

135
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:26,477
What are you talking about?
This is a garage, can't you see that?

136
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,070
Do you come from
a long line of mechanics?

137
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,780
It was a carriage house.

138
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:34,619
It's one of the original buildings
on what was the Armstrong Estate,

139
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,461
the property line of which
ran down to this brook.

140
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:39,588
Does this look like a brook to you?

141
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:42,215
This is not a brook, lady,
this is a sewer.

142
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,679
Originally it was a brook.

143
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Originally your family comes from
monkeys. What's that got to do with it?

144
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:53,498
This property has been laying here,
dead, for 25 years, do you know that?

145
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,085
All of a sudden, I buy it,

146
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:58,715
I try to put up some decent housing
that working people can afford,

147
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,883
and what do I get? A historical society.

148
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:04,222
Out the bullshit!

149
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,562
You can't stand working people
living in this neighbourhood.

150
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,030
I'm not going to argue with you. If you
want us to move you'll have to move us.

151
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,254
No problem. Rayette!

152
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,505
Let's go!

153
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,555
Come on! Come on!

154
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,311
Run!

155
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:33,610
I run and I run and I run and I run

156
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,537
I can't stay away, darlln'

157
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:41,999
I run and I run
and I run and I run...

158
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,639
Look, Pop, if someone asks you,

159
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:49,806
we winter in the Bahamas, somewhere in
the Hamptons and don't mention Jersey.

160
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,317
I'm only doing this because I love you.
That's the only reason.

161
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:56,409
If it was up to me,
I'd rather have a hernia operation.

162
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,045
Come on, Pop, joining Bushwood
is something you should want to do.

163
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:04,425
You worked hard for what you've got.
You deserve the best country club.

164
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,811
This is the best?
They're a bunch of snobs, that's all.

165
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:10,980
Look at the names of their kids.
You ever hear their names?

166
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:13,105
This and this Junior and The First.

167
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,863
The Second, The Third,
The Fifth, The Sixth.

168
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,168
They're brilliant! They can't even
think of a name for a kid.

169
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,300
It's not fair to condemn them
because they have roots.

170
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,472
They got roots like an oak tree. We
got roots. We got roots like a radish.

171
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:33,067
I don't want to be a radish all my life.
So, please, Pop, just try.

172
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,918
- Kate!
- Hi!

173
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,962
Hi.

174
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,185
Er, Daddy,
I'd like you to meet my friend Miffy.

175
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:54,777
Miffy? Miffy, that's a cute name.

176
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,697
I knew a girl in school once,
we called her Muffy.

177
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:00,584
Probably for different reasons.

178
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:04,580
She was an ugly girl. She had a
coming-out party, they made her go back.

179
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,294
They made her...

180
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,058
Well, shall we go?

181
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,807
Todd's waiting on the patio with
a scrumptious junk bonds salesman.

182
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:17,868
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Good luck. Have a good time.

183
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,405
- Bye.
- Goodbye, girls.

184
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,876
Kate, I am so sorry. I had no idea
what you were going through at home.

185
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,383
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean your father.

186
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:30,516
- My father?
- He isn't your real father, is he?

187
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,240
I'll get that for you, sir.

188
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,824
- Are you expected?
- Why, does it show?

189
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:08,124
You look like a sick man.
I don't want to give you any problems.

190
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,504
I'm looking for Ty Webb.

191
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,371
The room that time forgot.

192
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,496
Mr Webb, your guest.

193
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:29,468
- Jack!
- I see you're working hard, as usual.

194
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,596
You know how it is. Managing
a large inheritance is a full-time job.

195
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:37,515
The lawyers and accountants
send me a lot of things.

196
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:42,403
Got to sign things. A lot of work for
a measly couple of million bucks a year.

197
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,744
I was born with a wooden spoon
in my mouth.

198
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,916
Hm. Must have been hard on your mother.

199
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,801
How's business?
Still building those apartments?

200
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,718
Yeah, yeah,
mostly middle and low-income housing.

201
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,057
No money in it,
but I sleep well at night.

202
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:58,854
That's interesting.
I sleep well during the daytime.

203
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,239
Where, in a cat box?
You look terrible.

204
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,375
I got it.

205
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,508
There you are.
Who built this thing anyway?

206
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,067
I'll be right with you, Jack.

207
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:32,962
You know me, I believe a healthy life
needs a balance between work and play.

208
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:36,099
Give and take. In and out. Yin and Yang.

209
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,637
I heard you get more Yang
than you can handle.

210
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:41,978
- Hey, Ty, you're looking well.
- Hey, nice to see you, Vinny.

211
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:44,274
- Er, Ted.
- Whatever.

212
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,204
What you going to do
with all those hearts?

213
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,998
Ty! Damn!

214
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,590
Seven of diamonds.
Keep that queen of spades.

215
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,714
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

216
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,101
- He's ruined the entire hand.
- So you want to join Bushwood?

217
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:03,018
It's for my daughter's sake.
Me, I couldn't care less.

218
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,157
This place is what the world would have
looked like if the Germans had won.

219
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,830
Well, lucky for us, the Japanese won.

220
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:12,798
I guess I should introduce you
to some of the members.

221
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:16,131
- Do you have to?
- Take it easy, Jack.

222
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:19,849
You just relax.
The important thing is to be yourself.

223
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:22,272
And of course, lose the accent.

224
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:24,728
What accent?

225
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:29,071
Jack Hartounian, I'd like you to meet
some of the oldest members.

226
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,996
- Mr Foreskin.
- Forrester.

227
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,503
Forrester. And Mr Crabs.

228
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,511
And Mr Wrinkle.

229
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,427
- That's Winkler.
- Winkler. And Mr er...

230
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:44,057
- Or is it Mrs?
- Jamison.

231
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,734
Jamison, that's right. Mrs Jamison.

232
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,704
- Oh, there you are, Ty.
- Hello, Chandler.

233
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:51,658
- I was looking for...
- PoliGrip?

234
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,751
- No, no...
- Condom machine?

235
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,420
- No.
- That blue stuff you put your combs in?

236
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,844
I was looking for a Mr Hartounian.

237
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,765
Hartounian? In this club?

238
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,938
Oh, you mean Jack? Here he is.

239
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:06,571
- Hello.
- How do you do?

240
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,784
- I'm Miffy's father. Chandler Young.
- Chandler Young?

241
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:12,703
I'm at a disadvantage.
I only have one last name.

242
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,376
And quite an interesting
last name it is.

243
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:18,380
- Hartounian?
- What is your background?

244
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:21,172
My background? My father was Armenian.

245
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,231
My mother was half Jewish,
half English, half Spanish.

246
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,398
- That's three halves.
- Oh, she was a big woman.

247
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,537
I thought you should meet Chandler.
He's the club president.

248
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:36,001
You can play golf with him.
If that goes well, a cocktail or two,

249
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,422
and er, maybe some light petting later.

250
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,723
I'll leave that up to you, Chandler.
Well, I got a thing.

251
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,014
He's a little strange.

252
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:54,994
Elizabeth.

253
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,453
- Oh.
- Jack, this is Elizabeth Pearce.

254
00:18:57,674 --> 00:18:59,713
Hi, Jack. I sure like your suit.

255
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:02,336
Thank you.
You're a real nice-looking person.

256
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,229
- Thank you.
- I'll come back when you're dressed.

257
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,274
That's all right. I was just going to
get dressed. Real pleased to meet you.

258
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,697
Wait a minute.
Look what I did. I'm sorry.

259
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,454
It's OK.

260
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:18,377
Oh, is that where that goes? Most women
put that in a different location.

261
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,548
I don't need any there.

262
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,381
I've asked Elizabeth and my wife
to join us to make it a foursome.

263
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:28,733
I wouldn't mind if it's a foursome,
or two twosomes, or four onesomes.

264
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:33,820
And this is my wife. Cynthia.

265
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,530
Oh, oh. Hello, hello.

266
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,329
Hello.

267
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,838
Oh, no, absolutely not.
It's out of the question.

268
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,051
I refuse to play golf with this man.

269
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,264
Then I take it you've met?

270
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:51,321
This is the man who is trying
to destroy our community.

271
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,988
It was just a little disagreement
the other day.

272
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:55,662
Little?!

273
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,447
He tried to run me over
with a steam roller.

274
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,672
What steam roller?
Bulldozer. It was a bulldozer.

275
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:09,141
I really have to apologise to you. I was
wrong. I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

276
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:11,268
Darling, a word.

277
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,729
Excuse us for a moment.

278
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,825
Jack, let's get our clubs.

279
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:19,123
- Let's not make a scene.
- The man tried to kill me.

280
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,875
I'm sure he had his reasons.
The fact is he's here.

281
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:25,509
- I promised Miffy we'd play.
- It's funny running into Mrs Young.

282
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:28,477
I bet the first time was funnier.
Sorry I missed that.

283
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,355
Besides, this is an opportunity
for you to save the Armstrong Estate.

284
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:36,904
You can catch more flies with honey.

285
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,199
Mm.

286
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:41,621
I'm not going to run some
heavy equipment into a girl like you.

287
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,797
How sweet.

288
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,588
- Yeah?
- Yes.

289
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:48,048
So, everybody happy now?

290
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:52,018
- This should be fun, don't you think?
- I don't see how.

291
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,275
You're the guest.
You have the honour.

292
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:58,322
I'm only here 15 minutes and already
they want to give me honours.

293
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,578
I must be making a good impression.

294
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,915
You are, Jack. That means
they want you to tee off. Good luck.

295
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,588
Oh. Here goes.

296
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,433
Well, this'll be it.

297
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,396
Here we go.

298
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,864
Now!

299
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:31,726
Interesting club.
What would you call that?

300
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,933
It's a twelve-gauge.

301
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,434
Twelve-gauge.

302
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,588
Out of ammunition, Mr Hartounian?

303
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,881
A friend of mine at NASA sent me this.

304
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,638
I'm surprised
that you bother coming out at all.

305
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,806
Surely you could develop a gadget that
would allow you to sit in the club house

306
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,525
and punch buttons all day.

307
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,901
I got a friend working on that, too.

308
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,135
Doesn't that take
some of the sport out of it?

309
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:18,190
Not at all. Things could go wrong.
Batteries could go low, get static.

310
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,405
Anything could happen. Sometimes
the signal interferes with a pacemaker.

311
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,948
Edward! Edward!

312
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,457
Edward, are you all right?

313
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,238
- Bingo!
- Bango!

314
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,878
I feel all right now.

315
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,129
Must have been that chilidog.

316
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:53,881
He wants to become a member of Bushwood.
Can you imagine that?

317
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,806
With him around I can imagine anything.

318
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:04,195
So er... what would you say on my
chances of becoming a member here?

319
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,620
Well, thatjust may depend on you, Jack.

320
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,875
This is a lovely neighbourhood.

321
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,092
People hate to see it mucked up
with cheap apartments.

322
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:15,639
I can't tell you your business,
but you know what they say.

323
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:20,103
One hand washes the other.
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

324
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:23,441
You wouldn't want to disappoint
your daughter, would you?

325
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:26,198
- There's Daddy.
- Oh, hi.

326
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:33,130
- I certainly wouldn't.
- Why don't we get you an application?

327
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:35,802
Leave the real-estate business
to the lawyers.

328
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:39,187
If you want to leave it to the lawyers,
we'll leave it to them.

329
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,438
But remember, it was your idea.

330
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:46,983
I didn't go to one of those big, fancy
law schools like you did, Mr Pierpont.

331
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:50,162
So you're going to have
to explain something to me.

332
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:53,131
How in the world do you expect

333
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:57,177
Mr Hartounian to voluntarily
stop building on that site

334
00:23:57,392 --> 00:24:00,265
and move this entire housing project
somewhere else?

335
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,522
I don't see it.

336
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:05,276
Because, sir, he'll have no choice.

337
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,909
Let me explain how the legal system
really works.

338
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,328
OK.

339
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:14,168
You see, Mr Blunt, if your client
doesn't voluntarily cease and desist

340
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:19,013
we'll be forced to go through the long
and very costly process of injunctions,

341
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:22,895
law suits, motions, counter motions,
hearings, appeals...

342
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,356
Which will cost you so much
in legal fees and construction delays

343
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:32,282
you'll wish you'd never heard
of the Historical Preservation Society.

344
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:37,798
Because there's no way in hell we'd let
you come barging into Bushwood Estates

345
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:42,146
and throw up a lot of cheap housing
for blue-collar trash.

346
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,062
Which one of you
is Chandler Young's son?

347
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,481
I am.

348
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:53,202
You've certainly made it clear how
your legal system works, Mr Young.

349
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:57,254
Now I'd like to explain a little bit
about the Peter Blunt system.

350
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:03,761
You see... I don't go in
for... law suits and motions

351
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:05,726
or any of that legal stuff.

352
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:10,278
No, no, see what happens is
I find out where you live

353
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:13,664
and then I come to your house, see,

354
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:19,256
and I... beat down your door
with a fuckin' baseball bat!

355
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:23,389
And then I'm gonna make a bonfire
with the Chippendale,

356
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:26,358
maybe roast that golden retriever,

357
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,107
then eat it!

358
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:31,365
Then I'm coming upstairs, junior,

359
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:34,665
and I'm gonna grab you
by your Brooks Brothers PJs

360
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:40,086
and I'm gonna take your brand-new BMW
and cram it up your tight ass!

361
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,178
Do we have an understanding?

362
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:50,936
- So, Martha, is he in?
- He's in a meeting.

363
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,786
Now get the hell outta here before
I really get mad and hurt somebody.

364
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,959
- I tried to sweet talk them.
- So I heard.

365
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:07,183
I don't think they went for it. We're
not allowed to build on Bushwood Estates

366
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,773
until we get
the planning commission ruling.

367
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,481
- We have to have a hearing.
- A hearing?

368
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:16,323
Do me a favour, don't try to sweet talk
the planning commission, OK?

369
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,461
Jack, have a little faith
in your lawyer.

370
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:21,880
Faith in a lawyer.

371
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:32,321
- That was great, Daddy.
- It really was, Mr Young.

372
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:35,322
Thanks, Kate. he's coming along nicely.

373
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:39,289
Jumping a fine horse is a special blend
of strength, courage and grace.

374
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,295
It's a beautiful thing to watch
when it's done right.

375
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,050
Slow down. Slow down.

376
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:48,020
- Elizabeth, where's the brake?
- Next to the clutch.

377
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,639
Slow down. Easy, easy.

378
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,776
Son of a bitch! You go this fast again,
I'll send you back to the beer truck.

379
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:56,618
Whoa! Dog Food!

380
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,835
Daddy. What are you doing here?

381
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,373
I asked him.

382
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,261
Oh, Kate, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, my daughter Kate.

383
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,381
Oh, Kate, I'm so happy to meet you.

384
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,687
Hello. I can't believe
I'm seeing you on a horse.

385
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:12,141
He tells me he's been around
horses for years?

386
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,188
Betting on them, not riding them.

387
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,448
You want me to be a gentleman.
They ride.

388
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,748
- Not like that they don't.
- Quite an entrance, Jack.

389
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,331
For a moment, I was afraid
you might fall and break your neck.

390
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,838
Or your arm. Maybe strike your head
against a fence post.

391
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:30,642
Maybe be dragged several miles
over rough terrain.

392
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:35,273
Sweet of you to be concerned. So you're
not troubled by our lawyers' meeting.

393
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,864
No, not at all.

394
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,953
Care to take a few jumps?

395
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,086
I don't think he's quite ready
forjumping yet, do you?

396
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,958
Nonsense. Nothing to it.

397
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:48,762
Hold on tight, grip with your knees.
Let the animal do all the work.

398
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:52,014
Sounds like my wedding night.

399
00:27:56,615 --> 00:27:58,692
Your horse has quite a gas problem.

400
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:01,321
It's not the horse.

401
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,924
- Raise all the jumps.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,491
I mean this is crazy.
He could really get hurt.

403
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,742
Almost definitely, I'd say.

404
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:23,530
Stay behind me and do exactly as I do.

405
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:24,951
Go!

406
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,471
Ha!

407
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,854
Yee-ho!

408
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:45,790
A little higher next time. Higher!

409
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:50,918
You may want to urge him
a little more, Jack.

410
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:53,015
Come on.

411
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,484
Up, Prince.

412
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,773
This time, Dog Food, over it. Over it!

413
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,443
One more set ofjumps, Jack.
We'll make it an easy.

414
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:37,643
Having fun yet, Jack?

415
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:09,581
- Good evening, miss.
- Good evening, sir.

416
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,421
Pop. Daddy.

417
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,677
Did you have to wear that tux?

418
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:19,227
- Why, what's wrong with it?
- It's... blue.

419
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,562
It's notjust blue.
If you look at it this way it's purple.

420
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,153
If you look at it like this it's gold.

421
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,954
Beautiful, huh? Come on, sweetheart.

422
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:33,831
People here like their tuxedos black.

423
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:38,517
Sure. And they like their noses red,
their blood blue, their faces white.

424
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:43,607
Until they hire help and then they want
every face to be black, brown or yellow.

425
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:44,984
Isn't that amazing?

426
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,784
I'm not a hypocrite enough to go along
with a colour scheme like that.

427
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,371
Look, Pop, I don't expect
you to change all at once.

428
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,046
If you could just
turn down the volume a little.

429
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,883
I'm gonna introduce you to this guy
I really like,

430
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,558
so could you just pretend
you like everyone?

431
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:05,189
Pretend? I'm Jack Hartounian. I can't
pretend to like people I don't like.

432
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,815
Why are you so impressed
by these fonzanoons?

433
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:09,276
What's a fonzanoon?

434
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:12,662
A guy who farts in the bathtub
and bites the bubbles.

435
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:14,505
Nice. Pop, please don't...

436
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:18,218
Kate. I'm so glad you could make it.
This is for you.

437
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:20,971
- Thank you.
- That's a fonzanoon!

438
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:24,015
This is the person
I was telling you about.

439
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:27,025
Todd, I'd like you to meet my father,
Jack Hartounian.

440
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,530
- A pleasure, sir.
- Why do you look familiar?

441
00:31:29,746 --> 00:31:33,117
Because I'm suing you, sir.
Nothing personal, of course.

442
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:37,122
Nothing personal? You think your head
getting busted might be personal?

443
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:40,052
You think a broken nose
might be personal?

444
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:43,057
You think your head in a toilet bowl
might be personal?

445
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:45,481
Have a pig in a blanket.
I love yourjacket.

446
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:48,697
Doesn't he look nice, Todd?
Kate, it's always a pleasure.

447
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,236
Thank you.

448
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,780
Come with me, Jack. Just over here.

449
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,624
- He's a very funny man.
- Yeah, he's a riot.

450
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:00,469
Hey, look at this. Chandler.
You want to buy a horse?

451
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,439
Look who's here.

452
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:08,943
Cynthia.
You must be happy to see me, huh?

453
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:10,903
Of course.

454
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:19,289
Hello there. How are you?
What's happening?

455
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,551
Look at this conversation I just had.

456
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,980
It's great. It's the first time in here
that someone else got the cold shoulder.

457
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,278
Do you think I care?
I like to talk to myself. You know why?

458
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:31,862
I like to deal
with a better class of people.

459
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,918
I like that.

460
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:51,903
Do you rumba, samba, mambo-schmambo?

461
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:54,491
- I try to tango.
- That's close enough.

462
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:45,429
Kate, will you please look at your
father and my cousin dancing out there.

463
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,519
Excuse me.

464
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:46,134
Ha!

465
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,740
Boy, this is a tough room.

466
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:10,302
- What are you doing?
- Wow.

467
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,475
I was just practising.

468
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,311
In the dark?
How can you tell where the ball went?

469
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:20,156
You can't. Which is probably why
you don't see a lot of night golf.

470
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,243
How's the party going?

471
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:27,338
I see. Was it er... Was it that bad?

472
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,380
Harry... just by looking at me,

473
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,434
would you say that I was lower class,
middle class or upper class?

474
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:39,022
- You're being serious?
- Yes.

475
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,989
I would say... middle.

476
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,044
Upper maybe. Middle upper.

477
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:47,714
Definitely.

478
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:51,710
So what are you? I mean, at home,
when you're not doing the caddy thing?

479
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,222
Well, at home we happen to be
upper lower.

480
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:57,689
But when I'm away at school
I like to pretend I'm lower middle.

481
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:00,609
But what I aspire to become
is middle middle.

482
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,861
You're obsessed with class, aren't you?

483
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,409
I just want to fit in.

484
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,500
But around here it's so important
that you look a certain way,

485
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,595
you have the right friends
and join the right sorority.

486
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,647
Come on, Kate.
Joining the right sorority...

487
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:21,110
It's not important.

488
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:23,401
- You know who you remind me of?
- Who?

489
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:27,073
- My father.
- Guess that's better than your mother.

490
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:29,869
Attention, everyone!

491
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,713
It's time for our little slave auction.

492
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:35,052
Remember, it's all for charity,

493
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:40,610
so let's see if we can break
last year's record of $4,500.

494
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,658
Break out your chequebooks
and think Mandlngo

495
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,622
while I read the list
of this year's willing slaves.

496
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,457
What is this all about?

497
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:51,756
It's a game they play
when they feel guilty about being rich.

498
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,293
They auction off
the judge or chairperson,

499
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:58,811
and you buy them, take them home and
they sweep your floor, clean your garage

500
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:02,810
and afterwards you give them lunch
and a martini and it's very civilised.

501
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:06,034
Civilised. How do you do?
Nice to see you.

502
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:08,999
Jack. I'd like to have a word with you.

503
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,121
Hey, Chandler, how are you?

504
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,416
Mr Club President, how you been?

505
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:16,389
I'm having
the time of my life here.

506
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,683
- Everything is lovely, wonderful.
- Yes, it is. Here's the thing.

507
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,225
My wife and I spoke
to several of our members.

508
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:24,905
We feel that after tonight

509
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:28,369
it might be better if you
didn't visit the club for a while.

510
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:32,831
- What do you mean "for a while"?
- Ever, actually.

511
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,506
We just don't feel
you're Bushwood material.

512
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:41,396
The messy apartment business,
the attempt on Cynthia's life.

513
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,648
You understand, I'm sure.

514
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,606
I understand.

515
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:47,533
Good.

516
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:56,213
Our first society slave going up
for bids is the charming Cynthia Young.

517
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:05,817
So I thought we'd start the bidding
at erm... $50. Do I hear 50?

518
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,940
- $50.
- $100.

519
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,031
- 200.
- 250.

520
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:17,550
- 300.
- Do I hear 325?

521
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,720
- Very well, going once at 300.
- Come on.

522
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:23,392
- Going twice.
- 325.

523
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:29,319
- I thought he'd left.
- 325 is bid.

524
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,742
Do I hear 350?

525
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,921
Please!

526
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:38,505
- Daddy.
- Don't worry. 350!

527
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,000
400!

528
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:42,893
- 450!
- 500!

529
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,982
Finish him, Chandler.

530
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:54,281
510!

531
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:58,669
A thousand bucks!

532
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:02,253
I have a thousand dollars.

533
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,683
Do I hear more?

534
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:07,223
- Daddy.
- Very well, going once.

535
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:08,939
- Father, bid!
- Going twice.

536
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,945
- Chandler!
- What's he waiting for?

537
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,537
Please!

538
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:15,872
Well...

539
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:19,457
- Sold! $1,000 to Mr Hartounian.
- Why?

540
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:21,966
Ha.

541
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:28,059
- Do you want a tip?
- I want a tip.

542
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:30,151
Bend from the hip sockets.

543
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:34,067
If you can see your zipper...
you're screwed.

544
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,040
Hip sockets? OK.

545
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,084
Here?

546
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:41,332
- No.
- Here.

547
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:44,504
- Here.
- Here?

548
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:46,851
- No, here. Yeah.
- Oh.

549
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:49,223
- That's good.
- Kate!

550
00:39:52,032 --> 00:39:56,116
What is it you're doing out here?

551
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:59,039
- I'm just hitting some golf balls.
- Want to hit some?

552
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,581
- It's all in the hips.
- Oh, sure.

553
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,219
In my tuxedo,
without my glove or my spikes?

554
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:09,220
Aren't you an employee, and isn't
there some rule about how close

555
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:11,850
you're allowed to stand
to members and guests?

556
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:15,858
Yeah, I think it's 3.5 feet,
but only during working hours.

557
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,411
And if my memory serves, wise ass,
didn't I already fire you?

558
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:25,764
Yes, you did,
which is probably why I'm not working.

559
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:28,727
Kate, would you like to go back inside?

560
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:31,264
Actually, I think I might
go home from here.

561
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:37,245
Great idea. I'll drop you, and we can
stop at Bonny's. She's having a party.

562
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:39,414
Do you want to?

563
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,957
OK.

564
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:46,052
Thanks.

565
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:48,305
Thank you.

566
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,607
See you around.

567
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,735
Not around here, she won't.

568
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,745
$1,100 going once.

569
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,706
Someone, please.

570
00:41:03,924 --> 00:41:05,965
Going twice!

571
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:14,641
Sold, Mr Chandler Young for $1,100
once again to Mr Hartounian,

572
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:18,698
who has so graciously purchased
all of our society slaves tonight

573
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:23,708
for a grand total of $11,950.

574
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:28,505
I do hope you'll be able to find enough
little chores to keep us all busy.

575
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,883
I'll think of something.

576
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,590
Come on, guys, let's go!
We've got a lot of work to do.

577
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:54,474
I really hate this. Easy.

578
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,567
Oh, Jamison!

579
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,572
Hey, stupid, get out of there!
What are you, nuts?

580
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:05,462
- This is an outrage!
- Tell me about it.

581
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:09,091
I asked for labourers.
A labourer's a guy with big arms.

582
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:12,141
Bad teeth.
Just broke up with a waitress.

583
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,856
Hey, you're doin' a fine job.

584
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:44,204
Listen, a couple of us are going bowling
after work, suck down a couple of beers.

585
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:47,205
- Wanna come with us?
- Suck down a couple of beers.

586
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:50,590
Fine. Oh, excuse me... sir.

587
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:10,918
Hey, Jack, let me ask you a question.
How much did you pay for these people?

588
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:12,879
$11,900.

589
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:17,227
Well, you got burned. That old broad
can't carry lumber for shit.

590
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:19,811
All right, Hartounian,
you've had your fun.

591
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:22,104
What are you trying to prove with this?

592
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:24,033
I'm not trying to prove anything.

593
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:27,911
I want you and your friends to see
that people work hard for a living.

594
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,168
Don't tell me about hard work, mister.

595
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,789
I've cut more firewood
than you'll ever see.

596
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:36,715
It'll take more than you got
to break Chandler Young.

597
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:45,148
Chandler!

598
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:48,705
Chandler!

599
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,099
Chandler!

600
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,149
Hey, where's she goin'?
It's not even lunch time yet.

601
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,944
Chandler!

602
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,740
- All in favour?
- Aye!

603
00:44:06,953 --> 00:44:08,698
Opposed?

604
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:13,962
Then it's settled.
Jack Hartounian's finished in this city.

605
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,926
- PP, you handle the IRS.
- Uh-huh.

606
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:20,681
Contact the police, fire and utilities.

607
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:22,104
OK.

608
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,029
PM, go to work on his suppliers
and subcontractors.

609
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,905
Excuse me, gentlemen, but aren't we
being a little childish about this?

610
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:33,378
Is punishing this boob
really worth all this time and effort?

611
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,342
- Mm-hm.
- Yes. I think so.

612
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:39,474
Definitely. I'll tell you this.

613
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:42,937
He'll wish he never set foot
in this club.

614
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:46,273
Hard to say, huh?

615
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,241
How long do you think it'll be
before you get our power turned back on?

616
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:53,461
- What?
- Hard to say. I see.

617
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:56,044
Well, is it as hard to say as

618
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:59,928
"Oh, God, help me, there's a man
in my office with a flamethrower"?

619
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:02,812
- What's going on here?
- We got a problem.

620
00:45:03,022 --> 00:45:05,694
We got no cement, no lumber,
no steel, no nothing.

621
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,478
The building inspector
just pulled our permits.

622
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,156
- Where is the electricity?
- I'm working on it.

623
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:14,708
- There's a conspiracy.
- What are you telling me?

624
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:18,874
If you don't back off Bushwood Estates
they'll put us out of business.

625
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:20,805
That's what they think!

626
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:37,542
- Hi.
- Jack. Hi. Down here, reading.

627
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:40,166
Listen, I want to buy
Bushwood Country Club.

628
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:43,807
I made up my mind. I got to get even
with these sons of bitches.

629
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:47,060
Hold on a minute, Jack. Calm down.

630
00:45:48,197 --> 00:45:51,484
- You want to buy Bushwood from me?
- That's right. That's right.

631
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:54,862
Well, let me ask you this. Do I own it?

632
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:58,040
I checked it out.
You own 53 per cent of the stock.

633
00:45:58,257 --> 00:45:59,716
53 per cent?

634
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,766
Ah, good old Dad.

635
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,719
No flies on him.

636
00:46:05,564 --> 00:46:07,854
Very few on Mom as I recall.

637
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,941
Mom and Dad.
Well, they're gone now.

638
00:46:11,157 --> 00:46:15,205
- They passed away?
- No, no, Palm Beach.

639
00:46:15,415 --> 00:46:17,208
Wait a minute.

640
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,461
I'm sorry, I think they are dead.

641
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:22,337
Listen, I want to talk business.

642
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:24,762
All right, let's talk
over a game of golf.

643
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:27,646
- But you don't play golf anymore.
- I still play.

644
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,404
Just not outdoors. I finally got it down
to the absolute basic essentials.

645
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:40,453
Club... ball... and swing.

646
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,096
The rest is just walking round the park
wearing funny pants.

647
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:47,385
Is it safe to hit a ball in here?

648
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:49,931
Of course. It's a ballroom.

649
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,702
- Want a lift?
- Why not?

650
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:08,771
There's a tough dogleg
to the right up here.

651
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:12,731
- So do you want to sell, or what?
- Why are you so upset?

652
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:14,656
Because they insulted me.

653
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:18,818
First they shut down my building sites.
Then they cut off my power and phones.

654
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:21,036
- Pulled all my permits...
- Ouch!

655
00:47:21,254 --> 00:47:23,497
Let's look at it
from their point of view.

656
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,475
OK?

657
00:47:29,353 --> 00:47:31,348
I can't wait. I need an answer today.

658
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:34,486
Take it easy, Jack.
We're gonna have to negotiate.

659
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:38,649
There's gonna be phone calls, maybe
some mail. Talkin' mucho dlnero here.

660
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,793
And probably some American money, too.

661
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:49,515
A little chunky.

662
00:47:50,688 --> 00:47:53,726
I don't care what it costs. I want it.

663
00:47:53,945 --> 00:47:56,948
Mm-hm. Tough lie.

664
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:05,465
Jack, if I sell it, half the people
I grew up with won't speak to me again.

665
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,297
They don't speak to you now.

666
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:11,305
That's a very good point.

667
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,895
I'm gonna have to bank it
off the Chagall.

668
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:28,925
I topped it.

669
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:31,761
I topped it. Got a good bounce.

670
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:36,692
- It's in.
- Do we have a deal or not?

671
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:40,066
- Hm?
- Huh?

672
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,446
- Why not?
- Now you're talkin'.

673
00:48:44,085 --> 00:48:46,209
Do you have a twin sister?

674
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:51,678
Well, gentlemen, I think we've seen
the last of Mr Jack Hartounian.

675
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:56,108
I guess he learned a little something
about who calls the shots in this city.

676
00:48:58,406 --> 00:49:00,944
Wake up!

677
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,376
Now I know what they do with the bodies
once the medical students are finished.

678
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,710
You have incredible nerve, Hartounian.

679
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:10,632
What makes you think
you can walk into a private club,

680
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:13,886
- and stroll around as if you own it?
- Cos I do own it.

681
00:49:14,102 --> 00:49:16,143
You must be Chandler.

682
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:18,316
What are you up to?

683
00:49:18,528 --> 00:49:21,282
- Where did you get these?
- Ty Webb.

684
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,533
Ty Webb.

685
00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:27,963
I don't know what sleazy deal you made
or what do you intend to do here,

686
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:30,463
but our members
will never stand for this.

687
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,597
- Most of them can't stand anyway.
- Listen, Chandler.

688
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,931
You know what the most important problem
with the world is?

689
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:41,697
Privilege. People like you who somehow
think you're better than everybody else.

690
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:46,574
Here is a city full of poor people,
poor people who've suffered.

691
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:51,375
Suffered and struggled in the factories
and the slaughterhouses. For what?

692
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:55,974
So that people like you
should live in a mansion on the hill?

693
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:58,145
Chandler, let me tell you something.

694
00:49:58,356 --> 00:50:01,028
There's gonna be a lot of new faces
in this club.

695
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:05,738
I'm gonna see to it. I'm gonna open
Bushwood Club to the general public.

696
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:13,253
And I'm gonna make sure that everyone...
has a taste... of the good life.

697
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,640
Don't you just love this guy?

698
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:19,308
Don't start thinking
you've won anything!

699
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:21,931
This isn't over yet.

700
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:25,158
See you at the reopening.
Hope you like pickled herring.

701
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:29,073
Yeah, come on back any time
and we'll play a few holes.

702
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:47,358
- Chandler, I want to go home.
- See here, Cynthia,

703
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,536
the last thing we want to do
is let him think he's winning.

704
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,080
But he is winning.

705
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:05,936
Well, it's no different, is it?

706
00:51:10,124 --> 00:51:12,997
Perhaps it won't be so bad after all.

707
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:26,527
- Gimme that!
- This is outrageous.

708
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,448
I don't want to talk about it,
let's just play.

709
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:36,796
Hey, boys, you made it, huh?

710
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,264
What do you think? Isn't it great?
It's great, isn't it?

711
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:43,433
I suppose this is someone's idea
of having a good time.

712
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:44,812
What?

713
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:47,484
Perhaps you can turn the music down,
you idiot.

714
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:49,526
Oh, yeah, right.

715
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,962
What do you say I join you
for a little small ball?

716
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:59,544
Here, have a pull off of that
if you want.

717
00:52:03,646 --> 00:52:06,935
You've got a driver and a putter.
How can you play with two clubs?

718
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:09,195
How many do you need?

719
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:15,041
I can't believe I'm playin' golf, huh?

720
00:52:16,003 --> 00:52:18,579
Golf. Golf.

721
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:21,675
Sounds like you got something
stuck in your throat.

722
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:28,479
Oh, he really got a hold of that.
That one's in the upper deck.

723
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:30,738
Oh, that one's gone.

724
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,330
Where's my beer?

725
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,713
You know the problem with golf?

726
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:44,769
It's a game for wusses.
There's no damn contact.

727
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:46,972
You know what I mean?

728
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,992
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea. I got an idea, look.

729
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,697
Let's play one on one.

730
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:56,703
I'll defend the hole
and you try to score.

731
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,919
You got helmets, you got pads,
you got your clubs flying around.

732
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:05,183
Throw in a little stiff body checking.
Boom, you got yourself a game.

733
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:09,479
- What do you say?
- Good God.

734
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:11,688
Well, it was just an idea.

735
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,354
Ho! Where were you?
I've been looking for you all day.

736
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:34,409
I can tell.
Quite an impressive search party.

737
00:53:34,618 --> 00:53:35,996
Ha!

738
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:39,743
Oh, Cynthia. I didn't even see you here.

739
00:53:39,962 --> 00:53:43,880
- How are you? How you doin'?
- Do you mind? You're blocking my sun.

740
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,885
Your sun? Your sun?
I'm doing you a favour.

741
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:50,271
You lay around here your face
will look like an alligator bag.

742
00:53:50,483 --> 00:53:53,058
You're gonna be wearing luggage tags
for earrings.

743
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:54,906
Really!

744
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:02,169
I hope you brought your wooden shoes.

745
00:54:02,383 --> 00:54:05,801
It looks good, don't it, huh?
Don't it look great?

746
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:09,884
Yeah, we had a hell of a time
trying to find all these giant tulips.

747
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:13,228
You got to knock it
right through that little door.

748
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:15,155
It's hard as hell.

749
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:24,086
All right!

750
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,589
I'm on my game today.
Give it a try.

751
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,635
Hey, Kate!

752
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:35,650
He seems absolutely thrilled
with the joke he's made out of our club.

753
00:54:35,865 --> 00:54:41,458
Miffy, I hardly think Kate wants to hear
our unvarnished opinion on the subject.

754
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:44,208
You don't have
to varnish it for me, Todd.

755
00:54:44,424 --> 00:54:47,131
I stopped apologising for my dad
a long time ago.

756
00:54:48,432 --> 00:54:50,722
I admire that, Kate.

757
00:54:56,488 --> 00:54:59,362
Hey.
That's a pretty girl over there, huh?

758
00:55:00,371 --> 00:55:01,833
Yes, it is.

759
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:04,284
You'd like to get her alone in the dark?

760
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:06,416
As long as I've got your permission.

761
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:10,850
What's yourjob here? Yourjob here is
as a lifeguard. That's why I hired you.

762
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:13,469
I didn't hire you to watch my daughter.

763
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:16,266
- The lives. Lives. You got that?
- Guarding lives.

764
00:55:16,486 --> 00:55:19,574
Every life around this pool
is your responsibility.

765
00:55:19,785 --> 00:55:21,245
- Yes, sir.
- Repeat after me.

766
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:23,747
- Every... single...
- Every single life...

767
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:26,037
- You're too fast.
- Every single life...

768
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,130
around this pool is your responsibility.

769
00:55:29,345 --> 00:55:31,303
- My responsibility.
- Every life!

770
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:34,722
- It is my responsibility.
- Every single life.

771
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,685
Except that son of a bitch there.

772
00:55:36,903 --> 00:55:39,276
Girls, now you'll see some sliding.

773
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:43,658
Get that bastard.

774
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:52,719
Kate! Miffy!

775
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,513
Watch this.

776
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:05,907
Look out below.

777
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:10,665
Yeah!

778
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:12,963
Oh, hot, hot!

779
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:14,808
Hot! Hot!

780
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:16,978
He's such a show-off.

781
00:56:19,069 --> 00:56:20,731
Oh! Oh, boy!

782
00:56:20,947 --> 00:56:23,821
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! That's hot! Ow!

783
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:28,753
Oh, that's... Ow, my ass!

784
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:37,560
That's it. Take him off!

785
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,064
Shoot!

786
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,247
Come on, shoot! Come on! Come on, shoot!

787
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:49,500
Shoot! Come on!

788
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,291
- Will you please move?
- Huh?

789
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:56,966
Oh. Sorry. Go ahead.

790
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:02,234
Come on, you got it!

791
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:09,663
He steals the puck.
He's got it off the ice!

792
00:57:09,878 --> 00:57:14,176
Easy! Easy! Easy!

793
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,216
He shoots! He scores!

794
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:26,237
This is some damn sport,
eh, boys?

795
00:57:26,452 --> 00:57:31,332
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Let's go another 18. What do you say?

796
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:48,241
Chandler Young?

797
00:57:49,456 --> 00:57:50,870
Yes.

798
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:53,451
Our mutual friend
told me to meet you here.

799
00:57:53,672 --> 00:57:58,255
Captain Tom Everett, United States
Marine Corps, Company A, retired.

800
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,810
I was expecting someone with a vehicle,
but not this.

801
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:05,691
Well, think about it,
your objective is to surveil a target

802
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:08,397
operating in the construction business.

803
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:12,869
What could be better suited to this sort
of covert recon than a barf wagon?

804
00:58:13,963 --> 00:58:18,130
- Order something.
- I'm really not that hungry.

805
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:20,558
Typical.

806
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:26,015
Might I remind you that sacrifice is
the key to the survival of your country?

807
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:28,991
Or in this case, your country club.

808
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:31,362
All right,
then give me a cheese sandwich.

809
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,741
Don't have it.

810
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:36,287
I'll have a tuna on wholewheat.

811
00:58:36,507 --> 00:58:39,428
Don't have it.

812
00:58:39,638 --> 00:58:43,508
No.
I think you'll be ordering number six.

813
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,058
Fiesta burrito with chilli and eggs.

814
00:58:47,238 --> 00:58:50,240
Just exactly what is
your military background?

815
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:53,492
Oh, I had 15 years in.

816
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:58,007
Covert stuff mainly.
Recon, LRRPs, special ops.

817
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:02,883
Yeah. Most of the details
of my assignments are still classified.

818
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:07,768
I can't go into it without compromising
elements of our foreign policy.

819
00:59:08,948 --> 00:59:12,366
But it was mainly demolition work

820
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,072
of an inter-personal nature.

821
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:18,795
Then there was that damn
bureaucratic snafu in the Nam.

822
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:22,048
I ended up in a VA mental facility.

823
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:24,057
Typical.

824
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,645
So typical.

825
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:29,309
I can then assume our friend
will be discouraged from involvement

826
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,571
with Bushwood Country Club?

827
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:37,079
Are we talking... discouraged...
with extreme prejudice?

828
00:59:37,296 --> 00:59:41,296
I'm afraid we already tried
extreme prejudice. Didn't work.

829
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:45,561
No, no, no, I meant
do you want him... terminated?

830
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,309
The less I know about that the better.

831
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:51,064
Good. That's my policy exactly.

832
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,863
That way, when we're captured, and they
put a 12-volt battery to our testicles,

833
00:59:56,082 --> 01:00:00,035
which can, does and has happened...

834
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:04,888
we can honestly say
we're ignorant of the subject.

835
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,974
Should we swear a blood oath on it
or something?

836
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:11,858
Oh, I don't think that will be
necessary, Captain Everett.

837
01:00:12,782 --> 01:00:15,072
OK.

838
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:21,129
From now on, in future communications,
you'll refer to me as... Mr Sanderson.

839
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,005
And I will refer to you as erm...
Mrs Esterhaus.

840
01:00:26,225 --> 01:00:27,769
Fine.

841
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:31,266
Well... I guess that's it then.

842
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:35,903
- Oh, Mr Sanderson.
- Goodbye... Mrs Esterhaus.

843
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:17,360
My God.

844
01:01:17,577 --> 01:01:19,903
- What's the matter?
- You look stunning.

845
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:21,583
Thank you.

846
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:23,835
Give me a minute. I'll be right back.

847
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:31,812
Jack?

848
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:39,823
Jack, I'm in the kitchen.

849
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,300
Jackie?

850
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:55,564
I'm just fixing something.

851
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,010
Oy!

852
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:30,801
Jack?

853
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,842
Jack, shall I get that?

854
01:02:36,775 --> 01:02:38,815
What are you doing out there?

855
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:42,900
I just wanted to see what it would feel
like to come home to you every night.

856
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:45,365
Oh, how sweet.

857
01:02:47,337 --> 01:02:50,377
- Now what were you really up to?
- Me?

858
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:53,883
Nothing. Nothing.
I just wanted to give you a present.

859
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:58,772
Hello.

860
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,265
- What's this? Where you going?
- Going to stay at Miffy's for a while.

861
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:22,232
Miffy's? Why?

862
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,243
Cos I can't live with you anymore.

863
01:03:25,454 --> 01:03:28,744
Live with me? What happened?

864
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:33,046
You don't care about me, or you wouldn't
have done what you did to Bushwood.

865
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:36,350
Did to Bushwood?
I made it into a fun place.

866
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,729
No, you took a beautiful country club
and turned it into Coney Island.

867
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:44,695
It was perfect the way it was,
but you couldn't stand that, could you?

868
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,201
You had to make it cheap and common.

869
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:51,499
I don't believe this.
You sound just like one of them.

870
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:54,800
Don't you understand?

871
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,634
- I want to be one of them.
- You wanna be one...

872
01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:02,642
Then be one of them. Go ahead.
Go ahead, you got no family anymore.

873
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:07,278
- You're now one of them.
- That's fine with me.

874
01:04:07,496 --> 01:04:10,334
Fine with you, fine with them,
and it's fine with me.

875
01:04:10,543 --> 01:04:13,334
Then go ahead.
And don't come back here anymore.

876
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,273
- Little bit hard on her, weren't you?
- I was hard on her?

877
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:29,824
I work like a dog all my life
so she should have everything.

878
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:32,248
And she talks to me like that?

879
01:04:32,463 --> 01:04:34,624
All kids go through things like that.

880
01:04:34,842 --> 01:04:38,677
They're embarrassed about their parents
or they want to be someone else.

881
01:04:41,397 --> 01:04:43,521
I hope you're right.

882
01:04:43,735 --> 01:04:45,895
Just give her a chance. She'll be fine.

883
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,916
Everything is perfect.

884
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:58,674
It's a perfect mess, that's what it is.
My daughter walked out on me.

885
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:02,345
Just when I thought I was
doing it right, I'm doing it all wrong.

886
01:05:02,564 --> 01:05:05,733
Just when I think I'm on top
I'm on the bottom again.

887
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:11,192
My daughter was right. No matter how
rich I get I'm a filthy, vulgar person.

888
01:05:11,414 --> 01:05:14,037
That's what I am. That's what I am.

889
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:19,004
I'm trash. I'm filth. I'm dirt.
I'm garbage. I'm the scum of the Earth.

890
01:05:19,223 --> 01:05:21,263
I'm the scum of the Earth!

891
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:25,859
You can contradict me
any time you want, you know.

892
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,526
Hm? No, no, no argument here.

893
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,948
I make a point never to interfere
in people's relationships.

894
01:05:32,163 --> 01:05:35,701
You know, there's no mystery
to dealing with women.

895
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:40,338
Women are... They're just
human beings like you and me.

896
01:05:40,556 --> 01:05:43,096
They're fragile, they're sensitive,

897
01:05:43,311 --> 01:05:49,023
they're responsive to...
kindness and warmth and honesty.

898
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,775
They just have to be treated that way,
that's all.

899
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:57,961
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

900
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:02,211
What the... Very funny.

901
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:04,977
- Hi.
- Hi.

902
01:06:05,188 --> 01:06:08,311
- I'm Ty Webb.
- We were noticing you at the bar.

903
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:11,948
Er... want to play trap the clam?

904
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:18,623
- Dip the donkey?
- Excuse me.

905
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:23,135
Spank the puppy?

906
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:26,560
Swallow the swan?

907
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:30,144
- I have to put a dime in the meter.
- I'll help you.

908
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:33,030
Mow the lawn?

909
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,572
Pop the weasel?

910
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:41,926
Well, we're finally alone.

911
01:06:42,137 --> 01:06:44,178
I know.

912
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:48,523
Have you ever seen a crisp $50 bill?

913
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,403
Urghh!

914
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,479
Uh-huh.

915
01:07:33,697 --> 01:07:35,654
Jack, just the man I was looking for.

916
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:38,658
I just spoke to my friends
at the planning commission.

917
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:41,164
Here's a little present for you.

918
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:45,331
It'd be a miracle if you ever got
another building permit in this city.

919
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:51,762
You crooks are all on the take. Where
you're taking it I don't want to know.

920
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,105
So you might be interested
in selling your Bushwood stock,

921
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,984
at a whopping loss, of course.

922
01:07:57,201 --> 01:07:59,908
I'm sick and tired of you
and your bullshit, got that?

923
01:08:00,124 --> 01:08:04,339
- I'm buying you out!
- You're crazy if you think we'll sell.

924
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:06,923
- Name your price!
- Why don't we flip for it?

925
01:08:07,137 --> 01:08:09,179
OK, coin in the air.

926
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,719
Coin in the air.

927
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,054
...taking over...

928
01:08:13,275 --> 01:08:17,111
Be honest, who had heads?
I'm gonna flip again. Here we go!

929
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:19,153
It's tails.

930
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,697
- Did you hear me?
- Let me tell you something.

931
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,824
OK. You want a fight,
you got yourself a fight.

932
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,332
One more word and I'll kill ya.
One more word!

933
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:47,422
- Clown.
- That's not the word.

934
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:49,794
- Barbarian.
- That's not the word either.

935
01:08:50,014 --> 01:08:51,842
- Coward.
- That was the word.

936
01:08:52,059 --> 01:08:55,314
- That was the word.
- Break it up! Break it up!

937
01:08:56,652 --> 01:09:00,106
You want to settle this? Do it
like gentlemen, on the golf course.

938
01:09:00,326 --> 01:09:03,496
- 18 holes. Partners.
- Great idea.

939
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,749
You win, you can have your club back.

940
01:09:05,962 --> 01:09:08,920
He wins, he keeps the club
and he builds those apartments.

941
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:12,222
- You're on, mister.
- OK, you got a bet. It's on my course.

942
01:09:12,434 --> 01:09:16,137
- And no trick clubs.
- Who needs them? You're finished.

943
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,319
Out of my way.

944
01:09:22,536 --> 01:09:24,578
Hey.

945
01:09:27,588 --> 01:09:33,264
Todd. Go out and get a nice tie.
You look like a Pee-wee Herman doll.

946
01:09:55,143 --> 01:09:58,063
Look how uncoordinated he is.
Can't even drive a car.

947
01:09:58,275 --> 01:10:01,029
Can you imagine him beating me at golf?

948
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:09,877
Frankly, you're not great yourself.

949
01:10:10,091 --> 01:10:13,259
Even with me as your partner
there's still an element of risk.

950
01:10:13,471 --> 01:10:16,807
Take my word. Risk has been eliminated.

951
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:27,114
That's my car!

952
01:10:29,294 --> 01:10:31,752
Place yourself in my hands.

953
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,961
OK, trust me.

954
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:36,256
Relax. Come on, relax.

955
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,558
All right. Bend your knees just a touch.

956
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:43,524
- You want to spread your legs.
- You want me to leave you alone?

957
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,363
That's not funny.
OK, let's see that grip.

958
01:10:47,663 --> 01:10:50,667
No, Jack. Jack.

959
01:10:51,756 --> 01:10:52,954
- Terry...
- Harry.

960
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:56,214
- Harry. You're gonna be his partner?
- Yes. 50/50, right?

961
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:01,061
- I don't like you that much. 90/20.
- Close enough.

962
01:11:01,275 --> 01:11:04,647
I want you to swing nice and easy
and hit one down the fairway, OK?

963
01:11:04,865 --> 01:11:08,651
Just want to see how you hit it.
Take your time. Nice and easy.

964
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:13,919
Right down the fairway.
Relax and swing easy.

965
01:11:14,133 --> 01:11:16,507
Don't be afraid. Any time.

966
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:23,231
Just give it a good hit.
Right down the fairway.

967
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,363
Fellas?

968
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,411
No. No. Hold it. Time out.

969
01:11:33,629 --> 01:11:37,131
You're picking your head up.
You got to keep it down. Down.

970
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:40,717
And I noticed you're bending
your left elbow on your back swing.

971
01:11:40,936 --> 01:11:42,978
Keep that straight. Use both hands.

972
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,564
Bend your knees a little bit more.
That's it.

973
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:47,571
- It's really quite simple.
- Kevin.

974
01:11:47,783 --> 01:11:49,492
- Harry.
- Whatever.

975
01:11:49,703 --> 01:11:52,742
You're just confusing the man.
It's really quite simple.

976
01:11:52,961 --> 01:11:55,452
First of all, get rid of all this stuff.

977
01:11:57,176 --> 01:12:00,347
What you want to do is clear your mind.

978
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:03,764
OK? Watch me, OK? Take a deep breath.

979
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:08,360
Close your eyes.

980
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,903
And just be the ball.

981
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,415
- Be the ball.
- Be the ball.

982
01:12:15,629 --> 01:12:17,707
Be the ball.

983
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:21,178
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

984
01:12:21,392 --> 01:12:25,261
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
Na-na-na-na-na.

985
01:12:25,483 --> 01:12:27,357
- Be the ball.
- Be the ball.

986
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:32,154
Be the ball. Be the ball. Be the ball.

987
01:12:32,372 --> 01:12:34,994
- Be the ball.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

988
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,334
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

989
01:12:37,548 --> 01:12:40,967
- Na-na-na-na-na.
- Na-na-na-na-na.

990
01:12:41,181 --> 01:12:42,592
Na-na-na-na-na.

991
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:46,227
No, no, no, no, no. Jack. Jack. Jack!

992
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,850
Jack! You're not being the ball.
Be the ball.

993
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,862
Do me a favour, you be the ball.

994
01:12:51,074 --> 01:12:54,328
If I wanted to be sports equipment
I'd be a lady's bicycle seat.

995
01:12:58,381 --> 01:13:01,716
Tell you what,
the problem is concentration.

996
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,349
Why don't we try it blindfolded?

997
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,936
- Why not?
- All right, let's try that.

998
01:13:14,412 --> 01:13:19,541
Jack, we tried the spiritual approach
and it didn't work. It's not your fault.

999
01:13:19,756 --> 01:13:23,342
But this is the latest biomechanic,
ergonomic, kinaesthetic,

1000
01:13:23,556 --> 01:13:26,559
state-of-the-art teaching technique.
You'll like it.

1001
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:28,932
Get rid of that wicked slice.
Let's try it.

1002
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:34,991
OK, let's try one.

1003
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:41,080
That's getting better.

1004
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:47,847
Perfect!

1005
01:14:02,882 --> 01:14:06,634
- Good morning, Mrs Esterhaus.
- Don't "Mrs Esterhaus" me, you idiot.

1006
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:09,258
You blew up my Rolls-Royce.

1007
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,150
It's difficult. In my line of work you
learn it's the details that kill you.

1008
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:20,539
Just make sure that next time
there aren't any screw-ups.

1009
01:14:20,753 --> 01:14:24,705
I'm playing this man in a golf match
and I don't intend to lose.

1010
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,005
You won't.

1011
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:43,412
OK. These are six mercury-filled,
steel-jacketed dum-dum golf balls.

1012
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:47,086
Feel the weight on this little sweetie.

1013
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:53,434
This is a high-tensile strength
titanium driver,

1014
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,024
which in the hands
of a trained professional

1015
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,113
will definitely redefine
the term "handicap".

1016
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:01,952
Oh, yeah, look in the eyepiece.

1017
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:03,793
Go ahead. Feel free.

1018
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,756
I've set up a simulation. See?
Watermelon hanging from those gallows.

1019
01:15:07,972 --> 01:15:09,348
Yes.

1020
01:15:09,557 --> 01:15:13,606
Let's just say that that watermelon
represents the head of your problem.

1021
01:15:13,816 --> 01:15:15,394
All right?

1022
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:16,815
OK.

1023
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:21,863
Now, sir, if you would please...

1024
01:15:25,256 --> 01:15:27,747
keep your eye on the fruit.

1025
01:15:29,096 --> 01:15:33,098
Keep your eye on the fruit.

1026
01:15:34,565 --> 01:15:38,946
Keep your eye on the fruit.

1027
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,330
- Good.
- Good?

1028
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:45,535
- Good.
- Good?

1029
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:49,506
It's better than good. It's gone.

1030
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:52,259
Now, listen,
I want to be very clear about this.

1031
01:15:52,474 --> 01:15:55,014
Follow the match closely,
but stay out of sight.

1032
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,272
Do nothing, unless you my signal.

1033
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,278
OK.

1034
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:04,321
But should my opponent start to win
I will tip my cap.

1035
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:08,209
Speaking of tipping, there is the
as yet unattended to matter of my fee.

1036
01:16:08,424 --> 01:16:12,555
- I'd like it deposited there, please.
- What's this? A Swiss bank account?

1037
01:16:12,765 --> 01:16:16,053
It's the combination of my locker
at the Greyhound bus station.

1038
01:16:17,317 --> 01:16:19,275
How elegant.

1039
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:26,455
I hope this is the last time we have
to meet like this, Mr Sanderson.

1040
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:30,456
My sentiments exactly, Mrs Esterhaus.

1041
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:40,355
Ladies and gentlemen,

1042
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:44,654
let's get ready to rumble.

1043
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:47,244
Gentlemen,
these are the rules of the match.

1044
01:16:47,459 --> 01:16:50,913
It's a Scotch twosome. Each partner
hits the other partner's ball.

1045
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,804
For those of you unfamiliar
with this type of play,

1046
01:16:54,013 --> 01:16:57,801
it's a little like tag-team wrestling.
Only you can't do this.

1047
01:16:58,021 --> 01:17:01,191
None of this. Or this.

1048
01:17:01,405 --> 01:17:06,402
Now, fewest strokes wins the hole.
Most holes wins the match.

1049
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,949
- Fine.
- Australian winter rules.

1050
01:17:09,168 --> 01:17:13,585
You may improve your lie in the rough if
you can roughly prove you're not lying.

1051
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:16,378
If your ball goes in the water
you may go in after it,

1052
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,176
but only if it's been 45 minutes
since you last ate.

1053
01:17:19,397 --> 01:17:21,936
- Are you quite finished?
- Not quite, no.

1054
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:25,489
- Largest shoe size has the honour.
- Anybody beat a 12D?

1055
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:29,781
- I can, but I'm out of this.
- So?

1056
01:17:30,002 --> 01:17:31,961
- So I guess you're up.
- OK.

1057
01:17:32,174 --> 01:17:33,835
May the best man win.

1058
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:37,589
And if that doesn't happen,
I hope Jack and Harry pull this off.

1059
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:41,062
Wish I could stay, but I got a thing.
Bye.

1060
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:44,776
- Knock 'em dead, Harry.
- Come on, Harry.

1061
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:48,326
Straighten up!

1062
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,372
Yeah!

1063
01:17:56,053 --> 01:17:59,092
If you have to have a partner
you're the partner to have.

1064
01:17:59,309 --> 01:18:01,351
Great.

1065
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:09,909
These clubs are terrible!

1066
01:18:22,356 --> 01:18:23,683
Here we go.

1067
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,655
I know. I know! Be the ball.

1068
01:18:26,865 --> 01:18:29,439
Be the ball. Be the ball.

1069
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:31,656
Swing for the fences.

1070
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,082
He's sliced it.
Stay out of the woods.

1071
01:18:38,428 --> 01:18:41,349
Stay out of the woods!

1072
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,685
- Stay out.
- Look out!

1073
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:58,130
There's my objective.

1074
01:18:58,342 --> 01:19:01,882
He's no threat. Nice duds though.

1075
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:04,143
Sure hate to mess 'em up.

1076
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,648
This is gonna be an easy one.

1077
01:19:07,862 --> 01:19:11,364
One quick stroke,
I'll bounce him and be out by sundown.

1078
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:15,912
Easiest money I ever made.

1079
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:19,168
Hmm. How the hell
am I supposed to concentrate

1080
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,427
with smurf like that walking around?

1081
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:26,097
You did that on purpose.

1082
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:28,641
Naughty! Naughty!

1083
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:33,108
I may have to put you in the duck suit,
and your little dog, too.

1084
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:35,538
Ah-ha!

1085
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:39,621
Hey! Hey! Who the hell sent you.
You little subversive vermin.

1086
01:19:45,353 --> 01:19:47,928
Whoo! Whoo! Legal matter coming through.

1087
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:51,236
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
You getting the shit kicked out of ya?

1088
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:57,080
How's it goin'?

1089
01:19:57,085 --> 01:20:00,005
Terrible. I'm hungry
and have to go to the bathroom.

1090
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:02,589
No, I mean the game. What's the score?

1091
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:05,843
Ah, we're losing.
They're six holes ahead.

1092
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:09,267
I was starting to get used
to country club life.

1093
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:16,861
What do you say
we try something different? Come here.

1094
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,076
But the green is over there.

1095
01:20:19,295 --> 01:20:22,464
You have the worst slice
in the history of golf.

1096
01:20:22,677 --> 01:20:24,719
Might as well go with it.

1097
01:20:42,592 --> 01:20:43,969
Ha-ha!

1098
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:47,466
- See that?
- Thank you. Thank you.

1099
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:50,308
And I thought this was a hard game.

1100
01:20:53,155 --> 01:20:55,826
I got you now, you little furry freak.

1101
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:59,956
You're not going to get away from me.

1102
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:03,504
Scrambling around.
I know you're in there.

1103
01:21:05,847 --> 01:21:08,422
He's close.

1104
01:21:08,643 --> 01:21:13,060
You're close, aren't ya?
Just a few feet away.

1105
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:15,485
Mocking me.

1106
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:19,320
Ain't a gopher alive
that's a match for an ex-Marine.

1107
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:23,501
- Shh!
- Here we go.

1108
01:21:28,474 --> 01:21:30,932
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Yes!

1109
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:38,323
Chandler, what's going on? You were up
seven holes, now he's won the last six.

1110
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:42,038
- You promised he couldn't win.
- He can't win if he doesn't finish.

1111
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:21,277
- Harry. Hi.
- Is your dad gonna be happy to see you.

1112
01:22:21,495 --> 01:22:23,289
Yeah. How's the match going?

1113
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,825
It's all tied up
with this last hole to go.

1114
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:28,920
- Do you think you can win?
- We got the momentum.

1115
01:22:29,136 --> 01:22:32,139
Yeah. Yeah, I think we're gonna win.

1116
01:22:39,364 --> 01:22:43,152
OK, little gopher. Hey.

1117
01:22:43,372 --> 01:22:45,450
It's your friend Tom.

1118
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,663
I gotjunk food.

1119
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:52,096
Everybody loves mass-produced
cream-filled pastries.

1120
01:22:52,307 --> 01:22:54,219
They're good.

1121
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,929
I was just trying
to get your attention before.

1122
01:22:57,149 --> 01:22:59,857
Come on.

1123
01:23:00,071 --> 01:23:02,565
They're good. Huh?

1124
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,765
Very subtle, Mrs Esterhaus.

1125
01:23:13,974 --> 01:23:17,346
I read ya, loud and clear.

1126
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,620
Whoo!

1127
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:33,423
That hurts.

1128
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:37,687
I think it was a big mistake
tipping that arrow head with poison.

1129
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,903
- Don't hit it long.
- Gotcha.

1130
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:48,330
No, no, wait. Don't hit it short.

1131
01:23:48,543 --> 01:23:51,583
OK, right in the middle there
is where I want to go.

1132
01:23:51,799 --> 01:23:54,375
Wait, hit it long but let it go short.

1133
01:23:55,474 --> 01:23:58,312
Well, it's not long.

1134
01:23:58,521 --> 01:24:00,848
But it's short.

1135
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:06,238
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1136
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:09,329
You...

1137
01:24:14,428 --> 01:24:16,671
Come on, hit me. Huh? Come on, hit me.

1138
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:19,431
Come on, hit me!

1139
01:24:19,645 --> 01:24:21,772
Nya! What's up, doc?

1140
01:24:40,478 --> 01:24:43,649
Seems that cream
always rises to the top,

1141
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:45,901
doesn't it, bag boy?

1142
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:54,042
Well, girls, once we win this hole
this place will be back to normal.

1143
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:58,044
Kate, we might even be able to make it
in time for Bunny's brunch.

1144
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:00,176
Would you excuse me?

1145
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:04,980
Kate, I've decided that
you mustjoin my sorority.

1146
01:25:05,195 --> 01:25:08,068
And I know that the Kappas
are just going to love you.

1147
01:25:08,995 --> 01:25:13,494
There's only one thing? Would you
consider changing your name?

1148
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:17,665
Maybe take out the "ounian" and shorten
it to Kate Hart. Isn't that great?

1149
01:25:17,886 --> 01:25:21,554
Wait a second.
What is wrong with my real name?

1150
01:25:21,769 --> 01:25:24,976
Nothing. It's just that it sounds so...

1151
01:25:25,193 --> 01:25:26,820
So what?

1152
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:31,030
Kate, you want people
to think that you belong.

1153
01:25:31,247 --> 01:25:33,918
I do belong... to a family.

1154
01:25:34,795 --> 01:25:38,583
Well... if you want
my honest opinion, Kate,

1155
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:41,593
I think that your family's
really embarrassing.

1156
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:44,683
And I'm really happy
that I'm not a part of it.

1157
01:25:44,899 --> 01:25:47,437
Yeah, so am I.

1158
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:49,979
What? What?

1159
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:56,165
Miffy, you are a stupid,
superficial, snotty little bitch.

1160
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:59,502
Oh, really? Really, Kate? Oh!

1161
01:26:00,846 --> 01:26:03,220
Whatever! What... Ow!

1162
01:26:12,912 --> 01:26:15,583
Well, Jack,
I guess it's come down to this.

1163
01:26:15,793 --> 01:26:18,666
Whoever sinks their putt wins the match.

1164
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,458
Frankly, I'm not worried.

1165
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,054
Chandler, could I talk to you
for a moment?

1166
01:26:26,356 --> 01:26:28,564
Look, I don't know much about golf,

1167
01:26:28,777 --> 01:26:32,909
but I do know the difference between
a 50-foot putt and a two-foot putt.

1168
01:26:34,163 --> 01:26:39,328
It's always been my experience
to go with the guy closer to the hole.

1169
01:26:40,884 --> 01:26:43,424
- You're my kind of guy.
- Thank you.

1170
01:26:44,641 --> 01:26:48,096
- Can I give you some friendly advice?
- Yeah, all right.

1171
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:51,687
- Have you tried putting with a wedgie?
- A wedgie?

1172
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:55,158
Yeah. Oh, it's great.
All the pros are doing it.

1173
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,496
- Would you like me to show you?
- Yeah.

1174
01:26:57,709 --> 01:27:02,708
See, what you do is you take your normal
stance, like you're putting the ball.

1175
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:05,503
Just like that.
You never putted with a wedgie?

1176
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,515
- No.
- You just take your stance.

1177
01:27:08,731 --> 01:27:11,770
And then... this is the wedgie!

1178
01:27:14,618 --> 01:27:17,656
Try putting with that
crammed up your crack.

1179
01:27:23,428 --> 01:27:25,137
Pop?

1180
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:27,720
Pop.

1181
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:34,857
I just wanted to say that
whether or not you sink this putt...

1182
01:27:36,745 --> 01:27:38,787
I love you.

1183
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,038
I'm really sorry I've been acting
like such a jerk lately.

1184
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:47,217
I guess that's what I get
for hanging round a bunch of fonzanoons.

1185
01:27:47,433 --> 01:27:49,261
I don't know what you thought.

1186
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:53,646
Did you think you'd just walk out on me,
insult me, come back when you want?

1187
01:27:53,863 --> 01:27:58,493
Put your arms around me, tell me
"I love you" and I'll forget everything?

1188
01:27:58,704 --> 01:28:00,746
Yeah, that's the general idea.

1189
01:28:02,463 --> 01:28:04,504
You're right.

1190
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:35,188
Ah-hah.

1191
01:28:37,948 --> 01:28:39,991
Sink your putt.

1192
01:28:44,296 --> 01:28:48,130
Now. Do it now. Now.

1193
01:28:58,782 --> 01:29:00,527
Now! Now!

1194
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:09,301
- You can do it.
- Do it.

1195
01:29:09,512 --> 01:29:11,720
Now. Do it now.

1196
01:29:15,941 --> 01:29:17,105
Do it.

1197
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,092
No!

1198
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:55,173
Shh! He still might sink his putt.

1199
01:29:55,394 --> 01:29:57,554
If he does, we tie.

1200
01:30:13,138 --> 01:30:15,632
Father, a word.

1201
01:30:16,728 --> 01:30:21,440
This putt is very simple
and very straight.

1202
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,779
Just tap it.

1203
01:30:23,993 --> 01:30:28,374
- Tap it.
- Just tap it.

1204
01:30:29,169 --> 01:30:31,495
A tiny, tiny tap.

1205
01:30:31,715 --> 01:30:35,717
- Tiny tap.
- A tiny, tiny, tiny tap.

1206
01:30:54,219 --> 01:30:57,507
- Lost ball, wouldn't you say?
- We win, you lose.

1207
01:31:01,149 --> 01:31:03,820
Hey, Chandler, nice touch.

1208
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:09,656
Excuse me, Mr Something.

1209
01:31:10,878 --> 01:31:16,588
Might I trouble you for a scalpel, some
forceps or maybe even a pair of pliers?

1210
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:20,937
You see, I had a little trouble
getting out of the roughs over there

1211
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:24,434
and damn if I didn't
accidentally shoot myself

1212
01:31:24,654 --> 01:31:27,778
with a poison-tipped crossbow dart.

1213
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:31,452
If I pull the arrow out,

1214
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:36,169
will you please
suck out the poison for me?

1215
01:31:39,684 --> 01:31:41,725
Let me get this straight.

1216
01:31:41,938 --> 01:31:44,561
You pull it out, I suck?

1217
01:31:46,155 --> 01:31:50,073
Is there any money in it for me?

1218
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:52,959
Oh, tough course.

1219
01:31:53,169 --> 01:31:55,127
It was a tiny tap.

1220
01:31:55,341 --> 01:31:57,916
Look at you,
you've burned your sweater.

1221
01:32:00,476 --> 01:32:04,428
Mother, how could you marry a man
with such a terrible short game?

1222
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,728
Oh, shut up, Mary Frances.

1223
01:32:06,946 --> 01:32:09,985
Spoiled, snotty,
superficial little bitch.

1224
01:32:10,745 --> 01:32:12,159
What?

1225
01:32:12,165 --> 01:32:14,739
Todd. Todd.

1226
01:32:15,713 --> 01:32:20,511
Oh, drat, I guess this means
you won't be going to Bunny's brunch?

1227
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:44,595
Hey, baby.

1228
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:56,458
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!
