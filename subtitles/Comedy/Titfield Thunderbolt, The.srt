1
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,480
# Man of Sorrows! What a name

2
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,200
# For the Son of God, Who came

3
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,360
# Ruined sinners to reclaim

4
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,840
# Hallelujah!

5
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,880
# What a saviour

6
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,640
# Bearing shame and scoffing rude

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,720
# In my place condemned He stood

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,160
# Sealed my pardon with His blood

9
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,880
# Hallelujah!

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,600
# What a saviour

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,680
# Guilty, vile and helpless we

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,880
# Spotless Lamb of God was He

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
# "Full atonement!" can it be

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,880
# Hallelujah!

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,480
# What a saviour

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,760
# When He comes, our glorious King

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,280
# All His ransomed home to bring

18
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,360
# Then anew His song we'll sing

19
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,760
# Hallelujah!

20
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,560
# What a saviour

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Remember that we are all imperfect.

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,200
We see but in part.
We know but in part.

23
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,720
So let each of us study to approve
ourselves to God through Jesus Christ.

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,480
As under the Redeemer's gentle reign,
the wolf shall dwell with the lamb,

25
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,240
and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid.

26
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,800
That's a repossession.

27
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,240
Got less than 1,000 miles on the clock.

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
- Hah!
- I wouldn't shit you, kid.

29
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Hell, you kids are just
too damn smart this day and time.

30
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,400
- Try it on for size.
- Hey, thank you.

31
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,480
She's cleaner than a cat's ass.

32
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Go on, kick her up.

33
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
How much?

34
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
She's practically brand-new, boy.

35
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,600
$3,000 and some change.

36
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, I'm just looking, you know.

37
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,000
No, I don't know.

38
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
I mean, I don't know if you're man enough
to take on a car like this.

39
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
Are you?

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,760
I don't know.
I have a wooden leg.

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
You're kiddin'?

42
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,400
You wouldn't kid about a thing like that.
Would ya?

43
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm not kidding.

44
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Serious?

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,720
You never can tell.

46
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, come back here with my car,
you hippy sonofabitch.

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,920
Come back.
What are you doin' stealin' my car?

48
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
A true Christian, like his divine master,

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
is of a meek and forgiving temper.

50
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
He owes no man anything
but to love one another.

51
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
And he overcomes evil with good.

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,880
Glory to God in the highest,

53
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,520
and on earth,
peace and goodwill towards men.

54
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
<i>Amen.</i>

55
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Hey, uh...

56
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
Asshole.

58
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,520
- I thought you were the heat.
- Do I look like heat?

59
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,920
You look like one crazy sonofabitch
for a preacher, I'll tell ya that.

60
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,960
Who's that guy back there in the wheat?

61
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
Old friend.

62
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,720
With friends like that,
you don't need enemies.

63
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Which way are we headed?

64
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,320
We?

65
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,240
<i>- All right, which way are you headed?
- South.</i>

66
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,200
South's all right with me.

67
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
- You must like my drivin'.
- I love it.

68
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,440
- Ever thought of doin' it professionally?
- What?

69
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
Driving.

70
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,320
Why?

71
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000
You got blue eyes. All great race
champions have blue eyes. That's a fact.

72
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,600
And all preachers drink like fish.
That's another fact.

73
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,680
What's your name, boy?

74
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,400
Lightfoot.

75
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,480
You Indian?

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,760
No, just American.

77
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,080
<i># If I knew the way, I'd go back home</i>

78
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,360
<i># But the countryside has changed
so much, I'd surely end up lost</i>

79
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,640
<i># Half-remembered names and faces
so far in the past</i>

80
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,920
<i># On the other side of bridges
that were burned once they were crossed</i>

81
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
<i># Tell me where, where does a fool go</i>

82
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,120
<i># When there's no one left to listen
to a story without meaning</i>

83
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,120
<i># That nobody wants to hear</i>

84
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
<i># Tell me where, where does a fool go</i>

85
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,680
<i># When there's no one left to listen</i>

86
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
It's cold up here.

87
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,960
- How's your arm?
- Feels like lead.

88
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,040
Give me your belt, will ya?

89
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,720
Your belt, c'mon!

90
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
You ain't no country preacher, preacher.

91
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,720
I can tell ya that. Who are ya?

92
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Where are the license plates?

93
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't have any. I bagged it
about five minutes before I ran into you.

94
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,080
<i>Almost ran into you.</i>

95
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,960
- You like to spend money?
- When I can get it.

96
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,840
<i>- Do you care how you get it?
- No. If it doesn't cost me too much.</i>

97
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,480
Howdy. How's business?

98
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,640
In this business, you're
always one step away from bankruptcy.

99
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,360
Funny money, credits, speculation.

100
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,280
That ain't it. Somewhere in this country's
a little ol' lady with $79.25.

101
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,120
The five cents is a buffalo nickel.

102
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,320
That ain't it. If she cashes in her
investment, whole thing'll collapse.

103
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,960
General Motors, the Pentagon, the
two-party system and the whole shebang.

104
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,520
Arnold, what is he saying to you?

105
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,840
That's it. We're all running downhill. Gotta
keep running faster or we'll fall down.

106
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,080
Arnold, what was he saying to you?

107
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,240
Arnold?

108
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,760
What did he say to you?

109
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
Did he insult you?

110
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,160
I don't wish to be forward but
we'd like to exchange cars with you.

111
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,880
So the faster you get out,
the better it'll be for your ass.

112
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
- Arnold...
- Come on, out.

113
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
Arnold! Oh...

114
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,680
- I thought we were only gonna get plates?
- We didn't have a screwdriver.

115
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,560
Hey, look at this, man. They got
a department store back here. I like that.

116
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Those clothes and your mouth,
you could be a big man.

117
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,960
Busy night.

118
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,120
- I never paid for it in my life.
- Sometimes you have to pay for pleasure.

119
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Not me. I've never paid for it,
I can tell you that.

120
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
Well, this is where I get out.

121
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,040
You sure don't know a good thing
when you see it, do you?

122
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,080
Hey, why don't you take this watch, huh?

123
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,760
I want you to have it.

124
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,040
I don't want your watch, man.

125
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
I want your friendship.

126
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,040
I like you, that's all.
I thought we were gettin' to be friends.

127
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
We're good together.

128
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,200
Kid, you're ten years too late.

129
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
You sure are one lost dude, aren't you?

130
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,920
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

131
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Shit.

132
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,320
You're as young as you feel.

133
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,680
Hello.

134
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,800
We gotta stop meetin' like this.
People will talk.

135
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
Very funny.

136
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,800
No, with a preacher, especially.

137
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
Where there's smoke, there's fire,
you know?

138
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,000
How y'all doin', Kitty?

139
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,080
Quick, get in! Quick!

140
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,840
Hey, what is this?

141
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,440
Why walk when you can ride?

142
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,360
You sonofabitch.
Let me outta here right now.

143
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Hey, what's the matter?
Don't you like my face?

144
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,640
You're the best-looking face
I've seen all day.

145
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,040
- Where are you taking me?
- Anywhere you say, sweetness.

146
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,000
- I'm hungry.
- Chilli, right?

147
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,600
- I didn't get your name.
- I didn't give it to ya.

148
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,040
My name is Lightfoot.

149
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
- Lightfoot?
- That's right.

150
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,000
That's a dumb name. What kind
of a person would name a kid that?

151
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,160
- What's your name?
- Melody.

152
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
Melody? That's not a dumb name?

153
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,080
Hey, maybe we had the same father.

154
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,920
Brought some goodies.

155
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,560
- Are you outta your mind?
- This is Gloria and Melody.

156
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,400
- Pleased to meet you.
- Melody, Gloria.

157
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,640
Go right in, ladies.

158
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,880
You're full of surprises.

159
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,680
Gloria has a great ass, doesn't she?

160
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,640
It's the best I've ever seen.
Wouldn't you say that, Melody?

161
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
I just got out of a bed to come here.

162
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,760
And I don't intend
to jump right back into one here.

163
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,080
Oh, I forgot to tell ya. Gloria is yours.

164
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Take it easy, Gloria. You're killin' me.

165
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,000
- Where did you get all those scars from?
- Marines, Korea.

166
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh, yeah? I heard about that war.

167
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
Ooooh!

168
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
Mmm...

169
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
- What are you doin'?
- Getting dressed.

170
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Why?

171
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,560
So you can take me home.

172
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,240
You can stay here tonight.

173
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
No, I have to get home
before it's light out.

174
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
If you think I'm leavin' here at 3.30am

175
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,840
to take you
wherever the hell home is, you're crazy.

176
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,200
You'd better take me or I'll walk out
of here stark-naked and scream "rape".

177
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,400
Sure you will.

178
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,480
That would be stupid.

179
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,360
Rape!

180
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,840
Rape!

181
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,720
- Do you think we should stay here?
- Why not?

182
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Get your clothes on.

183
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,400
Here's some money. You can take a cab.

184
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,640
Sweets to the sweets!

185
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,160
How did you do?

186
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,240
Red-haired women are bad luck.

187
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,200
You sure that's their car?

188
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,920
That's their hearse.

189
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,880
Good morning.

190
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,320
Good morning, sweetness.

191
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,520
What'll it be?

192
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,360
I'm gonna have you.

193
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,680
And four scrambled eggs, very loose.

194
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
Bacon, toast, coffee,

195
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
and American fries.
You got American fries?

196
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Yes.

197
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,040
American fries?

198
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,560
Right.

199
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,480
Just coffee, black. Thanks.

200
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,480
OK. Thank you.

201
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,720
- God, it's poetry!
- Good jowl.

202
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,760
I love 'em like that.
Nice and tight. Jesus!

203
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,040
How you feelin' today, preacher?

204
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,160
The clock uncoils the working day,

205
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,160
and he wakes up
feeling his youth has gone away.

206
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,760
Now what the hell is that? A prayer?

207
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,640
A poem.

208
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,080
- A poem?
- Poetry.

209
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,600
Ah.

210
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,440
You stick with me, kid.
You can live for ever.

211
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,840
Sir.

212
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,120
You big sonofabitch!

213
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,880
You must've been into something
very big, preacher. Very big.

214
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,640
I can't see.

215
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,360
- Damn, they're goin' fast.
- I can't see 'em.

216
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,800
I don't know how the hell
I coulda missed 'em so many times.

217
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,320
Hang on!

218
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,080
He went over the...

219
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,080
What do we do now, Red?

220
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,160
Geronimo!

221
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,040
In a case like this, you can't take
your hands off the wheel for a second.

222
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,120
Get your hands on the wheel.

223
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,640
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

224
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,800
Shit!

225
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,920
What do we do now, Red?

226
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,000
Shut up, Goody.

227
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,560
Goddamn ding-ding.

228
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,800
Yeah, transmission's finished.
Seals are all gone.

229
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,560
Cadillac's my car anyway.

230
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,040
Where are we now?

231
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,160
Hell's Canyon.

232
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,240
Snake River.

233
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
Mostly huntin' camps and sheep camps.

234
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,040
Up here, people's business
is nobody's but their own.

235
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,480
Delivery boat's gonna come by
pretty soon. The Idaho Dream.

236
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,960
Should take us right up the river.

237
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,320
Better off gettin' as far away from me
as you can, boy.

238
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,920
In for a penny, in for a pound.

239
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
Lonely country, kid.

240
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,880
You got any people?

241
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,160
Hah! I don't even know any more.
That's weird.

242
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,000
Last time I saw any of them
I was just a kid.

243
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,760
I was a little too much for them to handle.

244
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
So they sent me away
to one of these boarding schools.

245
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,800
And on the train I met this woman.

246
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,520
Oh, man!

247
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,280
So the next thing I know, we're getting off
the train together in New Orleans.

248
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,200
Two weeks later,
I wake up in some fleabag hotel.

249
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,360
Oh, God!

250
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,080
But we had ourselves a good time, man.

251
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,720
So after her, things looked good.
I kept movin'.

252
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,800
Now you can't stop?

253
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
Here she is.

254
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,800
Idaho Dream.

255
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,400
Did you see that?
A steelhead, man. Beautiful.

256
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,240
Aah... Did you see that?

257
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,880
Yeah.

258
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,600
Well, my good friend, we're broke.
Do you have any suggestions?

259
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,400
If I knew what you know,
I'd never be broke.

260
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,920
<i>What do you think I know
that you would like to know?</i>

261
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,000
All right...

262
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,040
For one thing, I'd like to know
if there's a good way of beating a bank.

263
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,720
Banks! What do you know about banks?

264
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,120
<i>What the hell do you know about banks?</i>

265
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
What's so funny?

266
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,520
- You.
- Me?

267
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,600
That's right.

268
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,640
A man can do
whatever he sets his mind to.

269
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,720
Now, me, I wanna walk in
and buy a white Cadillac convertible.

270
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,760
Actually walk in and buy it, cash.

271
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,760
You might set your mind
to gettin' us a lift.

272
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
This walkin' is tough on my bad leg.

273
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
This is the best time. Most State troopers
are having coffee now.

274
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,280
<i>Hey! Hey! Hey!</i>

275
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,360
That sure isn't any white Cadillac.

276
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,360
Beggars can't be choosy.

277
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
You simple-minded sonofabitch.

278
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
Get in the back seat.

279
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,560
- There's a raccoon in here.
- Hell with that. Get in the back.

280
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,080
What's the matter with you? I ain't
got all day to wait on you. Come on.

281
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,600
I've been...
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

282
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,200
I've been drivin' all over this country.

283
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
This guy another friend of yours?

284
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Slightly advanced, isn't he?

285
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,760
Hey, what's wrong with this wreck?
We're gettin' gassed back here.

286
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,200
This guy's a basket case.
He's got the exhaust pipe in here.

287
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,560
- He's not your run-of-the-mill basket case.
- This guy is definitely out to lunch.

288
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,560
What the hell's the matter with you, boy?

289
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Hey, you're good, man. Very good.

290
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,920
Glass head, like all these nuts.

291
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,840
I don't know what we're gonna do
with these rabbits.

292
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Get 'em out.

293
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,560
I saw that. That was very good.

294
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,240
Where are we headed, man? I'm ready.

295
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,120
I don't know. Sometimes when there's
nothin' to do, it's best to keep movin'.

296
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,560
You smell somethin' up here?

297
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,280
No.

298
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
- Smell that?
- I don't smell anything.

299
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,520
It smells like shit.

300
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,480
Ah...

301
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,720
- Raccoon shit.
- Raccoon shit.

302
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,800
Hang your hand out the window
and let the rain get at it.

303
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,160
- Would you like...
- Get outta here!

304
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,560
Just remember not to pick your teeth.

305
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,280
Oh, God...

306
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,720
In small-town banks, they leave the
telephone off the hook in the vault at night

307
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,040
so the local operator can listen in.

308
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,080
People walk into these banks with paper
sacks, fill 'em with money and walk out.

309
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,600
Anybody can do it.

310
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
Bullshit.

311
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,960
The newest bank vaults have walls
of reinforced concrete five feet thick,

312
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,720
backed by six inches of steel.

313
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,400
The vault door is stainless steel-faced.

314
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,880
It's an inch and a half of cast steel,
another 12 inches of burn-resisting steel,

315
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and another inch and a half
of open-hearthed steel.

316
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,080
Come here.

317
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,520
A vault door has 20 bolts,
each an inch in diameter.

318
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,160
Eight on each side,
two top and two bottom.

319
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,960
This holds the door into a 16-inch steel
jamb set in 18 inches of concrete.

320
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,680
It's crosshatched by steel bars
running both vertical and horizontal.

321
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,000
This door is precision-made so you can't
pour nitro between the door and the vault.

322
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,080
If that isn't enough,

323
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,520
there's microphones, electric eyes,

324
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,560
pressure-sensitive mats,
vibration detectors, tear gas,

325
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,280
and even thermostats that detect
the slightest rise in temperature.

326
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
Still interested in banks?

327
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,160
I knew you weren't a preacher.

328
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,360
Preaching isn't so bad. You get used to it.

329
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,200
You are what you do, so to speak.
At times I even forgot about the money.

330
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,840
What money?

331
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,200
Montana Armored.

332
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,480
Montana Armored?

333
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,000
How did you get into the vault?

334
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,320
20mm canon with armour-piercing shells.
Wasn't too hard.

335
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
That was on the news.
That was a big deal.

336
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,720
What did they call that guy?
The Thunderbolt.

337
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,040
That's you.

338
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,400
You're the Thunderbolt.

339
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,600
Parson's luck.

340
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
Oh, no!

341
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,200
Watch out for the dog shit.

342
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,960
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.
That sounds like somethin'.

343
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,640
You're forgetting I'm a lot older than you.

344
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,960
There are plenty of guys twice my age

345
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
who don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.

346
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
In for a penny, in for a pound.

347
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,720
So, who were these guys
that are following us?

348
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh...

349
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,680
The big dude's a war hero.

350
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
Name's Red Leary.
Saved my life once in Korea.

351
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,960
He was sent to prison in Illinois
later on for stabbing a woman.

352
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,120
There he met an old-time bank robber,
Billy Lamb.

353
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Lamb taught him how to break safes.

354
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,400
Lamb was a real genius for organisation.

355
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,480
Thanks.

356
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,960
When they got out, Lamb introduced him
to Dunlop, an electronics expert.

357
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,720
That's the guy you took care of
in the field.

358
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
- Wanna brew?
- Definitely.

359
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,600
The little Orphan Annie-eyed
character's Eddie Goody.

360
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,160
He's a driver.
Harmless when he's alone.

361
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,400
So what happened to the money?

362
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,160
Hey, I don't care anything
about the money, you know that.

363
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,680
We're friends. I like you as a friend.

364
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,760
Yeah.

365
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,560
We hid it in a one-room schoolhouse
in Warsaw, a place Lamb went to as a kid.

366
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,600
Hid it in a wall behind the blackboard. Half
a million dollars worth. It's still there.

367
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,160
- Schoolhouse?
- Behind the blackboard.

368
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,240
Why?

369
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,200
It was always Lamb's practice
to control the money till the final split.

370
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,160
We kept in contact with each other
through personals in the paper.

371
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,160
Then Lamb had a heart attack and died.
Guess he was just too old for it.

372
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,320
Leary got suspicious but I didn't
tell him where the money was because

373
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,160
I knew he'd go straight to it,
heat or no heat.

374
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,360
Then the police released a thing in the
press saying the money had been found.

375
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,560
Bullshit.

376
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,480
Leary went off his ass.

377
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,640
He got careless
but couldn't lead them to the money

378
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,720
cos he didn't know where it was.

379
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,600
Finally, they convicted him on another
bank robbery that took place years before.

380
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
And when he got out
he convinced the others I'd set him up.

381
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,960
I decided
best that I should drop out for a while.

382
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,760
That church was a pretty far-out idea.

383
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,520
About as far out as possible, I thought.

384
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,840
Are you sure this is the spot?

385
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,120
Yeah.

386
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,920
- What? I didn't hear what you said.
- I said, yeah, this is it.

387
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,400
Well, what happened to it?

388
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,280
I don't know. Progress.

389
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,320
Have a nice day, boy.

390
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,200
Here, for you.

391
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,280
That's the last of our money.

392
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,120
It's good. Real good.

393
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,520
Fantastic pistachio.

394
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,080
What do we do now?

395
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
Drop your cocks
and reach for your socks.

396
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,160
Don't look at me. I didn't say a word.

397
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,240
- Red?
- Start the car.

398
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,520
Freeze, you sonofabitch.
The first one of you moves, I shoot.

399
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,000
All right, kill the engine.
Hand me the keys and don't turn around.

400
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,720
Both of you get out Pistachio's side.

401
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,880
No ideas - you'll both be dead
before you hit the ground.

402
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,880
Move it.

403
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,680
Turn around.

404
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,320
The guys in the car.

405
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,400
That's it, smartass.

406
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,320
Red. Goody.

407
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,440
- How's Dunlop?
- That's for us to know and you to find out.

408
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,320
Shut up, Goody.

409
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,800
- What do you want, Red?
- What do I want?

410
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,920
You got balls, I'll say that for you,
Johnny. I want your ass, my friend.

411
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Hey, flattery's not gonna
get you guys anywhere.

412
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,080
- Who's the comedian?
- Name's Lightfoot.

413
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,360
Does he know everything?

414
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,880
- No.
- Yeah.

415
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,160
Lightfoot, huh?

416
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah.

417
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,680
Good thing I didn't hit him in the face.
He'd be dead now.

418
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,680
You always had a high opinion
of yourself, Red.

419
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
What you been preachin' lately, Johnny?

420
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,280
Survival.

421
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,960
Are you ready?

422
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,040
I've been countin' the days.

423
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
That's for the kid.

424
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,120
- You wanna talk or play games?
- What do you want me to do, Red?

425
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,560
Shut your face.

426
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,320
I can't breathe! I got asthma.

427
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,560
What do you want me to do now, Red?

428
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,600
Kill the sonofabitch.

429
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,240
Here?

430
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,760
Yes.

431
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,720
Now?

432
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,400
Now!

433
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,640
Don't ever point a gun at me.
Understand? Not even a twig.

434
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,800
You got it.

435
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,960
You come from hitters, don't you?

436
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,800
What are you waitin' for? Why don't you
kill me? I woulda killed you.

437
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,560
That doesn't make up for two years.
I'm gonna kill you anyway.

438
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,080
The money was here - in the schoolhouse.

439
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,520
What's this garbage talking about?

440
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,200
The money was never recovered.

441
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,560
TV, radio, papers, everybody was lying.
They were working with the police.

442
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,040
When Lamb died I never came back here.
The money's still here. It's safe.

443
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,880
Here?

444
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,680
Yeah. Lamb went to school here in
Warsaw, a little one-room schoolhouse.

445
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,600
We put the money in the wall,
behind the blackboard.

446
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,640
Where's this one-room schoolhouse?

447
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,280
Gone.

448
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,360
Gone? Gone where?

449
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,680
I wish I knew. Used to be right
where the new schoolhouse is now.

450
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,560
You expect me to believe all this crap?

451
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,560
It's the truth. Why do you think
I'd come to a dumb town like this?

452
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,200
How the hell do I know?
You're queer for dumb towns.

453
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,520
Half a million dollars don't disappear.

454
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,640
They shoulda found something
when they tore the place down.

455
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,720
I wish I had the answer for you.

456
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,120
The sad part is that we got away with it.

457
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,600
It's a sin, that's what it is.

458
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,600
Christ, it's a sin.

459
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,520
Oh, boy, I feel old.

460
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,520
What are we gonna do now, Red?

461
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,600
Shut up, Goody.

462
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,440
I got hay fever too.

463
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,680
- Why not do it again?
- What's he mouthin' off about?

464
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Montana Armored.
We hit the same place, the same way.

465
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,880
Montana Armored?

466
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,920
What?

467
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,400
Hey, they'd never expect it.
Not something that big.

468
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,280
It's never been done before, has it?

469
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,520
That'd really be something, wouldn't it?

470
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,600
Yeah, it sure would.

471
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Hey, I think that's a great idea.

472
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,800
Let's not get queer over it.
What does the kid know anyway?

473
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,680
Besides the Lamb is dead
and he wrecked Dunlop.

474
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,000
You don't need the Lamb. We do it
the same way. You already did it once.

475
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,600
You might have something.

476
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,080
The blind leading the blind.
He's a kid. He eats pistachio ice cream.

477
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,680
Jesus, you can lead a mule to water
but you can't make him drink it.

478
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,120
That's a horse, not a mule.

479
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,800
I agree.

480
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,880
- Agree with what?
- With him.

481
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,760
Good grief.

482
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,080
Even if I did agree, what would we use
as a stake to operate with?

483
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,440
Well, we could all get jobs for a while.

484
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,320
You're better at asking questions
than you are at answering them.

485
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,240
And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb and
the leopard shall lie down with the kid.

486
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,520
What's that? A poem?

487
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,000
No, it's a prayer.

488
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,640
200 is 200 for the pot.

489
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,160
200?

490
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,400
Better than that piece of junk running out
on the highway. We got Goody's car still.

491
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,480
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

492
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,240
Where do you pick up
these pearls of wisdom?

493
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,680
Books.

494
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,480
You mean you can actually read?

495
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,000
<i>- I read you loud and clear.
- You better believe it.</i>

496
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,240
That's enough. We gotta keep it together.
If you can't manage that, I walk.

497
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,240
I'd like to hit him again
just for the hell of it.

498
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,000
<i>Well, there it is.</i>

499
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,080
<i>That's it?</i>

500
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,080
Sure doesn't look like much, does it?

501
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,760
<i>Doesn't look like much?
You dopey sonofabitch.</i>

502
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,120
- Simple-minded sonofabitch.
- What did you get in my way for?

503
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,360
Love this guy.

504
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,160
<i>We're gonna be great friends, Red.</i>

505
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,080
You forgot to give me
your Social Security number.

506
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,080
What?

507
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,480
I said that you forgot to give me
your Social Security number.

508
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,560
Oh, I've forgotten it.

509
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,080
Forgotten it?

510
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,960
Ha-ha!

511
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,800
Nobody ever forgets their number.
Where you been workin'?

512
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,240
Uh, listen, I'm gonna need it for these.

513
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,880
So if you can bring it to me tomorrow
I'd appreciate it.

514
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,440
Hey.

515
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,880
Do you live near here?

516
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,800
Man, I'm goin' crazy. That drives me wild.
She just does somethin' to me.

517
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,240
- Why did you leave?
- I couldn't wear that stuff.

518
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,760
Too humiliating. And you look ridiculous.

519
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,040
What's this?

520
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
That's my route.

521
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,120
Just follow the streets
and it takes you right back to the garage.

522
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,920
If you don't mind my saying,
I think you should get a job.

523
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,240
- Nobody asked you.
- All right, all right.

524
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,760
- Read me the first street.
- Left on 12th Avenue South to 9th Street,

525
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,120
- right on North 3rd to the viaduct...
- One at a time!

526
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,200
Left on 12th Avenue South.

527
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,960
You boys are bein' paid by the hour!

528
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,000
We haven't got all day on this mother.
Gotta move it.

529
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,520
# Baby

530
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,360
# Baby

531
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,160
# Baby

532
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,160
# Down, baby

533
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,600
# Baby, baby, get down

534
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,840
- There's a kid now. Pull over.
- It's my truck. I know what to do.

535
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,960
You're on the wrong street.

536
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,400
What?

537
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,920
I said, you're on the wrong street.

538
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,440
- What's he talking about?
- By me.

539
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,600
You're early. You're supposed to go down
the next street first, then come up here.

540
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,720
Well, listen.

541
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,840
While we're here, can I sell you anything?

542
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,160
No, I'm waiting for Judy Ann.
They have a better flavour of pistachio.

543
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,560
Look, kid, go fuck a duck.

544
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,320
Here comes, uh,

545
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,640
Lightfoot.

546
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,720
He's late, as usual.

547
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,880
Hey, the woman
came to the window again today.

548
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,320
Stark-naked this time.

549
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,640
Stark-naked?

550
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,720
No kiddin'?

551
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,600
What did she do?

552
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,880
Just stood there and stared at me.

553
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,760
How close was ya?

554
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,080
As close as I am to you right now.

555
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,000
Did you see everything?

556
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,760
- What do you mean, everything?
- You know what I mean - everything.

557
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,160
Clear as day.

558
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,360
What did you do about it, big mouth?

559
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,200
- I'll kill you for that!
- Sit down, Red. Sit down!

560
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,800
Young kids,
they don't believe in anything any more.

561
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,120
You'll get yours when this is over.
One way or another.

562
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,440
You can believe in that.

563
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,920
<i>All maintenance personnel off
the floor. Bringing in the guard dogs now.</i>

564
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,440
To hell with them dogs.
They treat 'em better than us.

565
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,520
They rush us outta here like animals.

566
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,720
Let's not argue now, Sam.
Those dogs ate up a man here once.

567
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,680
Ate him?

568
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,400
Yeah. Wrong man came on duty,
dogs ate him up.

569
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,560
They'll go through
a plate-glass window to get at ya.

570
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,240
A man don't fool around
with those kinda animals.

571
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,600
What did you think about that shot?
Three-ball in the corner pocket?

572
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,640
- Pretty honky.
- It was a pretty good shot.

573
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,680
Nothin' wrong with it.
Wasn't the best shot but it's all right.

574
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,760
- Who's that guy?
- New guy. Won't come outside any more.

575
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,440
Matter of fact, when he gets to work,
he keeps that door locked.

576
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,480
Why's that?

577
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,440
Well, one time we got him out here
and I kinda got up close to him

578
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,240
and unzipped my pants
and took out my pecker.

579
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:29,040
And I put that dude right in his hand.
He didn't know whether to hold it, drop it,

580
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,440
or run off down the street with it.
Funniest thing I ever saw in my life.

581
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,320
We just all rolled up on the sidewalk
splitting our guts. It was really funny.

582
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,160
Hey, Mario.

583
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,520
- Hey, boss, it's raining.
- Work between the drops.

584
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,320
Hey, Mario, what do we do about the rain?

585
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,080
Take your lunch hour now.

586
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,360
Lunch? It's nine o'clock in the morning.

587
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,840
Shit! Sonofabitch.

588
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,160
My own brother-in-law.

589
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,520
Got every skirt in town chasing him.
You'd think he'd share with me just once.

590
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,600
Stick out your tongue.

591
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,640
I'll teach you how to lick your eyebrows.
You'll have every woman after you.

592
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,280
Can I borrow the truck?

593
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,360
- What for?
- Doctor.

594
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,640
- You got a dose?
- Full disaster, man.

595
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:17,240
Go ahead. We're on our lunch hour. Just
don't wrap it up. It's my ass if you do.

596
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,040
Don't worry. I'll be back in an hour.
I'm just gonna clean up.

597
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,440
Hey, where'd you get those pants?

598
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,560
You freak!

599
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,120
I love you! Come back!

600
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,680
- Where'd you get the dents?
- Progress.

601
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,520
I dreamt about you last night.

602
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,080
- What about?
- I dreamt you said hello to me.

603
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,760
Don't you get smart with me.
I'll break both your arms.

604
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,200
I'll keep that in mind.

605
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,200
Remember what I said.
John and me go back a long way.

606
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,440
But you don't mean nothin' to me,
understand? Nothin'!

607
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,080
- What'd you try and kill him for then?
- Because we were friends.

608
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,160
Thank you.

609
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,520
- You boys are new around here.
- Yeah.

610
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,600
- Here's your receipt.
- Oh, thanks.

611
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,240
- Need some help with that box?
- No, thanks. We can manage ourselves.

612
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,320
OK. Suit yourself.

613
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,920
Relax. Relax.

614
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,880
One tank to a pop.
Johnny got four of them in Korea.

615
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,160
They gave him a Silver Star.
He was a hero.

616
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,800
That sonofabitch
even saved my life once. Come on.

617
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,240
This isn't gonna work.

618
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,320
I wish Dunlop was still here.

619
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,880
How did you take care of the alarm?

620
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,960
Dunlop monitored the frequency
of the signal on the wire.

621
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,560
He duplicated it
and then ran it back into the circuit.

622
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,200
The whole deal fit into two lunchboxes.

623
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,400
- We don't have Dunlop now, do we?
- Yeah, you took care of that.

624
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,840
These new alarm systems buzz directly
into the branch manager's bedroom

625
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,560
and the telegraph office.

626
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,640
This lulls whoever is bustin' into
the vault into a false sense of security.

627
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,560
He doesn't hear an alarm go off.

628
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,080
It's still a hard-wire system,
runs right through the telegraph lines.

629
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,840
There's no antenna there,
I'm sure of that.

630
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,920
We just gotta make sure
that the alarm isn't reported.

631
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,880
The risk is if they've run
a hard wire into the sheriff's office.

632
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,040
- How far away is that?
- I clocked that on the truck doin' 40.

633
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,480
Now, if the police come down on us hard,
say, at an average of 80 miles an hour,

634
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,120
we're seven minutes on the inside,
10 minutes on the outside,

635
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,560
depending on which route they take.

636
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,520
I think to be absolutely sure that we
should use five minutes as our bottom line

637
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,880
from the time you trip the alarm
in the vault.

638
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,320
Unless a patrol car
happens to be cruisin' closer.

639
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,720
<i>All right. Five minutes it is.</i>

640
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,480
Leary and I
will take care of the manager's house.

641
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,800
It's Sunday so the bars will be closed.
Only place open'll be the telegraph office.

642
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,240
At 10.30, Goody will drop Lightfoot off
in the alley behind the Liberty Lounge.

643
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,040
The window's been fixed so you can
climb right in and change your clothes.

644
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,080
You stay there until 11.30.

645
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:01,400
Don't fool around the bar. You stay right
there until 11.30, in the can. Understand?

646
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,520
At 11.30 you get into the telegraph office.
You gotta get in there before 11.35

647
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,400
because that's when the alarm goes off.

648
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,313
You'll see a light on the console. When

649
01:10:11,314 --> 01:10:14,680
that lights up, Leary
and I are in the vault.

650
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,360
And we don't care how you get inside.

651
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,480
Look,

652
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,320
I don't know if I can pull this thing off.

653
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,720
How do I know what to do?

654
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,320
What's the matter?
The job too tough for ya?

655
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,440
You can't stop this thing once you start.

656
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,320
Billy the Kid.

657
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,080
This isn't a game. You gotta get
that fat guy before he reports the alarm.

658
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,520
You tie him up,
gag him and put him in the can.

659
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,880
People are used to him
bein' in the can for long periods.

660
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,360
And you leave the place neat.
Understand? Just like you found it.

661
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:07,360
At 11.36 Goody comes around back.
If you're not ready, he goes without you.

662
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:12,840
You get in the car and hit the floor. You
don't move around till Goody tells you.

663
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,720
At 11.39 Goody comes back to the vault.

664
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,880
Leary and I will be there with the money.
If we're not, you just keep right on going.

665
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:29,720
If we pull this off, we should be able to
make the midnight movie at the drive-in.

666
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,800
Then what?

667
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,440
We watch the show.

668
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,400
Then in the morning we split
the money up and go our separate ways.

669
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,360
Here's a watch.
You're gonna need a watch.

670
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,360
Hey, Billy, don't forget to shave.

671
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,880
Tweet tweet.

672
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,760
<i>Charlie Johnson, please,
in the blue Chevy,</i>

673
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,840
<i>license plate 74. Is he here?</i>

674
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,400
<i>Three guys in the back, "Huh?"</i>

675
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,760
<i>I won't say it again, lady.
I'm warning you.</i>

676
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,280
<i>- How do you see yourself?
- Nude, usually.</i>

677
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,840
<i>Tell me, how would you
produce Don Rickles?</i>

678
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,080
<i>Trying to be what I am.
Doing what I do on the stage.</i>

679
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,880
<i>There's certain words you use
that I don't find offensive...</i>

680
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,440
Keep quiet and nobody gets hurt.

681
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,360
- Wake him up.
- Jack. Jack!

682
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,200
What the hell's the matter with you?

683
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,720
Oh, no. Not again.

684
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,160
Keep quiet and nobody gets hurt.

685
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,320
Oh, my God! My child. She's just a baby.

686
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,560
OK, but just keep it down.
I don't want my mother to hear me.

687
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,080
- Oh, my God!
- I was just getting started.

688
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,520
I want the combination of the outer
guard doors. Left series first.

689
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,880
Come on.

690
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,640
Uh... L-2,

691
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,600
R-3, R-7.

692
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,280
Uh... L-2, R-3,

693
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,000
R-5, R-7.

694
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,200
Again. Faster.

695
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,920
Uh... L-2, R-3,

696
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,040
R-7, L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.

697
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,680
All right. One more time. Now really fast.

698
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,120
L-2, R-3, R-7,

699
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,480
L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.

700
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,560
Now backwards. Quick.

701
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,680
- Come on!
- You're confusing me.

702
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,360
Say it fast
or you'll never say anything again.

703
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,080
R...

704
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,880
7, R-5, L-3,

705
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,760
No, R-3, L-2,

706
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,680
Uh, R-7, L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.

707
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,360
What a way to go.

708
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,440
It's 11.15.

709
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,120
- You ready?
- Right.

710
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,640
Murph, shake your ass up.

711
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,760
Come on, you sonofabitch.

712
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,520
Oh, you sexy bitch.

713
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,680
I'd even go out with you myself.

714
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,640
Shit!

715
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,120
When this is over I'm gonna get that kid.

716
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,200
You'll have to come by me first.

717
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,640
Hi. Come on in.

718
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,040
- Hi.
- Fill it up with High-Test.

719
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,760
- That's five.
- Goody!

720
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,480
Goody!

721
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,400
- Get some more.
- No, let's go. Come on.

722
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,880
<i>Hello, Red.</i>

723
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,840
You did a god job.

724
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,920
Thanks. Here's your watch back.

725
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,440
Keep it.

726
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,120
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

727
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:48,440
But after all that running around,
I gotta go so bad I can't see straight.

728
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,000
I got weak kidneys.

729
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,240
Shut your mouth
or you'll drown both of us.

730
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,600
Keep quiet back there now.

731
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,440
- Do you think she heard that?
- I can't help it. I'm dyin' here.

732
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,200
- Red-haired women are bad luck.
- What's wrong?

733
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,400
Just stay calm, Red.

734
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,480
So far, so good.

735
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,320
<i>Yeah, it's good. Full of vitamin hay.</i>

736
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,600
<i>Try some.</i>

737
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,560
What do you think?

738
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,600
Is that the heat?

739
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,120
Here.

740
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,320
11.42.

741
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,160
That's seven minutes the inside.
Nice work, Goody.

742
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,560
Seems there was another hook-up
after all.

743
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,680
- Everything I did was for nothing?
- Seems that way, doesn't it?

744
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,320
- Oh, Christ!
- Come on, keep your lid on now, Louise.

745
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,080
Goddamn! Hello, Murph.

746
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,400
Hey, what's with that light?

747
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,360
I know they're in here.

748
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:22,240
- Are you sure about this?
- I am sure. Sure as hell I am.

749
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,160
All right, if they're in here,
we'll get 'em out.

750
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,440
Sonofabitch.

751
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,040
- Red-haired women are bad luck, man.
- What's the matter? What's wrong?

752
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,920
What's goin' on up there?

753
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,120
This is crazy. I must be outta my mind.

754
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,600
- I told you not to listen to that kid.
- Take it easy, Red.

755
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,600
- You go fuck yourself.
- Will you shut up?

756
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,400
Shut up, Leary.

757
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,720
I'm up to here with all of ya. I'm gettin'
out of this fuckin' coffin right now.

758
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,120
Hey! Hey!

759
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,760
Stay outta sight.

760
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,960
<i>This is the police. This is the police.</i>

761
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,040
<i>Everybody stay in your car.</i>

762
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,880
Goody's hit.

763
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,800
You're gonna be dead soon anyway.

764
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,520
Stop the car.

765
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,440
- Oh, Leary...
- Are you outta your mind?

766
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,800
Stop right now or you're dead,
and you know I mean that.

767
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,120
Now give me that gun, real slow.

768
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:33,360
Now get out this side, both of ya,
and don't bother openin' your mouth.

769
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,560
- Christ, Red, this is dumb.
- On the ground, both of you.

770
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,840
- What happened to Goody?
- I threw that little sucker out.

771
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,920
You prick!

772
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,760
Say somethin' funny now, smartass.

773
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,240
Wow...

774
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,320
Hey, kid. Hey.

775
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,760
Are you all right, kid?

776
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,840
Can you hear me?

777
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,440
You all right, boy?

778
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,960
Oh, man, I'm dizzy.

779
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,600
- I'm dizzy.
- Come on, you'll be all right.

780
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,680
Let's go. Let's go, boy.

781
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,080
What happened?

782
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:23,600
Must've got a call on the car
and think it's us.

783
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,920
- I need clothes.
- We'll find Goody.

784
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,480
Dead man's clothes?

785
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,240
Come on.
We haven't got time to mess around.

786
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,560
Hey, you got the Silver Star.

787
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,520
You're the real hero, not Leary.

788
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,560
- Where'd you get that?
- Is it true?

789
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,360
- What difference does it make?
- I just wanted to know, that's all.

790
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:04,040
Alarms. Alarms! That's a real pisser!

791
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,800
- Jesus Christ.
- My God...

792
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,640
OK, boys, this is where I turn off
unless you wanna see Warsaw.

793
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,080
Thanks a lot, man.

794
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,560
Impossible.

795
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,280
What are you seeing?

796
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,920
A one-room schoolhouse. There it is.

797
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:19,600
"... moved to this site July 4th, 1972."

798
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,920
They moved it.

799
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,160
What'd they move it for?

800
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,360
Who knows? History.

801
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,600
History, dammit.

802
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,160
Do you think...?

803
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,440
I don't know, but it do present
mind-boggling possibilities.

804
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,000
Sam, look at this old kerosene lamp.

805
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,920
Just a minute. Let me get this.

806
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,440
- Hi.
- Hiya, fellas. How are ya?

807
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,720
- It's a nice schoolhouse you have here.
- Sure is.

808
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,200
Come on. We gotta go, honey. Come on.

809
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,920
Now, we don't want any trouble,
fellas, OK?

810
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,920
Have the camera. It's worth something.
Have them both. What do you say?

811
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,840
I got a bit of money
I can let you have, huh?

812
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,920
Even give you these car keys.

813
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,240
- Don't shove me.
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

814
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,760
Hey, do you think it's still there?

815
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,600
I don't know.

816
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,680
Only one way to find out, I guess.

817
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,560
Why don't you watch the door?

818
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,600
Okey dokey.

819
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,440
Lightfoot?

820
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,520
Lightfoot!

821
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,360
- You all right, boy?
- Yeah.

822
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,600
It's nothin'.
I must be gettin' tired or somethin'.

823
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:08,120
Lift up on it and then ease the screw out.
Turn it with your hand.

824
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,200
I got it.

825
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,240
Sorry. My arm went numb.

826
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,640
Wow!

827
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,760
Lmpossible.

828
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,720
Good luck now. Thanks again.

829
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,720
Hey, hey, hey!

830
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,640
- Ride?
- Where you headed?

831
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,840
- See what's over the next mountain.
- Why not?

832
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,360
A little music.

833
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,440
Have a cigar.

834
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,080
Where did these come from?

835
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,520
<i>I've been saving them
for a celebration.</i>

836
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,600
After all, we won, didn't we?

837
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,840
I guess we did, for the time being.

838
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,920
No, we made it.

839
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,160
We made it.

840
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,920
Not bad.

841
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,720
You know... you know somethin'?

842
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:26,120
I don't think of us
as criminals, you know?

843
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,200
I feel we accomplished something.
A good job.

844
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,240
I feel proud of myself, man.

845
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,040
I feel like a hero.

846
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,640
Are you all right, kid?
You don't look too well.

847
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,160
I believe you're right.

848
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,720
Lightfoot!

849
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,800
You all right, kid? What's...

850
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,840
<i># If I knew the way, I'd go back home</i>

851
