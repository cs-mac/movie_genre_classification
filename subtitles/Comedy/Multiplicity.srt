{3949}{4043}Hi, Douglas.|How's it going?
{4047}{4181}- What did you do?|- Demo'ed the driveway.
{4185}{4283}- Nice job, too.|- What's the problem?
{4310}{4424}It's the wrong driveway.|That's a problem, isn't it?
{4428}{4564}2933, Vic.|This is 2935!
{4627}{4724}We're in the wrong...|These guys are morons.
{4728}{4867}- I'm sorry. It's going to cost.|- It's going to cost who?
{4871}{5000}I'm in a bad way right now.|Money's very tight with me.
{5004}{5163}I can't afford to eat this,|even if it was my fault.
{5168}{5299}Shut up, Vic.|What am I going to do?
{5323}{5439}All right.|We're going to do both driveways.
{5443}{5561}No matter how long it takes.|And if you say one more word -
{5565}{5701}- I'll beat you to death|with a drywall hammer.
{5705}{5805}- You got it?|- It makes sense to me. Thank you.
{6037}{6127}Hello. Kinney.
{6132}{6286}Problem this morning? Giving away|free driveways? Come to my place.
{6290}{6415}No. Fax those plans right now.|Hold on.
{6443}{6583}Hi, hon. I was just about to call.|What's the matter?
{6587}{6726}Really? No, I know what it is.|It's the hot water heater.
{6810}{6900}My fax machine's gone psycho again.
{6904}{6979}What's up?
{7000}{7065}Do you hate me?
{7069}{7199}Do you want me dead? A guy from|Beverly Hills is going to sue me.
{7204}{7304}- You ruined his driveway?|- Yes, we did.
{7308}{7411}- Like a prank?|- No, Del.
{7416}{7572}Don't worry about it. It's my fault.|I'll fix it on my own time.
{7576}{7699}When? Ted told me you haven't|finished the Malibu job yet.
{7703}{7777}You know what I think?
{7781}{7907}- No, what do you think?|- We'll have to put in more hours.
{7912}{8046}This isn't a nine-to-five job.|We had a saying where I worked last.
{8050}{8146}"Unless you come in Saturday,|don't bother coming in Sunday."
{8168}{8303}- Are we going to work weekends?|- Weekends, nights, holidays.
{8332}{8446}My office. Two minutes.
{8894}{8959}Do you have any stegosauruses?
{8964}{9062}No. I have an iguanodon|and a tyrannosaurus.
{9129}{9231}I fished a stegosaurus.|Hi. dad.
{9236}{9349}- Good hand. Hi.|- Did you look at the water heater?
{9353}{9482}- I just walked in the door.|- No bath tonight, Zack.
{9486}{9563}Brush your teeth and go to bed.
{9600}{9674}You missed Campfire Girls.
{9678}{9780}I'm not in Campfire Girls.|I'm a Brownie.
{9784}{9939}- It was Jennifer's graduation.|- Man, I forgot!
{9944}{10039}I phoned and reminded you.
{10044}{10142}I totally forgot.|Was she upset?
{10146}{10256}Yes. All the fathers were there.|Even the divorced ones.
{10260}{10360}- And the lesbian moms?|- Both of them.
{10364}{10464}- Where is she now?|- In the den. Drinking.
{10468}{10631}- She's asleep. Where were you?|- I had to work late.
{10636}{10762}- King fired DeGrazzi.|- You're kidding. Why?
{10766}{10896}He does bad work.|But at least he does it slowly.
{10900}{11032}- Who will replace him?|- The guy you sleep with.
{11036}{11127}The video store guy.
{11132}{11259}I knew you were dating, but not|that you were sleeping with him.
{11263}{11417}That's great. It's like a promotion.|It's not great?
{11421}{11551}- Guess who'll do my job.|- You're going to do it all?
{11555}{11685}- Will they give you more money?|- It's more of a prestige thing.
{11689}{11824}They'll probably give me a plaque|or a certificate for being so great.
{11891}{12014}That's ridiculous. We hardly|ever see you. Can't you say no?
{12018}{12179}Yes, if you want to catch your own|food. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
{12183}{12270}I'll go check on the water heater.
{12380}{12436}Jennifer Kinney.
{12440}{12600}I'll seek the way that'll bring|me to the fllre of kindness, -
{12604}{12714}- Lighted by those who have|gone on the Campfllre Trall.
{12902}{12983}That's so great.
{12988}{13108}I don't know.|I'll have to think about it.
{13144}{13243}I really appreciate it.
{13252}{13339}Thank you.
{13344}{13435}I'll call you. Thanks. Bye.
{13439}{13583}- Hi. Hungry?|- No. I'm too tired to eat.
{13587}{13673}- Who was that?|- Valerie.
{13677}{13763}Who helped her dial the phone?
{13768}{13878}Don't start. The company|made her regional manager.
{13882}{14034}When I quit work to have Zack, they|thought more of me than of Valerie.
{14038}{14142}- Did she call to tell you the news?|- No...
{14146}{14287}She offered me her old job,|now that she's been promoted.
{14344}{14547}- Are you going back to work?|- Yes. What do you think?
{14632}{14707}What do I think?
{14712}{14891}The first couple of months you won't|make anything because it's hard.
{14895}{14988}We're paying more for child care.
{14992}{15125}We're both working and then we're|both not going to Campfire Girls.
{15129}{15289}- Maybe you could help out more.|- How am I going to work that out?
{15293}{15397}I just meant in emergencies.
{15401}{15581}A real estate emergency?|My whole life's an emergency.
{15622}{15706}I'm not going back to work, am I?
{15710}{15842}We always said I would,|but now I realise I never will.
{15906}{16053}Take my job. Go build condos.|Make sure to be there at 6:00.
{16577}{16655}Call an exorcist.
{16693}{16836}I don't know where it came from.|I'm sorry, Laura.
{16964}{17047}I'm sorry.
{17128}{17259}This is stupid.|We just need to get a schedule.
{17264}{17366}We don't need a schedule.|We need a miracle.
{17439}{17535}GEMINI INSTITUTE|MALIBU. CALIFORNIA
{17568}{17714}Once we get all this duct work in,|this should just fly.
{17733}{17889}Are you paid to watch her ass?|Because you do an excellent job.
{17893}{17987}We've got a problem down here.
{18030}{18100}I don't believe this.
{18104}{18185}Have a seat.|Damn!
{18204}{18315}Get out of the way.|Man. what is this?
{19148}{19319}I'm sorry. I just went crazy.|We'll turn the water back on now.
{19348}{19487}- This thing goes off all the time.|- Tough business.
{19491}{19571}- What do you do?|- Not mine. Yours.
{19575}{19660}Yes, really tough.
{19687}{19782}What do you do to relax?
{19786}{19915}- Well, play golf.|- That's a great game. How often?
{19919}{19979}Let's see...
{19984}{20104}Never. I'll have to cut back.|That's really going to hurt.
{20125}{20225}You don't have to live this way.
{20229}{20374}With all due respect...|I forgot to go to medical school.
{20378}{20478}- I can help you.|- Help me how?
{20482}{20580}Change your life.
{20584}{20733}- What do you guys do around here?|- We make miracles.
{20859}{20923}Sure.
{20992}{21039}Call me.
{21057}{21160}I feel guilty for not spending|enough time with my family.
{21164}{21372}Then I get resentful because I|don't have enough time for myself.
{21376}{21558}Work is first, my family is a close|second and I'm a distant third.
{21618}{21731}- Is that crazy?|- I'm not a psychiatrist.
{21736}{21931}And you don't need one. Real|problems require real solutions.
{21952}{22143}- Well, then... What do you do?|- I told you. I make miracles.
{22148}{22251}I create time.
{22268}{22364}I make clones.
{22440}{22509}Doug, sit down.
{22544}{22719}I'm a geneticist. 15 years ago|I started cloning viruses.
{22723}{22840}And then, ten years ago,|I cloned an earthworm.
{22844}{22979}- God bless you, sir.|- And then... a chimp.
{23066}{23135}And last year...
{23206}{23279}Last year...
{23368}{23485}- Hi there.|- Just in time.
{23489}{23619}- Doug is doing our new offices.|- I know Doug.
{23624}{23752}He and I went over the plans|one day. You were sailing.
{23847}{23899}Wait a minute.
{23903}{24028}- You understand my suggestion?|- Sure. What's not to understand?
{24032}{24167}- You xerox people.|- In a way.
{24172}{24307}The procedure takes about two hours.|It takes more or less two hours.
{24312}{24396}Then you have everything you need.
{24400}{24494}What is it that I need?
{24498}{24672}- Time!|- All you need. For everything.
{24708}{24851}Let's say I was interested.|What would a..?
{24855}{24952}Nothing fancy,|just a basic...
{24956}{25055}What would a basic clone job cost?
{25181}{25289}- Doctor, we're ready for you.|- Very good.
{25314}{25436}I hate to sound like a baby,|but promise me it'll be all right.
{25440}{25537}You're going to be fine.|There's nothing to worry about.
{25541}{25670}- I won't be like them. will I?|- I hope not.
{25684}{25736}Watch your head.
{25820}{25898}Lie back and put your feet|in the stirrups.
{25939}{26094}Did you see "The Fly"? Jeff Goldblum|came out with enormous eyes.
{26098}{26193}Peripheral vision is one thing,|but this is a bad look.
{26197}{26322}And he eats everything with|these little hands and everything.
{26326}{26415}Take it easy.
{26444}{26503}Well... What is that thing?
{26508}{26646}- This'll help you relax.|- So far it isn't working.
{26650}{26795}I'm sorry. My uncle went to the|dentist, and he was never the same.
{26800}{26933}I don't know if he got that|suction thing lodged in his throat.
{26937}{27039}But after that he was always,|"Hi, Doug... What's wrong?"
{27043}{27179}- Count backwards from 100.|- Sure. Like that'll work.
{28927}{29057}- Am I all right?|- You're fine.
{29074}{29189}Well?|I mean...
{29193}{29351}Is it..? Is it a boy?|I mean, did it work?
{29481}{29579}- Is that it?|- No. I'm afraid you're it.
{29599}{29715}What do you mean?|I can't be it.
{29719}{29807}- You mean. I'm the clone?|- That's right.
{29811}{29985}- No. I'm me. He must be the clone.|- No. I'm me.
{29989}{30102}- Help me out. I'm me, right?|- Look here.
{30106}{30235}- I must be me.|- Hold this.
{30239}{30349}Attaboy.|Now... look here.
{30436}{30547}- You see that?|- I see a "2".
{30551}{30631}There you go.
{30663}{30753}Wait, I remember everything.
{30757}{30889}I came in. I put this on.|I remember getting the shot.
{30893}{31035}You have all Doug's feelings and|memories right up to the cloning.
{31039}{31172}But now, when you have different|experiences, you'll diverge.
{31176}{31313}- What do I feed it?|- Feed it? What am I? A hamster?
{31317}{31483}- Sorry. I mean, it eats something.|- He's a person, just like you.
{31487}{31647}He'll get duplicate identification|here. You take care of the rest.
{31652}{31808}Now I'll leave you two alone.|You'll have a lot to talk about.
{31852}{31919}Astonishing.
{32250}{32394}- What?|- Nothing.
{32452}{32555}So... Where are you from?
{32637}{32767}- Stay down low. Really low.|- You want me to get under the car?
{32790}{32878}Good.|Laura's not home.
{33168}{33267}- The Mildew Suite.|- We'll fix it all up.
{33295}{33355}Am I really going to live here?
{33407}{33574}You can't live with me and Laura.|She'll wake up, roll over and say:
{33578}{33716}"Doug, you two have to get to work|or you'll be late."
{33720}{33864}Don't worry. We'll clean up, put|down some rugs, get a TV...
{33868}{34010}We ought to get a satellite dish.|Get all the sports and movies...
{34014}{34166}I don't know about that...|I don't think Laura'll go for that.
{34170}{34273}- I knew it. You're whipped.|- I'm not whipped.
{34277}{34360}You're whipped, partner.
{34381}{34496}- Fine, I'm whipped.|- Some guys are whipped. It's okay.
{34500}{34602}No, you're right.|We've got to get a plan together.
{34606}{34722}Think fast. Wear these|till you get some of your own.
{34726}{34825}Don't make me want to kick your ass.
{34829}{34913}Come on. Come on.
{34934}{35089}Look at this. This is a great coat.|I love this old coat.
{35093}{35231}- Always use the garden gate.|- We should black out the windows.
{35236}{35360}Good idea. We have to come|up with a strategy for work.
{35364}{35493}- We're going to get a lot done.|- We're going to kick ass.
{35497}{35605}- And Ted...|- We're going to destroy Ted.
{35609}{35739}We'll ruin him. Bring him down.|Crush him. And I'll break his neck.
{35868}{35939}Laura's home.
{36007}{36058}Hi, honey.
{36407}{36485}Zack, help me.
{36560}{36703}- What are you doing up there?|- I was looking for something.
{36739}{36863}- You look really beautiful today.|- I do?
{36867}{36938}Do you want to go to the pony rides?
{36951}{37011}We could go to the movies tonight.
{37333}{37438}We could car pool, if you want.|No, I could pick you up.
{37484}{37631}- Doug! When did you get here?|- Six. Half day today, Teddy?
{37635}{37775}Let's have that meeting now, Del.|Here's the report on the Palisades.
{37779}{37913}- When did you do all this?|- We should do them every morning.
{37917}{37973}Two minutes. Conference room.
{37977}{38109}Sure...|Find out what he had for breakfast.
{38312}{38457}- Morning. Meeting start yet?|- I thought you were in the meeting.
{38495}{38644}- Did you see me?|- Yes, but in a different shirt.
{38648}{38803}Yes, but do you know why?|I spilled coffee on it.
{38808}{38930}- Then I went to my truck when...|- I was in the ladies room?
{38934}{39066}Perfect. I have another shirt.|which I keep for emergencies.
{39070}{39258}Like when I spill coffee.|Also, I got out my briefcase.
{39262}{39370}Then I came back. and I|forgot the meeting had started.
{39374}{39538}- Shouldn't you go back in?|- Yes, but I must go to the truck.
{39542}{39659}I'll get the original shirt.|It's dry now. And I like it better.
{39679}{39803}So when I come out of the meeting|I'll be wearing the original shirt.
{39808}{39945}- Are you okay?|- No problem. Never been better.
{39949}{40035}Why don't you forget all about it?
{40088}{40180}- Del King Construction.|- Is Doug Kinney there?
{40184}{40349}- He's in a meeting. Who is it?|- Carl.
{40353}{40472}- Roger.|- Roger who?
{40476}{40533}Carl Rogerson.
{40537}{40618}Phone call for you, Doug.
{40683}{40746}- What's going on?|- Who is it?
{40750}{40838}It's me. You.|It's us.
{40842}{40975}Hold on. I'll take it in my office.
{41000}{41061}I'm too busy to talk to myself.
{41110}{41191}- What's up?|- What are you doing there?
{41195}{41319}- Where should I be?|- I mean, you just went to work?
{41324}{41480}- You wanted to be home more.|- Yes, but we must discuss this.
{41484}{41599}We have to coordinate some stuff.|Anyway, how's it going?
{41604}{41688}Good. Everything's under control.
{41692}{41777}I'll go out to the Palisades later.
{41781}{41898}- Then I'll go by Sherman Oaks.|- I took care of it, pal.
{41902}{42041}- I'll go to North Hollywood.|- I'll do that on the way.
{42045}{42129}- Reseda?|- Already did it.
{42133}{42315}I'll tell you what then...|What should I do?
{42319}{42433}I don't know. Start living it up.|I've got to go.
{42536}{42583}Kinney!
{42604}{42731}You think you're hot shit.|But you won't fool anybody.
{42736}{42823}You read me?
{42963}{43071}I'm on top of you.|I see you, my friend.
{43357}{43446}Take this one.
{44100}{44168}What are you doing?|Don't kick it.
{44172}{44292}It's not soccer.|Fall on it! Fall on the ball!
{44424}{44491}Defence, let's go.
{44496}{44561}Zack!
{44565}{44695}- Mom said you had to work.|- You're playing, I'm coming.
{44699}{44792}You looked good.|Go sit with your team.
{44796}{44938}I don't pay 160 bucks|to sit and watch my kid eat oranges.
{44942}{45071}He played four downs. That's all|I have to play him. Period.
{45076}{45245}Let go of that. I'm a lawyer, not|just a coach. I'll kick your ass...
{45249}{45392}Don't touch me! Back off.|I've had it!
{45484}{45599}- I don't need this.|- Don't pay attention to those guys.
{45604}{45734}I'm doing the best I can do.|It's not like I'm getting paid.
{45738}{45846}- No. You could be out playing golf.|- I love golf.
{45850}{46021}They don't know what they're talking|about. I appreciate what you do.
{46025}{46155}Can I mention one thing? You should|think about a multiple-set offence.
{46160}{46308}- Four of these kids are morons.|- I understand. If you used Zack...
{46312}{46430}- Zack is my kid.|- That's it. Here you go.
{46434}{46563}You turn this franchise around.|See you in the Super Bowl.
{46685}{46797}- Hi. What are you doing?|- Dad's cooking dinner.
{46801}{46891}- Spaghetti?|- Yes. Just like the old days.
{46895}{47037}Dad's the new football coach.|He's great. We scored!
{47041}{47211}We've got a good team.|Go get washed up for dinner.
{47284}{47345}Thanks for coaching, Dad.
{47349}{47499}- I thought you had extra work.|- Not any more.
{47504}{47612}- Did you get fired?|- No, no.
{47616}{47762}I was tired of carrying that heavy|load, so I went in to King and said:
{47766}{47919}"You either get me some help|or I'm walking." Taste this.
{47923}{48012}- What did he say?|- What do you think he said?
{48016}{48190}I thought he was going to cry.|But he agreed to hire some help.
{48194}{48346}- The guy's like an assistant.|- I'm glad. Who?
{48350}{48455}Who? You mean, who's the guy?|Just a guy.
{48459}{48571}A new guy you don't know.|Very new guy.
{48576}{48704}- What you're saying is, he's new?|- He's going to run everything.
{48708}{48835}- And you trust him?|- Yes, like I trust myself.
{48839}{49001}- Great. What will you do now?|- Now? I don't know.
{49005}{49155}Right now I thought|I might do this.
{49247}{49381}- I want you to take that new job.|- My job? You mean it?
{49385}{49582}Yes! I can still drop off the kids|at school and I can leave by three.
{49586}{49737}So if you can just back me up|occasionally.
{49741}{49837}- Let's get the kids to bed early.|- What time is it?
{49841}{49967}- 6:15.|- Kids, bedtime!
{50421}{50477}Hi, Doug.
{50481}{50630}- Hi. Vic. What time is it?|- It's... 5:30 in New York.
{50634}{50783}- Then it's 2:30 here.|- Why is it on New York time?
{50788}{50919}I bought it in New York|and couldn't reset the darn thing.
{50923}{51054}- When did I tell you to be here?|- No specific time.
{51058}{51157}Yes. 1:30.|In fact, I repeated it twice.
{51161}{51233}Do you want solid or laminate?
{51237}{51359}That's strange. For some reason|2:30 just stuck in my head.
{51363}{51455}I'll stick something in your head.
{51460}{51526}You're fired.
{51530}{51669}Take your New York watch and|your fat ass and get out of here.
{51688}{51838}- For being a few minutes late?|- No, no. Three, four. That's a few.
{51842}{51984}You were 60 minutes late.|That's not a few. Hit it.
{52117}{52218}Is this a negotiating tactic?
{52234}{52287}I'm on my way.
{52292}{52367}Take your hands off me, now.
{52389}{52531}Now I'm getting mad. You've made|a point. What's happening now?
{52589}{52708}Are you guys on a break?|Let's go!
{52712}{52842}- What got into you today?|- I should've fired him long ago.
{52846}{52972}- But he has like 34 kids.|- He's been married 17 times.
{52976}{53119}- What have you got there?|- You ought to see these plans.
{53124}{53274}Hi, it's me. I need to work late.|Could you pick up the kids?
{53278}{53349}- Sure.|- It's not that simple.
{53353}{53471}- It's picture day at ballet class.|- That'll be cute.
{53475}{53635}Go home, give her a bath, mousse|her hair and be there at 4:30.
{53639}{53739}- Can you do this?|- I can do it. I'll see you.
{53744}{53843}Okay. Bye.
{54303}{54427}- Hello?|- Take the kids to the ballet.
{54432}{54569}- Wait. I was just teeing off here.|- Not today, pal. See you later.
{54674}{54819}I don't want a shower.|I want a bath. I hate showers!
{54824}{54912}Zack, get her on that side.|Contain her.
{55081}{55173}- You're going.|- I'm not going.
{55236}{55335}Let me see.|Turn around.
{55339}{55442}Good. I like it.|Let's go.
{55672}{55767}Hi. Sorry we're late.|We're here for the pictures.
{55772}{55907}Didn't anyone call you?|It was changed to tomorrow.
{55911}{56024}- No, seriously. The pictures.|- Tomorrow.
{56028}{56128}Get a photographer down here now.
{56144}{56292}- Right now.|- I'll see what I can do.
{56717}{56796}Hello? She's not here right now.
{56881}{56940}You can leave a message.
{56944}{57011}Hold on a second.
{57044}{57172}Can you call back?|I have a little emergency here.
{57176}{57331}One of the kids swallowed a spoon.|No, just a teaspoon. She'll live.
{57438}{57488}Keep it down!
{57492}{57589}- He took it.|- Zack, give it back to her.
{57593}{57648}I'm telling you, give it back.
{57672}{57783}- Doodyhead!|- You're a doodyhead.
{57876}{57983}Bath time. Go on up and don't|come out till you're married.
{57987}{58091}- Could we have some cake?|- Get up there.
{58378}{58550}I'm sorry. This couple wanted|to see the same house over and over.
{58554}{58740}- We're both here.|- Of course, sir. Right this way.
{58744}{58910}- This is like having an affair.|- We're too busy to have an affair.
{59064}{59124}I think he likes you.
{59128}{59262}I like him too, but there's no|future in it. Besides, I have you.
{59266}{59319}What are we celebrating?
{59345}{59470}You know.|I've been thinking...
{59474}{59596}- This isn't working out.|- What?
{59600}{59735}This new arrangement.|I'm not getting anything done.
{59739}{59840}All I do is cook and do laundry.
{59844}{59974}I pick up and drop off the kids,|dress them and clean up after them.
{59978}{60099}I've done that for ten years.|You've done it for a month.
{60104}{60191}- It comes more naturally to you.|- How so?
{60195}{60281}You're a nurturer. You are.
{60285}{60426}First of all you have two|X-chromosomes, and I have...
{60430}{60585}It's scientifically proven. That's|why you have breasts and I don't.
{60589}{60691}Just what are you saying?
{60696}{60826}This system isn't working. We have|to go back to the way it was.
{60830}{60971}You take care of the house.|and I do what I need to do.
{60975}{61080}And what do you need to do?
{61084}{61215}I have to go back to work.|And that's it.
{61219}{61386}No, that's not it. I love my job,|and I'm doing great at it.
{61390}{61543}Valerie is moving me into estates.|I'll be making a good living soon.
{61548}{61703}I know it's hard, and I can imagine|your day, but I'm not quitting.
{61707}{61818}We'll just have to work it out.|And that is it.
{61888}{62015}It's funny you think that's it.|Because that's not it.
{62020}{62143}What I said... That's it.|What you said... not it.
{62147}{62251}No, Doug. This is it.
{62288}{62394}I can't believe|you lured me here for this.
{62398}{62502}Can I have some water?|I didn't lure you into anything.
{62571}{62687}I had no idea. You tease me|and I kind of liked it...
{62692}{62789}But I thought|you were a happily married guy.
{62793}{62927}- I sleep in the guest house.|- My God. Is it that bad?
{62968}{63066}It's pretty bad.
{63070}{63194}She's sleeping with another guy.|That's the God's honest truth.
{63198}{63417}- She doesn't even know I exist.|- It must be so hard for you.
{63421}{63562}- It is.|- Do you want to go to my place?
{63656}{63799}- I understand...|- Doug, are you all right?
{63909}{64031}- What's wrong?|- It's a football injury. Rose Bowl.
{64036}{64160}- You played?|- I fell out of the bleachers.
{64164}{64248}Can I help you to the car?
{64252}{64347}- Let's get some dessert.|- You're still hungry?
{64352}{64447}My life's a shambles.|I need pie.
{64452}{64556}Can you breathe?|Should I Heimlich you?
{64560}{64721}- I'll get you some more water.|- No! Laura! Look at me.
{64725}{64800}- How do I look?|- Crazy.
{64804}{64964}Let's order. Let's get something|to eat. We'll feel better.
{64968}{65138}- I'm going to the ladies' room.|- Me too. To the men's room.
{65142}{65293}I mean, I'll accompany you to...|You know what I mean.
{65448}{65524}Boy, everything looks so good.
{65528}{65638}Doug, that's the wine list.
{65642}{65780}I thought there were a hell of|a lot of beverages on there.
{65784}{65910}Will you order? You know what I|like. Anything with barbecue sauce.
{66048}{66189}- What are you doing here?|- It's my favourite restaurant.
{66193}{66367}- I know. What about Noreen?|- She's a colleague. We're talking.
{66372}{66519}- Come on. You're up to something.|- Are you jealous?
{66524}{66659}- You can't cheat on Laura.|- You can't. I never get to see her.
{66753}{66857}- This isn't working out.|- What do you mean?
{66861}{67048}Our deal. We'll switch. I'll go back|to work and you'll stay home.
{67095}{67191}I'm going to do housework?
{67196}{67398}I thought you were joking. There's|no way that's ever going to happen.
{67402}{67471}I got you the job, pal!
{67475}{67606}You think I'm a genie? You rub a|lamp and I do what you want me to?
{67610}{67769}- I have things I need to do.|- Look, things change...
{67773}{67939}You took away my wife, my family,|my friends. All I have is my job.
{67943}{68102}I'm doing the work you couldn't do.|And I'm making it pay, so back off.
{68286}{68431}- I'm just washing his face.|- Of course. Please, carry on.
{68654}{68754}- What are you doing?|- I had to do something.
{68758}{68936}We'll talk later. I'll distract|Laura. Get Noreen out of here.
{68975}{69041}He's in way over his head.
{69090}{69213}Doug, I'm ready for dessert.|That's not your sport coat.
{69217}{69325}I switched with a guy|in the men's room.
{69329}{69423}We traded. Men do that all the time.
{69428}{69512}- Let's go.|- I thought you wanted pie.
{69516}{69596}It's your wife!
{69611}{69740}- May we join you?|- Have we met?
{70228}{70353}- What happened to your shirt?|- Water spots.
{70357}{70521}- I don't want to fight about this.|- Great.
{70525}{70613}- About what?|- My job.
{70617}{70768}Hell, no. We don't want to fight|about that. That'd be dumb.
{70772}{70914}- Laura, do you love me?|- Of course I love you.
{70918}{71008}Then kiss me.
{71124}{71206}Come on. Let's go.
{71268}{71371}That guy looks a lot...
{71678}{71743}I'm sorry... He's kissing her!
{71819}{71925}- Come on.|- Stop pushing?
{72440}{72539}Hi.|Can I talk to you for a second?
{72543}{72670}Sure.|You want a beer?
{72674}{72811}Actually I could use a couple.
{72892}{72966}Two, I'd like you to meet...
{72970}{73121}- Three.|- Hi, how are you?
{73198}{73326}Are you nuts?|Are you mentally nuts?
{73330}{73457}- I have it all figured out.|- What do we need him for?
{73461}{73584}He's going to help me with the kids,|and when you're not working -
{73588}{73668}- you guys can hang out together.
{73672}{73836}- I'm giddy!|- We could do a lot together.
{73840}{73971}- You're lonely. I got you a friend.|- Where is he going to stay?
{73976}{74173}Here with you. That way you have a|friend and a roommate. Look at him.
{74177}{74253}I have an idea. How about no?
{74257}{74377}Doug, he needs space.|It's a shock. I think.
{74381}{74501}The idea was for you to work while|I was with Laura and the kids.
{74505}{74683}Well, it isn't working. I need a|break, so I can work on the house.
{74687}{74830}Or sit and think a single thought.|Or play golf every once in a while.
{74834}{74977}I've been working since I was|12 years old. It's break time.
{74981}{75103}I think the 12-year-old is saying:|"You need time for Doug."
{75108}{75295}- What a suck!|- I don't know what a suck is.
{75299}{75413}- Come on. For Doug.|- Fine. Screw your life up.
{75417}{75528}- You're in way over your head.|- You're two good-looking guys.
{75532}{75635}- I'll make this up to you.|- Start by cloning Laura.
{75640}{75755}Cloning, Laura...|Bye, Doug. Have a good time.
{75759}{75874}I'm worried about him.|He's uptight, isn't he?
{75878}{75963}He'll be all right.
{76020}{76149}That's a lot of ribs.|What is that? A slab?
{77013}{77115}Okay kids, hurry up.|We're going to be late.
{77119}{77179}Books, jackets.
{77184}{77331}I'll drive the kids to school. Take|a couple of minutes to yourself.
{77370}{77503}- Thanks.|- That's all right.
{77507}{77745}Look, what I said about you|quitting your job... Forget it.
{77749}{77859}You have as much right to work|as I do.
{77864}{77962}- You mean it?|- I mean it.
{77966}{78051}I just want you to be happy.
{78055}{78140}I'll give you a foot rub tonight.
{78539}{78662}- How's it going?|- Fine. I'm baking. Where are you?
{78666}{78841}At the Laker game. I meant to go|home, but I felt like stopping here.
{78845}{78911}Have a good time.
{78916}{79058}- Did you hear from Two?|- He's still at work.
{79062}{79167}The guy's a horse.|I'll be home soon.
{79172}{79263}All right.|See you.
{80216}{80335}- What happened?|- Nothing. I had a terrible dream.
{80340}{80454}- What was it? Your dream?|- I don't know.
{80458}{80563}Go back to sleep.|Everything will be okay.
{80772}{80883}What was that all about?|Up there, with Laura?
{80888}{81034}- Who won the game?|- Don't worry about that. Lakers.
{81038}{81136}- What were you doing in bed?|- Nothing.
{81140}{81259}We were watching TV. Laura wanted|to go to bed. What could I do?
{81263}{81395}What do you mean,|"she wanted to go to bed"?
{81399}{81514}- What do you mean?|- You know what I mean.
{81518}{81595}- Did you have sex with my wife?|- No!
{81600}{81783}No, Douglas! Here was the plan.|When she was asleep, I'd sneak out.
{81787}{81895}I guess I dozed off.|Nothing happened.
{81899}{82095}She did kind of brush me in that|region, but I mamboed out of there.
{82099}{82191}Doug, he mamboed out.
{82326}{82430}Listen to me. Both of you.|Rule number one.
{82434}{82535}It's unbreakable.|Don't even try to bend this rule.
{82539}{82634}Nobody has sex with my wife|but me.
{82638}{82721}Fabulous rule, Doug.
{82725}{82834}- No clone nookie.|- You're the man, Doug.
{82838}{82927}Original nookie only.
{82931}{83064}- We're clear on that rule, right?|- Absolutely. It's locked in here.
{83172}{83266}- So, did you?|- No!
{83270}{83335}- Wimp.|- Slob.
{83340}{83415}The mambo king.
{83436}{83520}Watch the stern there!
{83524}{83662}Number eight,|it's a boat, not a bathtub.
{83996}{84147}- Did you enjoy sailing?|- It was more like bumper cars.
{84151}{84252}How about a nice|"I sailed with Walt" T-shirt?
{84256}{84439}Do you have an|"I got a refund from Walt" T-shirt?
{84443}{84587}I'd like to learn how to sail.|Do you have anything big enough -
{84592}{84723}- to take my whole family out|and not end up like Gilligan?
{84728}{84879}Great show. Remember the one|with the Harlem Globetrotters?
{84884}{84975}That was good. Believable, too.
{86782}{86899}- What the hell are you doing?|- How many of you are there?
{86903}{87122}That's our brother Doug. This is|Patti and Beth. We were dancing.
{87182}{87239}One's cuter than the next.
{87273}{87369}Are you as much fun|as Lance and Rico?
{87373}{87451}Lance and Ri..?
{87455}{87590}- You're Rico, I'm guessing.|- Guess again.
{87656}{87726}Even he can't tell them apart.
{87730}{87929}Look, can we have some privacy?|We have to have a family meeting.
{87933}{88045}- Wait..|- We were going to have a party.
{88049}{88131}- You're kidding, right?|- No.
{88135}{88311}- Are you a drag or what?|- Try to keep your voices down.
{88316}{88440}Goodnight, Lance!|Goodnight, Rico!
{88480}{88573}The adventures of Lance and Rico.
{88577}{88743}- Where did you meet them, Lance?|- They work at the Minimart.
{88747}{88851}Yes, they're clerks.
{88855}{89068}- Were the Slurpee girls busy?|- I stopped to pick up my dinner.
{89072}{89207}She offered to nuke my corn dog.|What am I going to say? No?
{89211}{89300}So we came back here to party.
{89304}{89438}- They were two very nice women.|- "Women" being the key word here.
{89442}{89574}You can't just bring|strangers up here.
{89578}{89693}- Are we supposed to be monks?|- He has a point.
{89697}{89791}A damn good point.
{89852}{89978}- What are you doing?|- What do you mean?
{89982}{90139}- I'm having a smoke.|- I can see that, but why?
{90143}{90280}I spent 1,000 dollars to quit.|Remember?
{90359}{90485}- Looks like it didn't take.|- Don't ever do that again.
{90512}{90614}- What are you going to do about it?|- I'll hit you so hard, he'll die.
{90618}{90808}Guys, come on. Let's sit down and|talk. You're angry. Like two lions.
{90812}{90891}- Shut up.|- I'm sorry.
{90895}{91040}- Where's your aspirin?|- Tylenol. In the kitchen.
{91044}{91080}I'll find it.
{91081}{91117}I'll find it.
{91121}{91241}Look at this place. It's a mess.|I can't leave you for a minute.
{91371}{91464}One, two, three, four.
{91468}{91554}Doug, if I might...
{91591}{91726}One, two, three...
{91764}{91868}- Four...|- Twelve.
{91900}{91981}Doug, I'd like you to meet Four.
{91985}{92081}I got a wallet.|That guy gave it to me.
{92151}{92237}I'm going to drive a car.
{92241}{92348}He's got a wallet.|Come here. Come here.
{92386}{92514}- Where did he come from?|- He'll help us out around here.
{92518}{92649}Do the day-to-day stuff. Clean the|house, take out the trash and so on.
{92653}{92792}Forget that!|What the hell is wrong with him?
{92815}{92879}Nothing.
{92884}{92999}Nothing's really wrong.|He's a little special.
{93003}{93072}He's fine. He'll be all right.
{93111}{93222}- He's special, all right.|- We made a copy from Two.
{93226}{93350}Sometimes a copy from a copy is|not quite as sharp as the original.
{93354}{93466}Leeds loved it.|because it was very experimental.
{93470}{93527}We got a great deal.
{93569}{93687}Leeds loved it?|Good. Because I hate it.
{93692}{93854}You can't just go around|cloning people. That's crazy!
{93937}{94029}Listen up.|Listen really clearly to me.
{94033}{94149}Rule number two. First of all...|We all remember rule number one.
{94153}{94305}- No sleeping with your wife.|- That's important.
{94309}{94443}- Rule number two: No more Dougs.|- This is plenty, I think.
{94447}{94590}I'll call Leeds tomorrow. We're|out of the Doug-making business.
{94594}{94721}- Am I clear? Am I clear on this?|- The book's closed on that one.
{94919}{95031}I like pizza.|I like it!
{95035}{95117}We're going to need a cage.
{95146}{95252}Bye, Steve.|Good party.
{95347}{95439}I like Steve.
{95548}{95693}- How did it go?|- I'm telling you, this is great!
{95697}{95807}You want some really great sailing?|Bring Mrs. Doug tomorrow -
{95812}{95938}- and come to Catalina|with Robin and me on my big boat.
{95942}{96071}We'll cruise the Avalon Harbour|at sunset. Champagne on board.
{96075}{96235}We'd leave you alone. You make love|right on the boat. Very romantic.
{96240}{96355}- Think about Catalina.|- I'll call you.
{96433}{96571}Honey, may I do that?|I want to show you something.
{96575}{96714}First of all, this piece|of aluminium foil is too small.
{96718}{96882}It can't cover it all, so you'll get|that hard crust around the meat. -
{96886}{96973}- and nobody wants to eat that.
{96977}{97109}At Christmas time|we can make an ornament out of it.
{97113}{97251}And save those fries. We'll paint|them and hang them on the tree.
{97255}{97366}The kids are going to love that.|Okay, we'll take a fresh piece.
{97370}{97503}Now we fold up one side.|Make sure we're even.
{97507}{97651}Then I fold once. twice or three|times. Whatever you need to fold it.
{97656}{97792}But don't just roll it over. Then|you have that lump in the middle.
{97796}{97899}Fold it nicely, so no air gets|in there. Air is our enemy.
{97903}{98092}Then take this.|Tuck, tuck, fold. T.T.F.
{98096}{98226}Two tucks and a fold.|I just think of Elizabeth Taylor.
{98230}{98379}Now roll it over nice and flat.|No air is going to get in there.
{98384}{98546}We could send it off to NASA and|nothing would happen. Now, the lid.
{98550}{98647}That's very nice.|Very nice.
{98651}{98817}Doug, I've noticed some things about|you lately that make me think...
{98878}{98966}- What?|- Nothing.
{98970}{99045}Go like this.
{99176}{99274}Can I just do something?
{99278}{99458}See what that does? It frames you|better. It gives you height.
{99486}{99616}Why don't you go relax|and let me finish cleaning up?
{99658}{99714}Why?
{99718}{99843}- Are you sure?|- I'm sure.
{99896}{100025}Freezer. Second shelf.|With all the other meat products.
{100029}{100205}Unless it's in a skin casing.|Then it goes lower... In the bin.
{100660}{100730}That was a great meal, honey.
{100734}{100916}- You cooked it.|- But you ate it.
{100961}{101060}Were you wearing that shirt earlier?
{101064}{101186}- This? Yes, sure.|- I'm losing it.
{101190}{101259}Dad, watch this.
{101277}{101427}- I'll show you "walking the dog".|- You just showed me before dinner.
{101431}{101543}I did?|That's right. I forgot.
{101548}{101633}You want to go get some ice cream?
{101637}{101729}Unless we already did.
{101764}{101893}- Doug, did you decide?|- Did I decide what?
{101897}{102001}What we talked about all evening.|You said you'd think about it.
{102029}{102135}I did.|I gave it a lot of thought.
{102158}{102255}What did you think?
{102259}{102355}Well, I gave it a lot of thought.
{102360}{102495}I think whatever you think is|probably the smartest thing to do.
{102499}{102637}Don't put this all on me.|They're your kids, too.
{102641}{102747}Can I say something?|Let's leave the kids out of this.
{102779}{102879}You want to go to Disney World|without the kids?
{102884}{103064}No. I don't want to do that.|That wouldn't be fair to the kids.
{103068}{103244}To go, just you and me, would be|stupid. When is it we're going?
{103248}{103430}- Christmas. I bought the tickets.|- Are you nuts?
{103434}{103511}- You told me to buy them.|- Not me.
{103516}{103648}- Not me. Not me.|- You're driving me crazy!
{103652}{103768}I call and you bite my head off.|At times you're as sweet as can be.
{103772}{103955}Then you're obsessed with details,|and now you don't even listen to me.
{103959}{104104}- What is going on with you?|- Nothing. Nothing's wrong with me.
{104108}{104267}You could have bipolar disorder|or multiple personalities.
{104272}{104358}Let's sail to Catalina.
{104362}{104548}- Drink wine and make love.|- Doug, you don't sail.
{104552}{104690}But I drink and make love.|The sailing... How hard can it be?
{104694}{104765}We can't just sail off to Catalina.
{104769}{104887}Let's be spontaneous!|We used to do stuff like this.
{104892}{105039}You're the one who wants to go|to Ecuador and throw harpoons.
{105044}{105176}- Doug, that's just talk.|- Let's do it. Why not?
{105180}{105324}Your job. My job. Jennifer's dance|recital. The Donaldsons' party.
{105328}{105426}- I'm not going to that.|- You said you were.
{105430}{105583}When you figure out what you want,|would you just let me know?
{106006}{106086}- Hello?|- In here, Doug.
{106299}{106373}Three?
{106377}{106487}- Can I talk to you for a second?|- Sure, Doug.
{106492}{106606}- What's up?|- I have to go away.
{106610}{106705}- It's a business trip.|- Business trip?
{106709}{106799}- I handle the business.|- He does. Steve.
{106804}{106973}Fine. it's not business. I need to|be alone and figure some things out.
{106977}{107112}You need to get centered. Good idea.|You deserve that.
{107116}{107279}- You have to be me night and day.|- What about rule number one?
{107283}{107389}Rule number one. Steve!|What's rule number one?
{107393}{107513}Rain Man, go floss yourself.
{107530}{107706}The rule stands. Remember when I had|a bronchial infection? You got it.
{107710}{107867}Cough. Tell her you don't want her|to catch it. Can you handle that?
{107871}{107992}- I have a sore throat and a fever.|- Do you want me to handle it?
{107996}{108116}- No. Thanks, though.|- I'm just trying to help out.
{108229}{108334}- Is he safe with that?|- We take the blade out.
{108338}{108429}We shave him while he's sleeping.
{108517}{108581}It's cute.
{108585}{108683}All right, I'm counting on you.
{108840}{108891}Hi. Walt.
{108895}{109019}- Where's your wife?|- She couldn't make it.
{109023}{109128}Don't you want to wait|until she can come?
{109132}{109274}- No. she'll come next time.|- All right. Come aboard.
{110627}{110697}Doug...
{110798}{110966}I'm sorry. I understand why you|wanted us to go away together.
{110997}{111150}It sounded romantic. But we don't|have to go away to make love.
{111188}{111344}- Are you all right?|- I'm coming down with something.
{111348}{111508}I've got a lot of phlegm,|and I'm burning up.
{111512}{111658}I think I have a fever.|We'd better not get close tonight.
{111662}{111774}- I'm not worried.|- I don't want you to get sick.
{111778}{111963}I just think... You know what?|Maybe if you'd not do that...
{112028}{112186}- Maybe I ought to sleep in the den.|- Just relax.
{112245}{112391}Hey, did you hear from your parents?|How are they?
{112440}{112550}I'm really feeling sick.
{112609}{112743}I'm going to make you feel better.
{112910}{113079}- You weren't that sick after all.|- No. I guess not.
{113084}{113258}That was so unusual.|I've never seen you cry like that.
{113300}{113472}That time when the souffle fell.|But besides that...
{113476}{113576}I guess I was just moved by it all.
{113580}{113699}- You know what I want now?|- No.
{113704}{113812}Graham crackers and chocolate milk.
{113832}{114017}- You want some?|- No, thanks. I've had plenty.
{114172}{114284}What have I done?|What have I done?
{114645}{114810}- Hey! Who ate all the bologna?|- Burglars.
{114814}{114979}- Did you eat everything?|- Count Chocula.
{115109}{115290}That's it. I'm starving. I'll sneak|in and get something to eat.
{115460}{115574}Doug, you startled me!|Change your mind?
{115578}{115719}Yes, I changed my mind.|I think.
{115723}{115786}Want some?
{116298}{116375}You taste good.
{116379}{116484}You taste pretty good yourself.
{116612}{116719}Remember when we used|to make love all over the house?
{116723}{116801}I remember.
{116805}{116975}Aren't you hungry?|Boy, I could go for one of these...
{117007}{117075}... canned hams.
{117192}{117337}Wait. I don't know if this is...|the worst idea in the world.
{117484}{117615}I don't think we should do this.|I have a really bad cough.
{117620}{117726}Of course it could clear up|in a second.
{117785}{117852}I want you.
{117856}{117951}I'm not so sure... Okay.
{118062}{118120}Grab that.
{118620}{118749}That was athletic.|Better than the Stair-Master.
{118753}{118917}I guess I got a little carried away.|Are you all right?
{118921}{119021}Shouldn't we go back upstairs?
{119025}{119161}- I guess. Here.|- Thanks.
{119293}{119447}Laura, I almost forgot. There are|some things I have to take care of.
{119452}{119554}- I'll be up in a minute.|- The kids.
{119595}{119687}I forgot to shut the windows|in the Volvo.
{119692}{119764}No problem. I'll get it.
{119827}{119915}Sorry about yelling!
{120568}{120631}Steve?
{120645}{120731}Oh, baby!
{120735}{120884}You're drenched.|I'm sorry. Come upstairs.
{120888}{120983}I don't know what I was thinking.
{120987}{121196}You're soaking. Come on|and get out of these wet clothes.
{121250}{121325}I'm sorry, I was so selfish.
{121329}{121404}Let me help you with those pants.
{121454}{121511}Again?
{121649}{121756}- My peepee.|- I see.
{121916}{122032}So much for rule number one.
{122249}{122302}A hell of a ride.
{122306}{122434}Maybe we'll get the onshore wind|tomorrow. That'll be easier.
{122438}{122571}You ought to sit up|or you'll start feeling ill again.
{122576}{122744}- I'm sorry I hurled on your dog.|- It's not the first time.
{122748}{122851}Some people really shouldn't sail.
{122855}{123005}Maybe not. I was pretty|miserable there for a while.
{123040}{123132}It wasn't just|the getting sick part.
{123136}{123287}When I was down there|with my head in the head...
{123291}{123457}My whole life actually|flashed before my eyes.
{123461}{123603}The funny part is...|I wasn't in it.
{123696}{123770}I've got to get back into my life.
{123805}{123917}I have no idea what the hell|you're talking about.
{123921}{124003}But good luck to you.
{124146}{124316}- 103. You're not going anywhere.|- You're not going anywhere, Steve.
{124320}{124458}- The building inspector's coming.|- You're too sick to go anywhere.
{124484}{124590}- Del King.|- Del? It's Doug.
{124594}{124740}- How are you doing?|- Not good. I can't make it today.
{124778}{124957}- Why don't you rip out my liver?|- You're being a little dramatic?
{124961}{125064}If we don't get inspected today,|that guy won't be back for a month.
{125068}{125209}I understand. But I'm really ill.|Can't someone else meet him?
{125213}{125381}Nobody knows this job like you do.|Get down here or you're fired!
{125418}{125494}Nice attitude. Del.
{125512}{125608}- He said...|- I heard him. I have to go.
{125612}{125739}- You can't go.|- I have to go.
{125756}{125884}- Maybe I'll lie down for a...|- Take care of him. I'm going.
{125980}{126082}Sorry, Steve,|that leg has to come off.
{126116}{126219}All right.|So these are the water pipes.
{126223}{126343}And you've got hot and cold|available in all units.
{126348}{126479}That's very nice.|And what's that? It looks like...
{126483}{126637}It's the gas line, which would feed|natural gas to all appliances -
{126641}{126732}- which would require natural gas.
{126780}{126870}You're not answering the question.
{126874}{127016}- What was the question?|- The plan showed two-inch lines.
{127020}{127154}Go like this.|You've got something... That's it.
{127158}{127319}- Why did you go with one-inch?|- That's right. Now I remember.
{127395}{127453}So what's the answer?
{127514}{127590}Can you excuse me for a second?
{127706}{127802}Why did you decide|to use one-inch gas lines?
{127828}{127900}Knock it off!
{127963}{128110}Originally there were two ovens,|but King cut it back to one.
{128619}{128755}Got it. I remember now. The original|plan called for two ovens.
{128760}{128883}Somebody decided to cut back|to one to save money, I guess.
{128887}{128997}I like a double oven.|Sure there's a lot of bending, -
{129001}{129147}- but you can have a turkey in|the bottom and rutabaga up top.
{129152}{129260}- It's nice for entertaining.|- But you stubbed out for two.
{129264}{129331}What if someone wants two ovens?
{129420}{129544}I don't know.|Hold on a second.
{129548}{129657}- This is ridiculous.|- Wait...
{129661}{129833}He can't answer the questions, he|runs off. You know what that means?
{129837}{129954}- Alcohol and drugs.|- God knows what he's done here.
{129958}{130091}Because of the oven we took|the laundry room off this line.
{130095}{130207}- We ran a separate line for that.|- What about the gas fireplaces?
{130255}{130377}Thinking. Thinking.|Boy, does he have some tough ones.
{130381}{130446}He doesn't know what he's doing.
{130489}{130599}Wait a second.|You're entitled to your opinion.
{130603}{130764}But it's not fair to judge anyone|after one superficial conversation.
{130768}{130890}- We have to re-inspect everything.|- Kinney. Doug Kinney.
{130894}{131052}Stop all work until further notice.|I'll be back in about three weeks.
{131056}{131239}Get your act together or you'll lose|your license. And get him some help.
{131255}{131407}You what?|You got fired? How?
{131438}{131578}No, no, no.|Just come home.
{132067}{132155}Doug, what are you doing home?
{132160}{132298}- Are you sick?|- Yes. We're out of Pepto-Bismol.
{132302}{132448}- What about your big inspection?|- I guess I missed it, didn't I?
{132468}{132591}Wasn't it important? I rearranged|everything so you could go.
{132596}{132748}What are you, some kind of saint?|Do you want me to give you a medal?
{132870}{132939}Now I feel better.
{133128}{133273}Doug, you've been under|a lot of pressure lately.
{133277}{133407}But when you talk like that,|I think you mean it. It hurts me.
{133412}{133558}Something is happening lately.|I feel like I don't know you.
{133562}{133625}It scares me, Doug.
{133629}{133785}You tell yourself|that your problems aren't serious.
{133789}{133979}They happen to everyone. You hope|they'll go away, but they don't.
{134020}{134157}It's like this house.|You always said you'd fix it up.
{134184}{134350}"I'll fix it," you always say.|But nothing ever gets fixed.
{134389}{134529}I need to know what you're feeling.
{134565}{134699}I need to know if you still love me.
{134704}{134806}Please, just tell me|what you want.
{134872}{134946}I want pizza.
{135025}{135098}What?
{135144}{135275}I want pizza.|Give me some pizza.
{135917}{136098}Hey! Are you guys crazy?|What if Laura walks in?
{136102}{136179}Not much chance of that, sport.
{136184}{136295}- Where is she?|- She left you.
{136299}{136355}Nothing but tail lights.
{136360}{136525}She took the kids and went to her|mother's. They're in Palm Springs.
{136529}{136679}- I'm sorry. Did you eat?|- Forget that! Wait a minute.
{136683}{136799}- What happened with Laura?|- We had a fight.
{136803}{136941}- Why were you even talking to her?|- It's complicated.
{136945}{137034}I was pissed off|because I got fired.
{137038}{137202}No. he did. You couldn't answer|a few, simple, basic questions.
{137206}{137389}Simple questions? It was like being|on Jeopardy, for crying out loud.
{137393}{137495}- Knock it off!|- Puke-face.
{137572}{137653}Did you bring me a monkey?
{137774}{137962}- There's something else.|- What?
{137991}{138090}About rule number one...
{138172}{138231}What about it?
{138279}{138388}We bent it a little.
{138392}{138510}We bent it a lot.|Damn near broke the thing off.
{138560}{138693}- Did you sleep with my wife?|- Let's have some tea.
{138697}{138797}I'm sorry, Doug.|She's a powerful woman.
{138801}{138862}Take it easy!
{138866}{138953}She thought it was you.
{138972}{139119}The fact is...|She thought I was you, too.
{139159}{139262}- We're not perfect.|- We're not perfect.
{139266}{139342}I don't believe this!
{139424}{139559}I leave you alone for one day!|And you totally destroy my life.
{139564}{139657}We didn't destroy your life.|You did.
{139661}{139784}Actually, we were trying to save it,|and we were doing pretty good.
{139788}{139882}We just had one really bad day.
{139886}{140059}We tried. She was unstoppable.|It was like she couldn't get...
{140256}{140368}She touched my peepee, Steve.
{140617}{140696}I don't understand this.
{140700}{140786}We've had fights before, but...
{140817}{140901}Why did she leave?
{140905}{141035}- You don't fix stuff.|- What?
{141039}{141139}You always say you're going to|fix stuff, and then you don't.
{141214}{141303}Did Laura say that?
{141360}{141438}Maybe.
{141617}{141693}You talked to her before she left?
{141746}{141847}Maybe.|I don't remember.
{141852}{141949}This will refresh your memory.
{142185}{142261}Where do you put all that stuff?
{142265}{142366}Did you?|Did she tell you something?
{142370}{142450}She talked to me a lot.
{142466}{142548}She was afraid and she cried.
{142593}{142681}She cried?
{142685}{142780}She cried, because...
{142797}{142915}- Because I don't fix anything?|- She's scared.
{143027}{143102}She's scared.
{143169}{143299}- I'll buy you a present for this.|- A chainsaw?
{143303}{143428}Or a book. Something really nice.
{143570}{143663}Come on up.|I'm spitting on bugs.
{144014}{144134}- What's going on?|- I need you guys to help me.
{144138}{144271}I'm putting my life back together.|Come on. Let's go.
{144276}{144339}- About time.|- Polyblend.
{144847}{144950}- Steve, can I help?|- Grab the end of that plastic.
{145544}{145684}You said to be here at 8:30.|I'd like you to note the time.
{145688}{145817}- 9:15.|- This thing drives me nuts.
{145821}{146045}I'm sorry I spoke to you like that.|You're the best cement man alive.
{146064}{146176}- Really?|- No. No one else was available.
{146180}{146287}I can accept that.|You said you had your own guys?
{146315}{146374}Hi. Vic.
{146428}{146556}- Let's go to work.|- Fair enough.
{146593}{146660}Okay, you heard him.
{147191}{147329}I made some really tasty sandwiches|if you want one.
{147333}{147391}Great.
{147396}{147509}- Tuna with curried mayonnaise.|- I like that.
{147513}{147598}That's why I made them.
{147638}{147713}Let me ask you something.
{147736}{147860}The other night, when you were...
{147916}{148042}- When you were with Laura...|- I'll tell you something.
{148046}{148150}When she wants something,|there's no stopping her.
{148154}{148366}- I don't want any details.|- No, no. I know.
{148370}{148471}You think that...
{148475}{148625}... that she liked you|better than she likes me?
{148629}{148762}Of course not, Doug.|First of all, you are me.
{148766}{148914}- I am you. Do you understand?|- Yes, that's right.
{148918}{149034}I'm me, you're me and I'm you.
{149190}{149277}I know she loves you, Doug.
{149389}{149459}I wasn't there for her.
{149542}{149680}Even when I was there|I wasn't there.
{149748}{149887}Remember what you said about|quality time with your family?
{149891}{150021}Trust me. It's all quality time.
{150124}{150204}That's for sure.
{150232}{150306}You have to brush your teeth.
{150310}{150423}Don't forget your books and jackets.|Grandpa will take you to school.
{150492}{150618}Dad! Did you come to take us home?
{150708}{150875}Go inside and let me talk to Dad.|You can see Daddy later.
{150889}{150979}Come on, you guys.|Hurry up.
{151093}{151236}- How was the desert?|- Great. Just what I needed.
{151240}{151392}I saw on the weather|that it was like 175 degrees.
{151418}{151507}It was a little hot.
{151556}{151707}All right, here's the deal.|I'm going to ask you to come home.
{151712}{151849}But I won't plead with you.|If you say yes, great.
{151853}{152014}But don't expect me to stand in|front of the neighbours and beg.
{152018}{152110}I don't think...
{152114}{152229}Stop it. Get up. Why didn't|you talk to me? It was mean.
{152233}{152324}- That wasn't me.|- That's just the point.
{152328}{152473}I was a little confused about who|I was. All right, real confused.
{152477}{152595}Look, it's happened to you.|You want to be a mom and to work.
{152600}{152747}You want to be independent, but you|need to be taken care of a little.
{152789}{152897}- It gets confusing, doesn't it?|- Yes.
{153008}{153109}Come home,|so I can show you something.
{153113}{153223}Come on.|Just for a minute.
{153701}{153780}It's beautiful. Oh, Doug.
{154206}{154277}This is perfect.
{154313}{154413}Great, right?
{154424}{154483}The wall's gone.
{154488}{154585}It's just like I dreamed...
{154589}{154719}I'm so glad you like it.
{155050}{155140}It's so pretty.
{155203}{155273}How did you do this?
{155277}{155487}I had some of the boys do some|work and we just got it done.
{155491}{155591}If you put your mind to it,|you can do anything.
{156086}{156219}- What do you think?|- I think it's a miracle.
{156240}{156407}It's good, right? I told you|I'd finish it. I just needed time.
{156411}{156535}I'm thinking of starting my own|business. What do you think?
{156539}{156647}That way I could set my own hours.
{156651}{156802}I don't want to do anything big.|I want to start with small projects.
{156806}{156955}Bird houses and mail boxes.|Stuff like that.
{156995}{157103}That'd be nice.
{157247}{157334}I love you so much.
{157469}{157559}I mean, I just...
{157591}{157712}I just really love you.
{157724}{157874}Whatever I do.|whatever you need to do...
{157903}{158095}As long as we're both rowing|the same boat we'll be fine.
{158458}{158562}- Bye, honey!|- See you.
{158646}{158716}Bye!
{159196}{159287}Where are you guys headed?
{159291}{159450}- Wherever the road takes us.|- Maybe Florida. Stop off in Vegas.
{159454}{159526}We're going to eat a dolphin.
{159530}{159733}- No, you're going to pet one.|- Right. We'll pet a dolphin.
{159841}{160001}- Will you be all right?|- We'll be okay.
{160005}{160191}- We'll be fine. Don't worry.|- How about you? You'll be okay?
{160220}{160335}I'm going to be fine.
{160421}{160556}I'll tell you one thing.|You're three good-looking guys.
{160637}{160742}- When he's right, he's right.|- I guess.
{160762}{160924}- I'll see you.|- Bye, Doug.
{160947}{161037}See you, Steve.
{161407}{161521}If a T. Rex fought with a tank...|Who'd win?
{161525}{161574}I don't know, honey.
{161655}{161731}Mom?
{161868}{161955}You know|how to tell you love someone?
{161959}{162083}When everyone reminds you of them.
{162096}{162190}Dear Doug.|Greetings from sunny Miami.
