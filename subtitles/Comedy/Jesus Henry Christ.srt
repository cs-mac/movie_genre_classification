1
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,742
Would it kill you
to call me Mom?

2
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,277
Just once?

3
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,313
Would it?

4
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,745
Everyone calls you Patricia.

5
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,612
But you're not everyone,
you're my son.

6
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,049
And you're my Patricia.

7
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,509
Everyone thinks that I have
a photographic memory.

8
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,440
But that's not really accurate.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,845
I'm more like
a video camera.

10
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,510
I record what I see,

11
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,748
and, for reasons beyond me,
I always remember.

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,462
Frankly, I've always found
photographs depressing,

13
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,896
especially the old ones.

14
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,101
That's my mother, Patricia.

15
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,399
The product of
an unplanned pregnancy.

16
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,465
Patricia was the only girl in
a family of four boys.

17
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,739
Five, counting
my Grandpa Stan.

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,872
My grandmother was pregnant
for 72 months.

19
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,042
<i>- Ow!
- Or six years.</i>

20
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,815
Just about 1/6th
of her entire life.

21
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,517
Uncle Billy was the first born
of six sons.

22
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,686
<i>Tim and Tom
came next, then Jimmy,</i>

23
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,959
followed by two baby boys
who died in the uterus.

24
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,432
And finally, Patricia...

25
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,799
who, by all accounts,
had a very happy childhood.

26
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,461
Cheese!

27
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,697
<i>- Cheese!
- Cheese!</i>

28
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,298
Until her tenth birthday.

29
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,707
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

30
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,440
J' For she's a jolly
good fellow J'

31
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,314
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

32
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,148
J' Which nobody can deny M

33
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,382
Happy birthday,
Patricia.

34
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,789
<i>- The candles aren't lit.
- Oh.</i>

35
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,190
Stan.

36
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,455
Stan!

37
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,895
Hand me your lighter.

38
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,024
What lighter?

39
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,397
Oh...

40
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,536
You mean... this lighter.

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,644
Boys, if it wasn't
for this lighter...

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,704
I'd have been shot straight
through the heart

43
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,080
by one of them pinko, Commie,

44
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,316
socialist, Karl Marx-loving,
liberal wack jobs,

45
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,825
subversive moon bat,
hippie freaks.

46
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,258
Uh-huh.

47
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,954
But if he
thought he could kill

48
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,828
Stan "The Man" Herman...

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,561
Kapow, kapow, kapow!

50
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,596
Both: Faggot.

51
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,269
Now, one of you boys
gets this when I die,

52
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,571
so be careful with it.

53
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,312
You got something to
say, Billy?

54
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,047
I'm too high to bother with
the likes of you, Stanley.

55
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,282
You son of a--

56
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,120
Give me the goddamn
lighter, now.

57
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,446
<i>Uh, Mommy?</i>

58
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,542
Oh.

59
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,316
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

60
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,549
Oh...

61
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,590
It's almost out.

62
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,353
I'll save ya!

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,457
<i>- Stop, drop and roll!
- Jesus H. Christ!</i>

64
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,898
Stop, drop and roll,
stop, drop and roll,

65
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,562
stop, drop and roll,
stop, drop and roll!

66
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,337
My grandmother's death
was only the beginning.

67
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,576
Woo!

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,187
I said I'm Starsky,
you're Hutch.

69
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,450
Fine, have it your way.

70
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,857
Starsky's
a total homo anyway.

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,192
You calling me queer?

72
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,391
What if I am...
Starsky?

73
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,997
Take it back, take it back!

74
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,061
- I ain't homo!
<i>-</i> Okay, okay, I take it back!

75
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,266
You ain't homo!

76
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,467
Put down the gun, Tim.

77
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,339
Jesus H. Christ!

78
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,505
You didn't really think I'd
shoot my own brother, did you?

79
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,180
Ahh!

80
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,935
Uncle Jimmy died of AIDS.

81
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,101
How he got it,
no one talks about,

82
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,167
which, to me,
makes it even sadder.

83
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,838
Since no one ever
talks about him,

84
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,314
it's like
Uncle Jimmy was never born.

85
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,221
Happy birthday, Billy.

86
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,656
( Horn honking )

87
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,030
Going somewhere?

88
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,129
I'm going up
Canada way.

89
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,298
Canada?

90
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,171
What for?

91
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,402
I'm 18 now.

92
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,466
I don't got a choice.

93
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,478
Yes, you do, stay here.

94
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,515
If I stay here
they'll ship me off to 'Nam

95
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,878
or they'll lock me up in jail.

96
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,542
Either way you look at it,
I gotta go.

97
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,782
But I can't take care
of Stan, not all by myself.

98
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,221
I'm only ten years old.

99
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,250
( Horn honking )

100
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,256
You're gonna do
great, Patty.

101
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,595
I know you are.

102
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,834
Are you stoned?

103
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,669
Stay here with me.

104
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,800
Please, Billy, please!

105
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,572
I... I can't.

106
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,688
My name's not Patty,
it's Patricia.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,557
And you're a coward,
William Herman.

108
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,121


109
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,349
You must be the change you
wish to see in this world.

110
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,321
E-R-A!

111
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,857
I proudly accept

112
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,122
your nomination
for vice president

113
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,356
of the United States.

114
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,590
Anita Hill!

115
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,567
Keep your rosaries
off my ovaries!

116
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,797

00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,784
Happy birthday, Patricia.

125
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,980
Why is that
woman crying, Mommy?

126
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,892
Because God is punishing her for
being Satan's helper, honey.

127
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,328
Baby killers!

128
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,127
Baby killer!

Congratulations.

132
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,975
It's a boy.

133
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,452
It's a what?

134
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,719
A beautiful,
healthy baby... boy.

135
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,727
But-- but--
but that's impossible!

136
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,820
All the sonograms
said it was a girl!

137
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,489
I wallpapered her room pink

138
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,624
because it's supposed to be
a girl!

139
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,828
A beautiful,
healthy baby-

140
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,603
Henrietta.

141
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,868
So beautiful.

142
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,881
- Hello.
- Hello.

143
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,355
So, guys, um...

144
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,898
I'm feeding my grandson
the other day, you know?

145
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:48,989
Henry.

146
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,593
He's like nine months old.

147
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,139
These carrots are...

148
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,074
mmm...

149
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,838
delicious!

150
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,707
Tastes like shit!

151
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,544
The kid says...

152
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,917
That was funny,
do it again.

153
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,478
I'm not shitting ya.

154
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,024
The kid at nine months old
is speaking.

155
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,789
Wait 'til I tell the boys.

156
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,161
My grandson's
a freak genius!

157
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,358
No, no, no, no, no, Stan.

158
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,765
You do not say a word
about this to anyone.

159
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,997
- Stan... Stan...
<i>-</i> I swear, I swear, I swear.

160

You know, the kid's not
just smart.

161
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,533
You can tell,
he's got a good heart.

162
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,236
What's a freak, Patricia?

163
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,683
A freak is...

164
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,152
someone who's
very special.

165
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,450
Henry, honey.

166
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,253
It makes me feel lucky.

167
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,917
Stop pointing at him.

168
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,155
Aw...

169
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,964
I didn't say
nothing to no one.

170
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,802
Then what is this?

171
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,638
Now that there is
one photogenic kid.

172
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,713
I don't want Henry
to see any of this.

173
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,908
This... this... trash.

174
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,575
I don't want him to know
anything about it.

175
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,551
You got it.

176
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,384
Now let's go home.

177
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,220
I can't...

178
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,227
take care of you
anymore.

179
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,626
I won't.

180
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,129
Patricia.

181
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,296
I'm a grown man who can
take care of himself!

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,236
You're a grown man who's never
cooked a meal for himself

183
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,899
in his entire life!

184
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,601
Or washed any of his own
underwear

185
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,201
or raised any of his four sons

186
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,745
or made the necessary
arrangements to

187
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,212
bury three of them!

188
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,543
( Crying )

189
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,878
Oh...

190
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,783
Now don't you cry,
Henry, my boy.

191
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,584
Uh...

192
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,625
Your mother's right.

193
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,683
Your Grandpa Stan
being here...

194
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:05,261
Me being here
is best for all of us.

195
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,605
YUP-

196
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,299
Best for...

197
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,339
Gotta go, Geronimo!

198
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,952


199
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,114
What?

200
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,488


201
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,959
Ahh!

202
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,324


203
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,022
I'm okay.

204
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,867
"Y- ".

205
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,433
"Y- ".

206
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,910
"Y- ".

207
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,310
"Y- ".

208
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,042
"Y- ".

209
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,674
"Y- ".

210
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,719
"Y- ".

211
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,344
"Y- ".

212
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,583
Now, who can tell me

213
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,353
one word

214
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,395
that begins
with the letter "Y"?

215
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:07,987
Henry.

216
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,055
Why?

217
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,728
No, no, "Y" is a letter,
not a word.

218
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,169
<i>- You're stupid.
- Freak.</i>

219
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:18,573
I mean, "why" as in W-H-Y
are we here learning this crap?

220
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,736
Why?

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,041
They suspended you
from kindergarten?

222
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,275
When can I go back to school?

223
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,817
You are not going back
to that institution.

224
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,375
You're gonna
go to a real school.

225
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,945
One that nurtures, rather than
punishes the precocious!

226
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,150
One that encourages its
students to pursue the truth!

227
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,598
( Bell tolling )

228
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,438
Now...

229
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,305
whose father hasn't
had an opportunity

230
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,346
<i>to address the class, hmm?</i>

231
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,381
How about you, Henry?

232
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,376
My father sends his sincere
apologies, Sister Hathaway,

233
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,683
but he's currently
away saving the world.

234
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,781
So, in his absence,
I present to you--

235
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,689
Oh, my God.

236
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,386
Who is it?

237
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,657
Wonder Woman?

238
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,062
Must be the Invisible Man

239
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,930
'cause we all know you ain't
got no daddy.

240
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,594
All: Ooh...

241
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,764
Well...

242
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,774
at least I'm not adopted,
Malcolm.

243
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,935
Who says I was adopted?!

244
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:30,345
Unless your father suffers
from vitiligo universalis...

245
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,347
I do.

246
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,049
Vitig...

247
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,145
What?

248
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,350
The Michael Jackson disease.

249
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,689
I am not adopted.

250
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,057
Am I, Daddy?

251
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,328
Look in the mirror, kid.

252
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,336
You're black.

253
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,132
Who made Black History Month
the month of February?

254
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,467
The shortest
month of the year?

255
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,666
The white devil.

256
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,299
That's right, son.

257
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,039
The lying white devil!

258
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,978
You got a problem
with that?

259
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,448
I'm not saying all you
people look alike--

260
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,417
Who-- who all?
Me all?

261
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,782
Oh, you're talking
about my people?

262
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,652
You got something you
wanna say about my people?

263
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,453
Don't I know you?

264
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,984
I do not associate with
the filthy flesh of swine, pig!

265
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,725
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight,

266
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,066
fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight,

267
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,036
fight, fight, fight, fight...

268
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,165
It's about Rodney--
Rodney King!

269
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,835
Rodney King, Rodney King!

270
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,776
Rodney King!

271
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,924
"Open your eyes, people,

272
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,220
"for you have been blinded from
the truth long enough.

273
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,627
"There is no Easter Bunny,

274
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,032
"no Tooth Fairy...

275
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,593
"no Santa Claus.

276
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,638
There is no devil."

277
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,839
And there is no God?

278
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,711
No!

279
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,012
They're lies!

280
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,314
Lies that exist because
man has fooled himself

281
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,651
into believing
that he can see the truth!

282
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,554
"When in reality,
man cannot see

283
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,617
that the hand
before his face is his own."

284
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,523
You don't believe in God?

285
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,933
I have my doubts.

286
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,299
Then why are you here?

287
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,895
Why are any of
us here?

288
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,269
What is
the purpose of our being?

289
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,074
I'm talking about here,
at this Catholic school.

290
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,581
Ms. Herman, surely you don't
condone your son's beliefs?

291
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,483
I believe my son is capable
of drawing his own conclusions.

292
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,384
You work in a cafeteria,
do you not?

293
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,548
I manage
a dormitory dining hall,

294
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,784
at the university,

295
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,087
not that I can see
how that's at all relevant.

296
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,786
Then tell me, Ms. Herman,

297
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,265
how would you feel if your
son's misplaced, misguided

298
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,996
heretic beliefs caused a riot
in your dining hall?

299
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,640
There is too a God,
you freak!

300
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,443
"A" pluses across the board.

301
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,316
And that man wants either
a public apology

302
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,787
or an expulsion?

303
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,788
Is that even a choice?

304
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,188
We choose expulsion.

305
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,953
We choose to
fight against the tyranny.

306
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,050
We choose to fight
against it.

307
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,891
Who's my father, Patricia?

308
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,499
Who's my father?

309
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,975
Who your father is
isn't important.

310
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,476
You have me,

311
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,012
a mother who loves you
more than life itself.

312
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,639
But everyone else has a father.

313
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,581
Why do you want to
be like everyone else?

314
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,084
You're not like
everyone else.

315
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,052
<i>- You're very special.
- You mean I'm a freak.</i>

316
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,919
<i>- You're not a freak.
- You said so yourself.</i>

317
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,085
A freak is someone who's
very special.

318
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,492
I don't remember saying that.

319
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,929
I do, I remember.

320
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,227
I remember everything.

321
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,993
And that is an amazing gift.

322
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,564
You are an amazing young man
blessed with an amazing gift.

323
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,371
Or cursed.

324
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,914
Happy birthday,
Henry, honey.

325
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,887
This is from Grandpa Stan.

326
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,612
Ahh!

327
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,616
Damn it!

328
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,693
Where you going,
Henry, honey?

329
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,238
Stan's.

330
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,537
That's a great idea, let's all
go celebrate together.

331
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,270
Shall we?

332
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,521
Buenas tardes, Enfermera Bruna.

333
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,960
In Brazil. we speak Portuguese,
not Spanish, idiot.

334
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,295
In the US of
we speak English,

335
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,275
mi gatita atractiva.

336
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,802


337
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,991
I gave her an eight.

338
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,159
I never knew you
spoke Spanish.

339
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,791
Well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

340
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,894
Then again, there's a lot you
don't know about you.

341
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,532
Since when did you
start speaking Spanish?

342
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,840
Everyone that works here is
from south of the border.

343
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,504
Being here as long as I have,

344
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,948
you get used to
the lingo.

345
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,316
Besides, they like it
when you talk Mexican to them.

346
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,364
I get my money back if this
don't work, right?

347
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,001
Stan.

348
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,395
Stan.

349
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,575
Thank you, Stan.

350
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:47,228
I appreciate you not
pressing charges, Stewart.

351
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:52,504
Didn't mean to make you look bad
in front of your kid.

352
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,409
But I knew
I knew you.

353
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,879
You know that...

354
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,146
would barely be noticeable
if you were really black.

355
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,153
I am really black.

356
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,654
This ain't
gonna bounce, is it?

357
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:09,022
You have my word, it's good.

358
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,618
White devil's forked tongue
is a lying tongue.

359
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,788
Gotta go, Geronimo.

360
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,387
What, what,
where you going?

361
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,490
We're "negoci-tating."

362
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,092
I'm gonna see what
I can find out for you.

363
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,569
If the check clears.

364
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,338
But if I do happen to
found somehow,

365
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,934
I didn't
find it out... you dig?

366
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,113
I do dig.

367
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,801

I... hate... you!

I'm done.

398
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,519
You've really read
this whole thing?

399
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,964
I can record what I see
or read.

400
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,160
And I always remember.

401
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,225
Always?

402
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,568
The parental-manipulation
theory.

403
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,665
Posits that by selecting either
heterosexual

404
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,007
or homosexual practices
as the acceptable norm,

405
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,546
parents can promote to their
offspring

406
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,309
a specific
passage of sexuality.

407
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,520
Page two, second paragraph.

"An acute sense of unexplained

Slavkin O'Hara.

417
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,463
Henry James Herman.

418
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,432
What are you doing?

419
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,670
Can you help me take out
the trash, Henry?

420
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:48,858
Here we are.

421
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,491
Home sweet home.

422
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,341
Henry?

423
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,745
Is your daughter home?

424
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,009
Uh...

425
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,848
Audrey's... in school.

426
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:10,852
Speaking of which,

427
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,116
shouldn't you be
in school as well?

428
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,454
I got expelled.

429
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,050
Expelled?
For what?

430
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,386
Heresy.

431
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,536
If a bullet is fired straight up
into the sky,

432
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,700
it will slow down, stop,

433
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,333
then fall to
earth again--

434
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,435
accelerating until it reaches
a point

435
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,413
where its weight equals
the resistance of the air.

436
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,849
Brian.

437
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,950
I didn't do nothing.

438
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,462
Get your butt to
the principal's office.

439
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,588
Immediately!

440
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,859
What's the problem
with you people?

441
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,127
Oh, really?

442
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,362
And what might be that problem
be with my people?

443
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,370
Unlike where
you come from, Ms. Abda.

444
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,700
I was born here, Brian.

445
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,799
Real Americans believe in
innocence until proven guilty

446
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,401
and you have no proof that
I did anything wrong.

447
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,447
<i>- Audrey?
- Yes, Ms. Abda?</i>

448
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,315
( coughing )

449
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,786
Lesbo.

450
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,322
I am not a lesbo!

451
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,227
Are you okay?

452
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,272
Today's no worse than the living
hell that is my daily existence.

453
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,566
Fire.

454
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,966
Fire, I need fire.

455
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,242
Feel better now,
Dr. O'Hara?

456
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,447
No.

457
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,784
Not really.

458
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,821
Why were you
a sperm donor?

459
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,497
Excuse me?

460
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,732
You wrote in your book
that you donated sperm.

461
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,205
Why?

462
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:51,170
I didn't know
what else to do with it?

463
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,740
So I checked off the box.

464
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,787
It was a precautionary
measure.

465
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,289
A precaution against what?

466
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,053
I have testicular cancer?

467
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,822
Yes.

468
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:09,161
Cancer of the...
testicles.

469
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,565
Tell me, Dr. O'Hara.

470
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,161
Do you and...

471
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:18,674
Alice plan on having
any more children?

472
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,011
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara
and I certainly do.

473
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,849
Then may I suggest you seriously
consider sperm banking.

474
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,581
Sperm banking?

475
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,749
I myself am
a sperm donor.

476
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,690
Did you have testicular cancer?

477
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,191
Thank God, no.

478
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,061
No, no, no.

479
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,071
Some people donate blood,
I donate semen’s.

480
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,333
Why?

481
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,068
Not?

482
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,370
These are release form.

483
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,109
Pretty standard stuff
really, no biggie.

484
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,015
Now should your
fertility be unaffected

485
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,020
by the chemotherapy,

486
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:09,890
then all of your sperms shall be
properly disposed of.

487
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:14,192
Unless...

488
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,993
Unless?

489
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,662
You consent to have it donated
by checking off that box.

490
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,727
Little box at the bottom.

491
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,741
Little teeny box.

492
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,835
The process is
completely anonymous

493
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,144
and you will be monetarily
compensated.

494
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:37,017
Money's not the issue.

495
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,214
Then consider it a means of
fulfilling

496
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,190
your biological imperative.

497
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,591
I can only imagine
the profound love

498
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,219
pouring out of a mother's heart

499
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:50,494
when she first embraces
her newborn child.

500
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,536
A JOY that you...

501
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,631
you have made possible.

502
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,107
Alice.

503
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,941
I know, I know, Gunter,
I know, I'm late.

504
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:06,642
It's been almost an hour.

505
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,116
Honey?

506
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,846
You look positively
radiant.

507
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:13,617
You are too kind, Gunter.

508
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,656
Now then.

509
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,056
What's all this about?

510
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,998
You...

511
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,624
you didn't start
without me, did you?

512
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,637
God, Slavkin, I left work
early to be here.

513
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:32,402
That is so like you
to be totally selfish.

514
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,671
I took your last name.

515
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,872
<i>-</i> Remember?
- Alice Stravinowsky?

516
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,382
What would people think?

517
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,919
That we're married.

518
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,249
Well.

519
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,654
I may have lost my wife
to my oncologist,

520
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,129
but my fish can still swim.

521
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:01,969
At least I still
have my health.

522
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,866
Which is a lot more than I can
say for Dr. Flowers.

523
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,343
What happened to Dr. Flowers?

524
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,210
The Bulls won a championship.

525
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,048
<i>And the Bulls win
the championship.</i>

526
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,089
<i>Chicago is going crazy tonight.</i>

527
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,852
<i>Hundreds have been arrested
as fireworks</i>

528
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,918
<i>and random gunfire
explode throughout the city.</i>

529
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,021
Gunter!

530
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,760
Gunter!

531
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,359
Don't pretend like you don't
hear me, Gunter!

532
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,268
Yes, honey.

533
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,931
Yes, Henry?

534
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,201
Huh?

535
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,799
You look like you have
something you want to say.

536
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,003
Oh, it's-- it's nothing.

537
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,384
So, now that you find yourself

538
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,720
to be a man without
a school...

539
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,315
what are your plans?

540
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,883
My plans?

541
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,122
To continue your education.

542
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,062
Patricia and I haven't
really talked about that.

543
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,294
Who's Patricia?

544
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,928
My mother.

545
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,869
You call your mother
by her first name?

546
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,841
What does Audrey call you?

547
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,708
My daughter
calls me names.

548
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,337
Bad ones mostly.

549
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,546
Always actually.

550
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,315
Local news covering
the greater Chicago-land area.

551
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,914
<i>The Windy City is about to get
a whole lot windier</i>

552
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,287
<i>as the city braces itself-</i>

553
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,691
I want to go to college.

554
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,459
<i>Stay tuned for "Storm Watch,"
every hour, with our mega...</i>

555
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,398
Children your age
don't go to college.

556
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,601
When you were ten, you took
care of the entire family.

557
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,972
I didn't have a choice.

558
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,568
But I do, Patricia.

559
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,744
Okay, listen to me,
Henry, honey.

560
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,750
I see what happens to
boys and girls twice your age

561
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,649
who leave home and go off
to college.

562
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,778
Credit card debt.

563
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,822
Credit card debt
is the root of all evil.

564
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,915
But I don't want to
go away to college.

565
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,824
I want to stay right here at
home and go to the university.

566
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,556
Do you have a better plan
for my future?

567
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,892
Patricia.

568
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,124
Patricia.

569
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,996
You're smothering me,
Patricia.

570
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,332
I know I am, I know.

571
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,268
It's what mothers do.

572
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,804
Just promise me you won't
grow up too fast, okay?

573
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,741
You'll only break
your mother's heart.

574
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,904
I promise.

575
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,408
So...

576
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,281
anything else
you want to tell me?

577
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,285
Anything at all?

578
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,458
As a rule, Patricia, the Spanish
"H" is always silent.

579
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,462
Fill all
corresponding bubbles...

580
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,124
completely.

581
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,134
Erase all stray marks...

582
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,534
completely.

583
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:48,935
You have 30 minutes...

584
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,999
to answer 30 questions
completely.

585
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,509
Are there any questions?

586
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,842
You may begin.

587
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,806
May I help you?

588
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,552
Not with...

589
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,747
28 minutes left.

590
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,720
Impossible.

591
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,655
Come back
when you really are done.

592
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,990
I'm done.

593
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,225
The university usually
frowns upon

594
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,394
admitting students
so young in age.

595
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:57,929
However, given Henry's
unprecedented test scores,

596
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,203
we're willing to offer a full
academic scholarship

597
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,903
with an annual
stipend of 12,000,

598
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,378
all terms nonnegotiable.

599
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:07,076
Let me be perfectly clear,
President Sullivan.

600
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:11,518
Without my consent,
Henry doesn't go to college.

601
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,953
20,000.

602
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,251
My son is not
for sale.

603
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,916
30,000.

604
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,126
100,000.

605
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,185
<i>- 50.
- 80.</i>

606
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,594
<i>- 60.
- 75,000 a year</i>

607
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,155
for the length of
Henry's matriculation.

608
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,393
Nonnegotiable.

609
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,958
It's a deal, Ms. Herman.

610
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,006
Henry's stipend must be invested
in the following manner.

611
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,338
I suggest you
write this down.

612
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,378
Proceed.

613
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,344
With Henry
as sole beneficiary,

614
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,313
50% of his stipend will be
invested

615
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,008
in blue chip mutual funds.

616
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,245
The remaining 50%
in US Treasury notes.

617
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,879
On his 18th birthday,
Henry alone will be entitled

618
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,788
to the entirety of
both accounts.

619
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,087
Do we have a deal?

620
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,075
Uncle.

621
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,381
We can leave now,
Henry, honey.

622
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,439
Henry?

623
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,712
Honey?

624
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,058
Henry?

625
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,350
Henry!

626
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,858
Henry!

627
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:28,954
Henry!

628
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,658
Henry!

629
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,669
Don't walk away from me while
I'm talking to you.

630
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:34,829
Henry.

631
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,998
Henry James Herman,
you stop right there!

632
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,679
Did you beat him?

633
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,477
Did you out-negotiate
President Sullivan?

634
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:47,642
Yes, I did.

635
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,981
Well, congratulations,
Patricia.

636
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,850
I don't
appreciate your sarcasm.

637
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,946
I don't appreciate being used.

638
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,458
I don't want a stipend,
I don't need the money.

639
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,891
Not right now you don't,

640
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,293
but you'll thank me
when you turn 18.

641
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,695
I did this for you,
Henry, honey.

642
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,496
You did it
for yourself, Patricia!

643
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:09,300
How dare you raise your voice
at me-- I am your mother.

644
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,636
Without me, your genius butt
wouldn't be alive.

645
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,437
Well, if I am a genius,

646
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,671
I can assure you I didn't
inherit my genius gene

647
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,942
from you, now, did I?

648
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,983
Well, if not me,
then who?

649
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,375
Him.

650
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,782
- Him?
<i>-</i> Me?

651
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,189
Egg, meet Sperm.

652
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:31,488
Sperm, my mother.

653
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,119
Patricia Herman.

654
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,028
Dr. O'Hara just happens to be
my biological father.

655
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,804
- You?
- Me?

656
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,863
Oh, my God.

657
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,102
I think I'm gonna...

658
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,547
I'm sorry, Henry, could you
repeat what you just said?

659
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,714
The part where I said that
you're my biological father?

660
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,053
Yeah, that's it.

661
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,459
That's what
I thought you said.

662
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,293
I'm your father.

663
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,493
How so exactly?

664
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:12,830
I'm a test-tube baby.

665
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,393
Oh.

666
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,201
Oh...

667
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,508
<i>-</i> Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

668
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,105
Just imagining Audrey's reaction
to the news.

669
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,548
Well, you're
taking it rather well.

670
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,077
Oh, I'd probably faint too if
I wasn't so heavily medicated.

671
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,181
After our book-burning incident,

672
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,749
my psychiatrist
upped my dosage.

673
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,590
Now I don't
feel much of anything.

674
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,366
( Bell ringing )

675
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:53,004
Lesbo, lesbO, lesbO, lesbo,
lesbo, lesbo, lesbo...

676
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,813
( horn honking )

677
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:11,086
( screaming )

678
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,273
I'll be right back.

679
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,865
I'd like to Audrey myself,
if you don't mind.

680
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,537
Oh, I don't
think that's such a...

681
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,428
Audrey?

682
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,836
Yeah, that's me.

683
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,874
Who are you?

684
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,170
You're not alone, Audrey.

685
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,505
Not anymore.

686
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,307
Lesbo.

687
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,143
I'm your half...

688
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,013
Brother.

689
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,388
Ew!

690
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,327
Who is that kissing my Henry?

691
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,160
That would be my
Audrey.

692
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,529
I tried telling you.

693
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:25,932
But then you kissed me!

694
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,563
I can't hear you, I can't
hear you, I can't hear you.

695
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:32,767
I've never been kissed before by
a woman who wasn't Patricia.

696
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,106
She doesn't use
her tongue like you do.

697
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,305
Oh, I'm so gonna puke.

698
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,900
Hey, Who's hungry'?

699
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,460
Anyone?

700
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,505
Anyone?

701
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,369
I'm starving.

702
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,249
I've never been
here before.

703
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,342
That's because
the faculty club's off-limits

704
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,943
to people like us.

705
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,716
You mean poor people.

706
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,053
I mean proletariat.

707
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,423
President Sullivan did

708
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,554
rename it the Libertarian Club

709
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,225
in an attempt to make it
more inclusive.

710
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,269
Now anyone can come here?

711
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,735
- No.
- No.

712
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,863
Well, then, why did he bother
changing the name?

713
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,133
Why did Kentucky Fried Chicken
change its name to KFC?

714
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,702
Did they suddenly
stop frying their chicken?

715
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:44,974
No.

716
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,277
They most certainly did not.

717
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,876
In their defense, they did add
baked chicken to their menu.

718
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,546
It was grilled.

719
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,256
If it wasn't for
this university,

720
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:01,786
then this entire area would be
an economic wasteland.

721
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,457
Would it not?

722
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,000
And that justifies this
university's

723
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:09,436
refusal to pay its
workers a decent living wage?

724
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:14,499
Well, I'm just playing
devil's advocate, Ms. Herman.

725
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,511
How can you play
the devil's advocate

726
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,774
when you are the devil,
Dr. O'Hara?

727
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,512
What?

728
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,615
My daughter
hates you, Henry.

729
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,626
But don't be offended.

730
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,320
Audrey hates everyone.

731
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,954
What a terrible thing to say
about your daughter.

732
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,192
You did just say that
I was the devil, did you not?

733
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,393
It's true.

734
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,333
I do hate everyone.

735
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,768
Everyone but babbling babies

736
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,568
and retards
soaked in their own drool.

737
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:47,371
I believe the clinical term

738
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,968
is intellectually disabled.

739
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,140
So it's better to be disabled
than retarded.

740
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:56,048
To the intellectually
disabled, yes, it is better.

741
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,711
I'm so out of here.

742
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,083
Sit down, Audrey.

743
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:03,455
Am I the only one here who's not
in, like, total denial?

744
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,191
Totally messed up?

745
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,323
Open your eyes, people!

746
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,766
For you've been blinded by
the truth long enough.

747
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,433
What did you say?

748
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,373
- Nothing.
<i>-</i> Whatever.

749
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,738
Audrey's right.

750
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:23,244
<i>-</i> This is an awkward situation.
- You think?

751
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:24,541
When my Grandpa Stan told me--

752
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,912
Don't you dare mention that
man's name ever again.

753
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,609
He is dead to me now.

754
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,674
Dead.

755
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,847
When my grandfather told me that
he'd found my half-sister,

756
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,289
we both assumed
that she was just like me.

757
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,724
A test-tube baby.

758
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,352
It was a petri dish.

759
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,124
But then when Dr. O'Hara told me
that Audrey

760
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,893
was already conceived before
he was diagnosed with cancer-

761
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,763
You had cancer?

762
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,325
It was a long time ago.

763
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,268
You never told me
you had cancer.

764
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,534
I've been
cancer-free for over a decade.

765
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,200
But it could still
come back, right?

766
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,073
I'm sorry to disappoint you yet
again, Audrey,

767
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,545
but I hope not.

768
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,607
<i>- You're not a test-tube baby.
- It was a petri dish!</i>

769
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,550
You are my half-sister.

770
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,485
One-half of our genes are
identical,

771
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,490
and since we have
different mothers,

772
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,924
our common genes could have only
come from one source.

773
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,526
Unless...

774
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,196
Unless what?

775
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,796
No matter what happens,
Audrey,

776
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,534
you will always be my daughter,

777
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:28,270
just as I will
always be your father.

778
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,209
No matter what.

779
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,680
If you've got something to say,
then just say it, Dad.

780
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,316
There's a chance,

781
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:41,118
a very slim chance,

782
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:45,923
infinitesimal really, when you
come to think of it,

783
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,725
that you may...

784
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,832
Well, that you
may not be my daughter,

785
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,271
biologically speaking.

786
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,570
You look positively
radiant.

787
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,201
You are too kind, Gunter.

788
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,508
Since when?

789
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,243
Since you were born.

790
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,910
I mean since when did you
realize

791
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,578
that you may not be my father?

792
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:15,948
Uh...

793
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,323
Since before
you were born.

794
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,055
You were never
gonna tell me.

795
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,255
Were you?

796
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,822
Infinitesimal, remember?

797
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:26,732
If I'm not your daughter,
then who's my father?

798
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,099
I'm your father.

799
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,297
I am.

800
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,936
Maybe.

801
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,844
Audrey.

802
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,390
Audrey, honey.

803
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:50,858
Look at the bright side.

804
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,657
I am looking
at the bright side.

805
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,129
The chance that you
may not be my father.

806
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,063
However infinitesimal
that may be.

807
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,475
Sorry.

808
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,516
I'm not the one you should be
apologizing to.

809
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,019
I know who you are.

810
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,855
I read your book.

811
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,623
I tried to
raise my daughter

812
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:31,531
free from gender bias,
free from stereotypes

813
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,466
that dehumanize people.

814
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,506
How do you sleep at night?

815
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,974
Ambien.

816
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,341
You got no idea how much
trouble you caused me, do you?

817
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,812
You know, you're the reason my
son thinks he's adopted.

818
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,645
What is it
with you, home wrecker?

819
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,275
His son is adopted.

820
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,478
So what if he is?

821
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,316
Does that somehow make me
any less of a father?

822
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:54,583
<i>-</i> Yes.
- No.

823
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:55,680
Come here.

824
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,384
Come here, white devil,
you come here.

825
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,990
I know I wasn't
born black, okay?

826
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,622
I know that.

827
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,600
But I know
that I am black.

828
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,068
Here.

829
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,798
I'm black right here.

830
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,366
And that's the same way that
I know that Malcolm is my son.

831
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,139
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

832
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:20,080
I know that it must totally
suck to be a black man nurse

833
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,139
trapped in a white man's body,

834
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,743
but the white devil and I have
our own paternity problems

835
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,549
to deal with.

836
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,284
I need my
stepfather's sperm.

837
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,257
The what, with the...

838
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,295
No, look, whatever weirdness
y'all got going on,

839
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,227
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

840
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,593
I need to find out
if Gunter Flowers

841
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,361
is my biological father.

842
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:39,901
Me too.

843
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:41,698
No one cares about you,
home wrecker.

844
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:42,794
I got an idea.

845
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,840
Why don't you two
just go and ask him?

846
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,671
<i>- Because he's dead.
- Because he's dead.</i>

847
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,108
He's dead?

848
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,009
<i>- Dead.
- Dead.</i>

849
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:52,972
<i>And the Bulls win
the championship.</i>

850
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:55,777
Gunter!

851
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,445
Don't pretend like
you don't hear me, Gunter.

852
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,920
Yes, honey.

853
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:02,480
The trash isn't
going to take out itself.

854
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,492
<i>As fireworks
and rare gunfire</i>

855
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,619
<i>explode throughout the city.</i>

856
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,425
Yes, I am completely aware

857
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,829
that trash
is an inanimate object.

858
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,201
Gunter!

859
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,637
Gunter!

860
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,417
Gunter!

861
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,379
Gunter!

862
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:35,287
Gentle Jesus,
please make it stop.

863
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,622
Gunter!

864
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,752
For the love of God,
Alice!

865
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:42,354
Will you just shut it up?!

866
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,059
If a bullet is fired straight up
into the sky,

867
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,328
it will slow down,

868
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:04,718
Well, if y'all wanna find out
who your daddy is,

869
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,152
I suggest you get tested,

870
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,655
'cause as decreed by
the Supreme Court,

871
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,782
ain't nothing I can do for you
without your dead

872
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:13,727
step daddy’s permission.

873
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,388
I see my work here
is done.

874
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,726
Y'all have a good night.

875
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,662
If this hurts, I will--

876
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:22,669
Faint.

877
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,433
I think it's
a blood-sugar thing.

878
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,530
So...

879
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,904
Prick me
and get it over with.

880
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,014
This totally sucks.

881
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:37,450
As if my life isn't
miserable enough.

882
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,819
It turns out that my real dad
may be my dead step-dad.

883
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,721
I'm your real dad.

884
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,782
Maybe.

885
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,089
If my step-dad is my real dad,

886
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,688
that makes him
your real dad as well.

887
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,632
Which makes you my half-brother.

888
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,192
But the problem is,

889
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:57,171
we don't know
who our real dad is, do we?

890
00:54:57,228 --> 00:55:00,209
It's called process of
elimination.

891
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:03,074
It's called
a rhetorical question.

892
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,046
We just have to wait for
the test results.

893
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:09,448
What are we
supposed to do until then?

894
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:13,977
We could exhume Dr. Flower's
body and perform an autopsy.

895
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,251
Well, what are we waiting for?

896
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,259
Let's get some
shovels and start digging.

897
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,973
I didn't do nothing.

898
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,139
"I didn't do nothing"
is a double negative.

899
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,376
Which means you did
do something, idiot.

900
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,646
Prove it, lesbo.

901
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,211
Hey, hey, hey. hey!

902
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:24,248
Ms. Abda, Ms. Abda,
Ms. Abda!

903
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:29,727
Do you have
a question, Brian?

904
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:30,821
No?

905
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,231
Then let's move on, shall we?

906
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,907
Ms. Abda?

907
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,380
Yes, Audrey?

908
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,213
May I go to the restroom?

909
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,308
It's an emergency.

910
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,614
The period's almost over.

911
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,086
Not for me, it isn't.

912
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,679
Oh?

913
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,918
Go.

914
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,097
I should
so kick your ass.

915
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,663
You have every right to be
mad at me.

916
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,037
Oh, yeah?

917
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,805
I'm sorry for
the trouble I've caused you.

918
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,244
<i>-</i> You're weak.
- I'm ten.

919
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,179
Aren't you supposed to be in
college or something?

920
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,342
Aren't you
supposed to be in school?

921
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,010
I can't stand it when people
answer a question

922
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:25,382
with a question.

923
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,786
Then, yes,
I'm supposed to be in college.

924
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,824
Then what are you doing here?

925
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,486
I wanted to know
if you're okay.

926
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,267
Let's get one thing straight.

927
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:42,998
I will never,
ever be okay.

928
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,368
Okay?

929
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,102
I'm permanently damaged.

930
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:49,644
A freak,
just like you.

931
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,310
Don't sweat it.

932
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,717
I think being a freak's
kinda cool.

933
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,016
Yeah?

934
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,421
Better than being a sheep
like all the rest of them.

935
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,755
Why would anyone want to be
just like everyone?

936
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,987
What's in your hair?

937
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,360
It's nothing.

938
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,409
Every ditch school before?

939
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,603
No.

940
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,279
Where are you going?

941
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,714
Anger-obics.

942
00:58:57,468 --> 00:59:00,210
Holy "Beautiful Mind."

943
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,013
Unlike Henry,
my memory is, uh...

944
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,486
very average.

945
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,423
I have to write down my thoughts
in order to remember them.

946
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,319
On Post-it notes.

947
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,557
Well, you can stick them
just about everywhere

948
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,965
and they
stay stuck until you...

949
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,024
move them.

950
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,695
Have you heard about that
Post-it note

951
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,000
that survived
Hurricane Hugo?

952
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,701
140-mile-an-hour winds.

953
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,574
Knocked out eight oak trees
in a man's front yard,

954
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,547
but the Post-it note

955
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:37,380
stuck on his front door
withstood the storm.

956
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,422
What did
the Post-it note note?

957
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,549
I don't know that it
noted anything.

958
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,962
The point is
that it stayed stuck.

959
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:53,365
Well, what's the point of
posting a blank Post-it note?

960
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,993
I never said it was blank.

961
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:02,068
Did it say "please knock"
or "no solicitations" or...

962
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:08,942
Manifesto on
the nature of truth?

963
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:13,317
Results indicate
test subject's IQ 310.

964
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,159
Test subject?

965
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:20,854
Well, I... Henry has

966
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,523
the second-highest
IQ ever recorded.

967
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:26,397
My Henry is not a test subject!

968
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,129
Please,
sit down, Ms. Herman.

969
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,367
<i>- Please.
- Jesus H. Christ.</i>

970
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:36,673
I brought you here to
prove to you

971
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,905
that I have nothing,

972
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,140
- nothing to hide.
<i>-</i> How?

973
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,239
By shoving your
notes in my face?

974
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,978
Notes you intend to use to write
a book about my son?

975
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,315
The test subject!

976
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,353


977
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,411
Yes!

978
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,423
No, no, no.

979
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,618
No-- yes!

980
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,821
My original intention was to
write a book about Henry,

981
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,454
but that was
before yesterday.

982
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:57,328
<i>-</i> Before I found out the truth.
- The truth?

983
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,697
The truth that
Henry may be my son.

984
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,565
Henry is my son.

985
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:04,867
I'm his mother!

986
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,999
And as for you,
you're nothing but a test tube

987
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,668
filled with sperm!

988
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,041
If someone other than you had
written that book about Audrey,

989
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,514
what would you do?

990
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,986
I know exactly
what I'd do.

991
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,452
If you ever change your mind

992
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:29,122
and write
a book about my Henry...

993
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,962
I will hunt you down

994
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,229
and I will kill you.

995
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,177
It was a petri dish.

996
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,579
You were the test tube,
I was the petri dish!

997
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,658
Stop calling me, Stan!

998
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,093
Now is not
a good time-

999
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,596
I've never been to
an amusement park before.

1000
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,003
Let's go on a ride.

1001
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,734
I don't do rides.

1002
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:14,400
Exposure therapy
is the best way to get over

1003
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,740
an acute sense of dinophobia.

1004
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,609
I'm not scared of
being dizzy.

1005
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,238
That's not what
I read in your dad's book.

1006
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,241
Whoa.

1007
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,392
There's nobody here.

1008
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:34,622
We ditched school,
remember, genius?

1009
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:35,959
Let's go on a ride!

1010
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,874
Jesus H. Christ.

1011
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,341
What does the "H"
in "Jesus H. Christ"

1012
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:49,672
stand for anyway?

1013
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,337
I don't know, "holy," maybe?

1014
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,403
<i>Your guess is
as good as mine.</i>

1015
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,474
<i>- I thought you knew everything.
- I remember everything.</i>

1016
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,712
Everything?

1017
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,685
Everything I've ever seen.

1018
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:02,952
<i>- Since when?
- Since I was born.</i>

1019
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,924
Ew.

1020
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,754
( Screaming )

1021
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:15,702


1022
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,650
<i>That was awesome.</i>

1023
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,550


1024
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:40,651
(bell dinging)

1025
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:45,658
( screaming )

1026
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:49,636


1027
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:07,781
Sit down.

1028
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,893
( Screaming )

1029
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,404
Woo-hoo!

1030
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,564
Yes!

1031
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:29,172


1032
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,198
That's me.

1033
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,790
I own this game.

1034
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:54,858
This is anger-obics?

1035
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,235
What did you expect,
Tae Bo?

1036
01:04:57,294 --> 01:04:59,331
Amusement parks, I get,
but I can't believe you've never

1037
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,239
played an arcade game before.

1038
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,606
Patricia
believes in video games

1039
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,169
are the reason over 4 million
children take Ritalin.

1040
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,144
Hello, I said
shoulder width apart.

1041
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,688
Right foot slightly in front of
your left hand.

1042
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,519
Your other left.

1043
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,082
More, more.

1044
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,787
Stop.

1045
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,420
Now keep your left elbow
straight.

1046
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,802
You ready?

1047
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,964
See it.

1048
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:32,904
Shoot it.

1049
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,717
You suck.

1050
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:48,819
Watch and learn
from a master marks-woman.

1051
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,050
See it.

1052
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,183
Shoot it.

1053
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,369
How many did I kill?

1054
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:17,441
Everyone.

1055
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:20,010
You killed everyone.

1056
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,056
Well, I noticed the bad guys
are programmed according

1057
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,455
to a pretty simple
recursive equation

1058
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,994
that determines their
appearance on the screen.

1059
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,394
Do you want to know the equation
so you can finish the game too?

1060
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,884
What can we get
for 10,000 tickets?

1061
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,325
10,000 tickets doesn't
buy much.

1062
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,334
That's funny.

1063
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,265
Go on, take it.

1064
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,364
It's yours.

1065
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,737
What do you say?

1066
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:15,970
Thank you.

1067
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,409
You're welcome.

1068
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,243
That was nice of you.

1069
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:24,546
Tell anybody
and I will kill you.

1070
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,711
Got it.

1071
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,458
You have to look at things
in the long-term.

1072
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,824
In the short-term,
my life totally sucks.

1073
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,794
But it'll all blow over.

1074
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,058
Oprah or no Oprah,

1075
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,999
they'll all forget that
stupid book ever existed.

1076
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,729
Just look at Jonathan Franzen.

1077
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,168
Who?

1078
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,228
My point exactly.

1079
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:47,673
Besides, all the cash my dad's
making from the book

1080
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:49,836
is going into a trust fund.

1081
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,573
When I turn 18,
I'm gonna be rich.

1082
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:54,240
Me.

1083
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:55,908
Not you.

1084
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:58,009
Not we.

1085
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,747
Me.

1086
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:03,382
But I don't
want any of your money.

1087
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,221
Yeah, right.

1088
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,419
I don't.

1089
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,554
When I turn 18,
I'll have my own money.

1090
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,428
<i>- You wanna bet?
- On what?</i>

1091
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,592
I'll bet you that you that my
dad's not our dad.

1092
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:16,796
So I'm betting
that your dad is my dad?

1093
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,998
You're a genius?

1094
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,165
Really?

1095
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:21,140
I never said
I was a genius.

1096
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,303
And I never said
I'm a lesbo.

1097
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,313
Bet.

1098
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,374
I can't wait for you to meet my
Grandpa Stan.

1099
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,284
You know, if it wasn't for him,
we would have never met.

1100
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:34,617
I can wait to thank him.

1101
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,459
Places like this depress me.

1102
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:42,997
Why?

1103
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,963
Is this it?

1104
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:47,228
Is this where we end up?

1105
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:52,535
Surrounded by old people who
reek of mothballs and menthol?

1106
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,302
All of us just waiting to die?

1107
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:55,866
Not my Grandpa Stan.

1108
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,037
He reeks of
cigarettes and whiskey.

1109
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,705
Cool.

1110
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:01,680
Hey, everyone.

1111
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:02,978
Where's Stan?

1112
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,921
Nurse Bruna?

1113
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,149
Where's my grandfather?

1114
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,554
Stan?

1115
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:19,259
Stan?

1116
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,996
Stan!

1117
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:23,298
Stan!

1118
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,799
Henry, honey.

1119
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,042
Patricia... where's Stan?

1120
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,316
Come here, honey.

1121
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,485
Please, Henry.

1122
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,682
Please.

1123
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,191
Where's Grandpa Stan?

1124
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,293
I'm sorry, Henry, honey.

1125
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,701
I'm so sorry.

1126
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,636
Where is he, Mom?

1127
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,935
Where is he?

1128
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,040
Why aren't you in school?

1129
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,474
( Thundering )

1130
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,606
74 Nobel Laureates over
the course of this university's

1131
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:10,474
illustrious history.

1132
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,740
But never once has a tenured
faculty member

1133
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,248
appeared on Oprah.

1134
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,252
Oh, any publicity
is good publicity.

1135
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,287
I'm sure things will go much
better next time

1136
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:21,583
you're on Oprah.

1137
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,056
Peddling your new book.

1138
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,186
There isn't going to be
another book, Charles.

1139
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:31,198
With all the funding
being poured into your work?

1140
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:34,963
Henry... isn't my work.

1141
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,628
No?

1142
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,333
Then what is he?

1143
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:40,874
<i>- He's--
- He's here</i>

1144
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,841
because you
wanted him to be here.

1145
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:46,847
He's here because we're paying
him a lot of money to be here.

1146
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,644
He's here because of you.

1147
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:55,588
You're right, Charles.

1148
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,353
Henry is here...

1149
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,449
because of me.

1150
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,626
I understand that now.

1151
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:07,595
Thank you, Charles.

1152
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,000
Oh, please, Slavkin.

1153
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,469
There's no need to
thank me.

1154
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,096
My job is to manage.

1155
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,163
Your job is to
publish.

1156
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,607
Or perish.

1157
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,804
Well, then you're just gonna
have to fire me, Charles.

1158
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,410
Oh, wait a minute.

1159
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:25,942
That's right,
you can't fire me.

1160
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,544
I have tenure.

1161
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:07,686
Am I going to
beat the odds?

1162
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,230
Henry?

1163
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:11,924
The transition from
prodigy to adult

1164
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:14,195
is an extremely difficult one.

1165
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:17,033
Only one in a 100 prodigies
succeed in becoming happy,

1166
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:19,573
well-adjusted adults.

1167
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,011
10,004 Post-it notes
of research.

1168
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,881
Surely, you must have
arrived to some conclusion.

1169
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,420
Am I gonna be that
one in a hundred?

1170
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:37,947
You are a very...
special person.

1171
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,618
I know what that means.

1172
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,754
Someone of your...

1173
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:47,359
extraordinary intellect
comes along...

1174
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,563
maybe once in
a century, if at all.

1175
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,503
I don't want to be
extraordinary.

1176
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:55,805
But extraordinary
is exactly what you are.

1177
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,936
I don't want to be the test
subject of your next book!

1178
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:00,538
You're not, Henry,
you know?

1179
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,981
I promise you,
despite what you see,

1180
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,313
you're not.

1181
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:05,876
All my eyes can see
is all I know.

1182
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:10,450
I'm not writing
a book about you.

1183
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,517
I thought I was,
but I'm not,

1184
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:19,658
so you can
forget about all of this.

1185
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,895
All of what you see.

1186
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,403
I can't forget.

1187
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:33,843
This arrived in the mail.

1188
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:36,611
It's addressed to me,
but made out to you.

1189
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:38,414
Thought you might be
interested in the results.

1190
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,264
Where you going?

1191
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:54,997
To help my mom
plan a funeral.

1192
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:10,402
Ahh!

1193
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:18,746
Ahh!

1194
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:31,548
( Crying )

1195
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,009
Billy?

1196
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,081
Who is he?

1197
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:34,519
I think he's my uncle.

1198
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:41,518
Are you my Uncle Billy?

1199
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,623
If you're my nephew.

1200
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:53,030
This used to be my room.

1201
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,701
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1202
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:58,746
Four walls
and some left-over beads.

1203
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,744
It's been 35 years.

1204
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:04,284
Why didn't you come back

1205
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,616
when President Carter granted
amnesty to the draft dodgers?

1206
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,281
Back in '77?

1207
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:10,619
Well, I guess I thought
I'd have time

1208
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,217
to make amends.

1209
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:15,455
<i>Guess that was wrong.</i>

1210
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:16,929
You think?

1211
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,532
Stan wanted you
to have this.

1212
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,975
Is that a fact?

1213
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,770
He told me so himself.

1214
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,217
He wanted to pass it down to
one of his sons.

1215
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:52,496
You're his grandson.

1216
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:55,100
So you keep that.

1217
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,669
The Vietnam War was one that
I, William Herman, opposed.

1218
01:20:05,735 --> 01:20:08,181
Due to my moral principles.

1219
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:10,444
I do, however, sincerely
regret that in my absence

1220
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:11,746
that I've missed a great
many things.

1221
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,718
I have missed being a brother to
my brothers,

1222
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:15,050
who have all since perished.

1223
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:17,113
I have missed
being a friend

1224
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,853
to the strongest person
I've ever known...

1225
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,156
my sister.

1226
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,391
I've missed
being Uncle Billy to...

1227
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:31,167
He's a remarkable young man.

1228
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,764
But I missed most of all...

1229
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,172
being a son.

1230
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:42,109
Of all my regrets,
my single greatest is knowing

1231
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:45,380
that I'll never have the
opportunity to tell my father

1232
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:46,852
how much I miss him.

1233
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,316
How much I loved him.

1234
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,755
I hate you, Billy Herman.

1235
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,528
I hate you so much.

1236
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,214
Mothballs and menthol.

1237
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:20,152
You don't have to pretend like
you want to be here.

1238
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:24,180
I could pretend to be polite,
courteous and communicative.

1239
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,953
But I'm not.

1240
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:27,255
I'm a teenager.

1241
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,091
You're 12.

1242
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:30,562
I'll be 13 in a week.

1243
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,225
$0'?

1244
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:35,428
So I could
pretend to be happy,

1245
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,631
pretending that
you don't exist.

1246
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:40,298
But I wouldn't be happy

1247
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,110
After all,
you are my brother.

1248
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,885
It's such a relief knowing
that Gunter's not our dad.

1249
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:55,013
He was such a tool.

1250
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,613
You saw
the lab report?

1251
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,718
That means
you lost the bet.

1252
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:00,988
That means I won.

1253
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,605
Dad loved you
most of all.

1254
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,231
Yeah, right.

1255
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,900
I was an accident.

1256
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:17,774
It was an accident
I was ever born.

1257
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,575
Dad always wanted a girl.

1258
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,673
After four boys in a row,
he finally got one.

1259
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:26,284
You.

1260
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:36,757
After he...

1261
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:38,355
told Henry the truth,

1262
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:40,025
I...

1263
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,896
I wished he was dead.

1264
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:51,708
Well, at least now you know.

1265
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,075
That I wasn't an accident?

1266
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:54,739
No, you'd better be
careful what you wish for.

1267
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,692
Cool.

1268
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,306
<i>Mom?</i>

1269
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:31,550
<i>Mom?</i>

1270
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:33,109
Yes, Henry, honey?

1271
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,711
Who's this?

1272
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,331
That's your Uncle Jimmy.

1273
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,922
No, I mean that.

1274
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,397
That's you, Henry, honey.

1275
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,201
But I don't remember ever
meeting Uncle Jimmy.

1276
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,404
How could you?

1277
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,777
You were less than
a week old.

1278
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:02,747
And you were sound asleep.

1279
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:08,111
That was the day I told Jimmy
I named you after him.

1280
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,661
Henry James Herman.

1281
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,131
<i>I was named after
my Uncle Jimmy.</i>

1282
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,173
A week later,
you were at his funeral.

1283
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,674
Do you remember that?

1284
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,238
Yeah.

1285
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,315
Me too.

1286
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,953
Why don't we put this...

1287
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,048
back where it belongs.

1288
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:21,422
Every book
should have a title.

1289
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:26,166
Well, it could,
couldn't it?

1290
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,928
I don't think so.

1291
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,765
You said it yourself.

1292
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:32,328
<i>My guess is
as good as yours.</i>

1293
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:35,671
It's highly improbably that
the "H" stands for Henry.

1294
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:41,877
Let's say that
you could go back in time.

1295
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,315
Would you still publish
that book?

1296
01:25:44,373 --> 01:25:47,252
So many unintentional

1297
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:49,220
great things

1298
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:51,280
came to be
because of that book.

1299
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,654
Just answer
the question, Dad.

1300
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:58,489
Yes.

1301
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,624
I most certainly...

1302
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:03,101
would not.

1303
01:26:06,028 --> 01:26:07,666
No.

1304
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,970
I would not publish
that book.

1305
01:26:14,937 --> 01:26:16,712
You can't change the past.

1306
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:18,251
But you can
change the future.

1307
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:20,781
Henry's right.

1308
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,384
Today is my birthday.

1309
01:26:24,446 --> 01:26:26,551
And now that
I'm an adult...

1310
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,652
I feel that a I have
a moral obligation

1311
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:31,323
to help make
the world a better place.

1312
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:32,525
You do?

1313
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:34,765
You'?

1314
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,235
You, me.

1315
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:40,068
We should all be the change
we wish to see in this world.

1316
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:41,608
Shouldn't we, Henry?

1317
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,337
We should try.

1318
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,611
That is why after much
thought and deliberation,

1319
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,377
I, Audrey O'Hara,

1320
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,646
on my 18th birthday,

1321
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,884
will donate 20% of my trust fund
to the following organizations.

1322
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:00,657
Okay, fine.

1323
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:03,094
Make that 25%.

1324
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:05,962
33 1/3%
and that's final.

1325
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,329
I suggest you write
this down, Dad.

1326
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,802
Uh...

1327
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:14,029
Right.

1328
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:19,142
Don't seem to have a pen.

1329
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,611
Thank you, Henry.

1330
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,256
Proceed.

1331
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:32,815
The National Organization
for Women.

1332
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:37,294
The Environmental Defense Fund.

1333
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:43,796
The National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.

1334
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:56,713
My name is
Audrey Stravinowsky

1335
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,217
and I am a lesbian.

1336
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:06,926
Patricia was right.

1337
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:09,121
When I turned 18,

1338
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:11,824
I did thank
her for the money.

1339
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:14,094
The annual stipend that she
negotiated for me

1340
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:16,136
when I was ten
was more than enough.

1341
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,337
A donation in
Stan's name was made

1342
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:23,900
to the National Law Enforcement
Memorial Fund.

1343
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,846
The rest was donated to
the AIDS Research Alliance

1344
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,357
to ensure that the memory
of my Uncle Jimmy

1345
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,154
would never again fade away.

1346
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,090
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

1347
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,689
We have a birthday
to celebrate.

1348
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:47,893
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

1349
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,833
J' For she's a jolly
good fellow J'

1350
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:53,065
J' For she's
a jolly good fellow J'

1351
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:55,699
<i>- J' That nobody can deny M
- J' And so say I M</i>

1352
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,806
The candles aren't lit.

1353
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,712
Oh, right.

1354
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:07,180
Henry, honey,
hand me your lighter.

1355
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:08,312
I can light
the candles, Mom.

1356
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:10,118
I can do this.

1357
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,055
I will do this.

1358
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,708
Thank you, Dr. O'Hara.

1359
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:40,086
You're welcome...
Ms. Herman.

1360
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:42,088
And please
call me Slavkin.

1361
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:46,619
Slavkin Stravinowsky.
