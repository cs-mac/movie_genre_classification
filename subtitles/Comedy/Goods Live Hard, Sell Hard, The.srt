    ALL MY ATTENTION ON YOU.

1417
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:37,340
    YOU WANT TO MAKE THINGS
    PERSONAL, FINE.

    McCLANE:
    YOU KNOW THIS GUY?!

1429
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:27,007
I WORKED WITH HIM.
HE WAS D.O.D.'s CHIEF PROGRAMMER

FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY.

1431
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,978
    AFTER 9/11, HE'S THE GUY
    THAT TOLD JOINT CHIEFS

1432
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:32,746
THE SYSTEM WAS VULNERABLE.

1433
01:14:32,813 --> 01:14:35,148
HE WAS PUSHING
FOR TOTAL OVERHAUL,
BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN.

1434
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:36,833
    GABRIEL'S NOT EXACTLY
    PEOPLE-FRIENDLY.

1435
01:14:36,901 --> 01:14:38,285
YOU THINK SO?

1436
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,653
WHEN HE TRIED TO GO PUBLIC,

1437
01:14:39,721 --> 01:14:41,872
    THEY CRUCIFIED HIM...

1438
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,591
DESTROYED HIS REPUTATION.

UH...

1440
01:14:45,343 --> 01:14:45,976
        HE DISAPPEARED.

1441
01:14:46,044 --> 01:14:48,461

1559
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:54,074
HE, HE HATES COPS.

    SO JUST LET ME DO

1569
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,258
        (SOFTLY):
        FREDDY?

1570
01:21:29,326 --> 01:21:30,510
        YOU GOT COMPANY.

1571
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:40,320
FREDERICK, DIDN'T
YOU HEAR ME?

1572
01:21:40,387 --> 01:21:42,555
ALL BALTIMORE HEARD YOU, MA.

1573
01:21:42,623 --> 01:21:44,273

01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:47,427
        COME ON, MA!

1576
01:21:47,495 --> 01:21:48,795
HOW MANY TIMES I GOT TO TELL YOU

1577
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,263
    DON'T BRING PEOPLE
    DOWN HERE, MAN?

1578
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,732
I CAN'T SEE TOO GOOD. IS THAT
A YOUNG BEARDED HAN SOLO?

1579
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,585
WHAT HAPPENED, MAN?
YOU LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT.

1580
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:56,819
NO, DUDE, I GAINED 30 POUNDS.
WHO IS THAT?

1581
01:21:57,105 --> 01:21:58,871
OH, THAT'S...
YOU KNOW WHAT? DOESN'T MATTER.

1582
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:00,956
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
DOING HERE? 'CAUSE OF YOU,
I AM ROCKIN'

1583
01:22:01,024 --> 01:22:03,443
        FIVE GENERATORS JUST
        SO I CAN STAY ONLINE.

1584
01:22:03,478 --> 01:22:05,312
        AND SINCE YOU'RE BEING
        HUNTED BY ASSASSINS,

1585
01:22:05,314 --> 01:22:08,248
    IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ME
    THINK, LIKE, THIS VISIT

1586
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,750
IS A VERY PRODUCTIVE OR
HEALTHY USE OF MY TIME, AND...

1587
01:22:10,818 --> 01:22:12,051
        HEY, HEY, DON'T
        TOUCH THAT, ALL RIGHT?

1588
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:14,020
        C.B. RADIO?

1589
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:16,356
A LITTLE LOW-TECH FOR YOU GUYS,
ISN'T IT?

1590
01:22:16,424 --> 01:22:20,059
LOW-TECH-- DUDE, THAT, MY
FRIEND, IS AN END-OF-THE-WORLD
INSURANCE SYSTEM, OKAY?

1591
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:21,894
            SO WHEN THE LAST
            MICROCHIP GOES DOWN,

1592
01:22:21,962 --> 01:22:23,963
        I'M GONNA BE ABLE
        TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH
        WHOEVER'S OUT THERE,

1593
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:26,366
WHETHER THEY BE ZOMBIES OR NOT,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

1594
01:22:26,434 --> 01:22:28,701
            WHAT'D YOU BRING
            YOUR DAD HERE FOR?!

1595
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:32,922
HE'S COOL; HE'S INTO THE WHOLE
GAMING CULTURE...
        NICE POSTER.

1596
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,241
WHAT, LIKE,
YOU A BIG FAN OF THE FETT?

1597
01:22:35,309 --> 01:22:36,927
(WHISPERS):
OH, GOD.
            NO.

1598
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:39,596
    I WAS ALWAYS MORE
    OF A <i>STAR WARS</i> GUY.

1599
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,264
     <i>STAR WARS</i> GUY.
            OH, HE'S KIDDING.

1600
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,999
            WHO IS THIS MAN?!
HE'S MY...

1601
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,667
        HEY, DUMP TRUCK,
        I'M NOT HIS DAD.

1602
01:22:44,735 --> 01:22:46,803
        I'M A COP.
        HOW ABOUT THAT?

1603
01:22:46,871 --> 01:22:49,472
    OH, A COP, I'M SORRY.
    THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1604
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:52,958
        WHY'D YOU BRING A COP
        INTO MY COMMAND CENTER?!

1605
01:22:53,026 --> 01:22:54,110
(LAUGHING):
IT'S A BASEMENT.

1606
01:22:55,829 --> 01:22:56,828
        IT'S A COMMAND CENTER.

1607
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,213
    DON'T HELP, McCLANE.
    I CAN EXPLAIN.

1608
01:22:58,281 --> 01:22:59,948
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT THOMAS GABRIEL, ALL RIGHT?

1609
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,633
THAT'S WHY WE CAME HERE.

1610
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:04,086

THIS IS MY HOUSE.

1615
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:13,528
        YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
        WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

1616
01:23:13,596 --> 01:23:17,048
    OR I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU
    TO DEATH IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.

01:23:17,116 --> 01:23:17,833
        (GATE CLANKS)

     <i>FOUR YEARS AGO, THE D.O.D.</i>

1619

A CYBER-SPOOK FOR THEM, OKAY?

1620
01:23:35,902 --> 01:23:37,686
    FIRST DAY ON THE JOB,
    GOES IN TO HIS BOSSES

1621
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:41,689
    AND TELLS THEM THIS NATION'S
    SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE
    IS WIDE OPEN TO COMPROMISE,

1622
01:23:41,691 --> 01:23:44,008
        AND WHAT DO THEY SAY?
        "WE'LL TAKE IT
        UNDER ADVISEMENT."

1623
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:46,795
    BUT THIS DUDE DON'T EASE UP,
    'CAUSE HE'S COMMITTED,
    LIKE YOU READ ABOUT,

1624

A MEETING OF THE JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, OKAY?

1625
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:52,950
    AND USING JUST A LAPTOP,
    HACKS INTO NORAD

1626
01:23:53,018 --> 01:23:55,002
        AND SHUTS DOWN OUR

            STOP THE HACK.

SHUT DOWN NORAD WITH A LAPTOP

    YOU THINK I'M SCARED OF YOU?
JUST TELL US HOW TO FIND
THE GUY, THAT'S ALL.

    THE GUY? HE'S A GHOST, MAN;
    HE JUST FELL OFF THE GRID.

1632

    THAT'S PROBABLY BEING USED
    BY THOMAS GABRIEL RIGHT NOW.

    I DON'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN
    TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

1641
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:27,619
                    HERE, LOOK.

IN THE COUNTRY THAT I CAN FIND

1643
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:33,158
        CURRENTLY EMPLOYING
        THAT PARTICULAR TEMPLATE

1644
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:35,377
IS THE SOCIAL SECURITY
ADMINISTRATION, OKAY?

1645
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,645
BUT THEY DON'T EVEN USE IT
IN THE MAIN FACILITY. LOOK.

1646
01:24:37,713 --> 01:24:39,714
THEY USE IT IN THIS BUILDING.

        WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
        GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

1650
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:48,539
THE POWER CONSUMPTION

    IT'S HOT.

1651
01:24:48,607 --> 01:24:50,858
WHY WOULD THERE BE
CHILLING TOWERS THERE?
    THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

1652
01:24:50,926 --> 01:24:52,911
    HO.

1653
01:24:52,978 --> 01:24:54,863
    WHAT'S A CHILLING TOWER?

1654
01:24:55,698 --> 01:24:58,199
SEE WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH?

1655
01:24:58,267 --> 01:25:01,920

01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:05,523
TELL YOU WHAT, GUYS.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN THAT BUILDING,
