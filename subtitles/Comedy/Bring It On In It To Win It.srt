1
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,022
Shit.

2
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,024
Mommy.

3
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,106
Mommy, can we play croquet today?

4
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,457
Where's Daddy?

5
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,330
He's running.

6
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,796
From what?

7
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,674
Shh. Oh. Oh.

8
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,138
Eat.

9
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,145
Oh, shit.
All right.

10
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
How was your run?
Good. It was good.

11
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,104
- Eat your breakfast.
- I don't like it.

12
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,694
You do too. Stop coloring.
I'm impressed you're keeping it up.

13
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,699
What brand is this?
They're the same.

14
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,327
Daddy, look, it's your team.
Hmm?

15
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,574
Oh. Hey. That's my team.
That's great, honey. Are they winning?

16
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,621
Yeah,
That's more like it. Oh, oh.

17
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,661
Shit!
Aw. Hey, hey.

18
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,048
Sweetheart, do not use words like that.
That's a bad word. Okay?

19
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,335
Okay.
Yes, that is a bad word.

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,844
Yes, it is.

21
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,426
What? Don't look at me.
Mm-hm. Okay.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,716
- Goodbye, sweetie. Goodbye, jellybean.
- Oh...

23
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,350
Bye, Daddy.

24
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,185
Hey.

25
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,563
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Why?

26
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,477
Just checking.

27
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,650
- Okay. Bye, guys.
- Bye.

28
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,110
Can I have more juice?

29
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,120
Mike! Did you call Fenn about the tree?

30
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,203
No. I will today.

31
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,793
Please do. I don't want it coming down
on the house.

32
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,135
Yeah, you're right. I will.

33
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,340
Love you.

34
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,090
I love you too, sweetie. Bye.
Bye.

35
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,726
Shit.

36
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,446
Vig?

37
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,278
I'm down here.

38
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,459
What's up, Vig?

39
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,086
Donna's out sick. I can't find
anything without her. This sucks.

40
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,800
Who was that guy?
Oh. That sucks more.

41
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,301
That's the plumber. I called him
to look at this piece-of-crap boiler.

42
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,510
Why?

43
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,972
Because it clanks and it's
driving me crazy. You don't hear this?

44
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,554
I hear it. I just figured that it's old, so...

45
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,732
He said we have to replace it
because it's gonna blow.

46
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,564
What? We just had it fixed
like three months ago.

47
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,108
He said that job was crap.
That guy did crap work.

48
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,273
Can you believe that? That little scumbag.
Heh.

49
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,282
Unbelievable.
Um...

50
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,237
How much to fix it? Did he say?
Ah, 6 grand.

51
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,871
Holy shit!
That's right.

52
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,698
Holy shit!
Tell me about it.

53
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,996
And I gotta tell you, I'm not doing great.

54
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,000
My business is off,
and my stepson wants to get the Lasik.

55
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,171
Really? Isn't he kind of young for that?
You know, I really don't care.

56
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,221
If he wants to get Lasik and it
makes him happy, then he can have it.

57
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,844
Okay, so, uh...

58
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,179
...what you want to do here?

59
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,852
Okay. I was thinking...

60
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,889
...let's just leave it for now. We just...

61
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,604
...put plastic on the files.

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,732
What you thinking?
That sounds great. That's good.

63
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,275
For now.
Yeah, fine.

64
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,233
Let's get out of here
before this thing blows.

65
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,949
I'll get some plastic
before practice.

66
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,409
Hey.

67
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:20,419
Good morning, Shelly. How you doing?
A little hungover. My boyfriend's a moron.

68
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,999
I'm sorry to hear that.

69
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,334
How'd the team do last night?
We lost.

70
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,874
Bummer.
Mm-hm.

71
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,045
Your noon canceled,
so you just have the 10:30 and the 3:00.

72
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,303
Anything else?

73
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,556
The toilet's not flushing again.

74
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,391
Should I call someone this time?

75
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,554
No, I'll take a look at it.
Who have I got at 10:30?

76
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,555
Frank.

77
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,810
You think your son stole it?

78
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,819
Yeah, I know he did.

79
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,275
Mm-hm.

80
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,649
Why would he steal your cat?

81
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,990
He's jealous of her. Very jealous.

82
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,120
Wow. I can see why.
It's a nice-looking cat.

83
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,909
Oh, yeah.

84
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,470
What's Vig doing with that plastic?

85
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,269
Who knows?

86
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,686
Leo, remember you got lost
and the police had to help you a few times.

87
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,697
That's why we got Jolie to help you.
Right?

88
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,782
So, what do we do now?

89
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,367
If that judge deems you incapacitated,
you'll need a guardian.

90
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,832
If we can't find your daughter...
She can't even find herself.

91
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:45,041
Okay. If we can't find her, then the state
will become your guardian.

92
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,500
What state?

93
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,168
Uh...

94
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,256
You know, the state... of New Jersey.

95
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,053
That's crazy.
I don't need New Jersey's help.

96
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:02,938
I got Jolie. And there's nothing
going on between us, so you know.

97
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,475
Okay. I'm sure that there's not. Uh...

98
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,405
Let's first try to find your daughter,
and then we'll go from there, okay?

99
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,240
Am I still hungover
or is that noise getting louder?

100
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,656
You're probably still hungover, Shelly.

101
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:25,415
We got copies of Leo's financial
statements. The guy's loaded.

102
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,000
Leo? Yeah.
Any luck finding his daughter?

103
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,208
No, that lady is gone.
I have tried everything.

104
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,668
Crap.

105
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,753
Let me see his file again.

106
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,219
Can't the state just leave him in his home?
That's what he wants.

107
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,430
Yeah, they could. But they won't.
It's too much work.

108
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,433
They'll move him into Oak Knoll.
Pass me a brochure.

109
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,814
But he's got Jolie. She can handle it.

110
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,193
No, she can't. The guardian
has to make all the decisions.

111
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,862
It's the difference
between a babysitter and a parent.

112
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,116
Well, that's a bummer.
I wish I could do it.

113
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,944
I could use the extra 1500 a month.

114
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,621
Fifteen hundred dollars?
Is that the commission?

115
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,620
It's in the file. I told you, he's loaded.

116
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,079
Mike Flaherty's office.

117
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,544
Move! Move! Stay right on him.

118
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,539
Don't cross your feet!

119
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,293
Stay on him!
Keep your chest right down on him!

120
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,302
<i>Runaway</i>
<i>When I say</i>

121
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,553
Other man!

122
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,761
Come on, let's go!
Move, don't cross your feet!

123
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,926
Hey, hey, hey.
Whose headgear is this?

124
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,891
Whose headgear? Stemler, wake up!

125
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,401
How's the team doing?
Not good.

126
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,231
What the hell happened, man?
We used to be good.

127
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,066
Not anymore.

128
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,160
Shit. Could we stop for a second?
Yeah.

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,031
Holy shit. That sucked.

130
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,411
You're running good, buddy.
You're kicking my ass.

131
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,046
I'm trying to get out here
a bit more often, you know?

132
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,332
You gotta be kidding me.

133
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,842
What?
Lori. Texting me at 7 in the morning...

134
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,049
...asking if I want an antique
sewing table we bought together.

135
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,931
Do you?
No! I want my fucking house back!

136
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,600
Is she still with that guy?
What, my contractor?

137
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,931
Guy I hired? Yeah.

138
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,643
Scumbag's probably walking around
my house wearing his tool belt.

139
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,682
Ha, ha.
Take a picture.

140
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,027
For chrissake,
Come on, take it.

141
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,779
Come on, it's cold!

142
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,370
Don't send it.
Too late. I hate her.

143
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,625
Maybe you should move back to the city.
Get a new job. Shake things up a little bit.

144
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,545
Finley called. He's starting
a fund in May. I'll wait for that.

145
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,331
That guy is starting
another fund already? Wow.

146
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,966
The guy's an animal. He prints money.

147
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,547
Heh, heh.
Come on.

148
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,507
Let's finish strong, all right?

149
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,494
Hold up!

150
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,745
What?

151
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,534
What's wrong?
Just hold up.

152
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,832
Hold up.
You okay?

153
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,669
I can't breathe.

154
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,587
You're breathing funny.

155
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,423
Mike. Holy shit. Mike, you okay?
I'm gonna call somebody.

156
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,718
Don't call, don't call. I'm fine.
Shit.

157
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,393
Fuck. Shit.

158
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,933
Okay, Mike...

159
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,194
Hey, hey. Is it your heart?
Buddy, are you having a heart attack?

160
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,065
No, I'm not having a heart attack.
I just can't breathe.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,451
Okay. You could be having a heart attack.
Let's lay down.

162
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,408
It's wet. I don't wanna lay down.

163
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,413
You're dying. Lay down. Come on.

164
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,371
Do me a favor and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

165
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,285
Why?
Just squeeze it.

166
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,788
Are you cold?
Yeah, I'm lying on the ground.

167
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,457
Okay. All right. I'm gonna blanket you.

168
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,299
I'm gonna warm you up.
I'm gonna warm you up. It's okay.

169
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,429
Shh. Shh.

170
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,386
Are you all right?

171
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,055
Sorry!

172
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,106
How long has that been happening?

173
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,654
Couple of months.
Doctor says it's stress.

174
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,612
He prescribe anything for you?

175
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,906
Yeah, jogging.
What do you think I'm doing out here?

176
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,323
That scared the shit out of me.
What are you stressed about?

177
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,789
I don't know.
Just work, money, everything.

178
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,454
Is it that bad?
Yeah, it is.

179
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,964
It is.

180
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,509
I don't know if I can
keep my practice going.

181
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,339
Really? Holy shit, Mike.
Yeah.

182
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,099
I've tried everything.
I have no idea what to do, Terry.

183
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,433
You told Jackie?
No. Not yet. I don't want to freak her out.

184
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,434
Good call. All right.

185
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,274
We just have to come up
with a new strategy, right?

186
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,277
What else can you do for money?

187
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,358
What am I gonna do, bartend?
I'm a lawyer, Terry. I practice the law.

188
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,525
I know.

189
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,788
I'm not some fricking scumbag.
I help out old people for chrissake.

190
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,793
No offense, but your pal Finley,
all he gives a crap about is making money.

191
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,128
Yeah, but that's why he makes it.

192
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,711
No shit, Terry. Thanks for the update.

193
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,999
I'm just wrapping up.

194
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,218
<i>Sharon called. She wants...</i>

195
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,846
Jack, I gotta take this other call. Okay?
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

196
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,882
All right. Bye.
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

197
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,184
- Hey, Tom.
- <i>Hey, Mike.</i>

198
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,437
How are you?
<i>Good, good, thanks.</i>

199
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,935
Thanks for getting back to me.
<i>How you doing?</i>

200
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,066
I'm good. I'm very good. Ha, ha.
<i>Good, good.</i>

201
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,647
<i>So, what's up?</i>
Um...

202
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,815
Listen. I was just following up
to see if you had any overflow.

203
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,775
It's been a slow month on this end.

204
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,320
<i>Yeah, look, I gotta be honest.</i>
<i>It's been a slow month on this end too.</i>

205
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,409
<i>We really don't have overflow at this point.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

206
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,498
Right. Yeah, okay.
<i>I wish I could help.</i>

207
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,833
No, I got it.
<i>It's been slow here too.</i>

208
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,091
I appreciate that. Yeah.
<i>Okay, good. If you need to reach out...</i>

209
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,820
Stop. Hold on.

210
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,609
Leo. Hold on a sec, Leo.

211
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,154
Go back through.
Somebody stop that gentleman, please.

212
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,031
<i>Any word from his daughter?</i>

213
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,704
No, Your Honor. We have the two
certified letters returned unclaimed.

214
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,376
There is no phone number for her.
We can't find her.

215
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,375
She is the only living family, correct?

216
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,296
Correct, but Mr. Poplar
has not seen her for over 20 years.

217
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,590
Who?
Your daughter.

218
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,307
Oh. She's late. Probably shopping
for some crap or something.

219
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,641
Okay.

220
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,727
Thank you, Mr. Flaherty.

221
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,978
Okay, as Mr. Poplar has been deemed
incapacitated by this court...

222
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,443
...I'm appointing the Office of
Public Guardian to serve as guardian...

223
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,232
...for his person and property.

224
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,322
Do you have the order for me to sign?

225
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,455
- Yes, I sure do, Your Honor.
- Then please approach.

226
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,669
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

227
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,798
Yes, Mr. Flaherty? What is it?

228
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,255
I would be willing to serve
as Mr. Poplar's guardian.

229
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,129
Really?
Yes.

230
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,764
You've known him how long?
Two weeks?

231
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,767
More like five.

232
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,766
Really?
And you want to be his guardian now?

233
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,728
May I approach, Your Honor?
Counsel, approach.

234
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,686
What's going on, Mike?

235
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,823
Judge, I feel I would be a better candidate
than the state in this particular case.

236
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,947
Really?
Yes. Stop saying, "Really." It's annoying.

237
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,111
I live in the same town as Mr. Poplar.

238
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,576
Proximity hardly qualifies him
as a guardian.

239
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,449
And as his lawyer...

240
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,540
...I am in a better position
to execute exactly what my client wants.

241
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,878
Mr. Flaherty
is Mr. Poplar's court-appointed attorney.

242
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,292
I know, Stu. I appointed him.

243
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,379
Well, that hardly qualifies him
as a guardian.

244
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,677
- I mean, why should we go along with this?
- Mike?

245
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,304
Judge, Leo has told me
that he wants to live at home.

246
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,982
He has the money to do that. I wanna make
sure that happens. If the state can do that...

247
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,897
Counsel knows we can't do that.

248
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,983
We're spread too thin
to give that kind of individual attention.

249
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,993
But there is an excellent elder-care facility
in Mr. Poplar's town. We'll put him there.

250
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,241
Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.

251
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,239
You can do that, Mike?

252
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,576
Yes, I can. Really.

253
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,213
Did we win?

254
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,754
Uh... Yeah, I think we did.

255
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,673
Good.

256
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,069
Are we going to the park?

257
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:24,207
No. I'm gonna help you settle into a new
place so you can live right here in town.

258
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,869
I don't need a new place. I have a house.

259
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,546
I don't need that fancy stuff.
I know.

260
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,544
I just need you to live in this place
for a little while. It's very nice. You'll like it.

261
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,633
Did the judge say that?

262
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,469
Yes, the judge said so.

263
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,634
Shit.

264
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,894
Okay?

265
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:42,531
<i>Still all my song shall be</i>

266
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,705
<i>Nearer, my God, to thee</i>

267
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,502
Have a great day, gentlemen. Okay?

268
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,708
All right. Come on, crazy-legs.

269
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,343
Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold.

270
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,556
We have to get bagels for your mom.
Okay.

271
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,763
I have to make one stop first.
Where?

272
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,053
I gotta shut the water off
at a client's house.

273
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,346
Why?

274
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,015
It's freezing out.
I don't want his pipes to burst.

275
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,435
No, I mean why are you doing it?

276
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,854
Uh... Oh. Because I'm his guardian.

277
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,899
What? Since when?
Since last week.

278
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,534
That's a big deal.
Were you even gonna tell me?

279
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,740
It's not a big deal. I was gonna tell you.

280
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,201
You don't have time
to take care of an old man.

281
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,583
He's at Oak Knoll.
They take care of everything.

282
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,039
I just have to check in on him
from time to time.

283
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,329
Well, who pays for that?

284
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:40,423
He does. Come on, kiddo. It comes out
of his estate. And he can afford it, trust me.

285
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,882
I don't get it.
You've never done it before.

286
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,506
No, I haven't.
So why are you doing it now?

287
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,974
Because it's the right thing to do, all right?
We couldn't find his daughter...

288
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,014
...and I just wanna help the guy out.
It's not a big deal.

289
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,400
It sounds like a big deal.
You should have told me.

290
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,650
What's a big deal?

291
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,066
Is this gonna take long?

292
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,864
Nope. It'll be two minutes.

293
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,154
Who's that?

294
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,944
No idea.

295
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,206
- Who is that, Mommy?
- I don't know, honey.

296
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,617
Daddy's gonna find out.

297
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,461
How you doing? Can I help you?
No.

298
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,305
You looking for Mr. Poplar?

299
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,969
Yeah.

300
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,473
He doesn't live here anymore.
Where does he live?

301
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,642
Mind telling me
why you're looking for him first?

302
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,439
He's my grandfather.
I came to live with him.

303
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,150
Ah.

304
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,830
You live around here, Kyle?

305
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,999
No. Ohio.

306
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,668
Ohio? Where are your parents?

307
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,506
It's just me and my mom. She's back
in Columbus. She couldn't come.

308
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,626
How did you get here?
Bus.

309
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,388
Really? All by yourself?
Yeah.

310
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,969
That sounds like a big deal.

311
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,481
Leo, how you doing?

312
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,141
You have a visitor.

313
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,312
Who? Him?
Yeah.

314
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,525
Hey.

315
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,775
Come on in. I'll turn off the TV.

316
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,540
<i>Let's just kick it around,</i>
<i>as they say, man to man.</i>

317
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,703
This is Kyle Timmons, Leo.
He's your grandson.

318
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,496
Came from Ohio to see you.

319
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,005
I don't have a grandson.

320
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,134
Yeah, you do. We just never met.

321
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,211
You gonna bring me home?

322
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,968
No, he's just here for a visit.

323
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,883
Oh.

324
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,687
Okay. You want to watch a little TV?

325
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,556
Yeah. Sure.

326
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,938
<i>Well, I'm very good at keeping secrets.</i>

327
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,774
<i>There's some things</i>
<i>I won't even tell myself.</i>

328
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,065
- <i>What is it, son?</i>
- <i>You're looking at it.</i>

329
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:11,031
So I'll pick you up in about an hour.
Okay.

330
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,413
<i>...like everybody does, Father,</i>
<i>only you're too polite to say anything.</i>

331
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,700
So you called his mother?
No, not yet.

332
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,541
Oh. He was smoking too. He's 16.

333
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,795
Well, he's probably on drugs.
What are you gonna do with him?

334
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,590
We're gonna send him back,
is what we'll do.

335
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,177
I certainly hope so.
You got your hands full over there.

336
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,726
Now taking care of that old man too?
Sounds like too much, Mike.

337
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,763
It is too much. And somehow
he forgot to tell me all about it.

338
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,603
- I told you.
- No, not until I asked.

339
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,645
His daughter should be taking care of him,
not you. You got me to worry about.

340
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,777
I don't have to worry about him.
He's at Oak Knoll.

341
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,193
Can we play croquet today?
The whole thing sounds crazy.

342
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,074
It is crazy. It's crazy.

343
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,613
Who's crazy?

344
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,661
Me.

345
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,746
- So he lives here now?
- Uh-huh.

346
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:09,214
Your grandfather's in the early stages
of dementia, Kyle, so he needs a little help.

347
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,219
Are you a friend of his
or something?

348
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,798
Uh, I'm his guardian.

349
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,466
What does that mean?

350
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,056
I make sure that he's well taken care of.

351
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,103
That's cool.

352
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,898
<i>Meow, meow.</i>

353
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,654
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow.</i>

354
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,486
Oh, hey.

355
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,819
Everything all right?
Yeah.

356
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,873
Did you reach your mom?
Yeah. I told her I was coming home.

357
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,542
Did she wanna talk to me or anything?

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,165
No.

359
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,047
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you can't stay longer.

360
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,254
But maybe you can come back
again and visit with your mom.

361
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,092
Yeah, maybe.
If I wanna smoke, should I go outside?

362
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,181
You shouldn't be smoking.

363
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,183
I know. But if I do.

364
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,265
Then you should go outside.
All right. Good night, Jackie.

365
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,026
Good night, Kyle.

366
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,575
What are you doing?

367
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:22,207
We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking
any chances with Eminem down there.

368
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,877
There's not even a bathroom down there.

369
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,723
Can you get these people to get me some
Cocoa Puffs? I really like them.

370
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,977
You got it.

371
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,860
That Mike is a standup guy.
You need cereal, go see him.

372
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,776
Okay. We should go, Kyle.

373
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,073
Okay. Bye, Leo.

374
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,194
You going to work?
No, I'm going home.

375
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,408
Don't take any shit
from any of those guys.

376
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,039
I won't.

377
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,495
Here's 50 bucks, in case you need it.

378
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,209
I have money.

379
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,090
Actually, it's only 43, but take it.
You never know.

380
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,717
I have enough money, but thanks.

381
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,719
Okay.

382
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,339
Well, good luck, Kyle.

383
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,015
You too, Mike.

384
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,565
Hello.

385
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,109
Yes, it is.

386
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,645
Who is it?

387
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,438
What?

388
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,317
- Take care, fellas.
- Yeah, all right, Mike.

389
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,661
So, what happened?
I decided not to go home.

390
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,699
Then you decided you'd break
into your grandfather's house?

391
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:49,629
You mind if I have a quick smoke?
Yes, I do. Get in the car.

392
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,465
You wanna talk about it?

393
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,638
Not really.

394
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,097
Well, good luck with that, pal.

395
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,560
Oh, you'll see.

396
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,780
Kyle, we can't help you
unless you tell us what's going on.

397
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,157
Is there a reason
you don't wanna go home?

398
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,368
What happened to your eye?

399
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,074
Kyle, you can trust us.

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,874
Really.

401
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,789
I can't live there anymore.

402
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,960
With your mom?
Did she do that to your eye?

403
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:42,219
No. She's not even there.
She's at a clinic or hospital or something.

404
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,717
I'm living with Craig.
Who's Craig?

405
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,519
Her boyfriend, I guess.
But he's an asshole.

406
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,806
Does she even know you're here?

407
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,851
My mom? She doesn't care about me.

408
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,981
How do you know? She's probably worried
sick and doesn't know how to reach you.

409
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,109
She could've called, right?

410
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,290
We don't have a choice.
Ah. What are we gonna do, adopt him?

411
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,548
No.

412
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,177
But I'm not sending him back there until
I talk to his mom. She better call me back.

413
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,806
Honey...

414
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,347
Honey, I know that this is tough...

415
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,730
...but we're not in a position
to take care of another kid right now.

416
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,518
I don't care. I'm not sending him
back there. I can't.

417
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,527
For the record, I'm not happy about it.

418
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,905
Fine. Then we don't have to do this.

419
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,487
Yes, we do, Mike. We do.

420
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:48,114
It makes me so angry and so damn sad
to see him in this situation. He's just a kid.

421
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,825
Yeah, I know. I know.

422
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,085
I wanna go to Ohio
and beat the crap out of his mom.

423
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,464
Okay, come on,
No, I do.

424
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,249
I wanna beat the crap out of her...

425
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,214
...and her stupid boyfriend.
Okay.

426
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,174
I'm serious.
I know you are.

427
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:08,308
I just don't think that beating the crap out
of everybody is the best solution. That's all.

428
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,139
It feels like it.

429
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,063
<i>It's just one thing after another.</i>

430
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,439
So get rid of him again.

431
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,818
<i>I can't. We gotta figure out</i>
<i>what's going on back there.</i>

432
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,444
You talked to his mother?

433
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,527
<i>Not yet. Jackie's left her like 30 messages.</i>

434
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,404
<i>She's driving me crazy.</i>

435
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,194
Motherfucker. He is wearing his tool belt.

436
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,037
<i>What? Who?</i>

437
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,706
No, nothing, dude. Sorry. I'm distracted.

438
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,459
Where are you?
Are you watching Lori's house again?

439
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,621
It's my fucking house. And, no.

440
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,418
I'm driving. Where's the kid now?

441
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,300
In my waiting room.
Jackie made me take him with me.

442
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,632
<i>Listen to me, Mike. You listening?</i>
Mm-hm.

443
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,798
<i>This Isn't the time</i>
<i>to long that stock. Know what I mean?</i>

444
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,599
No. What does that mean?

445
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,851
You need to do what's best for you now.

446
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,480
That's not taking care of another kid,
especially a convict.

447
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,433
Yeah. Well, tell that to my wife, okay?

448
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,977
I found her.

449
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,817
Let me call you back.
<i>Get rid of the convict, Mike.</i>

450
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,817
She's in a drug treatment program
in Columbus. Got five weeks to go.

451
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,865
Jesus Christ. Can I talk to her?

452
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,992
No, they said she would call you.

453
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,244
Kind of a sweet kid,
but what's up with the hair?

454
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,289
Who the hell knows? Yeah?

455
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,835
- Hey, Mike. Hey, Shelly.
- Hi.

456
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,923
You think I can go see Leo?

457
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,680
Um, yeah, sure. Okay.
You know where it is?

458
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,091
Yeah. Down the street, right?
Uh-huh.

459
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,512
Okay. But just stay there.
I will come get you about 3.

460
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,351
Yeah. Later.

461
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,732
Later.

462
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,860
<i>Kill me</i>

463
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,022
<i>Just kill me</i>

464
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,192
<i>Just kill, kill</i>

465
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,361
<i>Kill me now</i>
<i>Kill me, kill me</i>

466
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,826
Oh, for crying out loud.
Rew, what the hell are you doing?

467
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,710
Get down there. Coach!
Phil, shut that off.

468
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,336
Watch it, guys.

469
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,045
Everybody, watch this. Everybody, watch,
because none of you are doing it right.

470
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,052
Get your chest on him.
That's a little too much.

471
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,553
A little further back, coach.

472
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,636
Like this?
Uh... Good, right there.

473
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,893
Get your full weight up on your toes.
Put your full weight on him.

474
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,896
Like that. Cross-face, grab the ankle,
and drive right through.

475
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,440
Good.

476
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,896
What up, pancake?
Shut up, Chewbacca.

477
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,230
More like the Secret Apprentice.
What are you, 10?

478
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,571
Wookiees wouldn't survive on the...
Hey! Hey!

479
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,157
We are trying
to teach you something here!

480
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,698
And you are all screwing around.
Shut up!

481
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,082
Quiet!

482
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,916
The last time that I checked, we haven't
won a single match. Right, coach?

483
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,876
- It's embarrassing.
- It's embarrassing!

484
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm not getting paid enough to sit here
and jerk around. I don't know about you.

485
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,089
I'm not getting enough.

486
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,598
I care about what I do!
So does Coach Vig! And so should you!

487
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,934
Run them, coach. Run them.

488
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,345
I can't stand looking
at these punks anymore.

489
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,933
Let's go, ladies!

490
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,107
Here.

491
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,821
Have some more corn.

492
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,985
- Thank you.
- I'll get you some more milk too.

493
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,320
Thanks.

494
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,114
Mike, did you call Fenn about the tree?

495
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,623
Uh... Ahem.

496
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,127
Yeah. But I talked to Terry,
and I think the two of us can do this...

497
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,130
Oh, no, no, don't start.
You two are not cutting down that tree.

498
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,792
Just call Fenn.

499
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,712
I'm gonna get her some Tylenol.

500
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,973
Do you wanna play croquet?

501
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,139
When?
When it's warm out.

502
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,351
Yeah. Maybe.
Cool.

503
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,773
Daddy, can I watch TV?

504
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,943
Yes, you can.
But just a half an hour, all right?

505
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,819
- Hey, Mike.
- Mm-hm.

506
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,659
You think I could practice
with you guys tomorrow?

507
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,995
Yeah, if you want. Sure.

508
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,826
All right, thanks.

509
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,255
By the way, what I did in there today,
yelling like that, I don't usually do that.

510
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,667
That's okay. They deserved it.

511
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,185
I don't have wrestling shoes.

512
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,847
Don't worry about it. You wrestle before?
Yeah.

513
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,525
Take it easy, all right?
All right.

514
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,436
Come on, get an ankle! Get an ankle.

515
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,982
Vig, can I have a second here?

516
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,026
Thanks. Okay, guys...

517
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,868
...listen up. Kyle here's gonna be
working out with us for a little while. Okay?

518
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,705
- What up, Kyle?
- Carlos, you and Jimmy rotate him in.

519
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,043
You got 10 seconds to get an ankle,
then we switch it up.

520
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,671
He'll try to take you down first,
then switch. Take it easy.

521
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,176
Okay, here we go.

522
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,055
<i>Fahrenheit 101</i>

523
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,892
<i>She got the long legs to prove it</i>

524
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,642
Switch it up. Here we go.

525
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,521
<i>She's a triple-X movie just walking by</i>

526
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,066
<i>Lip gloss, high heels</i>
<i>I'm losing my mind</i>

527
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,736
<i>She's coming at me like a wrecking ball</i>

528
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,929
Man, it's cold.

529
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,091
You have fun?
Yeah.

530
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,893
When's the last time you wrestled?
Couple years ago.

531
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,639
Why'd you stop?
Just felt like it.

532
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,852
Oh.

533
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,602
Hey, let me ask you something, Kyle.

534
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,946
How good are you?

535
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,107
I'm pretty good.

536
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,915
Holy shit.

537
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,414
Holy shit.

538
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,257
Did you see it?

539
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,793
This is the kid? Kyle Timmons?
That's the kid.

540
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,132
Wow.
Yeah, right?

541
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,639
He finished second at the states in Ohio.
Ohio's tough, dude.

542
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,222
Says he had 17 pins his freshman year.

543
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,353
What is that?
I'm playing Wii Golf.

544
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,264
Oh. That's cool.
Yeah, I'm awesome.

545
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,107
What'd he do his sophomore year?

546
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,361
I don't know. I couldn't find anything.
I don't think he wrestled.

547
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,737
Why?
I don't know.

548
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,193
He doesn't talk much.
He's kind of a weird kid.

549
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,859
Want another beer?
Yeah.

550
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,747
Why can't I have one kid
on my team like that, you know? Just one.

551
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,329
Well, you do. Right there.

552
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,035
Take that kid to states.

553
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,626
He's not on the team. He's not
even a student. Been here for three days.

554
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,210
So what? Enroll him.

555
00:34:55,385 --> 00:35:00,049
I can't enroll him. He's just here until we
reach his mother and we figure this out.

556
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,839
All right. So he's gotta do something.
Let him wrestle.

557
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,515
That's a nice bowl, man.

558
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,847
Yeah. Wedding gift. Yeah.
Oh.

559
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,012
Dude, look at it this way.

560
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:13,691
You're helping the old man out, and this kid
is like a bonus for doing the right thing.

561
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,520
Yeah, I'm not just
helping the old man out.

562
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,532
It's not like it's charity work, you know?
I'm getting paid for it.

563
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:25,537
Yeah, no shit, Mike. Everybody gets paid.
But, dude, think about it, all right?

564
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:30,918
What are the odds of this kid ending up
on your doorstep and wrestling like that?

565
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,036
That's a sign.

566
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,338
Check it out. One of his matches.

567
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,386
He's setting him up. See?
He's setting him up. He's gonna throw him.

568
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,720
There he goes.

569
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,062
Oh, my God!
High five! Yes!

570
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,563
Whoo!

571
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,725
Okay.

572
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,897
Here's $5 for lunch. I don't know what it
costs. But let me know when you find out.

573
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,815
I have money, but thanks.

574
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,985
Good for you. Save it.
Come on, take it. It's too early to argue.

575
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,530
- Okay. I'm ready. Let's go, pal.
- All right.

576
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,914
See you tonight.

577
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,416
Bye, Jackie.
Bye.

578
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,918
Hey.
Yeah. Hold on.

579
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,253
You sure we should do this?

580
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,758
Why not? I mean, if he's here two more days
or two weeks, it gives him something to do.

581
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,594
Unless you want him hanging out here.

582
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,766
No, you're right. We should do it.

583
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,779
Hey, Mike.
Uh-huh?

584
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:47,578
We got a check from Leo Poplar's trust for
1500, but it's made out to you, not the firm.

585
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,285
Uh-huh. Yeah, right. I'll take that.

586
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,290
Shouldn't I deposit it
in the business account?

587
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,496
Um...

588
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,708
No, it's not a legal fee, it's a personal fee.
For what?

589
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,050
I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship.
Really?

590
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,804
Yeah. Didn't I mention that to you?
You definitely didn't mention that.

591
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,466
Yeah. It ended up playing out that way.
I gotta get going, okay?

592
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,557
Can we put some of that in the business
account so they don't take our copier back?

593
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,020
No, not this time.
Next month, I promise. Bye, Shelly.

594
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,816
We need our copier, Mike.
I know.

595
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,814
That noise is getting louder.
I'm not hungover today.

596
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,655
That's good.
That's good?

597
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,529
Hey, honey.

598
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,874
No, I'm good.
Yeah, listen, can you do me a favor?

599
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,002
Mail the health insurance check.
I forgot to mail it.

600
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,207
I think it's on the desk.

601
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,634
Hey. What up, fellas?

602
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,673
Hitting the showers, huh?

603
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,351
That sounded weird.

604
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,683
The guy's unbelievable.

605
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,643
You want me to talk to Reed?

606
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,853
No, let me check with Kyle first.

607
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,112
Oh, yeah, coaches' office. Hey, Vig.
Hey, Terry.

608
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,362
What are you doing here?

609
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,945
What am I doing here?
What do you think? I gotta see this kid.

610
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,866
He's incredible.
He's good to wrestle. Mike cleared him.

611
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,328
Really?

612
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,990
- Yeah.
- All right.

613
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,000
So where we at?

614
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,875
Uh, we're trying to figure out
where he fits in.

615
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,713
Heh. Wherever the hell he wants, right?
Uh, no, not right.

616
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,219
Unfortunately, we have a system here.

617
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,297
Excuse me, Vig.

618
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,552
Hey, Kyle. Come on in. How's school?

619
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,058
It's okay.
Good. This is my friend Terry.

620
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,566
Hey, man. Good to meet you.
Great to meet you. Welcome.

621
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,065
Thanks.
Terry. Terry.

622
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,943
How are the shoes?
They're good.

623
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,402
Good.
Here you go.

624
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,570
I wanted to ask you something, Kyle.
Think you might wanna wrestle in a match?

625
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,908
Okay.

626
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,829
Good. We got one on Saturday.
What do you wrestle?

627
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,083
I used to wrestle 103,
but that's not gonna happen.

628
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,335
I could make 119 by Saturday.

629
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,091
Excellent. Done.
Ter.

630
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,342
Sorry.

631
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,256
Is there anyone there now?
Jimmy Reed, but he's not very good.

632
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,847
Yeah, but he might actually
be better off at 125, Vig.

633
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:21,606
- Don't you think we should wrestle off?
- Yeah.

634
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,144
<i>There's no place I'd rather be</i>
<i>Than anywhere else but here</i>

635
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,029
<i>Can't you see that I'm</i>
<i>Sick and tired of all the bullshit</i>

636
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,485
Good luck, man.

637
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,651
Thanks.

638
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,820
Okay, let's get them started.
Okay.

639
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,573
Wrestle off!

640
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,914
- All right, let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

641
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,665
Keep time, Vig.
I'll do it. You don't mind, do you?

642
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,628
No, go ahead.

643
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,628
Nice.
What?

644
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,297
Let's go, guys. Shake hands.

645
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,489
Wow. That is really fast. That's really fast.
Shh, shh.

646
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,990
Yes!

647
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,369
- Good match.
- Didn't feel good.

648
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,530
I don't think we can teach him anything.

649
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,002
Just being in that place
brought back all the memories, I gotta say.

650
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,331
The smell. It's like a form of self-abuse.

651
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,998
Were you guys really that bad?

652
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,792
- Mike was average.
- Yeah.

653
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,302
Right? I sucked. Sorry, Abby.

654
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,679
That's okay.

655
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,510
You were really better than Terry?

656
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,269
Yeah. Mike was scrappy. Abby, your dad was
like an angry little ferret when he wrestled.

657
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,271
We should have joined the ski club.

658
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,479
We could have gotten busy
with Alison Shepherd on overnights.

659
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,815
Terry.
Who was busy?

660
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,984
Your Uncle Terry's just being silly.

661
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,616
Sorry, Abby. Getting busy is bad.
Ha, ha.

662
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,948
So is getting married.
For crying out loud.

663
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,658
Getting married is bad?

664
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,791
Different viewpoints are important. Right?
No, not right, Terry.

665
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,203
You really need to get back up
on the horse.

666
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,167
- Okay, Mom.
- We should go.

667
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,877
I have to stop by the office.

668
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,678
How do you think
we'd do against Kyle, like, now?

669
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,216
Are you kidding me? He'd kill us.
Both of us, together.

670
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,101
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

671
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,061
Kid's got man strength, dude.

672
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,308
Man strength?
Mm. Like, not kid strength, man strength.

673
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,523
I wouldn't say that
around the locker room, Terry.

674
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,772
What are you doing in there?

675
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,317
Trying to figure out what's wrong
with my fricking backup system.

676
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,114
Just call your IT guy.

677
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,281
I don't have an IT guy. IT guys cost money.
Right.

678
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,708
You know what?
I'm just gonna say what's on my mind here.

679
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,584
I wanna be an assistant coach too.

680
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,169
Seriously?
Yeah. Why not?

681
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,552
Dude, I'm value added,
especially compared to Vig.

682
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,054
How are you value added?

683
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,840
Well, first of all, I'm fun.
There's no denying that.

684
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,931
Secondly, unlike Vig,
I actually used to wrestle.

685
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,436
Yeah, but, Ter, you sucked.

686
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,597
Mike, come on. I'm serious here.

687
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,814
I need some distraction in my life
right now. I'm sitting in that condo...

688
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,024
...just thinking about Lori and that guy...

689
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,281
...having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for.
It's fucking unhealthy.

690
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,197
I'm going kind of crazy right now.

691
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,115
Really.

692
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,367
We start at 3:30 p.m.

693
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,456
Don't be late.

694
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,043
My brother.
Hey, I'm not gonna let you down.

695
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,218
To the team.
All right.

696
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,761
What should I wear to my first practice?
Just a singlet.

697
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,643
Seriously?
Yeah, so we can see your man strength.

698
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,731
<i>Incoming call. Do you copy?</i>

699
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:55,692
<i>Incoming call. Charlie Squadron</i>
<i>taking heavy fire. Requesting airstrike...</i>

700
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,449
Hello. Hello?

701
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:03,198
This is Jackie Flaherty.
Kyle's staying with us.

702
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,536
Oh, I am gonna kill that lady.

703
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,331
Hi.

704
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,997
Your phone rang. Your mom called.

705
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,298
You answered it?

706
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,926
Yeah. We've been waiting
to hear from her.

707
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,845
What'd she say?

708
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,183
She didn't say anything. She hung up.
You talk to her?

709
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,470
No, but can you please not
answer my phone anymore?

710
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,349
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

711
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,898
Oh. Here. You shouldn't be smoking,
but if you do...

712
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,034
...could you put the butts out in here?
I quit.

713
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,867
Now that I'm wrestling again,
I can't smoke.

714
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,622
Pretty cool, right?

715
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,539
Yeah, it's very cool.

716
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,052
Was that Abby?
Mm.

717
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,589
If it is, she just ran away.

718
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,149
Hey. Were you outside?

719
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,817
Yeah. I went for a run.

720
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,327
Oh.

721
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,039
It's pretty early.
You do that every morning?

722
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,579
In season, yeah.

723
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,539
Huh.

724
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,672
Oh, um... You think I can use the weights
in the closet?

725
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,087
Absolutely. Help yourself.

726
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,553
All right. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

727
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,553
That was Kyle. He was working out.

728
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,767
Is he gonna do that
every morning?

729
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,932
In season, yeah.

730
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,272
I hate you.

731
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,610
Timmons.

732
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,489
One-nineteen. Good.

733
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,403
One-nineteen, got it.

734
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,280
Look at those tattoos.

735
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,290
Kid is so fricking cool.

736
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,286
125, Dreadlow.

737
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,131
<i>Now's the revolution</i>
<i>They're pushin' you down</i>

738

744
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,142
This song sucks.
Rew picked it. He's an odd one.

745
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,854
- Vig, which one is your kid?
- None of them. He quit.

746
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,313
Really? Your son quit?

747
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,604
My stepson.
I thought it'd be a nice way to bond...

748
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,773
...but he said it wasn't fierce and quit.

749
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,237
Harsh. So what are you still doing it for?

750
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,118
Vig is leading by example.
Winners never quit, right?

751
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,496
That's right, even if I'm not fierce.

752
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,870
Um, I sit there.

753
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,330
Sorry, I gotta sit next to Mike.
It's good luck.

754
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,494
Says who?

755
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,416
Guys. Guys. I don't think we should fight
about our seats in front of the kids.

756
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,675
I'm not really fighting.
Come on.

757
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,380
All right. Sit wherever you want.

758
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,181
I feel overdressed.

759
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,018
Let's go.
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

760
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,648
<i>I always sit there.</i>

761
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,934
<i>First day.</i>

762
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,399
Up! There you go! Shoot!

763
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,488
Take him down, Carlos! Come on.

764
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,530
There you go.

765
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,120
All right, Carlos.

766
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,751
All right.

767
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,540
Good match.
Yeah, great, thanks.

768
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,128
Hey. Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

769
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:53,141
Okay. This kid is good, so, you know,
you just be ready out there.

770
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:57,680
Okay. Can you give me a slap?
What?

771
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,731
Slap me across the face,
like you're trying to wake me up.

772
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,392
Uh-huh. Okay. Like that?

773
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,644
Yeah, but a little harder.

774
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,489
Go ahead,
hit him.

775
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,238
- Timmons.
- Let's go, Kyle!

776
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,411
Let's go, Kyle. Take this punk out!

777
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:21,703
Oh, Terry, hey, cut the shit, man. You're
a coach. You're not sitting in the stands.

778
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,088
I get excited. You know how I get.
I know.

779
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,874
I'm just coaching. Come on, buddy.

780
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,423
Okay, Kyle.

781
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,343
- Let's go, Kyle!
- Get your head up!

782
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,359
- Focus up.
- Go on, Kyle!

783
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,445
Fresh start.

784
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,196
- Get out of that.
- Keep the leg back!

785
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,080
Get out of that.
Get out, Kyle.

786
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,495
Two, red.

787
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,708
Get back on base!

788
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,174
What the hell is he doing?
Losing.

789
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,461
It's his first match, give him a break.

790
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,177
Eye on the prize, eye on the prize.

791
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,644
Hey. You okay?

792
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,316
Did he smile?
Yeah, I think he did.

793
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,160
Hey, beautiful!

794
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,912
Here we go!

795
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,324
Pioneers!
Nice.

796
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,836
Told you I'm good luck.
Had nothing to do with luck.

797
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,748
Beautiful. How'd that feel? Pretty good?

798
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,046
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

799
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,461
You ready?
Yeah. Can you slap me too, coach?

800
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,879
Uh-huh.

801
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,475
<i>Well, I said you cannot</i>
<i>touch the other gloves...</i>

802
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,433
I'm off to the market. Be back in a bit.

803
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,567
Can I go with you?
Uh, yeah, okay.

804
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,569
All right.
Let me grab my sweatshirt real quick.

805
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,612
Heh.
I wanna go with Kyle.

806
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,528
No, sweetheart, it's almost time for bed.

807
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,571
Please?
No.

808
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,290
Oh, Cocoa Puffs. Is that your brand?

809
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,545
No, they're for Leo.

810
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,923
How nice. Drop it in. It's on me.

811
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,376
Go ahead.
Thanks.

812
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,719
How's he doing?

813
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:40,304
He's okay. He can say
some pretty funny things, though.

814
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,845
The other day he told me I was fired.
Fired? For what?

815
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,267
I don't know. He just fired me.

816
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,899
Hmm, I think I have to meet this Leo.

817
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,067
Grab me two spaghettis.

818
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,025
Thanks.

819
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,569
Do you have any homework?
A little. I hate homework.

820
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,074
You ever think of going to college?

821
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:05,158
Yeah, but just to wrestle. My old coach
thought I could get a scholarship.

822
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,827
Yeah, I heard you were pretty good.
Why'd you quit?

823
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,383
That's okay. You don't have to tell me.

824
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,759
Ah.

825
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,091
You like tacos?
Yeah.

826
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,683
Me too. I make a mean taco.

827
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,935
Let's go! Let's stay focused!
Focus, guys! Good things will come!

828
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,147
Okay, coach, let's bring them in.

829
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,112
Come on!
Let's go. Sit down, everybody!

830
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,113
Have a seat.
Bring it in.

831
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,284
All right.

832
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,120
I wanna spend this week
working on bottom position.

833
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,622
Ha, ha.
Stemler.

834
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:50,036
Now, did you guys all see what Kyle did
the other day? He exploded up, right?

835
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,954
Kyle, show the guys what you did.

836
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,044
It's kind of my own thing.

837
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,126
Well, can you share it with us?

838
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,472
But it's not even a move or anything.
That's okay.

839
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:03,133
All right.

840
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,636
Well, I just tell myself that...

841
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:11,016
...the guy on top is trying to take my head
and shove it underwater and kill me.

842
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:17,023
And if I don't wanna die on bottom, I have
to do whatever the fuck it takes to get out.

843
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:25,497
Okay. So the move is, "whatever
the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's work on it!

844
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,993
Whatever the fuck it takes! Let's go! Up!
Come on, guys.

845
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:34,255
<i>You think because you pay the bills,</i>
<i>you have the right for all the say...</i>

846
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,838
<i>...you don't see to her,</i>
<i>you don't care for her...</i>

847
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:38,593
Your mother wouldn't come, huh?

848
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,347
No.
That girl was always a tough kid.

849
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:45,304
She say bad things about me?

850
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,478
Yeah, but I never listen to her anyways.

851
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,390
But you should. That's your mother.

852
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,433
Respect that.

853
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:56,695
Could you turn that down?
I hate that judge.

854
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,821
She's the reason I'm here.

855
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,609
But, Leo, this place is pretty nice.

856
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,323
But it's not my house.

857
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,704
I paid for my house.

858
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,873
I own my housel

859
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,955
Damn judge. Shut it off!

860
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:14,087
<i>...this woman $1500</i>
<i>In transition...</i>

861
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:24,010
You wanna go for a walk outside, Leo?

862
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,268
Yeah. Let's go to my park.

863
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,055
Your park, huh?

864
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:34,437
Yeah, my park.

865
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:38,566
Hey, did you bring the tape?
Yeah, it's in my bag.

866
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:42,069
Mike, can I ask you something?
Mm-hm. Yeah.

867
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,733
Of course. What?

868
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,871
Leo told me that some judge
made him move into that place.

869
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,909
He said that, huh?
Yeah. Is that true, or is he just making it up?

870
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:55,954
Uh...

871
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,749
No, that's true, pal.

872
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:00,758
Why?
Well...

873
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:04,137
...because they take
really good care of him there, you know?

874
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,763
But he wants to live at home.
Oh. I know.

875
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,269
I know. It's, uh, complicated.

876
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,431
Sorry.

877
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,933
Hello.

878
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:19,026
Yes, this is him.

879
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,608
Oh, hi.

880
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:26,151
Yeah, can you hold on just a moment,
please? Thanks.

881
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,619
Uh, I gotta take this.

882
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,239
I'll be in in a minute, okay?

883
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:33,500
All right.
Thanks.

884
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:42,964
What? She doesn't even know us.

885
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,800
I think she heard that I'm a lawyer,
and I have a family...

886
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,384
...and that was good enough.

887
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,220
For how long?
Another month.

888
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:51,555
Until she gets out of rehab.
A month?

889
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,436
Yes.
Holy crap.

890
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:56,143
But, you know, she said
that this Craig guy took off...

891
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,308
...and she really sounded kind of shaky.

892
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,393
I can't believe this lady.

893
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:02,816
No, I know.

894
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:06,654
Where is he, anyway?
In the basement with Abby.

895
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,244
This is crazy.
Yes, it is.

896
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:11,579
So, what do we do?

897
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:16,497
We let him stay. I don't know.
Do we even have a choice?

898
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,453
I guess we don't.

899
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,644
What's up?

900
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,438
You nervous?
No.

901
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:39,099
I am.

902
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:43,941
You're not wrestling.
Yeah, I know, I'm just nervous a lot.

903
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,272
Ever think about wrestling in a match?

904
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,193
I'm just waiting for the green light
from coach, you know?

905
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,990
Yeah. That's cool.

906
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,622
Dude, I'm glad I'm not wrestling today.

907
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,533
These guys are ranked fourth in state.

908
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:59,874
You're wrestling Kenny Randall.
He's undefeated. He's tough.

909
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,538
Really tough.

910
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,707
Whole team's tough.

911
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:06,334
I hate going to this fricking place.

912
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:08,716
Maybe that's why you're nervous.

913
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,720
Yeah. Maybe.

914
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,055
All right, cut the chatter! Cut the chatter!

915
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,352
Now, you should all be playing
the "What If" game.

916
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,017
What if he shoots a single leg?

917
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:25,403
What if he controls my wrist?
What if we all got pinned like last year?

918
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:28,861
Stemler, I swear to God, I'm gonna
throw you right off this bus myself.

919
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,321
Now, shut up.
My bad, Coach Vig.

920
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,827
Shut up!

921
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,031
- Way to go, Stemler.
- Shut up, Stemler.

922
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:43,372
They really pin all of you?
Just about.

923
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:46,208
It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath.

924
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:06,315
All right, Carlos. Kyle.

925
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,941
Okay. This is Kenny Randall.
He's very good.

926
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,781
Yeah, I heard.
All right, but you have an advantage here.

927
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,947
He has no idea who you are, right?
He's gonna be over-confident.

928
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,912
Take advantage of that.
He's gonna come at you, definitely.

929
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:23,458
Use his momentum, take a shot,
and put him away. Okay?

930
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:24,871
Okay.
Yeah?

931
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,710
...and Randall, Sheffield.

932
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,171
Why'd Daddy hit Kyle?
I have no idea.

933
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,135
- Come on, guys.
- Focus, Kyle, focus.

934
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,221
Let's go, baby. Let's go, Kyle!

935
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:41,479
Look alive! Look alive!
Let's go, come on! Come on!

936
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,481
Be a winner, Kyle!

937
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,688
- Shake hands.
- Don't wait. Go after him.

938
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:51,982
Take your time, Kenny.
Work around, take him down.

939
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,160
No way.

940
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:03,414
Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit!

941
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:06,830
He just pinned Kenny Randall.
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

942
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:10,125
Guys, guys, guys, calm down.
Calm down, calm down, all right?

943
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:13,010
There you go, Kyle!
How about that?

944
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,514
He knows who I am now.
You're goddamned right he does!

945
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,899
Hi.
Hey.

946
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,402
Can I watch TV in here?
Oh, yeah.

947
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:32,029
Oh. Wait, I wanna
show you something first.

948
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,363
Stella, who's that?
Kyle.

949
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,953
She started doing that
at the wrestling match today.

950
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,785
That's cool.
Yeah.

951
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,078
Okay, I gotta ask. Those tattoos.
They must have hurt, right?

952
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:48,917
Not really.
No, come on, don't lie to me.

953
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:50,457
Look.

954
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,047
I got it on spring break. Hurt like hell.

955
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,758
What does it say?
J.B.J.

956
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,298
Jon Bon Jovi? I'm a fan.

957
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,387
Really?
Yes, really.

958
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,893
I'm a Jersey girl.
You got a problem with that?

959
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:05,521
No, I do not.

960
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:09,855
That was fun today. You're good.

961
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:13,487
I'm glad you started wrestling again.
Yeah. Me too.

962
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,070
No quitting this time. You got that?

963
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:17,734
Yeah.

964
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:21,412
Can I tell you something?
Of course.

965
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:24,415
I didn't quit my old wrestling team.

966
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,329
I got thrown off.

967
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:30,254
Why?
I stole a car.

968
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,086
What? You don't even drive, do you?

969
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:34,626
No.

970
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,260
That was part of the problem.

971
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:39,218
Whose car did you steal?
A teacher's.

972
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:41,428
Oh, my God.
I know.

973
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,264
It was really stupid.
Yeah, it was really stupid.

974
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:47,181
You could have killed yourself.
Yeah.

975
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:50,976
Everything just got messed up after that.

976
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:56,023
Hey. We all do stupid things.

977
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,949
But the good news is
you got another chance.

978
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,610
And you're kicking butt.

979
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:04,410
That's the way to do it.
Yeah, I guess.

980
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:07,450
Oh, totally is.
You know who'd agree with me?

981
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:09,460
Mike?
No.

982
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,922
J.B.J.
Ha, ha.

983
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,394
<i>Why you wanna tell me</i>
<i>How to live my life?</i>

984
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:33,026
<i>Who are you to tell me</i>
<i>If it's black or white?</i>

985
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:40,066
<i>Mama, can you hear me?</i>
<i>Try to understand</i>

986
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,907
<i>Is innocence the difference</i>
<i>Between a boy and a man?</i>

987
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:47,574
<i>My daddy lived a lie</i>
<i>That's just the price that he paid</i>

988
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:51,495
<i>Sacrificed his life just slaving away</i>

989
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:56,587
<i>Oh, if there's one thing I hang on to</i>

990
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:59,298
<i>That gets me through the night</i>

991
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:00,678
Oh...

992
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:03,180
<i>I ain't gonna do what I don't want to</i>

993
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,262
Gotcha. Ow.
Ow.

994
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,596
Too hard, bro.

995
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,683
<i>Shining like a diamond</i>
<i>Rolling with the dice</i>

996
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:12,098
Good?
Yeah, go!

997
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:17,149
Whoa!
Oh, shit!

998
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:21,866
Awesome. Unh.

999
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,987
Yeah, baby! Unh.

1000
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,280
<i>Have a nice day</i>

1001
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:32,414
They don't have a heavyweight.
Really?

1002
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,124
No.
Korsic will be happy.

1003
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,165
Tell him so he doesn't puke.
He doesn't have to lose weight.

1004
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,675
Why's he puking?
Nerves.

1005
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:40,961
Ner...

1006
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:43,175
Oh, well, this is a team for the ages.

1007
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:46,216
Hey, guys. What's up?
Stemler wants to wrestle today.

1008
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:48,225
Heh.
Ter.

1009
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:49,556
Oh.

1010
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,516
You do?
Yeah, coach.

1011
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,398
I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right?

1012
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:55,900
Right.

1013
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:58,811
Where you gonna wrestle, Stemler?

1014
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,571
He can wrestle at 119.

1015
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:04,199
If I bump up to 125 and get a pin,
and Jimmy goes 130...

1016
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,954
...then we're only giving up one weight
class and we actually have a shot.

1017
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:11,582
Vig?
Yeah. He's right.

1018
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,162
It's possible.
Stemler...

1019
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:17,250
...have you ever wrestled in a match before?
No, I have not.

1020
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:21,717
He's just waiting for the green light, right?
Right.

1021
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:24,090
I think now's my time.

1022
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:25,884
I feel the force.

1023
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,223
One twenty-five.
Okay.

1024
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:38,939
Okay, we're gonna start 125,
DePasquale and Timmons.

1025
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:44,107
And then finish 119,
Tomlinson and Stemler.

1026
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,071
I'm ready, coach.

1027
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:50,204
Showtime.
Good.

1028
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,031
Oh, boy.

1029
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,999
It's gonna be fine.

1030
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:57,753
Hook him, come on! That's it!
Now hold on to him!

1031
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:00,415
Hook the arm, Carlos, that's it!
Stay on him!

1032
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:01,799
Hang on to him! Hang on to him!

1033
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,714
Yeah!
Very good.

1034
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,470
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

1035
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,549
Great, Carlos! Awesome.

1036
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,718
How we doing?
Shit, we can win this thing.

1037
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,512
If Stemler doesn't get pinned,
we can win. We're up five.

1038
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,773
That's a huge fucking "if."
I can hear you, coach.

1039
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,359
Sorry, Stemler.

1040
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:25,155
Okay, come on, Stemler, let's go.

1041
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:27,199
Okay.

1042
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:28,951
All right, buddy.

1043
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:32,162
You've been practicing a long time.

1044
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,664
A long time.
Yeah. Yeah.

1045
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,665
And you're ready for this, okay?

1046
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,669
You get in trouble,
you just listen to me. I'm right here.

1047
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,204
Okay? All right?

1048
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,466
Stemler, you're not gonna get pinned.
You are not gonna get pinned.

1049
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:46,594
No way, all right?
Now, I'm gonna slap you. You ready?

1050
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,675
Yeah, but not so hard.

1051
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,309
Thanks.
Okay.

1052
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,720
Let's get this going here!

1053
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:58,264
You gotta check in.
Sign in.

1054
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,313
Let's go, Stem! Let's go!

1055
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,528
You got this!

1056
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:12,946
Holy shit, it's Darth Vader.
Are you kidding me?

1057
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:14,204
- No way.
- What?

1058
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,490
I can't do this.
No.

1059
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:17,533
- What are you...?
- Don't take that off.

1060
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:22,254
It's just a mask.
For chrissake, Stemler.

1061
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:24,507
- Stemler.
- It's a protective mask.

1062
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:25,712
What's going on?

1063
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:30,258
If he's Darth Vader,
you're the Secret Apprentice.

1064
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,222
You got this.

1065
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:36,518
Ref, what's he doing?

1066
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,475
Okay?

1067
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,059
All right.
Let's go.

1068
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,395
All right, Stemler.
Let's go, Stem.

1069
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,811
Good man, let's go. Let's go.

1070
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:46,482
All over him. Right here.

1071
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:48,193
- Shake hands.
- Don't give an inch.

1072
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:51,192
- All right, Stemler.
- All right.

1073
01:03:52,163 --> 01:03:53,949
Good.
All right.

1074
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,072
Okay.

1075
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:59,242
Thattaboy. Good start. All right.

1076
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:03,663
Just keep trying.
I can't watch this.

1077
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,499
Let's go, ref! This kid's not doing anything!

1078
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,050
- It's stalling!
- Doing great, Stemler.

1079
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,586
- Come on, Stemler!
- Focus.

1080
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:13,093
Keep it going!
Tough it out, buddy!

1081
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,349
All right, Stemler.
Stalling, green.

1082
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,009
One, red.

1083
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:19,645
Shit. Shit.
Just keep going.

1084
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,727
We're one point from a tech fall.
We're gonna lose on criteria.

1085
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:26,019
No shit. Really?
If he loses by 15 points it's a technical fall...

1086
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:28,859
...and even though the score is tied,
we're gonna lose.

1087
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,614
Seriously?
All right, fuck this.

1088
01:04:30,785 --> 01:04:32,275
Hey, Stemler. Stemler!

1089
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,195
Listen to me. You need to get up, buddy!

1090
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:37,739
All right? He is trying to drown you!

1091
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:40,499
He wants you dead! Okay?

1092
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,661
But you are not gonna die
on the bottom, are you, Stemler? Right?

1093
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,047
You hear me?
All right, you remember the move?

1094
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,541
Whatever the fuck it takes.

1095
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,297
- Whatever the fuck it takes! Get up!
- Come on, Stemler!

1096
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:05,061
Wrestle him! Wrestle him!

1097
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:09,983
Let's go, Stemler!

1098
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:12,906
Keep going, buddy!

1099
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,498
Go shake his hand. Shake his hand!

1100
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,581
Thank you very much.

1101
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,843
I'm proud of what you did today.

1102
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,224
That win meant a lot to the guys.

1103
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:42,683
Yeah. Good coaching with Stemler.
Yeah.

1104
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:47,900
Let me ask you something, Kyle.
What's it like to be as good as you are?

1105
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,560
What's that feel like?

1106
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:51,319
I don't know.

1107
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,360
I guess it just feels like I'm in control.

1108
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,526
Of everything, you know?

1109
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:01,280
Yeah, I do. Must be nice.

1110
01:06:02,543 --> 01:06:04,124
It is.

1111
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:10,548
Get your leg free. Greg, get your leg free.
Gotta get your leg free. Arch your back!

1112
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:14,461
Arch! Arch! Fight! Arch! Fight it!
Get your leg free!

1113
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,471
Get your leg free! Arch! Up, up, reach!

1114
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,302
Reach! Fight it!

1115
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,804
District champs, baby.
Yep.

1116
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,220
Pure fucking poetry, baby!
District champs, baby.

1117
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:29,688
- Hey, Leo.
- Yeah.

1118
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:32,103
Guess who just won the districts.
Who?

1119
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,487
I did.

1120
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,613
Check it out.
Wow.

1121
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,742
And guess what.
What?

1122
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,533
Mike got a call
from a college scout about me.

1123
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:44,699
Yeah?
Hi, baby.

1124
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,830
What are you doing here?

1125
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:52,419
I just came to get you, honey.
And to see Grandpa.

1126
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:56,715
Baby, I missed you so much.
Can I get a hug?

1127
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:13,443
She go down?
Yeah, she passed right out.

1128
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:15,525
How's he doing?
He's upset.

1129
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:16,734
And I don't blame him.

1130
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:18,774
It's weird she shows up like that.
Yeah.

1131
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:23,196
And of course she's late, the druggie.
Can you stop with the "druggie" thing?

1132
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,365
Please.
What? She's a druggie.

1133
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,704
I understand that.

1134
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:30,502
You're gonna talk to her, right?
Yes, I intend to.

1135
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:31,788
If you don't punch her first.

1136
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,542
Okay, uh, that's her.

1137
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:40,425
It's not my fault if I punch her.
You know what? It is.

1138
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,555
That will be your fault.

1139
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,132
Hi.
Hi.

1140
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:45,596
Mike Flaherty. How are you?

1141
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,638
Come on in, please.
Sorry, but my cab was late, so...

1142
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:51,432
That's not a problem.
Not a problem. Come in.

1143
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,941
This is my wife, Jackie.

1144
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,655
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Right.

1145
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,404
Uh, can I take your jacket?

1146
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:04,157
Oh, yeah. Yes.
Okay.

1147
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:06,322
Thank you. Ahem.

1148
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:12,666
You have a really nice home.
Thank you.

1149
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:15,668
Uh, do you wanna sit down?

1150
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:18,008
Thanks.
Please.

1151
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:23,923
So Kyle's downstairs
with Abby, our 6-year-old.

1152
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:26,183
Oh, okay.

1153
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,763
Uh...

1154
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:29,678
Can I get you a drink?

1155
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:34,642
Uh, water or soda? Anything?

1156
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,732
Oh. No, I'm...

1157
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:38,986
...fine.

1158
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:43,193
Okay, uh, I'll go get Kyle.

1159
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:45,031
Yeah. How's he doing?

1160
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:50,120
Uh, actually, he's doing very well.

1161
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:51,409
Extremely well.

1162
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:56,502
Yes, he's going to the high school here.
And he's wrestling on the team, actually.

1163
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:57,960
Oh.

1164
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,342
- Yeah, that's great. Mm.
- Yeah.

1165
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,719
- He loves wrestling so much.
- I know.

1166
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,677
Oh, he's a sweet kid. Our girls love him.

1167
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,057
Mm.

1168
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,728
That's nice. I'm sorry.

1169
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,650
I don't mean to...

1170
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:24,067
It's just been a really hard time
and everything.

1171
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:28,533
And I feel bad that...
Oh. Come on.

1172
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:31,073
Now, come on. These things happen.

1173
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,162
We loved having him here.

1174
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:34,952
It's okay.

1175
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,411
Hey, honey.

1176
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,670
Uh... This is Abby.
Abby, this is Kyle's mom.

1177
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:44,177
Hey, Abby.
Hi.

1178
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,680
Hey, kiddo, you think you could
go get Kyle for us?

1179
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,557
- He left.
- He left? What do you mean?

1180
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:51,264
He left out the window.

1181
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:57,851
- I'm really sorry about this.
- It's okay. Thanks.

1182
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,529
You know, Kyle is doing really well
with the wrestling here, Cindy.

1183
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,735
Mm.

1184
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:09,029
He has the regions this weekend, and if
he wins there, he goes on to the states.

1185
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,322
That's great.
It is, you know.

1186
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,582
Could be a really good thing for him.

1187
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:16,334
It might even mean a scholarship.
You know?

1188
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:20,043
So I was wondering, actually, if you
wouldn't mind maybe staying around...

1189
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,923
...another couple of weeks?

1190
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:25,970
I don't think I can afford
to stay in the motel for that long.

1191
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:27,713
Uh-huh.

1192
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:31,759
Do you think maybe
we could stay in my dad's house?

1193
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:36,472
Yeah, I think that we could
probably make that work. Yeah.

1194
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:40,438
Yeah. Then, yeah.

1195
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:41,939
Really?
Yeah.

1196
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,400
That's great. Great.

1197
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:47,317
Sorry. Excuse me. Ahem.

1198
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,197
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

1199
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,407
<i>Yeah, Kyle's over here.</i>
Really?

1200
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:52,742
Good, we found him.

1201
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,658
Yeah, we're playing Wii Golf.
I'm destroying him.

1202
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:59,169
Hey, not for nothing, dude,
but this kid really hates his mother.

1203
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,796
- All right. Great, Terry. Thank you.
- <i>No, I'm serious.</i>

1204
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,252
<i>More than I hate my ex-wife.</i>

1205
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,418
Okay, I got it, Terry. Great. Thank you.

1206
01:11:05,596 --> 01:11:07,006
<i>Bye.</i>
All right.

1207
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:09,923
He went to my friend's house,
we can get him there.

1208
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,514
Yeah, you know, I think, um,
I probably should just go back to the motel.

1209
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,145
It might be too much for him tonight.
You sure?

1210
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:20,103
Yeah, I think it's probably better.

1211
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,522
I know how he can be.

1212
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,697
<i>It's hard, pal, I know.</i>

1213
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:32,328
But she's staying so you can finish the
season, that's pretty nice of her, you know?

1214
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:35,661
I told her you'd go see her today.

1215
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,792
Where?
Oh, you know, wherever you want.

1216
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:42,204
Uh, you could see her here,
we could go see her at Leo's house.

1217
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,373
She's moving in this morning.

1218
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:47,796
All right.

1219
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:52,298
I'll go see her at Leo's before practice.
But I wanna go alone.

1220
01:11:56,063 --> 01:11:58,679
Hi, Mike.
Hi, Betty.

1221
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,557
How's the foot?
Fine.

1222
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:03,191
Good.

1223
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,907
Cindy's here.

1224
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:12,488
Really? Did she say why?

1225
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:15,575
No, but she's here with an attorney.

1226
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,033
Hey, Cindy. How you doing?
Hi.

1227
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:20,576
Hi.
Hi. Mike Flaherty.

1228
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,369
Eleanor Cohen.
Great to meet you.

1229
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:23,754
So nice to meet you.

1230
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:26,631
Well, I didn't realize Cindy
was represented by counsel.

1231
01:12:26,802 --> 01:12:32,593
Oh, yeah, she retained me last week to
help sort out the situation with her father.

1232
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,930
Okay. Uh, well, come on in.
Well, thank you.

1233
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:38,139
Yeah.

1234
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:48,946
I thought, uh... I thought you said
you just got here two days ago, Cindy.

1235
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:55,453
Uh, Cindy wanted a little time to settle in
and spend some time with her father.

1236
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:59,790
Sure, yeah. Um, so how can I help?

1237
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:04,962
Cindy's decided to have
a more active role in her father's care.

1238
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:07,919
Mm-hm. Great. What kind of role is that?

1239
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,585
Um, I want to take care of him.

1240
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,048
Really?

1241
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,589
- Uh, do you wanna move here?
- No.

1242
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:19,100
Cindy's decided to bring her father
back to Columbus.

1243
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,312
That's where my support network is now.

1244
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:23,471
- Mm-hm.
- It's home.

1245
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,311
Um...

1246
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:30,821
My only concern is that
that may not be what Leo wants.

1247
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,357
Yeah, I already talked to him about it.

1248
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,116
He seemed to like the idea.

1249
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:38,779
I understand that, Cindy. But, uh...

1250
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:42,245
...you know, you haven't
seen Leo in a long time...

1251
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:45,126
...and he's battling dementia now.

1252
01:13:45,297 --> 01:13:49,256
So it kind of puts me
in a tough position here, you know?

1253
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,633
Yeah, I understand.

1254
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:56,968
But seeing that she is the presumed
guardian, we hope to avoid litigation.

1255
01:13:57,142 --> 01:14:00,509
So do I. And I know that we can.
Absolutely.

1256
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:03,599
We definitely can. Um...

1257
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:07,608
Now, I'm sorry,
but I actually have to see another client.

1258
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:08,813
Oh.

1259
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:12,150
But we should set up another time
to talk about this, definitely, okay?

1260
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,780
Yes.

1261
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:15,858
Okay.

1262
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:28,495
- <i>Is it that bad?</i>
- <i>Yeah, it's that bad.</i>

1263
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:30,835
Take her to court. You'll kill her.
I can't.

1264
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:34,001
What do you mean? She's a mess.
You're a pillar of the community.

1265
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:38,388
I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee.
It'll look very bad. Trust me.

1266
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,846
I can't afford that right now, Terry.
Well, then dump it.

1267
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,556
Dump it. Just give her back Leo.

1268
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,312
It sucks, but you got your business
to worry about.

1269
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,849
Yeah, I do. Maybe you're right.
Incoming, dude.

1270
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,234
- Mike.
- Hey, pal.

1271
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:55,318
Do you know she wants to take Leo back?
Yeah, I know. She just told me today.

1272
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,733
You're not gonna let her do that,
are you?

1273
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,490
I don't know, Kyle. It's complicated.

1274
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:02,154
What's complicated?

1275
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,119
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You can't let her do that.

1276
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:09,787
All right. Why don't you just go get ready
for practice, all right? I'll deal with it.

1277
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,756
Fine.

1278
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:16,005
But I told her I'm staying with you guys
until I leave.

1279
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,215
Stay focused, Kyle.

1280
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:20,923
Wow.

1281
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:25,269
What's your play?
Well, I have no fricking idea.

1282
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:28,729
She's looking for a payout, dude.

1283
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,936
Just give her an exit.
What does that mean?

1284
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:34,478
Give her some of Leo's money and
send her home. He's not gonna miss it.

1285
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:38,490
No, I can't do that.
She's not even in his...

1286
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:44,121
That's right, she's not. And she
doesn't know it, and that's my play.

1287
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:46,077
Wait, what's your play?

1288
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,120
Uh...

1289
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:52,504
Don't worry about it.
Can you get practice started?

1290
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:56,258
Really? Yeah.
Good, go.

1291
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:59,135
Want me to slap you, get you psyched?
No, I really don't.

1292
01:16:00,265 --> 01:16:03,473
I know that we're all concerned
with what's best for Leo...

1293
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:06,760
...so I'm hoping that we can
settle this in an amicable way.

1294
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,144
Well, so do we.
Good.

1295
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:13,309
Well, um, to that end, I thought that
I would lay all the cards on the table...

1296
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:18,322
...so that maybe you can understand why
I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy.

1297
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:20,403
Okay.

1298
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:23,489
Okay. Um...

1299
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:29,583
Cindy, your father disinherited you
from his will, completely.

1300
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:33,917
And I'm afraid that that can't change
now that he's been declared incapacitated.

1301
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:36,999
What?

1302
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:39,259
Is that true?

1303
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:41,670
We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike.

1304
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:44,931
Certainly. I brought you a copy.

1305
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:46,717
Thank you.
You bet.

1306
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:49,561
Then who did he leave it to? Kyle?

1307
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,687
No.
Then who? You?

1308
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:52,893
No, no.

1309
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:55,650
He actually left it
to the municipal parks system.

1310
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:58,107
He wanted the town park
dedicated in his name.

1311
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,283
Oh, my God. He is such a scumbag.

1312
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,828
Okay.
Oh, my God. No.

1313
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:11,663
He never cared about a fucking thing except
himself and his goddamn fucking money!

1314
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:13,202
- Cindy.
- Oh, my God!

1315
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,541
Don't do this.
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

1316
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,546
Please.
"Please" what?

1317
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:18,706
"Please"?

1318
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,718
I need to discuss this with my client.
Understood.

1319
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:24,721
Discuss? I'm not taking care of him
if I'm not getting anything.

1320
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:26,222
- That's it. No!
- Stop it.

1321
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:29,183
Oh, my God.
Uh, we're finished here, Mike.

1322
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,811
Understand completely.
I'm gonna leave that with you.

1323
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:33,730
Thank you.

1324
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:37,688
- How did you not know this?
- Look. Calm down.

1325
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:39,774
What the fuck were you doing?

1326
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:48,737
Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.

1327
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:51,156
Yeah, and she's moved back to the motel.
Good.

1328
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,292
Yes, it is. I think it worked.
It totally worked.

1329
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,078
They opened their kimono
and you made them eat the trade.

1330
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:59,543
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?

1331
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:01,299
No, no, really.

1332
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,686
It's time, coach.

1333
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:18,100
Hey, you ready?

1334
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:24,689
He's ready.

1335
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,118
Man...

1336
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:34,290
This is exciting, huh?
You think there are scouts here?

1337
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,123
Definitely. Wait till we get to the states.
Atlantic City?

1338
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,208
Oh. We're gonna have so much fun.
Fierce.

1339
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:40,963
Good luck, baby.

1340
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:52,676
Lockup.

1341
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:55,603
Okay. Listen up, all right?

1342
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,639
One more win and we go to the states.

1343
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:00,149
That's all that matters,
that's all that counts.

1344
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,935
Hey! Listen to me.

1345
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:05,192
You stay in this, okay?

1346
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:09,610
This is your place.
This is your place, you control it.

1347
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,824
Remember? You control it!

1348
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,746
Now, go get him! Finish it!

1349
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:17,626
At 119, we have Timmons,
New Providence...

1350
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,665
...and Brown, Saddle Brook.

1351
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,423
Ready to go on the whistle, kid.

1352
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:29,679
- Here we go.
- Okay, we're ready.

1353
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,636
Good game, gentlemen.

1354
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,017
- Stance.
- Come on, Kyle, you got this.

1355
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:38,054
Head up! Head up! Head up!

1356
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:44,770
- Kyle!
- That's a point, right?

1357
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,405
Yo, what do you got?
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

1358
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,191
- Kyle! Control. Settle down.
- One point, red.

1359
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:54,537
- Just settle down, okay?
- Let's go, Chris!

1360
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:05,332
Sprawl!
Sprawl, Kyle! Sprawl!

1361
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:08,376
Foot's on the mat. On the mat.
On the mat.

1362
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,213
Settle down.

1363
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:15,425
No, that's it. Over. Over.

1364
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,370
How you doing?

1365
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:40,241
I'm sorry.

1366
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:46,753
Hey. It's all right, man. It's all right.

1367
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:59,098
I don't wanna go with her, Mike.

1368
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,262
I don't.

1369
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:05,938
Okay, pal.

1370
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,278
Okay.

1371
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,797
Hey, buddy. Heads up.

1372
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,544
Take them to the car, would you?
I'll be right there.

1373
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:41,053
Why are you here?
I wanted to see my son wrestle.

1374
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:46,146
Yeah, well, your son had a pretty good
chance to do something special in there.

1375
01:21:46,403 --> 01:21:48,018
Maybe even change his life.

1376
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:50,312
And that's gone now,
so I hope you're happy.

1377
01:21:50,657 --> 01:21:52,943
That's not my fault.
It isn't?

1378
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:56,075
Why do you think he lost his shit
in there today? Huh?

1379
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,286
What do you want?
I want my father.

1380
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,828
It didn't sound like that the other day.

1381
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,002
You have no idea what my father
used to be like.

1382
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,958
He was different.

1383
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:12,001
He treated me like shit.
So you're gonna return the favor, is that it?

1384
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:13,509
I want that commission!

1385
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:15,878
That's mine!
Is that what this is about?

1386
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:18,639
Fifteen hundred dollars? My God.

1387
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,346
Isn't that why you took him?

1388
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,855
Okay. You know what, I'll tell you what.

1389
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:37,525
You want the commission?
Fine, I will let you have it.

1390
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:39,160
You don't even have to take Leo.

1391
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:42,242
I will take care of him for free,
and I will send you the check.

1392
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:44,203
On one condition.

1393
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:48,040
What's that?
That you leave Kyle here with us...

1394
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:50,205
...until he finishes high school.

1395
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:54,626
I'm his mother. He belongs with me.

1396
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:56,385
You sure he feels that way?

1397
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:58,717
Don't you tell me what my son feels.

1398
01:22:58,892 --> 01:23:01,554
He's coming with me,
and there isn't anything you can do.

1399
01:23:01,728 --> 01:23:03,389
Then you can't have that commission.

1400
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:05,554
Oh, well, we'll see about that!

1401
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:07,518
Yeah, we will.

1402
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,896
I want to see my son!

1403
01:23:11,446 --> 01:23:14,313
Give him a call. You got his number.

1404
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:23,580
We were right there, Mike.

1405
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,748
Right fucking there.

1406
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:28,917
Now we got nothing.

1407
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,219
Are you okay?

1408
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:45,764
No.

1409
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:50,269
Mike. Your mom's here.
Dinner's almost ready.

1410
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:52,434
You seen Kyle?
He's not in the basement?

1411
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,273
No.
Oh, for chrissake.

1412
01:23:55,365 --> 01:23:58,277
I'll find him.
Thanks, Terry.

1413
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,863
What a day, huh?
Yeah, right.

1414
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:07,661
You okay?

1415
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:11,665
What are we gonna do?

1416
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:16,299
There's nothing to do. I can't stop her.
She's gonna take Leo and Kyle with her.

1417
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:19,381
You don't think you can beat her in court?
No, I don't. Nope.

1418
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:22,639
Well, isn't it obvious
she just wants him for the money?

1419
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:27,393
I just can't win this one, Jack.

1420
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:28,974
Trust me.

1421
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:31,727
I do.

1422
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,025
Hey, Kyle. Honey, come in.

1423
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:45,654
I'm so glad you came.

1424
01:24:48,543 --> 01:24:50,249
Have a seat, honey.

1425
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:53,165
You want a soda or something?

1426
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,254
What do you want?
Ahem.

1427
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:08,343
I just wanted to say
how sorry I was about the match.

1428
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:12,309
Is that why you called?
Just to tell me that?

1429
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,475
No.

1430
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:21,444
I also wanted to say that I'll do
whatever you think is best for Leo.

1431
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:23,199
I promise.

1432
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,325
Then leave him here, where he is.

1433
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:31,124
I have to tell you, I'm not sure
that's what Leo wants.

1434
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:33,368
Here.

1435
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:38,873
Just read the parts in yellow.
What is it?

1436
01:25:39,052 --> 01:25:41,509
It's the transcript
from when Leo was in court.

1437
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,840
My lawyer got it for me.

1438
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:47,844
This isn't real.

1439
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:50,681
The judge told Leo he had to live there.
No.

1440
01:25:50,855 --> 01:25:52,971
No, honey. This is official from the court.

1441
01:25:53,483 --> 01:25:55,144
That's what Mike said.

1442
01:25:56,277 --> 01:26:00,065
He gets paid
for being Leo's guardian, Kyle.

1443
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:04,358
And then he just put him in that place
so he wouldn't have to deal with him.

1444
01:26:04,535 --> 01:26:06,696
Leo belongs with us.

1445
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:08,156
Why?

1446
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:13,999
Because we deserve that money, Kyle.
Not some lawyer.

1447
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:19,042
You're a big boy.
You can understand that.

1448
01:26:23,513 --> 01:26:25,720
Look, Kyle, honey...

1449
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:30,092
Shut up. Just shut up.

1450
01:26:30,687 --> 01:26:33,099
I don't care about any of this.
Just leave Leo alone!

1451
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:35,597
Do you hear me?

1452
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,478
Do you?

1453
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:45,944
Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it.

1454
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,359
Yeah, bye.

1455
01:26:47,537 --> 01:26:49,493
Anything?
No, he's not at Stemler's.

1456
01:26:49,664 --> 01:26:51,200
Where could he be?
I don't know.

1457
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:53,706
Uh, maybe he went for a walk.
We should take a drive.

1458
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,116
Your mom can stay with the kids.

1459
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:59,253
Where we gonna go? Hold on. Yes?

1460
01:26:59,424 --> 01:27:01,005
Hello?

1461
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:03,625
Yeah, this is him.
Who is it?

1462
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:06,631
What?

1463
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:09,047
It has been a very long day.

1464
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:10,510
I need some answers.

1465
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:13,643
Now, if you can't give them to me,
get me somebody who can.

1466
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,561
Now.
Sir, please stay calm.

1467
01:27:15,732 --> 01:27:17,723
We're doing our best.
You've lost my ward.

1468
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,356
- Calm down.
- We'll find him.

1469
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:21,438
"Calm down"
We're gonna sue your ass.

1470
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,944
I'm sorry.
How could you just let him escape?

1471
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:26,697
Look, he's definitely
not on the premises.

1472
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:29,610
A lot of the time,
they just try to go home.

1473
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:33,700
- We're about to go there now.
- Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1474
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,833
Hey, folks,
keep an eye on each other.

1475
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:38,493
Terry.

1476
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:47,927
- The lights are on.
- It's gotta be him.

1477
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:50,759
- Hey, did you bring the key?
- No, I forgot it.

1478
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:54,892
Shit.

1479
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,053
Shh, Terry!
My bad, my bad, my bad.

1480
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:59,688
Ring the bell.
I just did, sweetheart, okay?

1481
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,018
I think I hear a TV.
Really?

1482
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:07,647
You're right. Okay. Um...

1483
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:10,157
Hold on, hold on.

1484
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,364
Hold on.

1485
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,827
- Yes, there he is.
- What's he doing?

1486
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,290
He's watching TV.

1487
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:23,838
Leo.

1488
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,712
Leo.

1489
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,835
Leo.

1490
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:30,628
He's not responding. Hit the bell.

1491
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:33,719
Anything?
Nothing.

1492
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:36,555
Dude, is he dead?
I have no fricking idea.

1493
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:39,186
Christ.
Dude, this is kind of spooky.

1494
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:40,767
Should we break in?
No.

1495
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,690
Okay. I've got a key back at the office.
I'll go get it.

1496
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,647
You guys stay here.
Alone?

1497
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:49,397
Hey.
Hello.

1498
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:51,156
Hi.
Hey.

1499
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,901
Come on in.

1500
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:57,329
Super spooky.
You go first.

1501
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,082
Oh, for God's sake.
I'll go last.

1502
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:10,339
You okay, Leo?

1503
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,630
How'd you get here, pal?

1504
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:17,759
Leo, did you walk here?

1505
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,349
- I brought him.
- Aah!

1506
01:29:21,524 --> 01:29:22,730
Kyle!

1507
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,186
You brought him?
Yeah.

1508
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:28,103
Are you out of your mind?
We've been worried sick about him.

1509
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:29,521
About both of you.

1510
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:32,156
You didn't have to worry about us.

1511
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:36,994
Really creepy. Just saying.

1512
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:39,447
Kyle.

1513
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:43,209
What the hell are you doing?
Making spaghetti.

1514
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:46,462
Jesus, have you lost your mind?
No.

1515
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:49,999
You can't just take him out of the home.
This is where he belongs.

1516
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:53,214
No, honey, he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
We talked about this.

1517
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:55,379
Yeah, we did.

1518
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:57,264
I remember.

1519
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:59,175
Listen to this.

1520
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:02,220
"Mr. Poplar wants to live at home."

1521
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,314
You can do that, Mike?

1522
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,897
"Yes, I can. Really."

1523
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:10,936
What? What is this? What?

1524
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:13,113
It's true, isn't it?

1525
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:15,567
Mike?

1526
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:18,827
What is this?

1527
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:24,159
You're just like her.

1528
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:26,247
Mike.

1529
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:28,879
Kyle. Kyle!

1530
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:34,503
Hey, Kyle. Hey,
will you hold on a second?

1531
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:35,965
- Don't touch me!
- Oh!

1532
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,676
Shit.

1533
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:40,432
I'm sorry, come on.
I said, don't touch me!

1534
01:30:40,603 --> 01:30:42,844
Jesus. Okay.

1535
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:45,559
Let me explain, okay?
Explain what?

1536
01:30:45,733 --> 01:30:48,099
How you lied to me?
How you lied to Leo?

1537
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:51,235
No, that's not how it was, okay?
Then how was it, Mike?

1538
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:54,021
Calm down. All right? Come on, man.

1539
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,781
Calm down.
Watch the head fake.

1540
01:30:55,952 --> 01:30:57,817
I'm not gonna wrestle with you.

1541
01:30:57,995 --> 01:30:59,701
Hands up, hands up.
Stop it, okay?

1542
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:01,408
Don't egg him on.
That's not helping.

1543
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:03,698
It is. This kid's a good wrestler.
Calm down.

1544
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,582
You see, I told you.
Stop it!

1545
01:31:05,753 --> 01:31:08,870
Okay, buddy, get to your base. Good.
Stop!

1546
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:10,709
Mike, stop it!
Okay, buddy.

1547
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:13,374
I'm trying to stop it!
Sit out, Mike!

1548
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:15,884
Sit out!
Would you stop coaching and break it up?

1549
01:31:16,055 --> 01:31:17,966
Ow. Get the hell off me!
Break it up!

1550
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,346
Kyle. Kyle.
Kyle! Aah.

1551
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:22,099
Come on, get up. It's okay,
I... No, no, no.

1552
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,555
I'm just the ref. I'm just the ref!
Just the ref!

1553
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,391
Kyle!

1554
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:29,727
- Come on!
- Kyle!

1555
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:31,608
Kyle!

1556
01:31:34,323 --> 01:31:36,188
Is this true, Mike?

1557
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:37,857
Did you say this to the judge?

1558
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:41,573
Yeah, I did.

1559
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:45,914
So then why did you move him
if he wanted to stay here?

1560
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:50,836
Because it would have been
too much work to leave him here.

1561
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:52,588
Okay? I couldn't handle it.

1562
01:31:53,134 --> 01:31:56,171
Then you shouldn't have taken him.
I had to do it, all right?

1563
01:31:56,345 --> 01:32:00,588
Why?
Because I needed the money. Okay?

1564
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:02,097
We need the money.

1565
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:06,011
So you took some old man
out of his home to make money off him?

1566
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,930
What, are you out of your freaking mind?
No. No!

1567
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:12,608
I did not think that it would
get this complicated, okay?

1568
01:32:12,987 --> 01:32:16,900
Really? Or you just didn't think
you'd get caught?

1569
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:30,619
Jack, where you going?
Home!

1570
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:46,766
<i>Incoming call. Do you copy?</i>

1571
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:52,057
<i>Incoming call. Charlie Squadron taking</i>
<i>heavy fire. Requesting air strike Bravo.</i>

1572
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:54,600
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1573
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:57,612
<i>Delta Squad, disengage target.</i>

1574
01:32:58,449 --> 01:32:59,939
Hello?

1575
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:02,654
Hello, Mom?

1576
01:33:03,871 --> 01:33:05,577
Hello?

1577
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:09,281
Did your mom just crank-call you?

1578
01:33:09,794 --> 01:33:11,079
No.

1579
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:16,000
So did you and coach get into a fight
because you lost?

1580
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:18,291
No, we got in a fight
because he's an asshole.

1581
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:22,337
Really?
Yeah, really, Stem.

1582
01:33:23,599 --> 01:33:25,635
Well, I'm sure he'll
make it up to you, bro.

1583
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,641
You're the best wrestler he's ever had.

1584
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,145
I mean, he's always been cool to me,
and I suck.

1585
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:41,026
Hi, Leo.
Hey.

1586
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:46,160
I fell asleep. Ahem. I'm sorry.

1587
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,036
Sorry for what?

1588
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:56,788
Wanna go home, Leo?

1589
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:01,876
Yes. I'd like that.

1590
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:11,931
Hi.

1591
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:14,976
Hi.

1592
01:34:15,484 --> 01:34:18,692
Where's Kyle?
He slept at Stemler's.

1593
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:22,606
You?
Uh, Oak Knoll.

1594
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,368
So, what are you gonna do?

1595
01:34:29,248 --> 01:34:30,863
I have to go to court.

1596
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,578
No, you can't. You told the judge
you were keeping Leo at home.

1597
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,285
I know.

1598
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:38,295
Tell her you changed your mind
and he needs to be in a home.

1599
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:39,921
No one could argue with that.

1600
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,416
I can't do that.

1601
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:47,259
Why not?
Because it's not true.

1602
01:34:48,184 --> 01:34:50,675
Oh, well, I'm glad you're done lying now.

1603
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:54,846
Just in time to lose your practice.
That's how your family survives.

1604
01:34:55,024 --> 01:34:56,764
Did you ever think of that, Mike?

1605
01:34:57,776 --> 01:34:59,858
Yeah, all the time.

1606
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:02,603
Shit.

1607
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,782
I'm sorry, Jack.

1608
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:10,198
I really am.

1609
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,452
I know.

1610
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,880
Hey, pal. How'd you get down here?

1611
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:32,508
The window.
You hungry? I'm making pancakes.

1612
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:34,597
I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit.

1613
01:35:34,772 --> 01:35:37,013
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1614
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:42,067
Hey, Kyle.

1615
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,736
Listen, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1616
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:47,740
I know, Mike, you're sorry.
Everyone's always sorry.

1617
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:52,324
I'm moving Leo back home, Kyle, and I'm
gonna fight to make sure that he stays there.

1618
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:55,706
It's too late, you'll lose.
My mother's gonna take him.

1619
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:58,743
Maybe, but I'm still gonna try.

1620
01:35:58,921 --> 01:36:02,334
So what? You want me to forgive you now,
is that it, Mike?

1621
01:36:03,676 --> 01:36:07,260
No, I just want you
to give me another chance.

1622
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,227
This is bullshit!

1623
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:22,525
Hey, Kyle, listen...
I want to be alone.

1624
01:36:22,695 --> 01:36:26,483
What?
I just wanna be down here alone.

1625
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,982
Okay. All right. Yeah.

1626
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:37,618
Kyle, I just wanna say we love you.

1627
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:41,728
Hey, guys.
Hey.

1628
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:44,015
Hey, Mr. Poplar.
Good to see you.

1629
01:37:44,193 --> 01:37:45,228
Jackie.
Hey.

1630
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,393
How's it going?
What are you doing here?

1631
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:49,562
Dude, I'm your assistant coach.

1632
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,605
Just notice who isn't here.
Aha.

1633
01:38:03,337 --> 01:38:05,373
Ah. Hey, Mike?

1634
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:07,038
Hey, Eleanor.

1635
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:08,581
Can I talk to you?

1636
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:12,718
Uh, sure. Hold on, okay?

1637
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:22,769
You know the transcript alone
is enough to hang you.

1638
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,898
Yeah, well, we'll see what happens.

1639
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:29,734
Shame on you, counselor.

1640
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,111
Is that it?

1641
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,652
No, my client would like to talk to you.

1642
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,330
Hi.

1643
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:54,839
Is your deal still available?

1644
01:38:57,141 --> 01:38:58,597
What about Kyle?

1645
01:39:00,686 --> 01:39:02,517
He can stay.

1646
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,854
Then, yes, it is.

1647
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:09,144
And you'll send me the checks?

1648
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:11,689
Every month.

1649
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:15,819
You take good care of him?

1650
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:18,321
We will.

1651
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:21,824
I wanna say goodbye.

1652
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:24,782
Okay.

1653
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:28,748
Kyle, come here for a minute.

1654
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:34,708
Your mom wants to talk to you
for a minute.

1655
01:40:07,044 --> 01:40:08,329
Nice shot.
Thanks.

1656
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:10,745
Not bad, not bad.
Check this out.

1657
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:12,413
All right.

1658
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:17,088
Nice, dude.
This mallet's crap.

1659
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,054
Hey, guys.

1660
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:27,094
Hi, Daddy. I'm winning.
That's great.

1661
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:28,637
What up, coach?
Hey, Stemler.

1662
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:31,352
Kyle, can you move those
garbage cans around the side?

1663
01:40:31,527 --> 01:40:32,937
All right.
Thanks, pal.

1664
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,102
- All right, I'm switching colors.
- Why?

1665
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,690
I'm not feeling the orange.

1666
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:38,947
- Hey, honey.
- Hey. How was work?

1667
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:42,951
Good. I got stuck at the office with a client.
I know, Shelly called.

1668
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:46,079
I dropped off the fan at Leo's today.
Thanks for doing that.

1669
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,457
I'll be right back down.
You got time to eat?

1670
01:40:48,627 --> 01:40:51,619
Uh, I'll eat there.
All right, make sure you do.

1671
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:07,843
Hey, barkeep.
I will take a banana daiquiri, please.

1672
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:11,058
All right.
Would you like an umbrella with that?

1673
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,315
No, thank you, but keep those coming.

1674
01:41:13,485 --> 01:41:15,476
Okay.

1675
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:18,941
So how you doing, pal?
Me?

1676
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,106
I'm pretty good.

1677
