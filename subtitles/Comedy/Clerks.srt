No, I don't work today.

back, and try some gum instead.

- Here. Chewlies gum. Try this.

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
All I'm saying is, if you're
that unhappy, you should leave.

149
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
- I'm not even supposed to be here today!
- I know.

150
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,280
I stopped by your house.
Your mom told me you left, at 6:00.

151
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
The guy got sick.
He couldn't come in.

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,720
- Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?
- Yes.

153
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm gonna play like shit because
I didn't have a good night's sleep.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
- Why'd you agree to come in?
- I'm only here until 12:00.

155
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,680
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,520
- Why don't you open the shutters?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

157
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,440
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

158
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,040
- Thanks.
- How much did you leave up there?

159
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

160
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,800
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,360
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that?

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,240
How do you know they're taking the right
change or paying for what they take?

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Theoretically, people see money,
no one around,

164
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,840
they think they're being watched.

165
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,920
Honesty through paranoia.

166
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

167
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,400
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

168
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
- Smell won't come off.
- [Door opens]

169
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
You think anybody
can see us down here?

170
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,760
Why, you wanna have sex or something?

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,840
- Can we?
- Really?

172
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
- I was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

173
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,160
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure?

174
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
Show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

175
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,600
- What about what we do for you?
- Women?

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Women as lovers are basically the same.
They just have to be there.

177
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Be there?

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,480
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

179
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

180
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,240
How flattering.

181
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,120
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

182
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,680
You think so?

183
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,680
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

184
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,240
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

185
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,880
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

187
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,920
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,280
I've touched a nerve.

189
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

190
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,800
It wasn't directed at you.
It's a broad generalization.

191
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,200
You're making a generalization
about broads.

192
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,240
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

193
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,520
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

194
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
- How many?
- How many what?

195
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,240
How many different girls
have you slept with?

196
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,960
- Didn't we have this discussion before?
- We might have.

197
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,000
- I don't remember. How many?
- Including you?

198
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,560
It better be up to and including me.

199
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,000
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls?

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,960
Including you? Yes.

201
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
- Ow! What'd you do that for?
- You're a pig!

202
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Why'd you hit me?

203
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,000
Do you know how many men
I've had sex with?

204
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,440
- Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.

205
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,720
- Three?
- Three, including you.

206
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
You only slept with three people?

207
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who?

208
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,120
- You!
- No, who are the three, besides me.

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
- John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
- Wow.

210
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,040
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

211
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,640
- You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

212
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

213
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

214
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,000
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

215
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,480
Name it.

216
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,400
I want you to come with me on Monday.

217
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
- Where?
- To school.

218
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,960
There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program

219
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
after a lapse in enrollment.

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,800
Can't we have a discussion
without that?

221
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,400
It's important to me, Dante.

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,000
You have so much potential
going to waste in this pit.

223
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,640
- I wish you'd go back to school.
- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

224
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,560
- Shit! Why're you getting up?
- I have class in 45 minutes.

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,520
Willam?

226
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Hey, Ronni.
How you been, man?

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,760
What, do you work here now?

228
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,040
No, I was visiting my man.

229
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

230
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,880
- How you doing? Just the soda?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

231
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,880
So where you been, man?
Still going to Seton Hall?

232
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,040
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

233
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,240
That's beautiful, man.

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,480
So, you still talk to Silvan?

235
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

236
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,480
Oh, that's great.

237
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,160
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

238
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Bye. Take it easy.

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,680
- [Ronni] That was Snowball.
- [Dante] Why do you call him that?

240
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,360
Silvan made it up.
It's a blow job thing.

241
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
What do you mean?

242
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

243
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,680
It's called snowballing.

244
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,400
- He requests this?
- He gets off on it.

245
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that?

246
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
Like you said, she snowballed him.

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,000
- Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I'm serious.

249
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,600
- You sucked that guy's dick?
- Yeah. How do you think I knew...

250
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,280
You said you had sex with three guys.
You never mentioned him.

251
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
- Because I never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick!

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,880
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.

253
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh, my God. Why did you tell me
you only had sex with three guys?

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
Because I did only have sex
with three guys.

255
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,680
- Doesn't mean I didn't go with people.
- I feel so nauseous.

256
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

257
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,120
I did understand!

258
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,000
That you had sex with three guys
and that's all you said!

259
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,920
- Please calm down.
- How many?

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
- How many dicks have you sucked?
- Let it go!

261
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,720
Shut up and I'll tell you. Jesus!

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,440
I didn't freak out when you told me
how many girls you fucked!

263
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,280
This is different. This is important.
How many?

264
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
Well?

265
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,600
- Something like 36.
- What? Something like 36?

266
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
- Lower your voice.
- What is that? "Something like 36"?

267
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,240
Does that include me?

268
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
- Uh... 37.
- I'm 37?

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

270
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,240
- 37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks!
- In a row?

271
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,480
- Where you going?
- Listen, jerk. Until today, you never knew

272
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,200
how many guys I slept with
because you never bothered to ask.

273
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,880
You act all nonchalant about fucking
12 girls. I never had sex with 12 guys!

274
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,360
- You sucked enough dick!
- I went down on a few guys.

275
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,280
- A few?
- One was you. The last one, I might add.

276
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,280
Which, if you're too stupid to comprehend,
means I've been faithful since we met.

277
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,960
All the others I went with before I met you.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.

278
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,320
Don't look at me like the town whore,
you were plenty busy before you met me.

279
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,000
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any other decent person?

280
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Because going down isn't a big deal.

281
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,800
I liked a guy, we'd make out,
and I'd go down on him.

282
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,520
- But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
- I feel sick.

283
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
I love you!
Don't feel sick.

284
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,720
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

285
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm going to school.
Maybe later you'll be more rational.

286
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,120
- I'm 37! I just can't...
- Goodbye, Dante!

287
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,360
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on the way through the parking lot!

288
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,840
Hey! Hey, you!
Get back here.

289
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,360
I thought that place was supposed
to be open at 11:00. It's 11:20.

290
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,640
I've already called his house twice.
He'll be here soon.

291
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,160
Hey, it's not like
it's a demanding job over there.

292
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,720
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

293
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
I walked in the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

294
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,320
- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?

295
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,120
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No! He was probably resting his eyes.

296
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,400
What the hell is that,
"resting his eyes"?

297
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,200
- Like he's some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that's his night job.

298
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,560
Wise ass too, huh?
Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.

299
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,800
That's why you jockey a register
in some fuckin' convenience store

300
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
instead of working at a steady job.

301
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,720
I've got no time to bullshit around,
waiting for that son of a bitch.

302
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,720
Make sure he gets that.

303
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,160
The number's 812. My name's Wynarski.
I wanted a movie tonight.

304
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,680
If you tell me the movie title,
he'll hold it for you.

305
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,520
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

306
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,480
[Door opens, closes]

307
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,080
You forgot your keys.

308
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,040
- Guy ain't here yet.
- You're kidding! It's almost 11:30.

309
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,880
- I've been here since 11:00.
- I hate it when I can't rent videos!

310
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,040
I would've went to Big Choice,
but the tape I want is on that wall.

311
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,080
- Really? Which one?
- <i>Dental School.</i>

312
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,520
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

313
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,480
- I have first dibs.
- Says who?

314
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Says me. I've been here half an hour.
I'd call that first dibs.

315
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,160
- Ain't gonna happen. I'm getting it.
- Like hell you are.

316
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,720
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

317
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,680
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.

318
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,040
All right, asshole. You're on.

319
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
You're late.

320
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,520
- What are you doing here?
- The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

321
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,440
- Why are the shutters closed?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

322
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,920
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- That's what I said.

323
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,080
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

324
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,960
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Go open the store.

325
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,840
- Hey, you see a set of keys around here?
- No time for love, Dr. Jones.

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,680
Fucking kids.

327
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,840
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

328
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,400
Said the store was closed for two hours
yesterday. I tore up his membership.

329
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,880
Shocking abuse of authority.

330
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class,

331
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,040
especially since I rule.

332
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,800
- [Randal] Want something to drink?
- [Dante] No, thanks.

333
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
Who was on your phone
this morning, like, 2:30?

334
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,160
- I was trying to call for half an hour.
- Why?

335
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,680
I wanted to use your car.
Snack cake.

336
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,720
You don't wanna know.

337
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,640
- You call Caitlin again?
- She called me.

338
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,840
- You tell Veronica?
- One fight a day is all I can stomach.

339
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,640
- What do you fight about?
- We don't fight about anything.

340
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
She wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction.

341
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,240
I bet the most frequent
topic of argument is Caitlin.

342
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,520
- You win.
- I'm going to offer you some advice.

343
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,240
Let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin.
You been with Veronica how long?

344
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
- Seven months.
- Chick's nuts about you.

345
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,480
- How long you date Caitlin?
- Five years.

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,960
Chick made you nuts.
She cheated on you how many times?

347
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,880
- Eight and a half.
- Eight and a half?

348
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,120
Party at John Kay's, senior year.
I pass out in his bedroom.

349
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
- Caitlin jumps all over me.
- So that's cheating?

350
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,160
- In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad?

351
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,920
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

352
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,920
- One time, I called this girl "mom."
- I hit the light, she freaks.

353
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
- She thought I was Brad Michaelson.
- What?

354
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a dark room. Picked the wrong one.

355
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
- She didn't know I was at the party.
- God.

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,920
- Great story, huh?
- That girl was vile to you.

357
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,120
Interesting postscript.
Know who wound up in there with Brad?

358
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,640
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.

359
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,040
- Chess team Alan Harris?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

360
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
They raise sheep.

361
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,600
- Frightening.
- Different strokes to move the world.

362
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,240
I don't see how you could romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

363
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,960
She broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

364
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,920
- There was a lot of good.
- Oh, yeah?

365
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

366
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,680
That's what high school was about.
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

367
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
- Think things will be different this time?
- They are.

368
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,440
When she calls me now, she's different.
Frightened, vulnerable.

369
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
She's finishing college
and about to enter the real world.

370
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
- Shit, I gotta place an order.
- Talkin' to myself.

371
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,040
- I'm listening. She's leaving college...?
- And she's looking for support.

372
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

373
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
What about Veronica?

374
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,280
The arguments Veronica and I have
are a manifestation

375
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
of a subconscious desire
to break up,

376
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
to pursue a meaningful relationship
with Caitlin.

377
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,440
- Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
- It's safe to say yes.

378
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,480
- I think all four of you better talk it over.
- All four?

379
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,640
You, Veronica, Caitlin
and Caitlin's fiancé.

380
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,120
- Do you sell video tapes?
- Yeah. What are you looking for?

381
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
- <i>Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.</i>
- Uh, one second.

382
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm on with the distribution house.
Let me make sure they got it.

383
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,200
- What's it called again?
- <i>Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.</i>

384
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,160
- [Child] Happy Scrappy...
- She loves it.

385
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,320
Obviously.

386
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,240
This is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

387
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,480
I'd like to place an order.

388
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
I need one each of the following tapes:

389
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,800
<i>Whispers In The Wind,</i>
<i>To Each His Own,</i>

390
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,920
<i>Put It Where It Doesn't Belong,</i>
<i>My Pipes Need Cleaning,</i>

391
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,120
<i>All Tit Fucking Volume Eight,</i>
<i>I Need Your Cock,</i>

392
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,480
<i>Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers,</i>
<i>My Cunt And Eight Shafts,</i>

393
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts,</i>
<i>Cum Buns III,</i>

394
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>Cumming In Socks,</i>
<i>Cum On Ilene,</i>

395
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,560
<i>Huge Black Cocks</i>
<i>with Pearly White Cum,</i>

396
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,320
<i>Girls Who Crave Cock,</i>
<i>Girls Who Crave Cunt,</i>

397
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,920
<i>Men Alone Il: The KY Connection,</i>
<i>Pink Pussy Lips,</i>

398
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,960
oh, yeah, and
<i>All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.</i>

399
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,920
Yup. Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

400
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
<i># I'm a needle, you know</i>

401
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,880
<i># Never want to be a haystack</i>

402
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,080
<i># Don't ever want to break</i>
<i>Your heart in two</i>

403
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,600
<i># Know the crowd</i>
<i>Is gonna sell their soul</i>

404
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,640
<i># Take it anywhere I know</i>
<i>Well, I promise you</i>

405
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,760
<i># It's making me sick #</i>

406
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes, I'd like to check on
a misprint in today's edition.

407
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,600
Today's edition.

408
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,280
It says,
"Bree to wed Asian design major."

409
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,240
No, everything's spelled fine.

410
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,360
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

411
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't know,
a typographical error or something.

412
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,640
Maybe it should say, "Caitlin Bray"
or "Caitlin Bre" with one "e."

413
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
I'm a curious party.
A curious party.

414
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,160
I'm an ex- boyfriend, and...

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
I talk to her all the time and
she never mentioned this engagement.

416
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,440
That's why I'm thinking
maybe it's a misprint.

417
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,760
Are you sure? Maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

418
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,760
Meaning like, someone who asked her out
once and got shot down,

419
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,160
and this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper.

420
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,560
Hello. Hello?

421
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,240
- [Sniffing]
- [Cat meows]

422
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,960
I don't care if she's my cousin, I'm
gonna knock those boots again tonight.

423
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,400
- Look. The fuckin' human vacuum.
- Scumbag, what are you doing?

424
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,360
- Hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin.
- He's your cousin?

425
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
- He's from Russia too.
- No way.

426
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,200
- What part of Russia?
- Do I look like his fuckin' biographer?

427
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,360
- Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
- Moscow.

428
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
- He only speaks Russian?
- He speaks some English, but not good.

429
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,240
- Is he staying here?
- He's moving to the big city this week.

430
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
- He wants to be a metal singer.
- [Girl] No way.

431
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
I swear. Olaf, metal.

432
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

433
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
- [Speaks Russian]
- That's fucked up, man.

434
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
- What did he say?
- I don't know, but this guy's a character.

435
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,680
- He really wants to play metal?
- He's got his own band in Moscow.

436
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
- Called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans".
- That doesn't sound metal.

437
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,400

- <i>Empire.</i>
- Blasphemy.

466
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,360
<i>Empire</i> had the better ending.

467
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,720

All <i>Jedi</i> had was a bunch of muppets.

471

There was something else going on
in <i>Jedi.</i> I never noticed it 'til today.

472
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,160
They build another Death Star, right?

473
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,480
The first one was fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

474
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Luke blew it up. Give credit.

475
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
The second one was being built
when they blew it up.

Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

477

Something never sat right with me
that second time.

478
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,760
I couldn't put my finger on it.
Something wasn't right.

479
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,000
And you figured it out.

480
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,560
The first Death Star
was manned by the lmperial Army.

481
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,040
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.

482
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,080
Basically.

483
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,760
So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

484
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,320
- And the second time around?
- It wasn't even done being built yet.

485
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,560
- It was still under construction.
- So?

486
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,920
A job of that magnitude would require

487
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,880
a lot more manpower
than the lmperial Army had to offer.

488
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,560
I'll bet they brought
independent contractors in.

489
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,280
- Plumbers, roofers...
- Not just lmperialists.

490
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,320
- Is that what you're getting at?
- To get it built quickly,

491
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,320
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

492
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,040
Think the average Storm Trooper
can install a toilet main?

493
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,440
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in independent contractors.

494
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,280
- Why are you so upset.
- All those contractors brought in are killed.

495
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,960
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

496

Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

497

You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

498
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,880
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

499

Along come these militants who blast
everything within a three-mile radius.

500

You didn't ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

501
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,480
- You're trying to scrape out a living.
- I don't mean to interrupt,

502
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,400
- what are you talking about?
- The ending of <i>Return Of The Jedi.</i>

503
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,720
He's trying to convince me

504
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,960
that any independent contractors
working on the Death Star

505
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,520
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed.

506
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

"Done And Ready Home lmprovements."

508
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,240
Speaking as a roofer, I can tell you
a roofer's personal politics

509
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,280
- comes into play when choosing jobs.
- Like when?

510
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,680
Three weeks ago, I was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

511
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,560
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

512
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,040
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

513
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,760
- Then I realized whose house it was.
- [Dante] Whose was it?

514
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,600
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Babyface Bambino? The gangster?

515
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,480
The same! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

516
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,400
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

517
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,960
- Based on personal politics.
- Right!

518
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,120
The next week, the Foresci family
put a hit on Babyface's house.

519
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,400
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

520
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
No way.

521
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,520
[Man] I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

522
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
My friend wasn't so lucky.

523
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,400
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

524
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,960
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

525
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,960
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

526
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,880
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

527
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,960
Are either one of these any good?

528
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,880
- Sir?
- What?

529
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,560
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don't watch movies.

530
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,840
[Sighs] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

531
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,040
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

532
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,880
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

533
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,800
Nope.

534
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720

535
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,000
- Well, what about these two?
- They suck.

536
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,360
[Sighs]
These are the same two movies.

537
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,760

- No, I wasn't.

538
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,000
I don't think your manager
would appreciate...

539
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,160
- I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon?

540
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,680
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

541
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention.

542
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,760
And I hope it feels good.

543
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,920
- You hope what feels good?
- I hope it feels so good to be right.

544
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,240
Nothing's more exhilarating
than pointing out

- Wait.
- She in here?

552

This guy's going through all the eggs.

553

This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

554
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,400
- What's he looking for?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

555
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,200
- Perfect dozen?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

556
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,440
- The quest isn't going well?
- Obviously not.

557
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,720
- Look at the cartons that didn't make it.
- Why doesn't he mix and match?

558
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,160
- I told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say?

559
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,400
He said it's important to have standards.
No one has pride anymore.

560
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

561
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,520
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

562
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,440
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

563
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,600
Two packs of cigarettes.

564
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,600
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

565
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,320
- You know him?
- No, but I know the behavior.

566
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,440
He's looking for the perfect
carton of eggs?

567
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
[Randal] How'd you know?

568
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,360
- I'll bet you he's a guidance counselor.
- [Dante] Why do you say that?

569
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,280
I saw it happen in Food City, last year.
Different guy, though.

570
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,080
Stock boy said he looked through
cartons for half an hour,

571
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

572
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,440
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

573
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,320
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

574
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,520
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.

575
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,840
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

576
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,520
They used to make a big deal of it.
They just let it go now.

577
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,640
They always pay for whatever they break.
They never bother anybody.

578
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,200
Why guidance counselors?

579
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,440
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

580
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,840
- My guidance counselor was worthless.
- See?

581
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,280
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference.

582
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,320
That's why I manually masturbate caged

00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,640
<i># You can call it</i>
<i>Another lonely day #</i>

585
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,040
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in "9"?

586
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,000
Damn, that's eerie.

587
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,720
Know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour?

588
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
What's a jiz-mopper?

589
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,000
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

590
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
- "Nudie booth"?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

591
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,640
- You ever been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.

592
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,880
Oh, man, it's great.

593
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,960
You go into a booth, and there's
glass between you and these chicks.

594
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,160
- They put on a show for you for ten bucks.
- What kind of a show?

595
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,200
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

596
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,840
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

597
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now?

598
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

599
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Everybody does it right on the window.

600
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,480
I don't know if you know this,
cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it.

601
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
- I will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me?

602
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,240
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

603
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,680
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

604
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,680
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

605
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,440
You've highly offended me.

606
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,440
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

607
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,280
Oh!
[Screaming]

608
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,960
- You can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that?

609
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,800
- You know he's going tell the boss.
- Who cares?

610
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,680
He's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in is way too uptight.

611
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,560
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

612
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,760
- I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up?

613
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,800
You'd feel better if you'd
rip into the occasional customer.

614
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,680
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

615
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,240
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that
annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.

616
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
- There aren't!
- How can you lie like that?

617
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,240
Why don't you vent? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off?

618
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,600
Well, I guess it isn't
customers in particular.

619
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
Maybe just a group of customers.

620
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,520
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

621
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,440
The Milk Maids?

622
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,240
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

623
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,280
as if somewhere beyond all the
gallons is a container of milk...

624
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,960
that won't go bad for like a decade.

625
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You know who I can do without?
The people in the video store.

626
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,120
- Which ones?
- All of 'em.

627
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,720
What would you get for a six-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

628
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,480
So, do you have any new movies in?

629
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,040
Do you have that one with that guy who
was in that movie that was out last year?

630
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,960
They never rent quality flicks.

631
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,080
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

632
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,560
Oooh! <i>Navy SEALS!</i>

633
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,000
In order to join they have to have an I.Q.
Less than their shoe size.

634
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,920
You think you get stupid questions?
You should hear the barrage that I get.

635
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,360
There's no ice?
I've got to drink this coffee hot?

636
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,720
So, how much is this thing anyway?

637
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

638
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,360
Ooh! Mini-Trucker magazine.

639
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,280
- See? You vented. Don't you feel better?
- No.

640
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,360
- Why not?
- My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

641
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,680
You got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

642
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,600
Veronica!

643
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,600
- What happened to home by 12:00?
- Boss hasn't shown up yet.

644
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,000
- How come you're not in class?
- Got canceled.

645
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,360
- So I brought you some lunch.
- What is it?

646
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts
cut off. What do you think?

647
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,120
- It's lasagna.
- Really?

648
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,520
Oh, you're the queen.

649
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm glad you calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

650
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,280
- Thirty-seven?
- Shut up!

651
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,640
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

652
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,400
[Sucking sound]

653
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,720
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

654
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,400
- You had to tell him?
- I had to. He put it into perspective.

655
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,280
- What did he say?
- He said at least he wasn't 36.

656
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,200
And that made you feel better?

657
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,560
And he said most of them were college
guys I never even seen or met before.

658
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,600
- The ostrich syndrome: If you don't see it...
- It isn't there. Yes.

659
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,800
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagna.

660
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,640
- Couldn't get the shutters open?
- No.

661
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,920
I called the locksmith. The earliest
he can be here is tomorrow morning.

662
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,480
Bummer. Well, I gotta
head back for the 1:30 class.

663
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,400
- What time you get finished?
- 8:00. I have a sorority meeting 'til 9:00.

664
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,040
I'll see you when you close.
Can we go out for coffee?

665
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,960
- Sure.
- Good.

666
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,200
See you when you close.
Enjoy the lasagna.

667
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,560
[Door opens, closes]

668
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,960
[Sucking sound]

669
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,680
Vermont?

670
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,760
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

671
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,440
He left at what time?

672
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,600
He really went to Vermont? When
the hell was someone going to tell me?

673
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,320
He promised me he'd be here by noon!

674
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,480
Jesus, when does he get back? Tuesday?
You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

675
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,880
I've got a game at 2:00,
the shutters are jammed.

676
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,560
And he's in Vermont?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!

677
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,960
[Sighing]

678
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,240
So I'm stuck here until closing?

679
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,120
Oh, this is just great.
I can't fucking believe this.

680
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,560
No. No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

681
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,280
Yeah, I know.

682
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,800
No, I'll be all right.

683
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,520
Well, that's all I can do, right?
Yeah.

684
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,400
- All right, thanks. Bye.
- Vermont?

685
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,400
- Can you fucking believe this?
- He didn't mention that to you?

686
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,120
Not a word!
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

687
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,360
- So, what? You're stuck here all day?
- Fuck!

688
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
- Why'd you apologize?
- What?

689
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,000
I heard you. Why?
You had every reason to be mad.

690
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,040
- I know!
- That seems to be the leitmotif in your life.

691
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
- Ever backing down.
- I don't back down!

692
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,680
You always back down.
You assume blame that's not yours.

693
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
You come in on your day off.
You buckle like a belt.

694
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,280
- Know what pisses me off?
- That I'm right about your buckling?

695
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,840
- I'm going to miss the game!
- Because you buckled.

696
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,040
- Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping!
- Don't yell at me, pal.

697
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,280
- I'm sorry.
- See? There you go again.

698
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,040
- I can't believe I'm going to miss the game.
- At least we're stuck here together.

699
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,360
You got a customer.

700
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,920
What?
What do you want?

701
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,640
I can't fucking believe this.

702
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,680
Yeah, hello, Sanford.
Dante.

703
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,520
I can't play today.
I'm stuck at work.

704
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled today...
Forget it.

705
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,920
Point is, I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

706
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,920
Wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

707
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Hold on.
You feeling limber?

708
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,400
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
- I've got to tell you,

709
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
this is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

710
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,680
I never thought you capable of such
a disregard of store policy.

711
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,560
- I told him I had a game. It's his own fault.
- No arguments here.

712
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,600
- Insubordination rules.
- I just want to play hockey.

713
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

714
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,960
If you grab one,
then everybody will.

715
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
- So?
- Who's gonna pay for these Gatorades?

716
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,080
- What do you care, motherfucker?
- I have a responsibility.

717
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,960
- Everybody can't grab free drinks.
- What responsibility?

718
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,840
- You're closing the store to play hockey.
- He's got a point.

719
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
Will you let me maintain
some semblance of control?

720
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
go the full nine,

721
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,720
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit.

722
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,760
As if we're going to have a run
on Gatorade.

723
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,320
- Fuckin' A.
- All right! Jesus, you fuckers are pushy!

724
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,440
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

725
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,440
- Design major.
- Can we not talk about this?

726
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,480
Fine, but you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

727
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,200
- You gonna lock the store?
- You gonna lock the video store?

728
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,080
Look who you're asking here.
How're we gonna block the street?

729
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,720
- We're not playing in the street.
- Then where are we gonna play?

730
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,720
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

731
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,960
[Yelling]

732
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,080
I got it! I got it!
It's mine, it's mine!

733
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah!

734
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,160
[Yelling continues]

735
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,840
Hit 'em!

736
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,920
All right, here we go.
I got it.

737
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,080
- When is this period over?
- Eight minutes.

738
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,800
What, are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

739
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,160
- Just wait a few minutes.
- I'm gonna break my neck on this ladder.

740
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,280
Lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store!

741
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,720
- Where are you?
- He's busy!

742
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,760
- In a second!

743
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,440
Fuck "in a second"!
Oh, look at you. You can't even pass.

744
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,480
- [Dante] I can pass!
- How about covering the point? You suck!

745
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,840
- Who are you to make assessments?
- I'll assess all I want, pal!

746
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,520
- Dante, you in or out?
- Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

747
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,080
- You're any better?
- I can whip your ass any day.

748
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,960
- Easy to say over there.
- Give me a stick, pretty boy!

749
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,080
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass!

750
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,880
- You open?
- Yeah, you open?

751
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,120
- No!
- No!

752
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,720
There's a stick.
You're shooting up against this goal.

753
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,000
Hey, Redding! Come on.
Get this fucker!

754
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,680
Oh, man! Hey!

755
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,600
Come on. Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on. Get him!

756
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,600
Come on. Get him, get him!

757
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,880
- Give me another ball.
- There are no more.

758
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,440
What are you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

759
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,960
I brought the orange one
and... the orange one.

760
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,320
Hey, any balls down there?

761
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,160
[Jay] About the biggest pair
you ever seen, dingleberry.

762
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
- You only brought one?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.

763
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,080
- [Redding] Dante had the balls.
- Nobody has another ball?

764
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,560
Shit!

765
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,160
We got what, 12 minutes of a game
and it's over? Fuck!

766
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,840
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

767
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,400
I still get free Gatorade, right?

768
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,760
- Be careful.
- I'm trying.

769
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,600
You know, the insides of those has
got stuff that can give you cancer.

770
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,000
- So I'm told.
- Yeah.

771
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,680
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living. In the circus.

772
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,040
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?

773
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,720
- Got hit by a bus.
- Oh. Can I help you?

774
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,200
Well, uh, that depends.
You got maybe a toilet in here?

775
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,240
- Yeah, but it's for employees only.
- I understand.

776
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,600
But I, uh, thought maybe
you'd let me use it anyway.

777
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,760
I'm not so young anymore and I'm,
how do you say, a little incontinent.

778
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,760
- Sure. In the back, through the cooler.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

779
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,160
Say, uh, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

780
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,240
- The white kind.
- I didn't ask about the color.

781
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,760
I mean, is it rough
or is it cottony?

782
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,560
- Actually, it's kinda rough.
- Oh, boy!

783
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,840
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my hemorrhoids.

784
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
I thought maybe you could
let me have a roll of the soft stuff.

785
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,600
I see you sell
the soft stuff back there.

786
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,320
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, boitshik! What's the difference?

787
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,600
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

788
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,240
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

789
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,160
You're a lifesaver.

790
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,000
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

791
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,520
but, uh, maybe I could have something
in the back there to read?

792
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,440
A paper or something?

793
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,680
Sometimes it takes me a while,

794
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,400
and I like to have something
to read while it's going on.

795
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,320
[Dante] Yeah, sure, go ahead.

796
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,520
[Man] One of the magazines you got
in the back behind the counter.

797
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,720
- The porno mags?
- Yeah!

798
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,120
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

799
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,480
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

800
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,360
Not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

801
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,760
- They got bigger titties in there.
- Here.

802
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,480
- Now leave me alone.
- Oh, thank you, sonny boy.

803
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,400
I appreciate it.

804
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,360
Hell of a game.

805
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,320
One ball? I close the store, they come
all the way here, for one ball?

806
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,520
Hockey is hockey.
At least we got to play.

807
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,400
Twelve minutes is not a game.
It's hardly even a warmup.

808
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,880
- Bitch, bitch. Want something to drink?
- Yeah, a Gatorade.

809
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,720
- Hey, what happened to all the Gatorade?
- Exactly. They drank it all.

810
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,280
- [Randal] Know what Sanford told me?
- [Dante] I can't believe she's marrying.

811
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,840
- Julie Dwyer died.
- Yeah, right.

812
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,920
- No, I'm serious.
- Oh, my God!

813
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,960
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

814
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,400
- How? When?
- Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

815
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,280
She was swimming in the pool
in the YMCA when it happened.

816
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,000
- She died mid-backstroke.
- I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

817
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she
one of the illustrious 12?

818
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,680
- Yeah, number six.
- You've had sex with a dead person.

819
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,280
- I'm gonna go to her wake.
- No, you're not. It's today.

820
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,280
- [Dante] What?
- [Randal] The next show's at 4:00.

821
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,520
- [Dante] What about tomorrow?
- [Randal] She's buried in the morning.

822
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,920
- You gotta watch the store. I gotta go.
- Wait.

823
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,120
Has it occurred to you
I might be bereaved?

824
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,280
You hardly knew her.

825
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,640
True. Do you know how many people
will be there?

826
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,560
- All her old classmates.
- This is beneath even you.

827
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,600
I'm not gonna miss what's probably
the social event of the season.

828
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,800
- You hate people!
- But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?

829
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,520
Stop being an asshole.
Someone's gotta watch the store.

830
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
- If you go, I go.
- She meant nothing to you!

831
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,160
She meant nothing to you neither
'til I told you she died.

832
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,080
- I'm not taking you.
- I'm going with you.

833
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,600
- I can't close the store.
- You just closed the store to play hockey.

834
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,480
Which means I can't close it for another
hour just so we can both go to a wake.

835
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,400
You were saying?

836
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,200
Thanks for putting me in
such a tough spot. You're a good friend.

837
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Twenty- two. Just like us.

838
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,680
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.

839
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,160
That's nothing compared to
how my cousin Walter died.

840
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,200
How did he die?

841
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
- He broke his neck.
- That's embarrassing?

842
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,960
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

843
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.

844
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,960
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.

845
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,120
- Oh, my God!
- Haven't you ever tried to suck your dick?

846
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,960
- No.
- Yeah, right. You're so repressed.

847
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,480
- Because I never tried to suck my dick?
- No, because you won't admit to it.

848
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,680
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
'cause he tries to go down on himself.

849
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,400
You're as curious as the rest
of us, pal. You've tried it.

850
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,280
- Who found him?
- My cousin? Mom found him.

851
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,960
It was a mess. He was on his bed,
his legs doubled over himself.

852
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,880
Mom freaked out.

853

<i># You know that you are</i>
<i>A shooting star #</i>

854
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,960
- Made it, huh? Dick in his mouth?
- Yeah.

855
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,680
Balls resting on his lips.

856
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,160
- Wow. He really made it.
- Yeah, but at what a price.

857
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,480
- I can never reach.
- Reach what?

858
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,880
- You know.
- What, your dick?

859
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,880
Yeah. Like you said, I guess everybody
gets curious and tries it sometime.

860
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,800
I never tried it.

861
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,800
Fucking pervert.

I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

Nobody's there.
It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

How many people ever come to the store

- [door closes]
- I can't fucking believe you.

876
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,920
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

877
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,600
- You knocked the casket over!
- I was leanin' on it. It was an accident.

878
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,840
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose!

879
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,040
- So the casket fell over. Big deal.
- Her fucking body fell out!

880
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,240
I put her back in it. It's not like
it matters if she breaks something.

881
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,640
- Just go open the video store.
- [Jay] Open the video store!

882
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,000
Shut the fuck up, junkie.

883
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,680
- Would you just go open the video store?
- Yeah, you cock-smokin' clerk.

884
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,600
How many times have I told you
not to deal in front of the store?

885
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm not.
What're you talking about?

886
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,680
- Have you got anything, man?
- What you want?

887
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,080
- Let me borrow your car.
- I don't want to talk to you.

888
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,440
- Fine. Just let me borrow your car.
- Why should I loan you my car?

889
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,680
- I want to rent a movie.
- You want to rent a movie.

890
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,800
I want to rent a movie.

891
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,240
- [Sighs]
- What's that for?

892
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,800
- You work in a video store!
- I work in a shitty video store.

893
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,920
I want to go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

894
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,080
And a pack of cigarettes.

895
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,000
- Cute cat. What's its name?
- Annoying customer.

896
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,920
Fucking dickhead.

897
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,160
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers?

898
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,560
- Let me borrow your car.
- May I be blunt with you?

899
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,560
If you must.

900
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,360
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST Video, respectively.

901
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,640
We have obligations that, although
they may seem cruel and unusual,

902
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,440
- mean manning the store until closing.
- I see.

903
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,960
So playing hockey and attending wakes
are standard operating procedures?

904
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,280
Those are obligations that couldn't
have been met at any other date.

905
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,920
Renting videos, that's gratuitous, and
illogical, since you work at a video store.

906
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,840
- Are you open?
- Yes.

907
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,520
I don't care for your rationale.

908
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,320
It's gonna have to do,
being it's my car up for request.

909
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,560
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.

910
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,080
- What's your point?
- You're a clerk, paid to do a job.

911
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,520
You can't just do anything
you want while you're working.

912
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,440
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time-Warner.

913
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,440
Report stock increase."

914
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,120
They print any kind of shit
in this paper.

915
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,040
They certainly do.
Three dollars.

916
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,520
- Your argument is title dictates behavior.
- What?

917
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,800
You won't let me use your car
because I have a title and job description.

918
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,040
- I'm supposed to follow it, right?
- Exactly.

919
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,360
I saw one one time that said,

920
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,960
"The next week,
the world is ending."

921
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,360
In the next week's paper, they said,

922
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,080
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

923
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,440
by a koala-fish mutant bird."

924
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,640
[Laughing]
Crazy shit.

925
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,280
I'm no more responsible for my decisions
here than a death squad soldier in Bosnia?

926
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,240
You're not being asked to slay children
or anything.

927
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,800
- Yeah, not yet.
- And I remember one time...

928
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,600
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk!

929
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,160
- I'm sorry. He meant to hit me.
- Well, he missed.

930
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,040
Here, let me refund your money
and we'll call it even.

931
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,040
I'll never come in here again.

932
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,040
And if I see you again,
I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

933
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,840
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Two reasons.

934
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,600
One, I hate it when people can't shut up
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

935
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,000
And two, to prove a point.
Title does not dictate behavior.

936
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,400
- What?
- If title dictated my behavior as a clerk

937
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,280
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but I did.

938
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,840
My point is that people
dictate their own behavior.

939
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,200
Even though I work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

940
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,480
Agreed?

941
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,440
You are a danger
to the dead and the living.

942
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,840
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

943
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,800
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

944
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,600
Sounds like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

945
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,600
Excuse me?

946
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,640
You strained
when you picked up that milk.

947
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,560
- It only weighs seven pounds.
- I didn't strain. I sighed.

948
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,840
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

949
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,280
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

950
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,360
I'm a trainer. I know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

951
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,520
- What? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat!

952
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,880
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

953
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,880
- You open?
- Yes.

954
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,560
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

955
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,120
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape?

956
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,040
Can't really tell from here.

957
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,840
- He is.
- I am not!

958
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,760
How much can you bench?

959
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,680
- I don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

960
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,600
I know I can bench more than that.

961
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,320
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way!

962
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,240
Feel that.

963
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,040
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

964
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,240
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

965
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,720
- Oh, for God's sakes!
- See, you're ashamed.

966
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,120
You know you're out of shape.

967
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,160
Here.
Take my card.

968
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,560
I can get you on an aerobics,
free weights program.

969
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,440
- Are you open?
- [Dante] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

970
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,360
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day?

971
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,440
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

972
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,360
I don't have love handles!

973
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,560
- Were you working here about 4:00?
- Yes.

974
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,440
- It's from being around this food every day.
- Oh, I know.

975
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,920
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

976
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,640
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can I have your name, please?

977
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,960
Dante Hicks. Why?
What's this all about?

978
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,000
You're Dante Hicks? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

979
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,440
- Because he's out of shape!
- Do I know you?

980
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,000
Do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out...

981
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,800
- With Caitlin Bree!
- I'm her sister.

982
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,720
You're Alyssa's sister Heather?

983
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,800
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree?

984
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,840
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl?

985
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,360
A little taller than her?
Gorgeous body?

986
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,320
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

987
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,360
You went to the same school,
played hockey.

988
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,000
- How did you know that?
- You still goin' out with her?

989
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,120
- No, she's getting married.
- To you?

990
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,080
No. To an Asian design major.

991
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,000
Aw, shit!

992
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,240
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, I used to fuck her.

993
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,680
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

994
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,400
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

995
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,440
- You're Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

996
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,360
- You know him?
- Yeah.

997
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,840
- Caitlin talked about him all the time.
- Really?

998
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,840
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

999
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,560
Don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

1000
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,840
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it.

1001
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,440
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

1002
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,400
Jesus Christ! What next?

1003
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,320
- Here you go.
- What's this?

1004
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,080
- A fine for $500.
- What?

1005
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,000
Five hundred bucks?
For what?

1006
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,480
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170<i>l</i>51.

1007
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,040
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

1008
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,520
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

1009
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,840
is regarded as disorderly.

1010
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,080
- What are you talkin' about?
- An angry mother called the state

1011
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,040
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

1012
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,080
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes today.

1013
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,880
The Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health

1014
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,800
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1015
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,240
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

1016
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,720
The fine is doubled
due to the young age of the child.

1017
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,840
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids!

1018
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,760
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old?
What a scumbag!

1019
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
That's sick, Dante.

This summons cannot be contested

Failure to remit will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids.
Hey, wait a minute!

Forget it. I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

Can I, uh, give you

- Let's not talk about her.

- Train. It took eight hours.

Something I read in the tabloids.

- It's not what you think.
- Oh, it's not.

I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well.

You could've broken it gently.

I'm sorry, but when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

Well, kind of. Sort of.

"Kind of," "sort of"?

was in the paper.

- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?

"Wreck" is a harsh term.

"Mildly disturbed".

for you to think I was hiding something.

behind your refusal to wed.

I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating,

1125
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,120
is a lot more idyllic than
what actually happens when we date.

Yeah, a real date.
Dinner and a movie.

Naked Somewhere" kind of private date?

- Jerk!

Here I am, throwing myself at you,
succumbing to your wily charms,

1136
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,360

in so many words.

- He's your fiancé.

you haven't gotten the drift

Duh! I'm about
to become single again.

1143
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,040
And, yes,
allow me to placate your ego.

1144
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,000
You are the inspiration
for this bold and momentous decision

1145
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,080
that will probably get me ostracized
from both school and home.

1146

You ask me who I choose.

I choose you.

1148
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,320
- So, what are you saying?
- You are such an asshole.

1149
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,920
- I'm just kidding!
- I can already see this is not gonna work.

1150

- I'll ask Randal to close up.
- Where is he, anyway?

1151
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,040
I thought he'd be at your side
like a lapdog.

He went to go rent a movie.
He isn't back yet.

1153
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,280
I'll close up and leave him a note.

1154

You are too responsible.
But no, I have to go home first.

They don't even know
I've left school yet.

1156

I should break the disengagement news
to my mother,

1157
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
which is gonna cause quite a row
considering she loves Sang.

1158
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,080
- Who doesn't?
- Well, me, I guess.

1159

[Sighs] So I shall
take my leave of you,

1160
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,920
but I will return in a little while,

1161
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,840
at which time I would love to
go for dinner and a movie with you.

1162
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
What happened to the walk

She's gonna need years of therapy.

1313
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,160
My question is, how did she come
to have sex with a dead man?

1314
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,760
She thought it was me.

1315
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,800
What kind of convenience store

We're gonna need a bigger boat.

What's with you, man? You haven't
said anything for 20 minutes.

1323

What the hell's your problem?

1324
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,000
- [Sighs] This life.
- This life?

1325
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,320
Why do I have this life?

1326
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,240
Have some chips.
You'll feel better.

1327
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,840
I'm stuck in this pit,
working for less than slave wages,

- What are you talking about?

1340

This thing you have, this inability
to improve your station in life.

- Fuck you.
- It's true, man.

You blame life for dealing you

responsibility for your situation.

- What responsibility?
- If you hate this job and the people...

1345
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,440
and the fact that you have to
come in on your day off, why not quit?

1346
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,000
- Like it's that easy.
- It is. You just up and quit.

1347
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,400
There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

You're qualified for at least one.
So what's stopping you?

- Leave me alone.
- You're comfortable?

1350
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,480
This is a life of convenience
and any attempt to change it

1351
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,840
would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

- Same with Veronica.
- Leave her out.

1356
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,200
You date Veronica because it's
convenient and she's low maintenance.

1357
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,080
But all you do is talk about Caitlin.

1358
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,560
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

1359
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,840
High school, for God's sakes.
You're 22.

1360

- Leave me alone.

It must be great to have
this ability to simplify things.

1366
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,960
- Am I right or what?
- You're wrong.

for 30 years. I call him Dad.

"Yes, some things you say are true"?

1373

Things are not going to change.

1374
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,840
- Make 'em change.
- I can't, all right?

1375
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,480
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

1376
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,480
I can't make changes in my life
like that. If I could, I would.

1377
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,480
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

1378
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,280
on the big money and fabulous prizes.

1379

- Jesus H. Christ! I can't.

So you're gonna be miserable 'cause
you don't have the guts to face change?

I shit my pants.

I thought we might
be starting again.

Didn't I see her change your tire once?

I jacked up the car. All she did was
unloosen the nuts and put the tire on.

they wanted from me was weed and shit.

I love her.

That's it. He doesn't love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.

And he told you all of this?

Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part. That's my theory.

I don't know what to say.

1433
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,680
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

1434
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,640
It's not your fault.
It's Dante.

Look. I don't know thing one
about chicks.

I can get out of here.

What did you do that for?

why didn't you say so?

and see that slut!

- You've been talking to her for weeks!

Only a few times.

1443

I've gone down on a couple of guys.

Oh, a couple?

just wait.

I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame!

- Will you let me explain?
- What?

1449
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,840
How you've been waiting until the time
was right to dump me for her?

But I'm not going to hold your hand
anymore until you figure it out!

1454
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,480
I've tried with you, Dante.

1455
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,000
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

1456
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,840
to take charge and find direction.

1457
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,280
I transferred so maybe you'd be more
inclined to go back if I was with you.

1458
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,680
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

1459
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,080
and wanted to see you
pull yourself out of this funk

1460
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,200
that you've been in since that whore
dumped you so many years ago.

1461
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,600
You wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over more!

1462
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,800
- I don't wanna go back...
- Of course. Not now.

1463
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,720
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out.

1464
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,920
I want you to follow through so you
can find out what an idiot you are.

1465
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,640
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you, she will,

1466
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,280
when she dumps you again
I want to laugh in your face

1467
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,360
so you realize what you gave up
our relationship for.

1468
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,160
I'm glad Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't.

1469
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,560
Having him tell me was
the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

1470
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,720
- Veronica, I love you.
- Fuck you!

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,160
The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. Stings.

1484
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,080
- How's your neck?
- It's kind of hard to swallow.

1485
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,960
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

1486
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,240
Why did you tell Veronica I was
gonna dump her to go with Caitlin?

1487
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,160
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

1488
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,680
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change.

1489
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,200
- I thought I'd give you a hand.
- Thanks.

1490
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,120
You still didn't have to choke me.

1491
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,000
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

1492
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,880
- Why do you say that?
- Why do I say that?

1493
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,640
Forget it.

1494
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,680
No, really.
What did I do that was so wrong?

1495
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,080
What don't you do?

1496
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,240
Sometimes I think you come to work
to make my life miserable.

1497
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,560
- How do you figure?
- What time did you get to work?

1498
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,920
Like 10:00, or ten after.

1499
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,920
You were half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

1500
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,640
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store is closed.

1501
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,240
- It's not like I'm miles away.
- Unless you're out renting videos.

1502
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,080
Hermaphrodites. I rented it
so we could watch it together.

1503
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,560
You get me slapped with a fine.

1504
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,560
You argue with the customers,
and I have to patch everything up.

1505
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,320
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

1506
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,560
To top it off, you ruin my relationship.
What's your encore?

1507
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:35,200
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

1508
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,760
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is?

1509
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,880
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

1510
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,200
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, pal!

1511
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,320
Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

1512
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,240
I'm the source of all your misery.

1513
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,760
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

1514
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,120
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend

1515
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,040
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

1516
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,200
You wanna blame somebody?
Blame yourself.

1517
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,240
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today."

1518
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,000
You sound like an asshole!

1519
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,040
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

1520
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,080
You're here of your own volition.

1521
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,960
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

1522
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,280
like this would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1523
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,920
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1524
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:22,400
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

1525
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,640
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

1526
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,000
so much more important
than it really is.

1527
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,480
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, I might add.

1528
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,680
I work in a shitty video store,
badly as well.

1529
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,520
That guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

1530
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,280
We like to make ourselves
seem more important

1531
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,280
than the people that come in
to buy a paper or cigarettes.

1532
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,840
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

1533
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,560
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,
what are we doin' workin' here?

1534
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,640
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

1535
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,040
- Need a ride home?
- No, I got one. Just pulled up.

1536
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,880
- You workin' tomorrow?
- Same time. What about you?

1537
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,240
I'm callin' out.
Goin' to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

1538
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,640
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

1539
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,680
You wanna grab a bite to eat when you're
done with that and I get off work?

1540
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,560
- I'll give you a call, let you know.
- All right.

1541
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,520
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

1542
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,640
I can talk to her,
try to straighten...

1543
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,240
No, thanks.
I think I can handle it.

1544
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,960
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

1545
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,880
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.

1546
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,760
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

1547
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,400
Why don't you wrangle for me?

1548
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,000
- [Scoffs] No.
- Come on. Just wrangle out the door.

1549
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,680
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on.
