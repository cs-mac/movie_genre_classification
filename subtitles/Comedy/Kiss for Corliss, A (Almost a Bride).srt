00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:38,945
What do you see?

00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,176
Are birds flying?

00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,567
Yeah.

00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,896
They're flying beyond the sun.
Where are they flying to?

00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,289
I'm sure they're flying
to the world over yonder.

00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,204
Can you see it?
Take a good look.

00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:52,542
No, I can't see.

00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,283
Want me to allow you to see it?

00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:55,284
Yes.

00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:59,426
Here. Take a good look.

00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:05,750
The world we live in is composed of the
our world, and the world over yonder.

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,733
We live in this world,
and the gods live in that other world.

00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,093
Gods?

00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,555
<i>The world that the gods live in</i>

00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:22,382
<i>is composed of Water Country,
Sky Country, and Earth Country.</i>

00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,926
<i>Those from the Realm of the Gods
send gods over to our world</i>

00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:28,531
<i>in order to look after the environment
in the human world.</i>

00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:32,126
They don't look after
human beings, though?

00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:35,043
Humans can take care of themselves.

00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:38,382
<i>The kings of Water Country,
Sky Country, and Earth Country</i>

00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:41,882
<i>were fated to be kings from birth.</i>

00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,384
<i>The king of Water Country, in particular</i>

00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:50,168
<i>is also given the special power of being
the emperor of the Realm of the Gods.</i>

00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:54,221
<i>The new emperor must bring the three
god stones together and make a royal seal</i>

00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,593
<i>in order to become the next emperor.</i>

00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:58,819
<i>However, the gods
who have those god stones</i>

00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,853
<i>are the guardian gods
who reside in the human world.</i>

00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,998
<i>So he has to come here
to find those stones</i>

00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,430
to become the emperor of the gods?

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,908
Yes.

00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,979
What happens if the guardian gods
won't give up the stones?

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,651
Well, that's something that
only humans would do.

00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,501
But there's something strange about this.

00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:20,600
Why did they leave the god stones
in the human world?

00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,764

High Priest.

00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,199
It's about time that the red water came.

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,727
Looks like the Realm of the Gods will
welcome a new emperor after 3,200 years.

00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,752
Where is Lord Habaek?

00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:51,442
For my lowly self to be given this honor
truly is quite gracious of you, my lord!

00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:56,341
To think that I'd be
painting a portrait of you...

00:04:56,341 --> 00:05:02,112
I understand why the heavens chose you
to be the next in line for the throne!

00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:07,175
It's time... for me to do your eyes, sir.

00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,038
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,603
The... finishing touches...

00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,182
Lord Habaek.

00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,656
You have a call from the High Priest.

00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,689
Tell him to stop calling me so much.

00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,747
Why does he have to ask me so many
insignificant things every day?

00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:37,052
The water of Water Country
has turned red.

00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,336
So he said that you
should make preparations.

00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,694
Does the king know about this, too?

00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,250
He is quite happy.

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,721
He has been eagerly awaiting
the red water for a long time.

00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:05,622
I understand how he could be exhausted,
seeing as how he was king for so long.

00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:09,605
These are the locations of the
guardian gods who have the god stones.

00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:12,870
These coordinates will lead you to them.

00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,144
Lord Habaek.

00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,206
Moo Ra will be the god
from Water Country

00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,026
and Joo Dong will be the god
from Earth Country.

00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,336
- Who is the god from Sky Country?
- Lord Bi Ryeom.

00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,670
Bi Ryeom?

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,355
We must have the coronation by the
seventh time the red water flows

00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:44,345
so all you have to do is get the
god stones and return before then.

00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,423
I will return immediately.

00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:49,791
Why, my lord? The  is
far more interesting than you'd think.

00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,545
You will have quite a lot of time
before the seventh red tide

00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,156
so enjoy yourself while you are there.

00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,353
I have no interest in that.

00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:02,531
Also, why do such archaic and
meaningless formalities still exist?

00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:08,620
There is no such thing as a
meaningless thing in this world.

00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:13,708
At any rate, the first thing
I will do as king

00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,413
is get rid of these archaic
and meaningless rituals.

00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:20,442
Yes, go ahead and do that
when you become king.

00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:24,122
It sounds like you're implying that
I may not be able to become the king.

00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,526
Of course not, my lord.

00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:28,896
You were fated to become king
from the moment you were born.

00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:33,184
You'd become king even if you
lay still and did nothing.

00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:37,107
How could that possibly happen
unless your fate were twisted?

00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,622
What relevance does becoming the emperor
of the Realm of the Gods have with humans

00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,805
that the god stones
are kept in their realm?

00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:44,060
What a nuisance.

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,387
Oh ho.

00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,204
Since you've asked that question...

00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:52,019
you may linger there and
find the answer for yourself.

00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,728
It isn't a question.

00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,656
Oh, you've heard of the
gods' servants, haven't you?

00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:03,057
The humans who have promised
to become the gods' servants

00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:04,571
generation after generation?

00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:08,011
If you get into a tricky situation,
seek out a descendant from this family.

00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,071
All you need to do is show them this

00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:15,547
and exchange a few words with them
for them to accept you as a god.

00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:18,423
I do not need it,
since I won't be seeking them out.

00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:23,951
It is a woman.

00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,721
Shall I show you her face?

00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,764
She's not from the Shin family.

00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:29,175
No thanks.

00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,971
Nam Soo Ri will be serving you.

00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,657
It may be difficult, but please
keep that with you at all times.

00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:38,164
And don't just leave it
in your clothes somewhere!

00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,562
Sky Country is doomed.

00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,922
They've sent Bi Ryeom as
the guardian god of the skies.

00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,979
There's no way he'll carry
out his duties properly.

00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,895
Why do you hate
Lord Bi Ryeom so much, sir?

00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,495
You were so close as children.

00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,013
He has no decorum.

00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:56,144
And... he's not trustworthy.

00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,566
You'll have to study up on the
human world before you go, sir.

00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,559
That's precisely why
I'm bring you with me.

00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,302
I heard that you've
been to the human world.

00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,635
Well, yes. I do know everything
there is to know about that place.

00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:09,563
You'll feel a bit of a shock when
you pass through the Gate of the Gods.

00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,068
It can actually be kind of addictive.

00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:15,918
Prepare the finest human clothing for me.
And a present for Moo Ra, too.

00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,881
Have you seen your servant's face?

00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,102
I heard that it's a woman.

00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,408
Is she pretty?

00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,841
<i>Yes, I see.</i>

00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:29,775
Aliens from the planet Intro-Q2544
delivered a divine message to me.

00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:34,158
My leader is TF1004, but this
seemed to be quite an urgent matter.

00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,269
I see. Anything else?

00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,940
On Earth, there are Earth Partners like
me who carry out these divine messages.

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,847
There are people who belong to
our organization all over the world.

00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:45,332
But the strange thing is...

00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:52,047
why did they deliver this message to me,
instead of a partner in the States?

00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,094
That's what baffles me.

00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:56,193
Yes, I wonder why
it was delivered to you.

00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:04,578
Oh, "Tell Obama that
world peace is at risk."

00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,144
That's what this means, huh?

00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:09,056
Doctor, are you...

00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:15,091
What should I do,
since I don't know his address?

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,158
Do you know about the thing that
came out of the White House?

00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,432
You don't believe me either,
do you, Doctor?

00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:38,886
No, of course not. Patient--

00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:41,078
Patient? Did you just call me a patient?

00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:46,495
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,655
Hey!

00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:50,239
- Patient!
- Who's a patient here, huh?

00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,659
Um, Ma Bong Yeol.

00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll try to find Obama's address
in any way I can, so--

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,863
Goodness!

00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,666
Stop lying when you
don't even believe me!

00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:03,996
Oh... Doctor. Doctor!
Nobody will believe me!

00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,869
- World peace is at risk, here!
- Stop it!

00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,190
Sir, sir!

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,458
Please let go of her before
you continue speaking!

00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,725
It's true that world peace is at risk.

00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:21,631
You... understand our language?

00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,883
Of course. Nice to meet you.

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,864
Oh, it's nice to meet you!

00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:31,539
All right, let's go. Let's go.

00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:34,102
Let's go.

00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,049
How did you learn his language?

00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,424
I did some research.

00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:46,216
His language has a rough system,
just like the alphabet.

00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:48,024
Bong Yeol is quite
intelligent, after all.

00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,767
He's better off than me.

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,592
His guardian wanted to
have him checked in here, right?

00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,861
I can't do it. Schedule
another appointment with him.

00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,312
How could you give up so easily, Doctor?

00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,798
Give up easily?

00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,250
Hey, I've been seeing him for a year now.

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,666
You think it's easy
for me to admit defeat?

00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,090
Am I supposed to hold on to him
just because of my pride?

00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,806
I'm worn out, too.

00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,818
Yes, Doctor.

00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,965
Here's half of the notices
to you from the banks.

00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,938
The bank said that they can't
extend your payment due date

00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,163
and they want you to
come in tomorrow.

00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:21,363
What?

00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:22,832
Why not?

00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,785
Well, the psychiatric hospital
isn't doing too well

00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,033
and you haven't been
paying the interest on time.

00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,125
Are they telling me to
shut down my practice, then?

00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,655
That's what it sounds like to me.

00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,671
Leave.

00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,775
Give me your coat.
I'll wash it for you by tomorrow.

00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:35,846
No thanks.

00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:38,873
Want me to have a drink with you?

00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,770
Why would I have a drink with you?

00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:46,581
Oh yeah, you forgot this before.
It's for your land in Gangwon-do.

00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,147
<i>[Land Tax Notice]
[Taxpayer name: Yoon So Ah]</i>

00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,211
You still haven't sold that land yet?

00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,910
Who'd buy a useless field of gravel?

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,351
Why did they have to leave me
things like this behind?

00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:05,225
The hospital is behind on
a lot of its bills, too.

00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,602
I'm sure you've lost half of
the security deposit already.

00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,823
So why are you sticking by my side?

00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,005
Just leave!

00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,269
Well, I'm trying to
repay my debts, of course!

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:14,961
- After all, you--
- That's enough!

00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,803
I don't want to hear it.

00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:27,552
Is that still your dream, Doctor?

00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,057
- To leave Korea?
- Yeah.

00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:33,376
As soon as my debts are repaid,
I'm going to go live in Vanuatu.

00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,115
Just get yourself a man who
will take care of your debts for you.

00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,739
And just live here.

00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:40,475
No, I don't want to. I hate Korea.

00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:44,464
Are you sure that it's
not just men that hate you?

00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:49,238
Hey. I even once got a diamond ring
from a second-generation heir!

00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,549
Oh, I found it!

00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,778
Geez, why won't he believe me?
I definitely got one!

00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,688
You were still here so that you could
become mine eventually, huh?

00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:15,763
Also, what kind of name is An Bin?

00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,078
How childish.

00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:21,224
Take care of my bills and the
interest on my loans, okay?

00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,196
Vanuatu, my love.

00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:56,390
<i>Now that's what I call living life.</i>

00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:08,020
I can't even see a single star properly
in this disgusting country, ugh.

00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:19,480
Please, please let me get tons of money!

00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,575
Hey, woman.

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,688
Woman!

00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:13,403
I will grant you the honor of allowing
you to lend this to me for a bit.

00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:40,857
Hey, woman.

00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,145
Wake up!

00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,900
You shouldn't be sleeping here, right?

00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:52,115
What a bothersome woman.

00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:03,846
What happened?

00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,376
What's going on?

00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,377
Ow.

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,849
Oh... ow!

00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh man.

00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,220
Huh?

00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:51,457
You damned thief!

00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:57,317
"Thief"? Why, that insolent woman!

00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:04,387
I'll see you next time.

00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,065
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:15,108
<i>Nam Soo Ri.
Where did Nam Soo Ri go?</i>

00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,122
Lord Habaek! Lord Habaek!

00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,488
You're safe!

00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,607
What happened?

00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,592
I don't know. I fell over there.

00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,477
Why do you look like this, sir?

00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:29,298
And why are you wearing my clothes?

00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,601
Pardon?

00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:34,526
Oh... what's going on?

00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,680
Trade outfits with me.

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,604
This is strange.

00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:45,203
The location of the Gate of the Gods
is different than last time.

00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:46,567
Take a good look around.

00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,824
I heard that this place can change
a lot, even in 10 years' time.

00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:53,798
No, the land used as the
Gate of the Gods never changes.

00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:58,203
Then something must have gone wrong
while we were on our way here.

00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,670
Where are the coordinates?

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,603
What? You don't have them?

00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,512
Oh no!

00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:15,972
Oh dear! Geez!

00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,755
Use your divine powers to find them.

00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,137
Did you find them, my lord?

00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,785
What's wrong?

00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,294
It's strange.

00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,791
It feels as if...

00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:44,285
something seeped out of my body.

00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,343
How could this have happened?

00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,157
How could you have lost
your divine powers?

00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,805
First, let's return to Water Country.

00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,147
Take me to another gate.

00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,213
I can't, my lord.

00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:21,194
A god who comes here can only return
once he finishes his duties.

00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:23,030
I told you to study up...

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,421
First, let's look for the
descendant of the god's servant.

00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:27,410
It's times like these
when we need their help.

00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:38,159
You don't have it?

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,445
Oh no! What are we going to do?

00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,836
I'll look for some clothes
to change into first.

00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,894
- I'm all right.
- Well, I'm not.

00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,101
Don't go anywhere. Stay here.

00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:02,261
You can't just act haughty and confident
and give commands to just anyone, okay?

00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,363
All right.

00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:07,026
Oh, damn it!

00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:16,284
No, there's no way.

00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,223
<i>I'm sure that this is only temporary.</i>

00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:27,737
<i>I couldn't do as I wished when I
first went to Sky Country, either.</i>

00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:55,624
So how close are you, exactly?

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,423
How many times do I have to tell you?
I had my diamond ring stolen!

00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,392
I'm not drunk, okay?

00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,332
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:07,958
Why did I come to the park?

00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:14,324
I told you, I came here
to find my diamond ring.

00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,617
What? Delusional?

00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,019
Hey.

00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,333
Where are you now?

00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,519
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,122
Just answer my question, okay?

00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:30,156
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,083
Where are you, you idiot?

00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,680
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,296
- Where?
- <i>I am Habaek!</i>

00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,852
That surprised me.

00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:02,554
<i>See, I told you that I'm Habaek.</i>

00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:11,875
Yeah, it's working fine.

00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,060
There aren't any issues with it.

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,863
Turn it off for now. Let's try turning
it on and off two more times or so.

00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:36,364
<i>It's that woman.</i>

00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,567
<i>What's going on?
Is he walking toward me?</i>

00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,295
<i>Do I know him?</i>

00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,513
<i>No, I don't know him.</i>

00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:09,182
Woman.

00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,007
You were mistaken.

00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:13,660
I just borrowed it
for a bit, is all.

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,832
Pardon?

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,515
Are you talking to me?

00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:21,242
If you tell me your name and residence,
I will have Nam Soo Ri compensate you.

00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,775
What is it that you need?

00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:28,872
<i>Mental illness can strike anyone
regardless of their appearance, huh?</i>

00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:33,615
Your family must be quite
worried about you, so go home.

00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:34,858
Don't decline. Just tell me.

00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:36,161
It's all right.

00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:38,247
You dare defy me?

00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,402
I told you to tell me, not to leave!

00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:42,777
<i>Damn it all.</i>

00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:56,633
<i>Maybe he's delusional?</i>

00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,513
I asked you what you needed.

00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:06,464
Money?

00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:09,523
Money?

00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:12,791
Money?

00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,632
What is that?

00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,170
It's fine.

00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,406
Please go home soon. Goodbye.

00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,773
- Let go of me!
- Your name and place of residence.

00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,932
I'll report you if you don't let go!

00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:30,603
- I said let go!
- Doctor!

00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:32,612
What are you doing?
I said let go! Ow!

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,353
- Ow!
- Whoa, let go, sir!

00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:36,595
Don't be like this, sir!

00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:39,176
How dare you defy me,
and then do this?

00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,855
What's wrong with your forehead?

00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,727
Did you hit her?

00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:43,973
No. Let's go.

00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:47,229
I am the god of the water,
to-be king of Water Country

00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,136
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods!

00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,016
I am Habaek.

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,295
I am the god of the water,
to-be king of Water Country

00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,353
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods!

00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,290
I am Habaek.

00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,644
I knew it.

00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,451
He has delusions of grandeur.

00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:23,994
Here.

00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:27,589
Our clinic isn't too far,
so stop by sometime.

00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,506
Our doctor is great at treating patients.

00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:31,865
Be sure to come by!

00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,172
<i>[Nurse Yoo Sang Yoo]</i>

00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:45,835
You know that your life's calling
was to be a psychiatrist, right?

00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,691
People who need your help are
always finding you, day or night.

00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,123
Shut it.

00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:53,255
I bet you'll only meet people like that
at "Banana Boat" or wherever, too.

00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,119
It'd be better for you not to go.

00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,280
Still, isn't Korea better--

00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,682
Where's the closest police station?

00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,575
Why? Are you going to report him?

00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,056
- Yeah.
- Take the high road. He's ill.

00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,025
I'm going to file a report
for my diamond ring.

00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:07,558
Are you still drunk?

00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,811
They said they'll give you
a call after investigating.

00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:12,868
Are you mad?

00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,042
I feel like they don't believe me!

00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:20,117
Okay, let's say you did bury a diamond
ring under a tree many years ago.

00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:22,137
But you also said that
a shooting star stopped

00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:23,590
and went back and forth three times!

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,064
And then a robber fell from the sky
and stole the ring from you?

00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,099
And yet, they left your wallet behind?

00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,468
I'm telling you, it's the truth!

00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:32,761
Do you want a glass of cold water?

00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:34,290
Oh wait, she doesn't like cold water.

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,732
How about some hot water, then?

00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,227
Where were you?

00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:46,053
I was collecting information from humans
and finding lodgings for tonight.

00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,781
Let us go. I've found us an
adequate place for tonight.

00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,471
- It's close to the water, too.
- There's no need.

00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:52,346
- My powers came back.
- Really?

00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:57,050
This water behind me heeded
my command and shot upward.

00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,630
I knew it.

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,770
All right, then.
Please make that into gold.

00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:23,711
This is the closest place to water,
so I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.

00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:24,955
Here we are.

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,217
I already blew it up,
so it's too late.

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,654
A human male gave this to me
and told me to visit.

00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,164
You spoke with humans?

00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:39,915
Oh, I told you not to
say anything to them.

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,111
Happy Psychiatric Clinic,
Nurse Yoo Sang Yoo?

00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,041
What?

00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,086
Oh, I was just reading this.

00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:52,502
You don't know how to read
the human language, do you?

00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,231
Sleep well, my lord.
I will keep watch over you all night.

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,559
As for the coordinates,
I'll continue searching once day breaks.

00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:18,872
<i>Pretty much anything in the
human world can be solved with money.</i>

00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:20,355
I asked you what you need.

00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:22,580
Money?

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,250
It's not "money,"
but "mo-ney," you idiot.

00:30:51,397 --> 00:30:53,886
<i>There was a call
from Happy Bank, too.</i>

00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,492
Did you borrow money from there, too?

00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:57,178
I wasn't the one
who took out that loan.

00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,288
Yeah.

00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,817
I wouldn't have been able to take care
of this just by selling a diamond ring.

00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,515
Money?

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,761
What is that?

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,141
Yeah, his mind must be at ease.

00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:27,637
That's all you need in life.

00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:54,909
Let us talk while taking
a walk around the resort.

00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,454
You start, Food and Beverage Team.

00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:59,446
We have 300 Chinese guests here today
for the construction of a harbor.

00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:01,820
A Chinese heir named
Li Woi will be here.

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,202
Please go, CEO, and--

00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:05,328
No need for me to go,
since this isn't an official state visit.

00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:06,693
What about you,
Business Strategy Team?

00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:07,714
Yes, sir.

00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:09,301
This is a proposal from
Block Company from England

00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:10,714
for the construction of Block World.

00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:13,897
There haven't been any changes
to the land we inspected before.

00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:17,080
It's not bad, as long as
the issue with the land is settled.

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,286
I'll take a look at it.

00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,015
Is your report about
the bank, Intel Team?

00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:23,910
Yes, there is a bank that says they will
lower their interest for several loans.

00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,760
And they wish to have
a meal with you, CEO.

00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,711
Must I really go?

00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,729
I think it'd be good for you
to meet them once, sir.

00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,059
<i>Scientists have succeeded in detecting
a second wave of gravitational forces.</i>

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,006
<i>There may be a third or fourth wave
of gravitational forces coming at us</i>

00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,419
<i>at this very moment.</i>

00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,934
<i>The time-space continuum in Seoul
may have shifted without us knowing.</i>

00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:50,513
<i>Today on "Fascinating Science,"
we'll talk about gravitational forces.</i>

00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:52,913
You're here, Doctor?

00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,444
No calls from the police station?

00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:55,467
None.

00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:59,413
They say that the time-space continuum
in Seoul may have shifted yesterday.

00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:02,724
Do you think that's when the
diamond ring disappeared?

00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,138
I went to Dongdaemun Market
early this morning to buy it.

00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,378
Just wear that for now.

00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,682
You should've just gotten some sleep.

00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:31,090
A doctor's coat is so
important to a doctor.

00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:33,530
- Don't you feel sick?
- I didn't get drunk.

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,531
What about breakfast?

00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:35,984
Again with your nagging.

00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,538
There's nothing for you
to eat at home, right?

00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:39,490
I'll have to go make
some side dishes for you.

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,523
Do you have a death wish?

00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,628
Someone rear-ended
your car last month, right?

00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:43,884
Named Park Sang Chul.

00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:44,990
They called again.

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,882
I already took care of things
with my insurance company.

00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:49,740
I don't know. They said they'd come
to meet you, then said never mind.

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,125
It's so confusing.

00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,186
When are you going to go to the bank?

00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:55,827
You won't be able to solve this
by pushing it aside it for later.

00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:56,925
I know that.

00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,954
Are there any appointments this morning?

00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,310
Of course not.

00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,201
You don't have any in the afternoon
either, so go whenever you want to.

00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:15,532
You delayed payment on your
loan's interest many times.

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,030
And you haven't taken care of
your credit at all, Customer.

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,659
Your income for last month
was far too low.

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,103
Please look this over one more time.

00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,820
I always paid my taxes properly.

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,835
I'm only going through
difficulties for the time being.

00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,184
So many people go to
psychiatric hospitals now.

00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:38,217
Then... we can start charging you
only seven percent interest

00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,271
after you repay the first loan

00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:44,010
but... I'm not sure if the
Examination Division will accept this.

00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,583
Seven percent?

00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,797
How can it go up from
four to seven percent?

00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:54,666
Please look into this for me, then.

00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,563
Where did that guy go now?

00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,987
<i>[Happy Psychiatric Clinic]</i>

00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,748
<i>[June 24, 2017, 2:10 p.m.]</i>

00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,161
Gosh, why is it taking so long?

00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:32,643
Excuse me! Excuse me? Excuse me...

00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:46,391
How much longer will it take? I have
a patient waiting for me at the hospital.

00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,856
Please wait a little bit longer.

00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,090
Oh my, what do I do? What do I do?

00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:01,969
President, did you enjoy your lunch?

00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:06,445
Would you like a cup of
Ethiopian hand drip coffee?

00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:09,804
If you borrow money from our bank,
we'll offer an interest of one percent...

00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:12,476
What? One percent?

00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,789
Excuse me.

00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:20,856
- I told you to wait!
- For how much longer?

00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,925
All I've done is wait
since early this morning.

00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:26,920
All I want is an extension on my loan.

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,380
Is it really that hard to do?

00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,045
Why are you going all over the place
with my personal information?

00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:39,271
How about... how about you wait outside?

00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:40,943
I'm not waiting!

00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:44,190
And why do I get seven percent
when he gets one percent?

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,152
- Why are you discriminating?
- Well, that's because--

00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:50,858
I know. I get it. But this is too much!

00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,675
The difference between seven
and one percent is too much!

00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:55,353
Please help her first.

00:36:55,353 --> 00:36:58,885
We'll continue our talk
through my finance team later.

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,458
Wait, President. Don't go...

00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:06,137
Apologize to the president!

00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,322
What did you say?

00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:11,614
He's upset because
of you rudely butting in!

00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:15,235
I don't agree with that.

00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,347
It's your fault for exposing
my interest rates to another client.

00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:21,976
- I think you should apologize.
- Pardon?

00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:24,985
I'll make a request to the bank
so you can get the loan that you want.

00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,706
Why would you do that?

00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,666
It was simply out of
the kindness of my heart.

00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,681
Then stop harassing the employees
about the interest rates

00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:37,411
and work harder to make more money.

00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:49,460
Please visit our clinic. Please visit...

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,501
Please visit...

00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,210
Hey, wait! Stop!

00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:01,155
Why did you wipe off the bird crap
with our business card?

00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:05,556
I mean, why?

00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:09,150
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,025
- What happened?
- Why did you wipe it with our card?

00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,003
Don't do this.

00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:20,257
If you contact me separately,
I'll resolve it.

00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:24,172
This business card is our face,
and you wiped bird crap with it!

00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:26,536
- Stop, let's just go.
- I mean...

00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:30,849
What are these wipers for?
They're here to clean your windshield!

00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,079
If your car is big,
is that all that matters?

00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:39,806
I'm sorry...

00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,755
Psychiatric clinic?

00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,748
I'll contact you after I get a quote.

00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:05,847
Sir!

00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:11,061
What about the coordinates?
Did you find them?

00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:15,474
No, I think I lost them
on the streets earlier today.

00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:16,905
On the streets?

00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:19,773
Then there's no hope of finding them.

00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:24,333
I guess not. But why did you come out
when I told you to stay home?

00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:27,684
Home?

00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:35,630
I noticed you sleeping well last night.
I thought you were going to stand guard.

00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,228
I couldn't help it because
I was sleepy and hungry.

00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:41,172
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:44,443
Newbies like me get hungry,
just like a human.

00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,742
I'm sure a god like yourself
can't understand.

00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:50,146
Do I... have to continue
listening to that?

00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,724
No.

00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,246
Are you really hungry?

00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:59,378
I am.

00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:03,164
I'm sorry.

00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:06,628
This is all because I lost my powers.

00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:10,121
I can't even take care of
a devoted servant like you

00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,527
so I don't know how I can ever
be a good king in the future.

00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:15,641
Excuse me? No, that's not true!

00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:18,469
Did you really
expect me to tell you that?

00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:23,188
- No.
- But what is that used for?

00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:28,599
Oh, that is...

00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,190
It's not food...

00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:39,126
- Let's go there.
- Pardon? Where?

00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:42,724
The land of the Gate of the Gods.
It's protected by my servant's descendant

00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:45,280
so if we go there,
we'll know where to go.

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,858
Pardon? Are you going
to meet the descendant?

00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:51,925
Giving my servant an
opportunity to fulfill a mission...

00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:56,128
As a god, it's my generosity and my duty.

00:40:56,128 --> 00:41:01,293
What do we do?
Don't those wipers cost millions of won?

00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,157
I might have to move out
of my one-room apartment.

00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:07,228
Then why did you go
into a raging fit like that?

00:41:07,228 --> 00:41:10,324
Because he wiped bird crap
with our precious business card.

00:41:10,324 --> 00:41:13,052
I didn't know you were so devoted.

00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,708
But why did it have to be his car?

00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:25,813
Are you calling Secretary Min?
Ask him for a discount.

00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:28,021
I'm not calling him.

00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:38,981
Gosh, why isn't the real estate agent
answering his phone again?

00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:47,150
- I'm going to Gangwon-do.
- Right now?

00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,494
If you're taking the expressway,
change your tires.

00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:53,440
And the oil for your brakes,
and your navigation...

00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:58,342
Wipers...

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,001
Gosh, why isn't it working?

00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,887
Don't act like a used navigator, okay?

00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,371
There.

00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:41,090
Did you say you're going
to Chungbong Village?

00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,315
Go straight that way. All the way down.

00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:48,378
And when you feel
that it's right, turn left.

00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:52,726
Then go straight, and when you
feel like it's right, turn right.

00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:56,353
If you do that, you'll see it.
Do you understand?

00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:09,282
What did that human just say?

00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:11,780
Oh, he said we're close.

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,210
Don't worry. I've been here
multiple times already.

00:43:20,954 --> 00:43:23,380
I didn't get a call
from anyone for five years.

00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,224
That's why I made a request last time.

00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:29,099
I asked you to post some advertisements
and take extra care of it.

00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,297
Geez, I got it. I got it.

00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:36,728
I came here today to lower
the price for an urgent sale.

00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:41,128
No matter how cheap it is,
who will buy that useless piece of land?

00:43:41,128 --> 00:43:46,255
Sir, you're not wrong, but you shouldn't
say that in front of the land owner.

00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:49,947
Fine, are you going to
sell it for half the price?

00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:51,460
Half...

00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:02,608
We were supposed to enter through
that gate. Humans can't see it.

00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:05,626
It looks quite shabby
for the Gate of the Gods.

00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:08,637
But the descendant of your servant
doesn't know anything. What will we do?

00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:11,974
We need to give her the crest
we lost to wake her up naturally.

00:44:11,974 --> 00:44:14,840
Don't worry. There are other ways.

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,929
Like what?

00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,717
She'll fall for my charms.

00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:21,434
There's no way she won't listen to me.

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,942
And if that woman doesn't fall for it,
I'll use my last resort.

00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:29,610
And what's that?

00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:33,793
Pardon? No, not that, sir.

00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:36,416
- Why not?
- That mustn't be used.

00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:38,996
We can recover the crest
when we go back.

00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:41,402
That way, she'll forget everything.

00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:43,427
But not if you use that method.

00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:47,302
That... will be too difficult
for a human to handle.

00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:50,197
Ever since last night,
until this very moment...

00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:52,518
you've continued to display foolish acts

00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:56,922
so what is this foolish thing
you're saying now?

00:44:56,922 --> 00:45:00,724
And, above all else,
you lost your powers.

00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:03,525
- So will it work?
- Why does it matter?

00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:05,695
If I don't have powers, am I not a god?

00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,481
Then, why don't you act as my master?

00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:13,440
How could you say that?
I didn't mean it like that.

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,043
Excuse me!

00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,594
Excuse me, why are you here?

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,851
This is my land.

00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:44,831
<i>It was you.</i>

00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,422
Let go! Don't do this!

00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,722
I am the god of the water,
to-be king of Water Country

00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:52,983
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods!

00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:56,123
I am Habaek.

00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:58,150
<i>Why is he here?</i>

00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,742
- Are you the land owner?
- Yes, I am.

00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:06,222
- Are you thinking of buying it?
- Why would I buy my own land?

00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,445
Pardon?

00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:27,925
I've looked for you for a
very long time, my servant.

00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:30,920
It's so very nice to meet you like this.

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,393
Be deeply touched...

00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:37,434
that I'm happy to see you.

00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,420
- What the heck are you doing?
- How dare you?

00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,047
<i>Don't you realize you were
destined to be a psychiatrist?</i>

00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:54,722
<i>People who need your help
are always finding you.</i>

00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:58,255
I need to see Yeom Mi.
I think it's time to see Yeom Mi.

00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,880
Sir.

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,012
I wish you'd give me a signal
before you did anything.

00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,833
Hey, Yeom Mi! Do you have time tonight?

00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,530
No, you need to make time.
Let's meet tonight.

00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:17,704
I'm in Gangwon-do right now. Oh my gosh!

00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,684
<i>What? What happened?</i>

00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:24,762
Hey, I'll call you back later.

00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:30,523
Are you all right? Let me see.

00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:33,590
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,840
I don't think I'm okay.

00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,445
I'm not fine.

00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:53,338
<i>Please enter the road
in the three o'clock direction.</i>

00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,670
I'll drop you off at a nearby hospital.

00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,425
Let's call the insurance company there.

00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:01,699
No, I will follow you
wherever you're going.

00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:06,150
Excuse me, if he's hurt,
how will he make it to Seoul?

00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,639
And why are you being informal?

00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:11,523
I don't know what you mean,
but wake up so you can understand.

00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:14,351
Everything will be easier
once you understand.

00:48:15,155 --> 00:48:16,657
<i>What did he say?</i>

00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:20,731
Excuse me, is there a hospital
you visit regularly?

00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,708
If not, come to our hospital...
What am I saying?

00:48:25,907 --> 00:48:27,603
Excuse me.

00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:30,128
I'm a doctor, and your friend--

00:48:30,128 --> 00:48:32,623
He's not my friend. He's my servant.

00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,409
Then, your servant...

00:48:35,972 --> 00:48:38,768
No, this man...

00:48:38,768 --> 00:48:41,248
is completely fine in my opinion.

00:48:41,248 --> 00:48:44,119
I'm just driving you because
I hit him, so let's cooperate.

00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,579
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:52,539
This isn't the road I took earlier.

00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:01,159
<i>Please turn right.</i>

00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,934
I don't see a road to my right.

00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,753
<i>Please go straight.</i>

00:49:13,753 --> 00:49:16,907
It feels like we're driving
into the mountains.

00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:22,487
<i>Please turn right.</i>

00:49:23,556 --> 00:49:26,257
<i>Please turn left.</i>

00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:29,554
<i>Please drive straight.</i>

00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:32,119
<i>Please make a U-turn.</i>

00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:48,396
<i>Please enter the road
in the 11 o'clock direction.</i>

00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:51,523
- I'm going crazy.
<i>- Please be careful of the curb.</i>

00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:56,103
<i>Please go straight
in the 12 o'clock direction.</i>

00:49:56,103 --> 00:49:58,724
- The road is blocked!
<i>- Please go straight.</i>

00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:01,927
- Where am I supposed to go?
<i>- Please go straight.</i>

00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:03,704
<i>Please drive safely.</i>

00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,619
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:16,735
What... should I do to help?

00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,697
- Nothing.
- Should I drive?

00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:23,777
Do you have a driver's license?

00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:25,407
What's that?

00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,079
No.

00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:37,186
Doctors don't let their
patients drive the car.

00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:54,358
<i>Please turn right.</i>

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,965
No!

00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:24,398
What's the matter?

00:51:24,398 --> 00:51:26,927
This? Her car stopped
because she ran out of gas.

00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:29,119
Then give her some gas.

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,498
How?

00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,077
Lend me your cell phone.

00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:43,963
A cell phone. Don't you have one?

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,005
Fine, let's walk.
I'm sure we'll run into someone.

00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:58,907
We'll borrow a phone and call
the insurance company or buy gas.

00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:03,061
I don't know what you're saying,
but get some rest.

00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:06,521
- Pardon?
- You're tired. Get some rest.

00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:08,172
Nam Soo Ri will go by himself.

00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:11,487
But, he's hurt.

00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:13,664
- That's right, I'm hurt.
- No, you're not.

00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:16,771
I don't think I'm hurt. I'm not hurt.

00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:18,253
Go.

00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:22,956
No, it'll be quicker if I go.

00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:26,010
Oh my! Wait, excuse me!

00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,492
I don't even know where anything is.

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,139
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:41,465
This is my license plate number
and insurance policy number.

00:52:41,465 --> 00:52:45,545
And this is money for gas... Hold on.

00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,579
This.

00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:52,478
I almost forgot.

00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,911
Okay.

00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,922
Why...

00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,402
am I so unlucky today?

00:54:57,322 --> 00:54:58,782
Excuse me!

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,157
Wait in the car.

00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:16,282
I'm fine out here, so get some rest.

00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:19,460
My name is Habaek, not "Excuse me."

00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,467
I am the god of water,
to-be king of Water Country

00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,481
and to-be emperor of
the Realm of the Gods.

00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:27,030
And I'm your owner...

00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,893
Habaek.

00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,101
<i>Gosh, I keep forgetting he's a patient.</i>

00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:40,222
Excuse me, Patient...

00:55:40,222 --> 00:55:41,813
I mean, Habaek.

00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:45,170
Why do you think you're the water god?

00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,945
What kind of question is that?
Then what about you?

00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,746
Why do you think of yourself as human?

00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,128
Fine.

00:55:58,128 --> 00:56:02,262
Then, what is the god of water?

00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:04,646
What are you trying to do with me?

00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,443
As a human, do you want me
to teach you a lesson?

00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:15,103
It seems like you want to talk about
the principles of the world.

00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,360
Listen well.

00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,329
The god of water, the god of the sky,
and the god of earth.

00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:23,224
We're... nature.

00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:24,824
I'm...

00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:28,456
nature.

00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,590
- A natural person?
- I'm nature.

00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,266
A natural person?

00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,652
I'm nature, and on top of that...

00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:40,521
I'm the most natural of nature.

00:56:56,485 --> 00:56:59,929
He looks totally normal on the outside.

00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,255
Stop glancing over.

00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,494
I can see it with my eyes closed.

00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:10,197
I'm very used to getting looks like that.

00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:14,056
<i>Yes, I'm sure you are.</i>

00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,938
Do you... have a family?

00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:23,045
I could say I do,
and I could say I don't.

00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:26,344
We don't have the same family
relations that humans have.

00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:29,927
- Then who was that friend--
- I told you, he's my servant.

00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:32,699
He's like you. Nam Soo Ri is
my servant in the Realm of the Gods

00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,246
and you're my servant in the human world.

00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:40,039
- Look here, Servant.
- Yes?

00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,023
- Excuse me!
- It's Habaek!

00:57:47,603 --> 00:57:52,090
Do you really need money
more than anything else?

00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,130
Why?

00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,909
Why do humans need money so badly?

00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,331
Because money means happiness.

00:58:03,902 --> 00:58:08,378
- For you too?
- Yes, why do you ask?

00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:12,429
I... think I can do that for you.

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,398
Not right away,
because of my current circumstances.

00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:23,434
<i>Why do I keep falling for it?</i>

00:58:25,123 --> 00:58:26,862
Hey, Servant.

00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:31,130
If you need money
more than anything else

00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,253
because money will make you happy

00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:37,592
that means what you need is happiness.

00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:42,621
What do you really know about me?

00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:46,302
However, I have no interest
in the happiness of humans

00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:48,773
so I'll reward you with money.

00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,958
I think we should help him.

00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:05,547
- Are we going the right way?
- No.

00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:07,599
It looks like we're lost.

00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:10,561
You're calmer than I expected.

00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,021
Of course.

00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:15,742
Right now, I'm your guardian.

00:59:15,742 --> 00:59:18,311
- My guardian?
- Yes.

00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:22,838
I might not look the part,
but I'm a doctor.

00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:28,905
I hope that subordinate or colleague
of yours went the right way.

00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,958
I don't think this is right.
We should go back.

00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:41,195
- That's what I wanted to say.
- Excuse me, I'll take the lead.

00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:42,987
Hey, Servant!

00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:51,755
This is my last warning.
Listen carefully.

00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,585
I'm Habaek, not "Excuse me."

00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:57,246
I am the god of water,
to-be king of Water Country

00:59:57,246 --> 00:59:59,815
and to-be emperor
of the Realm of the Gods.

01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:01,858
Habaek.

01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,992
Then listen to me.

01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:16,266
My name is Yoon So Ah, not "Servant."

01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:20,909
And since I'm your guardian,
I'd like you to call me Doctor Yoon

01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:24,364
but if you don't like that,
call me Yoon So Ah.

01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:26,235
Do you understand?

01:00:26,235 --> 01:00:28,005
I see.

01:00:43,255 --> 01:00:45,304
- What?
- Run!

01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:38,233
Let's get in the car! Oh my!

01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:55,827
Let's get in the car! Oh my!

01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:10,242
The trunk!

01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,635
Why do we have to be quiet?

01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:48,260
I think it left.

01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,135
- How are you?
- I'm very uncomfortable.

01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,489
Pardon?

01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:59,481
Don't move. That's even
more uncomfortable.

01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:02,547
Okay.

01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:11,675
I think it left, so let's open it.

01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:23,579
What's... that?

01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:30,523
Oh my!

01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:36,853
That pig smiled at me!
That pig must be crazy!

01:04:14,657 --> 01:04:16,322
Habaek!

01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,521
- Can you move?
- I need to sit for a while.

01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,139
What happened?

01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:47,780
I was lost and ran into a hunter.

01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,454
Good thing he was here.

01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:53,989
- What about the hunter?
- He went after the pig.

01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,715
Are you hurt?

01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:14,858
Excuse me, I thought you couldn't drive.

01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:18,309
- I couldn't.
- Then, what's this?

01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:20,291
I'm good at it now.

01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,077
This is my first time.
But driving is quite fun.

01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:25,469
What?

01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,219
Then, do you really not have a license--

01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,356
What is this license that you speak of?

01:05:33,356 --> 01:05:36,007
Excuse me! Let me drive!

01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:37,577
Rest!

01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:41,599
I'm in the middle of gracing you
with a divine blessing.

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,018
This is also my generosity
and duty as a god.

01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:47,427
Excuse me!

01:05:49,637 --> 01:05:51,637
Don't worry too much.

01:05:51,637 --> 01:05:56,570
Habaek has abilities that
humans can't even imagine.

01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,992
I don't care, so stop the car!

01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,925
Stop the car!

01:06:26,925 --> 01:06:28,902
Is this where you live?

01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:38,757
- Did you trick me?
- Who tricked whom?

01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,585
Anyway, thank you for
what you did for me today.

01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,324
It happened a long time ago.

01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,684
A god made a promise with your
ancestor, whose name I don't know.

01:06:56,684 --> 01:07:00,550
He promised that your family
would forever live as my servants.

01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,677
It doesn't matter that
you didn't make the promise.

01:07:02,677 --> 01:07:05,505
If it's what the gods want,
as the descendant of my servant

01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:08,081
you must assist me as promised.

01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,780
Take me to your residence.

01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:15,409
No, the hospital will assist you.

01:07:15,409 --> 01:07:17,219
If you refuse,
it'll only get harder for you.

01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:20,699
It's hard enough as it is,
so I don't care.

01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:25,264
You were right. Happiness
might be what I need the most.

01:07:25,264 --> 01:07:27,617
Because I'm exhausted.

01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:31,947
So please... just go.

01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:34,840
I'm begging you.

01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:42,766
After explaining everything to you,
you haven't awakened.

01:07:42,766 --> 01:07:45,369
How slow-witted you are.

01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:47,126
Then I have no choice.

01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:52,284
Nam Soo Ri, I wasn't going to use
this method because of what you said

01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,815
but I have no choice.

01:07:54,815 --> 01:07:57,387
Habaek, but your powers--

01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:58,831
Hey, Servant!

01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:17,434
I'll grace you with a divine blessing

01:08:18,332 --> 01:08:20,056
so you may awaken.

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,000

01:09:25,711 --> 01:09:28,440
<i>Please... please save me.</i>

01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:33,774
- Are we leaving right away?
- Yes, my portrait was disrupted.

01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:38,484
I know. He just need to dot your eyes.
Why are you punishing him?

01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:42,662
Punishing him?

01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,315
When is Habaek coming back?

01:09:48,315 --> 01:09:51,079
I wish I had dotted his eyes
before he left!
