Sir, you were driving
erratically back there.

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm gonna be honest
with you, ok.

10
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,050
I kind of got swept up
in the music and...

11
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,820
You know, I got swept up.
I was swept. I got swept up.

12
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,989
Sir, step out of the car.

13
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,057
Have you ever performed
a field sobriety test?

14
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,392
What?

15
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,428
Just put one foot
in front of the other.

16
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:42,963
- Yeah.
- Heel-to-toe, for nine steps.

17
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,368
One foot and extend
your arms to the side.

18
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,504
Can you do that?

19
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,573
I'm sober!
I can't do it!

20
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,074
No shaking.

21
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:57,944
Look, this is not easy.

22
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:59,179
You can do it
'cause you've practiced.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
- Come with me.
- What?

24
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,015
Sir, you are clearly
intoxicated.

25
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,184
I'm not! I wasn't drinking.
I was just happy.

26
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:07,186
Is that the penalty
for being happy?

27
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,988
Oh, the head, the head,
the precious head.

28
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,890
Don't hurt the head.

29
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,276
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hey, Ben.

30
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,377
How are you, man?

31
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,379
What a fucked up morning I had.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,247
- Today? This morning?
- Yeah, this morning.

33
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,582
Unbelievable.

34
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,684
Hey, did you hear haney's
gonna use one of my ideas

35
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,085
in the big presentation today.

36
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:43,654
- Is that right?
- Yeah, how about that, huh?

37
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,389
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,023
Your mother must be
so proud of you.

39
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:50,726
- Well...
- "Ben got something in the presentation."

40
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:53,162
- "We're so proud of him."
- It's... yeah.

41
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:55,064
- "Did you hear?"
- I hope haney likes it.

42
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,965
Did you see? His son
is in the office today.

43
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,307
- Is that right?
- Yeah, Howard.

44
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,269
He named his son
after Howard roark

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,405
from ayn rand's the fountainhead.

46
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:04,640
- Howard roark.
- Oh, I never read it.

47
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,508
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the biggest asshole

48
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,577
in the history of literature,
and then you name your kid...

49
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,278
- Why would you do that?
- Oh Jesus.

50
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,847
- Are you all right down there?
- This just drives me crazy.

51
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:13,881
What?

52
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:15,383
I'm sick of these outlets

53
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,818
always on the floor.

54
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,953
Every time I try
and plug something in,

55
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:22,323
I have to move furniture,
and I strain my back.

56
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,525
Why can't outlets be up here?

57
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,927
- At eye level.
- Eye level?

58
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,395
What are they, like genitals?

59
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:29,996
We have to hide them?

60
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,465
Why are we hiding outlets?

61
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,367
- Think about it.
- Yeah. It's a...

62
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,968
- Oh. See you later.
- Ok.

63
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,403
Good to see you, boss.
Good luck today.

64
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,003
Hey. Ben, how are you?
Where you been?

65
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:41,040
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Chuckles]</font> I had a little
problem this morning.

66
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,543
- It's... crazy.
- Big day today.

67
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:45,177
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

68
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,912
Ok.

69
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,948
Is that new?

70
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,016
No. I've had it
for a while.

71
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,686
That's a plepler,
he paints shopping carts.

72
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:56,688
As a kid, I was fascinated
by shopping carts

73
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,710
because you get to drive
them in the supermarket.

74
00:03:58,792 --> 00:03:59,825
It's quite beautiful.

75
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,227
I can't believe I never
noticed that before.

76
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:04,029
Something about the shopping
cart I find mesmerizing.

77
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,564
Hey, look who's here!

78
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:08,500
Hi, buddy. How ya doing?
How are you doing?

79
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,101
You wanna meet Mr. flomm?

80
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,302
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,471
Nathan, this is my son, Howard.

82
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:15,439
- Hello.
- This is our nanny, marina.

83
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,775
Marina, this is Nathan flomm.

84
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,243
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

85
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:22,113
I like that, that swirl
you got on your hair there.

86
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:23,648
Thank you.
It takes a few hours.

87
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,616
Huh? It takes
a few hours.

88
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,617
What do you do
about the shampooing?

89
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,887
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Sighs]</font> Once a week.

90
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,289
- You shampoo once a week.
- Once a week when I do it.

91
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,192
You may wanna consider
going twice, you know.

92
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,661
That's a long time
to go without shampooing.

93
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:38,896
But this takes two hours.

94
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:40,664
Try a second shampoo.

95
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,665
Take a little tip, little tip.

96
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,766
He's a full-time job.

97
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,935
She's a very valuable member
of our family.

98
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,736
Wonderful caregiver.

99
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,038
Will you do me a favor
and take Howard out

100
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,739
to the front desk
and wait for me there.

101
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,308
You need to get in there.

102
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,642
I wanna say good-bye
before he goes to school.

103
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,577
I'm... every day.

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,379
Ok, buddy. Will you wait
for me out there?

105
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,579
- Ok.
- All right.

106
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,415
Bye. Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,350
Love you.

108
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,985
Isn't he cute?

109
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:06,721
She's shampooing once a week,
are you kidding me.

110
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,725
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Applause]</font>
- Congratulations to Andy matsin.

111
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,994
Good job. Also to mark
and his aerodynamics team

112
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,797
for perfecting the
exterior profile of the car

113
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,632
and reducing
the drag coefficient

114
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,135
to a very slippery 0.23.

115
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,305
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Applause]</font>
- Very good job, mark.

116
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:26,140
So I've answered all the
tough questions about the car.

117
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,575
Is it safer?
Is it more efficient?

118
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:31,211
Can it travel further
on a single charge

119
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:34,280
than any other production
electric vehicle out there?

120
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,483
Yes, yes, and yes.

121
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,886
So there's probably
one more question

122
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,255
that you all have.

123
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:44,523
What's the name?

124
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:48,126
What are we gonna call
this bold new vision?

125
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:51,529
It's a name that instantly
defines our product.

126
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,298
Ladies and gentlemen...

127
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,369
The Howard.

128
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,973
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Applause]</font>
- Brilliant.

129
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:05,176
- Are you kidding?
- Thank you very much.

130
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,880
The Howard? Honestly?
That's what we're calling this?

131
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,181
Yes.

132
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:13,384
I'm sorry. I got a real problem
with this name, man.

133
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,888
- Oh God, Nathan.
- Howard? You can't...

134
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,389
You can't call a car Howard.

135
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,691
Come on. Seriously.

136
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,560
I tell you what. Everybody,
let's reconvene in 15.

137
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,496
Nathan and I are gonna
have a quick discussion

138
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:29,366
about the marketing of this.
Let's move forward.

139
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,567
<font color="#F5DA81">- Nathan: </font> Do you like this name?
<font color="#F5DA81">- Man: </font> It's a great name.

140
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,036
Grab that door
on your way out. Hey.

141
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,907
All right.
Let me just say this, ok.

142
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,341
You brought me
into this company

143
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,709
for my marketing
expertise, correct?

144
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,511
- Yes.
- Ok.

145
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:45,381
I hate to toot my own horn,
but you know I was the brains

146
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,848
behind the edible arrangements,

147
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,651
1,030 percent growth
in three fiscal quarters.

148
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,387
- I'm aware.
- I'm not making that up.

149
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,821
Call Patrick lyons,
he'll tell you...

150
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:56,057
Nathan, I'm aware
of your success.

151
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,325
It's why we hired you.

152
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,693
Ok. You're making
it impossible

153
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,896
for me to market this car.
I can't do it.

154
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:03,798
Nobody's gonna buy a car
named Howard.

155
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,999
It's like naming
a restaurant hepatitis.

156
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,434
- It's a name.
- It's not a good name.

157
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,536
Call it a Dewey.
That's a good name.

158
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,771
- A Duncan. Call it Duncan.
- Nathan,

159
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:13,941
your job is to come up
with the marketing.

160
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,476
Marketers market.
Inventors invent.

161
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:17,777
It's a slam-dunk.

162
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,212
By the way, what happened
to the pee flap?

163
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,548
The pee flap...
Nathan, are you still

164
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,216
on this horrible idea,
the pee flap?

165
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,320
- I thought you were into it?
- It's an insane idea.

166
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:29,055
Everybody wants to pee
in their car.

167
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,756
Nobody wants to pee
in their car.

168
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:31,757
I wanna pee in my car.

169
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,159
You'd get pee
all over yourself.

170
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,094
No, the tube comes up
high enough

171
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,662
that it will catch everything.

172
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:39,464
Nathan, everybody's different.
How big is the tube?

173
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,132
You put your balls
and your penis in the tube

174
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,334
and that's that.

175
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:43,875
And you have
different size pee tubes

176
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,437
if you happen to have
big genitals.

177
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:46,938
What about the liability?

178
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,306
What happens if you hit a bump

179
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:49,941
with your dick
and balls in a tube

180
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,843
and you...
It chops it off?

181
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:54,478
So people sign a little waiver
or something. Big deal.

182
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,246
Nathan, it's a...
What do women do?

183
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:58,248
What do women do?
Half of our market?

184
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,352
All right. So women
don't have to use it.

185
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:04,421
You can't turn the interior
of a car into a urinal.

186
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:07,458
Bad idea.
The car is perfect.

187
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:09,860
I'm sure I could've worked
something out for women.

188
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:12,095
Nathan, your job is to sell it,

189
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,363
and if you can't do that job,

190
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,697
we're gonna find
somebody else that can.

191
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,299
You are invested
in this company.

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,434
You have ten percent
of this company.

193
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,371
You wanna walk away from that?

194
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:23,306
Are you offering me
my ten percent back?

195
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:26,608
I will happily give
you your ten percent back.

196
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,177
You have a deal.

197
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:30,778
You're making a huge mistake.

198
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,347
I think you're
making a mistake.

199
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,816
It's the worst decision
you've ever made in your life.

200
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,652
You made the worst
<font color="#F5DA81">decision: </font> Howard.

201
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,089
How beautiful is this?

202
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,457
I don't think that salmon
was wild, by the way.

203
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,626
- Did you see this?
- Oh my God, that's beautiful.

204
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:50,764
We have a rosewater-infused,
white chocolate souffle,

205
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,200
with an almond chutney.

206
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:56,570
And here we have the raspberry
and chocolate mousse

207
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,240
with a kola nut
and coco mousse in the center.

208
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:03,644
- Kola nut?
- Yes, kola nut. Enjoy.

209
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:06,980
I was... I was walking
down Castro street,

210
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,250
and this fat woman
is coming toward me

211
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,619
and she bumps me
with her stomach

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,287
and knocks me off the curb.

213
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,088
It was hilarious.

214
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,690
What is...
What did you do to her?

215
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,158
Are you ok?

216
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,526
Yeah, of course, I'm ok.
It was funny.

217
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,862
There was a cop, saw the whole
thing, he was laughing.

218
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,963
This city, what's happening
is disgusting.

219
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,766
These homeless people, the
hospitals are releasing them...

220
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,400
- It's so sad.
- They're in Mountain view now.

221
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,003
It's not sad.
It's a funny story.

222
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,873
- I just don't understand...
- You don't think that's funny?

223
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,675
A fat woman just hits
me off the road...

224
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,309
If you say fat again...

225
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,045
<font color="#F5DA81">Nathan: </font>
Oh, you can't say fat.

226
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,879
You can't say fat.

227
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,914
What is going on
with electron motors?

228
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,749
I'm very excited about
the electric car coming out.

229
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,751
Oh, my gosh.
You have no idea.

230
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,620
They doubled that battery life.
Did you know that?

231
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,190
- They have doubled that battery life.
- What?

232
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,192
- You're sitting on a fortune.
- That thing is gonna be huge.

233
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:58,228
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, well, there's a problem.

234
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,397
<font color="#F5DA81">Woman: </font>
With the car?

235
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:04,033
- I'm out of the company.
- What?

236
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:08,472
Yeah. There was a presentation
today and he revealed

237
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:12,141
that the name
of the car is Howard,

238
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:14,143
and I had
a big problem with that.

239
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:15,244
And he said,
"if you don't like it,

240
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:16,845
"you can sell back
your shares," and I did.

241
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,706
No, you didn't.
Please tell me you're joking.

242
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:19,881
No. I'm not joking.

243
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:21,550
Because he named his car
Howard? This is a joke?

244
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:24,620
You can't name a car Howard.
It's just not a name of a car.

245
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:28,490
Honey, enough about the name.
Let's get back to the shares.

246
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:33,328
You have to go back
and get your shares back.

247
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:36,897
I actually love
the name Howard.

248
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,501
I do. I was thinking
about the name last night.

249
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:42,337
Howard's a solid name.
Howard's a good guy.

250
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:45,372
There's a lot of good
Howards. They're average.

251
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:48,742
They're an average guy
doing average things.

252
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:50,410
And this is the campaign:

253
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,013
Solid, dependable, trustworthy,

254
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,381
that's our Howard.

255
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,318
The name that yesterday
you had nothing

256
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,953
but disparaging comments about.

257
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:03,489
I'm really sorry.
I am. I'm sorry.

258
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,892
Yeah. Sounds to me like
you're sorry you fucked up,

259
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:09,895
but not, you know,

260
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,364
not for what's underneath it.

261
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:14,167
I apologized.
That's what's important.

262
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,934
It doesn't matter if you
apologize if it's not sincere.

263
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,103
Apologies don't have
to be sincere.

264
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,473
It's just the act
of the apology itself.

265
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:24,842
It's only... all that matters
is if you're acting sincere.

266
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:26,645
That is literally
the only thing

267
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,946
an apology has to be,
is sincere.

268
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:30,482
Oh God, will, I completely...

269
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,116
- Otherwise, it's just words.
- I'm acting sincere.

270
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,818
Of course, I don't believe it.

271
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,622
Here at this company,
we believe in sincerity.

272
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:41,192
You had the opportunity
to meet my son yesterday,

273
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,413
the one thing in the world
that I happen to care about

274
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,416
more than this company.

275
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,830
What did you do?
Do you remember?

276
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,798
You talked about
his nanny's hair

277
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,667
and how much it might stink.

278
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,903
Nope. Never said
the nanny's hair stunk.

279
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,005
I never said that.
I never said it stunk.

280
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,273
You know what you didn't say?

281
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,675
- What?
- "Cute kid."

282
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,243
- I was gonna get to that.
- "What a nice son."

283
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,178
What a great job
you did raising your son

284
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,713
as a single parent.

285
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,081
"What a nice job,
seems like a good kid."

286
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,882
You know what,
you don't get to that.

287
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:08,917
You lead with it.

288
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,485
How could you lead with it

289
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:12,254
if somebody's shampooing
once a week.

290
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:14,489
Janine has your severance
package at the front desk.

291
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,057
Your things
have been packed up.

292
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,559
You can tell the delivery
company to take them

293
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,820
wherever you need them to be.

294
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,430
I'm sorry
it had to be like this.

295
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:25,333
Are you sorry?
Are you really sorry?

296
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:29,002
- No.
- You see?

297
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,671
You did the exact
same thing I did.

298
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:34,675
You apologized,
but you didn't mean it.

299
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:36,443
Janine has your things.

300
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:38,511
The delivery guys
need an address.

301
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,989
You know, I was an early
investor in this company.

302
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,758
I believe in this car.

303
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,092
I thought we were good friends.

304
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,427
Will, this isn't fair.

305
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,130
It's not fair.

306
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,304
<i>The Howard is</i>
<i>the model t of it's day.</i>

307
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,673
<i>It's literally</i>
<i>a billion-dollar idea.</i>

308
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:12,710
<i>Will haney with the Howard</i>
<i>has built a better mousetrap</i>

you ever seen a black dwarf?

Yeah. I would've punched a white

You wouldn't have punched

No one punches white dwarfs.
They play around.

punch a white dwarf in the face.

What, I have dwarf racism?

423

Of course, there's
always dwarf racism.

424
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,198
So you mean the white dwarf
is cuddly and cute...

425
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,633
White people are afraid
of black dwarfs.

426
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,136
I would find a black dwarf
just as cuddly as a white dwarf.

427
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,437
You're way off base there.

428
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,371
You'd pick them up and
punch them in the fuckin' face.

429
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,006
I'm really sorry,

430

00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,040
I need the space in the bed,

462
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,643
and I feel like
the air is contaminated

463
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:19,843
from the breathing.

464
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:21,745
They're shedding skin cells.

465
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,281
Skin cells? What are you,
a fucking microscope?

466
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,815
I just wanna close
my eyes and go to bed.

467
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,116
What else is there to do?

468
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:28,785
Happy Birthday, rolly.

469

<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font>

470
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,691
It's Jennifer.

471
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,326
Are you kidding me?

472
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:38,695
No, I'm not kidding you.
I lost a lot of weight.

473
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:40,630
I just can't get over
what I'm seeing.

474
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:43,300
It's me, it's just
a lot less of me.

475
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,700
That is incredible.

476
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:47,869
It is incredible.
It changed my life, rolly.

477
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,250
Everything good.
I got a new job.

478
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:51,607
I got... I'm engaged
to be married.

479
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:54,310
Really?

480
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,651
I'm engaged to be
married, yeah.

481
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,379
I'm surprised.

482
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,647
Why?

483
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,082
You know, you could have
a lot of suitors now.

484
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:04,519
Go off and get engaged
to the first guy you meet?

485
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,188
You're in demand.

486
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:08,856
Did he like you
when you were fat?

487
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:10,925
He never talked to me
when I was fat.

488
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,861
Ok, there you go. See, he's
superficial, just like me.

489
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:15,996
I wouldn't have dated you
when you were fat either.

490
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,498
- I'm sorry to say.
- What a terrible thing to say.

491
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,900
Yeah, I know, it's terrible
but it's true, it's true.

492
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:21,935
Huh...

493
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,169
Who is he?

494
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,804
His name is jaspar.

495
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,940
He's the guy you...
In the face when you walked in.

496
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,942
He's the guy over there.

497
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:30,877
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

498
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,563
- Hey. Rolly, how are you?
- Hey. Hi, Carl.

499
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,465
Did you get that birthday
e-mail I sent you?

500
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,434
Oh, well, you know Carl,
generally, I gotta tell you,

501
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:59,738
I don't reply
to birthday e-mails.

502
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,473
You know, "thank you very much."

503
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:04,475
So kind of you.
Oh, you remembered."

504
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,543
It turns the birthday
into a job.

505
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:07,544
Yeah.

506
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:08,886
The birthday
shouldn't be a job.

507
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,481
We should be celebrating
a birthday.

508
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,948
We shouldn't be going,
"oh, it's my birthday,

509
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,818
- "I have to go to work."
- Yeah, you're right.

- Hey.

512
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:21,758
- Hey, rolly.
- Oh, hey, Wendy.

513
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,626
- Great party.
- Thank you for the shoelaces.

514
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:24,587
Oh, you're very welcome.

515
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,663
She got me shoelaces
for my birthday.

516

<font color="#F5DA81">Man: </font> Big fucking cocksucker.
Let me ask you somethin'!

517

What the fuck is that thing
you're building over there?

518
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,638
You wanna have a cup
of coffee, sober up?

519
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,206
That was my daddy's place, Mac.

520
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:40,008
Yeah, well, it's not his now.

521
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,310
"Well, it's not his now."

522
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:43,211
Not his now
'cause of guys like you.

523
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:44,846
You're fucking up
the whole island.

524
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,981
I was just hired to build
a house, that's all.

525
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,318
- Mcmansion, Mr. mcmansion.
- Come on, we gotta go, brother.

526
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:50,719
Blue heron's fucked!

527
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,488
The whole fucking
island's... fucked!

528
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,325

I'm begging you.

Well, there's
my favorite birthday boy.

532
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:17,176
I had such a great time
at your party last night.

533
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,645
It was a hell of a party.

534
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:21,013
Well, you deserve it.
You're the best guy.

535
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:23,282
Thank you, Gladys.
That's sweet.

536
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:24,650
All right. Let me know
if you need anything.

537
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,454
There's one little thing
that's kind of been on my mind

538
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:29,621
and I've been meaning
to tell you about it.

539
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:30,856
What?

540
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:34,560
I noticed that you put
the silverware on the table.

541
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,495
That's where you put
silverware.

542
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:40,365
It doesn't seem quite
sanitary to me.

543
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,467
It's clean. I cleaned it
right before you came in.

544
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:43,801
The last people left, I...

545
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:46,003
And how did you wash
the table, Gladys?

546
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,505
I have these cloths
that are like...

547
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,940
These rags?

548
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,610
- See what I mean?
- My rags aren't dirty.

549
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:56,347
Oh, Gladys, rags
by their very nature are dirty.

550
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:59,182
The rag is a filthy animal.

551
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:01,251
So what are you saying?

552
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:04,888
Why not put
the silverware on a napkin?

553
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:08,859
Terrific idea.
I'll get back to you, ok?

she should date other people?

You don't want her dating a black

No, no, no. Of course not.

559
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,408
And I said that to her before I
knew who she was going out with.

that she should
date other people.

but a jealous, racist
motherfucker?

Oh, no, no, no.

You don't want her dating
a black man, that's what it is.

568
00:24:37,787 --> 00:24:40,054
- No. That's ridiculous.
- It's gotta be.

569
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:41,523
I don't care who she dates.

570
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:43,491
You know how hard it is
to find a Cuban woman?

571
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:44,792
That shit ain't easy, man.

572
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,294
Three or four of them escape
Cuba every fucking day.

573
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:48,762
That's a low ratio.

574
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,697
They come over here on fucking
rafts and holding on wood

575
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,079
and floating their
ass over here.

576
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,802
Sometimes they float on other
fucking Cubans, sometimes.

577
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:56,069
They gotta use
a Cuban to float on.

578
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,540
Leave her the fuck alone,
man. Stay out of my shit.

00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,918
Maybe on TV.

586
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,987
I'll figure this shit out.
It will come to me.

614
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,757
the flat stuff, are mirrors,

615
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,892
so just be extra careful
with those.

616
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,428
Obviously,
no one wants bad luck.

617
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,563
I'm in your way.
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font>

618
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,598
I'm so sorry.
You have a job to do.

619
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,600
Uh, I will let you
get on with it.

620
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,436
Thank you.

621
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,929
Back up, back up.

622
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,264
Just back up.

623
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:49,966
- Me?
- Yeah, back...

624
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:51,301
Right over here, there's
a place. Right over there.

625
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:53,002
- Are you kidding?
- No, come on.

626
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,605
You have a clearance
right around the bend there.

627
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,906
- I can't back...
- Of course, you can.

628
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:00,209
I'm way back there,
you should be backing up.

629
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,345
- Back up.
- Damn it.

630
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,714
- You're supposed to back up.
- Fuck you. Let's just go.

631
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,549
Asshole.

632
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:14,088
My clearance is
like 80 yards behind me.

633
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:17,291
He's got... just right around
a little bend, it's nothing.

634
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:19,893
- Right.
- And he won't back up.

635
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:21,929
I'll tell you this,
if that's happen to me again,

636
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,764
no way I'm backing up.
I don't give a shit who it is.

637
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:25,966
- Stand your ground.
- But it happens all the time.

638
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:27,901
Last time that happened to me,

639
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:30,237
I just pulled up, I wouldn't
move, he wouldn't move.

640
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,871
I get out of the car
and I started walking away.

641
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,440
The guy goes, "where are you
going?" I said, "I'm leaving.

642
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,175
You happy now, asshole?
You win."

643
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:37,043
And I walked
and I left the truck

644
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,778
and I went
to bridget tobert's house

645
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,747
and I just smoked a joint
and came out an hour later.

646
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:42,982
Truck's there,
he's gone, I win!

647
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,018
You guys ready to play
cards or what?

648
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,519
Yeah. What are we playing?

649
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,988
Chicago, highest spade
in the hole, splits the pot.

650
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:52,057
Speaking of Chicago,
anyone going to the concert?

651
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,493
- What concert?
- The Chicago concert.

652
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:55,727
They're coming back
to the island.

653
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:56,962
They haven't been here
for 20 years.

654
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,198
Wendy should be happy
about that.

655
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:01,866
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>
- What does that mean?

656
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,134
Why should Wendy
be happy about it?

657
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:05,270
Last time they were here,
she blew the lot of them.

658
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,605
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

659
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,940
No! They came here
20 years ago,

660
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,142
she went to the concert

661
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:13,344
and she ended up
blowing the band.

662
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:14,945
- Allegedly.
- It's a rumor.

663
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,981
- Wendy blew Chicago.
- Wendy the waitress,

664
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,615
who I lived with
for three years, that's...?

665
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,185
- No, not the whole band.
- How many did she blow?

666
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:23,654
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

667
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:26,556
If you blow one guy,
ok, I get it,

668
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:28,291
people blow people, it happens.

669
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,227
But what? We're not talking
about Simon & Garfunkel here.

670
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:33,730
This is Chicago.
That's a big band.

671
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:34,731
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

672
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:36,900
Was it one? How many was it?

673
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,035
I know she blew Robert lamm
and James pankow.

674
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:40,369
- No way.
- Yeah.

675
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,370
Lee loughnane was
in on that, I will bet on it.

676
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,239
I don't wanna get you upset,
but as a friend,

677
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,373
I heard it was three.

678
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:47,142
But you don't wanna
get me upset?

679
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,510
- No, no.
- No.

680
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,679
You don't wanna get me upset,
but you heard it was three.

681
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,014
You're my friend,
I don't wanna get you upset.

682
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:53,248
Oh, no, I really
appreciate that!

683
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,851
"Your ex-girlfriend blew
three guys from Chicago."

684
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,185
You're not gonna get me upset.

685
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:59,020
You're all wrong.
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Whispers]</font> It was four.

686
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:00,755
Fuck you, dottie.

687
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:03,991
Ok? If anybody was blowing
Chicago that night, it was you.

688
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,527
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>
- I wish.

689
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:08,096
I'm gonna find out
about this, by the way.

690
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,897
I'll get you a picture
from when she was in high school

691
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,933
and you show it to the band
and see who remembers her.

692
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:13,333
- Ok. Yeah.
- They'll remember.

693
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:16,636
One thing I don't understand,
why do you care?

694
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:19,339
Everybody seems to know about it
except me and it pisses me off.

695
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,407
If I were you,
this whole Chicago thing,

696
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,309
I'd let it go.

697
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,713
Eh... we'll see.

698
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,148
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Knocking on door]</font>
- Who's this?

699
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,884
- I'll find out.
- Rolly, two to you.

700
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:34,854
Hey, everybody, this is my friend will.
I met him at the barge.

701
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:37,757
I wanted to show him
some island hospitality.

702
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,925
- Will, this is dottie.
- Hi, will, how are you?

703
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:41,894
Mike, Rick, rolly,
and that's Frank

704
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:44,529
- and that's molgy.
- For all your insurance needs?

705
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:45,930
Thank you very much.

706
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,432
Hey, I don't wanna
kiss your ass,

707
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,401
but I'm the proud
new owner of a Howard.

708
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:52,371
Thank you. It's been very
successful, been very good.

709
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:53,739
Who do I give money to?

710
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,840
- Oh, you brought your money, good.
- I did indeed.

711
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,843
We love new card players.
You're in.

712
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,479
Do we know one another?

713
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,313
I feel like...
I feel like we've met.

714
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:06,251
You thought I was a mover
a couple days ago.

715
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,451
You thought he was a mover?

716
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:10,554
Him? He's like
90 years old.

717
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:13,491
- No, I did not.
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Indistinct chattering]</font>

718
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:15,927
Starving seniors? It must've
been the shoulders.

719
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:19,263
I feel terrible.
I hope I tipped you.

720
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,931
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

721
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:22,732
<font color="#F5DA81">Dottie: </font> Hey, will,
is it true you have

722
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,634
an actual
bowling alley in there?

723
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:26,436
- We do.
- And a tennis court?

724
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,905
We don't have the tennis court.

725
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:29,367
Oh, just thought
I'd bring that up.

726
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,474
The basketball court
can be multipurpose,

727
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,177
so we can, uh,
we can work it out.

728
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,510
You guys ready to play
cards here or...?

729
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,545
Was there a guy,
like a few years ago,

730
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,948
is this true or is this myth,
about the guy who was like

731
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,217
your partner or something
when you started the company,

732
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:42,985
but he got out early
and then...

733
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:45,087
He would've ended up making
like a million dollars?

734
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:46,789
Yes. He was one
of our marketing guys

735
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,991
back when we were
just a little start-up,

736
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:51,426
and we were just about ready
to take the car public.

737
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,995
Had he kept that investment
stake in the company,

738
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,397
it would've been worth somewhere
in the area of a billion dollars?

739
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,667
- Oh!
- That's just his?

740
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:01,469
- Yeah.
- What an idiot!

741
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,171
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughter]</font>

742
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,140
He must regret
every day of his life.

743
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:06,974
- Maybe he's happy.
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

744
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,776
- That's what I like to think.
- He's a broke idiot!

745
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,411
Maybe he has his integrity.

746
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,814
- I'd rather have 12 bathrooms.
- That's right.

747
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,082
You don't know
what he was thinking.

748
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,951
Maybe he wanted to get
away from the company.

749
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,118
Maybe he was an idiot.

750
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,720
Maybe he doesn't give
a fuck about money!

751
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,101
What do you know
about this guy?!

752
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,989
- I don't know shit about him!
- I know you don't.

753
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,523
Because he's a moron!

754
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:28,461
I wouldn't be associated
with somebody that stupid.

755
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:31,097
- Come on. Who's in?
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Poker chips clack]</font>

756
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:33,132
Here, you know what?
I'm gonna take off.

757
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,634
- Aw, come on, rolly.
- Come on, rolly.

758
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,103
Uh... we'll do it next week.

759
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,071
- All right, rolly.
- Nice to meet you.

760
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:40,705
- Ok, see you.
- See you next week, rolly.

about any of this?

No, I never told anyone
except your father.

770

He's the only one who knew.

771
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,100
Yeah.

772
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,635
I don't understand how
haney couldn't recognize you.

recognize you if that...

completely different.

I mean, really.

All right.
How about that?

I'm leaving the island.

Yeah. I can't stay
with this guy here.

And I can't stay here
with him, on the island.

I just can't. I can't be here.
I can't be here. I'm leaving.

00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:59,349
And, uh, she's got a big mouth.

915
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,251
All right.
Looking forward to it, man.

916

Button up.

917
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,899
- Hey, McKenzie.
- Hey, rolly.

918
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,768
Can I have a word?

919
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,469
Yeah, sure, sit down.

920
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,604
Thank you.

921
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:23,272
What's up?

922
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:27,142
Well... <font color="#A9F5F2">[sighs]</font>
Here's the situation.

923
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,844
You know I work for tibby

924
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:33,281
and, uh, lately, she's been
sexually harassing me,

925
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:35,082
putting her hand on my leg,

926
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,719
dressing suggestively,
things of that nature.

927
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,621
The point is,
I gotta get out of there.

928
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:41,989
I was hoping maybe I could,
uh, get something with you.

929
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,825
You're working on
Blue heron, right?

930
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:46,327
Nah, I don't think so. No.

931
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:48,529
I got a bunch of guys
I hire from a pool,

932
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,130
guys I worked with before.

933
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:55,402
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Scoffs]</font> You know, I hate
to bring this up, McKenzie.

934
00:40:55,503 --> 00:41:00,307
But, uh, I'm sure you'll
recall that a few years ago,

935
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:04,477
I found your dog,
in the woods, behind my house

936
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,879
and at the risk of my own
personal safety,

937
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,147
I brought it back.

938
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:10,616
I fed it and gave him
the rest of my meatloaf.

939
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,385
And he had a baked potato.

940
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:14,153
I didn't know dogs
ate baked potatoes.

941
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:16,922
And then we sat down and we watched
an episode of <i>law & order.</i>

942
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:18,724
And I fell asleep with
that poor dog in my arms.

943
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,158
And he must've had
some dog dream

944
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:22,661
because I woke up and he was
twitching and going like that.

945
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:25,163
And then, I woke up in the
morning and I called you.

946
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:29,033
You're saying I should give you
a job because you found my dog?

947
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:30,869
I got lyme disease
from that night.

948
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,237
I never told you about that.

949
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:34,872
Ok. I'll tell you what...

950
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:38,509
Only because I do appreciate
you saving lucky...

951
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,847
- ...we'll try it out.
- I appreciate it.

952
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,114
I won't let you down.
I'll work for you.

953
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:45,516
I'll do a good job for you.

954
00:41:45,617 --> 00:41:47,150
Monday morning, eight o'clock.

955
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,519
See you then.

956
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,487
Eight o'clock.

957
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,100
Uh, rolly,

958
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:06,602
what are you doing?

959
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:09,170
So, um...
I couldn't help but notice

960
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:14,576
that my suggestion
has gone unheeded.

961
00:42:14,677 --> 00:42:18,480
I heard you,
and, uh, I just decided

962
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,749
that I have
pretty good system here.

963
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,116
Well, you just saw
what I have to do.

964
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:24,251
I have to clean it in the water.

965
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:27,254
Now I need more water.
We're in a vicious cycle here,

966
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:31,258
of silverware into water,
into more water, on napkins.

967
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,260
The whole thing can be avoided.

968
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:35,763
It's disappointing.

969
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:38,632
I gotta get going
because I've got other people

970
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:39,900
I have to care of.

971
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,602
- You look real good.
- Thank you.

972
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:45,572
Sorry you had to wait.

973
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:47,240
It's still hot.

974
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:48,942

lunch with there?

- Yeah.

- I did.
- Yeah.

- Yeah.

00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,764
so whether it's cool
or whether it's hot.

1066
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:24,000
- Uh-huh.
- So it just stays there.

1067
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:26,535
It doesn't matter
if it's on 68 or 78,

1068

it just is always
that temperature.

1069
00:47:28,238 --> 00:47:31,373

There's an asterisk,

1070
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,376
the asterisk,
it's a sort of a warning.

1071
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,744
It's saying, "we're coming on."

Get ready,
we're gonna be warm soon."

1073
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,749
Or "we're gonna be cooler,"
you know.

1074
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,350
Can we just fix it?

1075
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:46,354
I'm on it. On it.

- Rhonda!

Hey, have you seen
my gray jacket,

1079
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,168
the new one that I just got
with a black liner?

1080
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:55,763
No. But why don't
you put on the seersucker.

1081
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:57,332
I got it for your birthday,
it looks so...

1082
00:47:57,433 --> 00:47:58,732
I would put
the seersucker jacket on,

1083
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,900
but my barbershop quartet
license just expired.

1084
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,002
Well, you don't need to take
that kind of attitude.

1085
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:04,638
- Rhonda!
- You know I don't like that.

1086
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:07,407
I don't like it either. I've
had it with this whole thing.

Oh, yeah, she did.
Yep. That's a fact.

- Yeah.

that you guys were taking care
of all that kind of shit.

not connected, uh, properly.

<font color="#A9F5F2">[Children shrieking, sobbing]</font>

1215
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,120
- You know what?
- Hmm?

1216
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:44,156
Come with me because it's...

1217
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:45,890
I left my hammer in the gym,

1218
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:47,725
and I'll explain
the whole thing to you.

1219
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:49,461
But you've got
a hammer on your belt.

1220
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:51,029
<font color="#F5DA81">Rolly: </font>
No, my lucky hammer.

1221
00:53:52,932 --> 00:53:54,566
Can I ask you a question?

1222
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:57,369
Do you know anything
about this fair on Saturday?

1223
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,070
Oh. <font color="#A9F5F2">[Scoffs]</font>
Are you kidding?

1224
00:53:59,171 --> 00:54:00,671
- The fair, of course.
- Yeah?

1225
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:02,005
They have it once a year,

1226
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,607
and everybody
on the island goes.

1227
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,642
It's fun.
You know, there's rides

1228
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,311
and there's a dunking booth,
you ever see one of those?

1229
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,679
I love the dunking booth.

1230
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,014
The dunking booth,
and they got like, best pig.

1231
00:54:11,116 --> 00:54:13,384
- Ok.
- And best Danish.

1232
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:15,418
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font>

1233
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,020
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Sighs]</font> Oh God,
it feels so good to laugh.

1234
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,822
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Sighs]</font> You know what?

1235
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,024
My husband's leaving
this weekend.

1236
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,593
I think that's
what I'm gonna do.

1237
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,429
I'm gonna go to the fair
on Saturday. I'm gonna do it.

1238
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,864
You know what,
you're a real vineyarder now.

1239
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,132
- Mrs. haney?
- Uh-huh.

1240
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,766
There's a package here
you need to sign for.

1241
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,902
Ok, great. Um...

1242
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,538
- See ya.
- Bye, rolly.

1243
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,042
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Door closes]</font>

1244
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,747
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Phone ringing]</font>
- Yeah.

1245
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,349
<font color="#F5DA81">- <i>Rolly: </font> Hey, stumpo.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

1246
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,883
<i>Ok, get this.</i>

1247
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:52,553
Haney is gonna be
out of town this weekend.

1248
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:55,289
His wife is gonna be
at the fair all day Saturday.

1249
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,790
The house is gonna be empty.

1250
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:59,760
<i>You can do your recon,</i>
<i>take pictures, scope it out.</i>

1251
00:54:59,928 --> 00:55:02,596
Beautiful. Ok, we'll case
the place on Saturday night.

1252
00:55:02,696 --> 00:55:04,364
Ok, see you.

1253
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:07,400
I'm gonna follow
her from the gate...

1254
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:09,068
- Right.
- ...Over to the fair.

1255
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,471
If I see that she's heading
back, I'm gonna text you.

1256
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:12,772
That should give you
plenty of time to get out.

1257
00:55:12,873 --> 00:55:14,441
All right.

1258
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,576
Well, I gotta pee.

1259
00:55:16,677 --> 00:55:18,344
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Sighs]</font>

1260
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:21,180
See, they should have
pee flaps in cars.

1261
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:24,517
Pee flaps... a little
flap, a cylindrical tube,

1262
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:26,685
you pee right into the tube.

1263
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:29,021
Wouldn't that be a great idea?

1264
00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:31,457
- Where does it go?
- Yeah, where would it go?

1265
00:55:31,558 --> 00:55:33,925
- Can't just let it out.
- Yeah. The same set-up as an airplane.

1266
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,426
I don't think
you thought this through.

1267
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:36,494
I'm just gonna be
honest with you.

1268
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,129
There'll be piss
all over the roads?

1269
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,131
Just use a bottle
like everybody else.

1270
00:55:40,232 --> 00:55:43,301
No. That one astronaut tried
to kill that other astronaut

1271
00:55:43,402 --> 00:55:45,803
- and she drove cross-country in a diaper.
- Oh, yeah.

1272
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:47,372
That's a good idea,
a car diaper.

1273
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:50,207
You do a car diaper, that makes
more sense than a pee flap.

1274
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:52,809
A car diaper? That's
the worst idea ever.

1275
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:53,977
You sell them at gas stations...

1276
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:55,345
Hey, hey, hey.
There she is.

1277
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:57,047
Get out, get out, get out.

1278
00:55:57,148 --> 00:55:59,316
I'll text you.

1279
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,306
Well, well, well.
What a surprise, rolly.

1280
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:26,408
Hey. Fancy meeting
you here.

1281
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,709
- Meeting you, yeah.
- Yeah.

1282
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,111
You know that swing set
I asked you to put together?

1283
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:31,446
- Yeah.
- It collapsed.

1284
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:33,081
I know.
I know all about that.

1285
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,483
Yeah. Did you know there
were a lot of kids on it?

1286
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,985
Did you know two of them are
in the hospital right now?

1287
00:56:38,087 --> 00:56:40,087
I followed
all the instructions.

1288
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,589
You're fired.

1289
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,790
- What?
- That's right, you're fired.

1290
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:45,759
Turn in your helmet.

1291
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,162
If anybody is getting fired,
McKenzie, it's gonna be you.

1292
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:52,266
Rolly here has fixed
my exo-plasmatic tube

1293
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,101
and done wonders
on your shoddy work.

1294
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,035
"Ecto" what?
I'm sorry...

1295
00:56:56,136 --> 00:56:58,771
The flagellator... we can't
even find the flagellator.

1296
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:02,174
- The "flaga" what?
- And the exo-plagmatic tube.

1297
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:04,110
The heat has not been working

1298
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:05,511
since I arrived
in this house, McKenzie.

1299
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:07,079
I will take care of it.

1300
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,681
If you're gonna fire anybody,

1301
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:10,902
you're gonna come to me first
and you're gonna ask me.

1302
00:57:10,983 --> 00:57:13,383
- I'll take care of everything.
- Well, you better get on it.

1303
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,887
- That's why I hired you.
- Nice to see you, Mrs. haney.

1304
00:57:15,988 --> 00:57:17,389
Yeah, nice to see you too.

1305
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,923
Enjoy the fair.

1306
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:21,625
I'm so sorry about that, rolly.

1307
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,928
Blaming me for the swings?

1308
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,163
Those poor kids.
I felt so horrible.

1309
00:57:26,265 --> 00:57:28,065
I feel so much
guilt about that.

1310
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,101
I'm gonna visit those kids
in the hospital tomorrow.

1311
00:57:30,202 --> 00:57:31,602
- You are?
- I am.

1312
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,404
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

1313
00:57:33,505 --> 00:57:35,772
By the way,
this is very fortuitous...

1314
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:36,873
This is.

1315
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:38,875
I must say,
bumping into you like this.

1316
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:40,277
Excellent.

1317
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:42,312
We should take in
the fair together.

1318
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:44,347
- Let's do it.
- Oh, great.

1319
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:49,752
Hey! Look at that!

1320
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:52,454
- Right for the one I aimed...
- That was unbelievable!

1321
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:54,156
What's over there?

1322
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:56,425
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font> That's all you got?

1323
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:58,260
Come on. You can throw
better than that one.

1324
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:59,728
Come on! <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font>

1325
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:02,064
Hey, Mrs. Lee,
I want my nails do.

1326
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:06,067
Oh, look who's here.
I wanna talk... ooh!

1327
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,005
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Indistinct conversation]</font>

1328
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:17,912
Oh, it's disgusting.

1329
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:19,293
No, I'm literally
gonna throw up.

1330
00:58:19,348 --> 00:58:20,548
How could you drag me here?

1331
00:58:20,649 --> 00:58:23,417
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1332
00:58:23,517 --> 00:58:25,419
Here's the itinerary, ok?

1333
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:26,453
Ok.

1334
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:28,255
Ferris wheel next,

1335
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:29,789
then we go
right to the big tent.

1336
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:30,991
Oh, that's cute.

1337
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:34,461
- Oh. Oh, yeah...
- Who's Bartholomew gosnold?

1338
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:37,264
<font color="#F5DA81">Rolly: </font> He's the founder
of the vineyard, and Martha is

maybe his daughter.

1340
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,333
I don't know.

1341
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,201
- Martha's vineyard.
- Yes, yes.

1342
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:43,702

Let's be pilgrims.

1345

- Pilgrims?
- Yes.

1346
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:13,663
- Really looking forward...
- I got it. I'm gonna get it.

- Come on.
- Let me get it.

- No!
- I'm doing it.

Hi, um...

1350
00:59:25,276 --> 00:59:27,776
Yeah, look at you over there.

Motherfucker named Nathan.

- Shh! Quiet.

No, you be quiet.

1362
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,200
You know what
Jennifer told me now?

1363
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:53,768
That she wants her space.

1364
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,437
You put that shit in her head.

1365
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:57,772
"Space" means "I wanna be
with somebody different."

1366
00:59:57,873 --> 00:59:59,840
No, no. She's saying
she wants her space.

1367
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:02,543
It's like space.
You're alone in space,

1368
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,078
the planets aren't
near each other.

1369
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:08,749
It's the black void of being
alone in a black void.

1370
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,218
So no one wants to be
near a black void?

1371
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,887
- I'm a black-ass void now?
- No, you're not a black void.

1372
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:16,356
You're talking about me. I'm
the blackest motherfucker here.

1373
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:18,425
- You're not a black void!
- Man, I'm about to smash

1374
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:20,026
the rest of that fucking hair
out your goddamn head.

1375
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:21,428
I can read between
the lines and shit.

1376
01:00:21,529 --> 01:00:22,862
Oh, no. That's crazy.

1377
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:26,499
You fuck my life up, I will
fuck your life up, Nathan.

1378
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,900
Tit for tat.

1379
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:30,369
Tit for tat? There's no tat,
there was no tit.

1380
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:33,539
If I see Jennifer
with another man,

1381
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,374
going fucking crabbing,

1382
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:37,476
antiquing, getting
pushed on a swing,

1383
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:40,745
this whole charade you're
doing right now, it's over.

1384
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,816
I'm telling everybody, Nathan.

1385
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,620
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Woman laughing]</font>

1386
01:00:52,224 --> 01:00:54,658
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Lively chattering]</font>

1387
01:00:57,062 --> 01:01:00,298
Ok. Oh, that's funny.
That's a funny story.

1388
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:02,066
- Ha ha.
- What a funny story.

1389
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,101
- This is my friend, rolly.
- See you later. Take care.

1390
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,002
Ok. You're
gonna friend me, ok.

1391
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:07,204
Get lost.

1392
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:08,972
Don't forget.
I'm gonna Facebook you for sure.

1393
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:11,341
Ok. Take care.
What's going on here?

1394
01:01:11,442 --> 01:01:12,809
- Oh, having fun.
- You're having fun?

1395
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,844
Meeting people, thanks to you.

1396
01:01:14,945 --> 01:01:16,446
What about jaspar?

1397
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,047
I don't wanna have
just one man.

1398
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:19,448
It's the time
to have fun for me.

1399
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:20,782
Thanks to what you told me,

1400
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:22,851
you made, like,
a light go off in my head.

1401
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,253
Ok. It was
a stupid thing to say.

1402
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:25,721
Jaspar's nice
for somebody else.

1403
01:01:25,822 --> 01:01:28,690
I wanna, you know,
I wanna see what's outside.

1404
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,892
I got some news
for you, baby. Ok?

1405
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:33,462
You're gonna gain
the weight back.

1406
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:35,830
Then there's not gonna be any
jaspar, then you're gonna be alone.

1407
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:37,599
You're gonna gain
the weight back.

1408
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:39,700
What is that...
Why do you gotta say that?

1409
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,802
What do you mean? You're going
to, that's what happens.

1410
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:43,605
Nature abhors a vacuum.

1411
01:01:43,705 --> 01:01:46,774
- It wants to fill up...
- It wants to pour the vacuum.

1412
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,309
No? <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughs]</font>

1413
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:51,311
Doesn't a vacuum suck
something up,

1414
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:52,679
like when you vacuum?

1415
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,114
You're gonna get fat again.

1416
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:55,549
Well, you know what?
I changed my lifestyle,

1417
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,950
I'm not gonna gain
the weight back. Ok?

1418
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,285
You wanna make a little bet?

1419
01:01:58,386 --> 01:02:00,677
- I'll make a big bet. - Yeah, how much?
- Not a little one, let's make a big one.

1420
01:02:00,678 --> 01:02:01,655
I'll make a big one.
Fifty bucks.

1421
01:02:01,656 --> 01:02:03,390
- Fantastic. That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

1422
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:05,892
- I'll do more.
- Fifty bucks.

1423
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:07,360
Just do me one favor.

1424
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:09,362
Before you start dating
other men,

1425
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:11,564
will you just think about it?

1426
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:14,267
Give it a little time.
You claim to want your space.

1427
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:15,934
Well, now give it some time.

1428
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:18,337
Time and space, they work
together. They're partners.

1429
01:02:19,906 --> 01:02:21,374
How much time do I need to?

1430
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:22,440
A long time.

1431
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:23,975
- A long time?
- Yes.

1432
01:02:24,076 --> 01:02:25,677
Take my time.
Be by myself.

1433
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,279
- Yeah.
- I'll think about it.

1434
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,047
- Ok. Come on.
- Let me give you a call.

1435
01:02:29,148 --> 01:02:30,848
- You deserve a free coffee.
- Give me a hug. Ok.

1436
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,984
- Ok. This is fantastic.
- Ok.

1437
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:34,653
You're gonna think about it.

1438
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:36,054
What kind of coffee you want?

1439
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:37,955
- A vanilla latte.
- I'll make it myself.

1440
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:39,323
- Ok.
- Ok.

1441
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:40,924
Vanilla latte!

1442
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:47,264
What are you doing here?

1443
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:49,800
I have estimate for you.

1444
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:52,035
What is this? Have
you been following me?

1445
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,970
This is not important to you.

1446
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:55,638
What is important to you is

1447
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:58,074
I am here
and I have estimate for you.

1448
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,700
- Ok.
- Ok.

1449
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,177
How much is the estimate?

1450
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:02,845
Thirteen-hundred dollars.

1451
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:05,215
Really?
Thirteen-hundred dollars?

1452
01:03:05,316 --> 01:03:07,983
- This is what it costs.
- Where'd you get this estimate?

1453
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:11,220
I got it from vlad's body shop.

1454
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:14,423
- Vlad is a chechen.
- What's the problem?

1455
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,625
You're in chechen cahoots.

1456
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,860
- No, it's chechen coincidence.
- Oh, that's a coincidence?

1457
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,629
- I want to ask you something.
- Yeah.

1458
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,930
You have problem
with chechen people?

1459
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,665
Me? Are you kidding?

1460
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,033
I adore the chechen people.

1461
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,034
You're one of my top
five ethnic groups.

1462
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:29,303
- Really? Listen to me.
- Yeah.

1463
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,805
I don't have time to fucking
talk with you all day.

1464
01:03:31,906 --> 01:03:33,608
No, of course not.

1465
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,143
You pay the money
or you have big fucking problem.

1466
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,113
One vanilla latte.

1467
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:42,116
Hey, thank you.

1468
01:03:42,217 --> 01:03:43,883
- It's on the house.
- You're sweet. Thank you.

1469
01:03:43,984 --> 01:03:45,985
Enjoy the fair, rolly.

1470
01:03:47,321 --> 01:03:49,256

1474
01:03:54,528 --> 01:03:57,163
Um...
So I'm gonna head home.

1475
01:03:57,265 --> 01:03:59,531
What? No.
You can't do that.

1476
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,234
- Really?
- May I ask a question?

1477
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:04,303
Sure, rolly.

1478
01:04:04,404 --> 01:04:06,805
When was the last time
you were on a Ferris wheel?

1479
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:08,674
- Really?
- Yes. Here.

1480
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:10,175
- All right. All right.
- Come on.

1481
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:13,746
Ferris wheel and there's
piglets to see too.

1482
01:04:13,846 --> 01:04:15,680
- There are piglets?
- There's little piglets.

1483

Ok. <font color="#A9F5F2">[Chuckles]</font>

All right. Come on.
Let's hustle it up.

- That was so much fun.
- That was excellent.

1491

Because of the silverware?

- No. That is not...
- But it's neon, it's cute.

1494
01:05:05,261 --> 01:05:08,697
It's not you. You know, you're
lighting up, "I'm an asshole."

1495
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:11,300
White's a good color.
I like white.

1496

A little fur
with those little tie things.

Let's get outta here.

1500

- I don't think so.
- No? Nothing?

1501

- No.
- Ok. Well...

He doesn't like me in hats.

1503
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:30,416
Well, if she really
wanted to buy it,

1504
01:05:30,517 --> 01:05:32,085
she would have bought it.

1505
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:34,921
She's blaming it on me.
I had nothing to do with this.

1506
01:05:35,022 --> 01:05:37,657
You know, except for the rides

1507
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:40,026
and then the food, it was
actually pretty good.

1508
01:05:40,127 --> 01:05:42,963
- I can't believe the junk you ate.
- Made me so happy.

1509
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,930
It's unbelievable.

1510
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,531
How are my teeth?

1511
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:48,800
Good?

1512
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:50,569
I think you're ok?

1513
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,338
Let me see your teeth,
let me see.

1514
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:55,207
- Hmm. You're good.
- Yeah?

1515
01:05:55,308 --> 01:05:57,243
You have a... hold on...
A little smudge.

1516
01:05:59,012 --> 01:06:00,979
There.

1517
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,613
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Sighs]</font> All right.

1518
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:06,751
This was the best day,
excellent.

1519
01:06:06,852 --> 01:06:09,653
So, good night.
I'll see you at the house.

1520
01:06:09,755 --> 01:06:10,855
- Ok.
- Ok.

1521
01:06:32,476 --> 01:06:34,143
New plan.

1522
01:06:35,379 --> 01:06:37,246
Instead of blowing up
the house,

1523
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:39,949
I'm gonna steal haney's wife,

1524
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,953
marry her and take
half his money.

1525
01:06:44,054 --> 01:06:45,421
Oh, you gotta be...

1526
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:47,924
- What? Is this a joke?
- It's not a joke. No.

1527
01:06:48,025 --> 01:06:49,891
It's not a joke?
It's stupid.

1528
01:06:49,992 --> 01:06:52,294
You think she's gonna leave
her young, handsome,

1529
01:06:52,395 --> 01:06:54,329
- billionaire husband...
- Oh, yes.

1530
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,997
For a broke, bald old dude?

1531
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:59,600
I know when I have a connection
with somebody, ok?

1532
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,624
This woman likes me.
Really?

1533
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:04,739
Oh, it's there. It's there.

1534
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,575
I love you so much.

1535
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:11,278
I love you so much.

1536
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:14,949
I have to tell you something.

1537
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,751
I spoke to the doctor...

1538
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,523
And I've decided to stop
the treatments.

1539
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,592
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Crying]</font> Oh, no.

1540
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:27,726
No, no, no.

1541
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,695
No! No!

1542
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,165
I took her to the fair
yesterday.

1543
01:07:32,266 --> 01:07:33,833
She asked me for a tooth check.

1544
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:35,701
A tooth check, come on.

1545
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,502
- It means nothing.
- Who the fuck cares? That's means nothing.

1546
01:07:37,603 --> 01:07:38,770
Rags will give me a tooth check.

1547
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:40,138
All the time.

1548
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:42,040
- Right...
- You guys do tooth checks?

1549
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,408
- Sure.
- Constantly.

1550
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:45,510
I might have kale
in there or something.

1551
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,579
She wiped
some smudge off my cheek

1552
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,847
when I said good-bye to her.

1553
01:07:48,948 --> 01:07:50,382
It was probably annoying her.

1554
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,583
<font color="#F5DA81">Rolly: </font> No!

1555
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:52,951
Yeah. She's like,
"get that shit off your face."

1556
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:55,119
What about our plan?
What about me?

1557
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,320
Where does that leave me?

1558
01:07:56,421 --> 01:07:57,821
Where does that leave
the fellas?

1559
01:07:57,922 --> 01:08:00,624
That's a very legitimate
question, stumpo.

1560
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:03,194
Once I marry her
and get half her money,

1561
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:06,364
it's gonna leave you with
a million fucking dollars

1562
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:08,032
for each of you!

1563
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:10,467
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Shouting, laughter]</font>
- And after I move in,

1564
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:12,268
we invite everybody
on the island

1565
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,704
to come watch us
blow up the house.

1566
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:16,646
- We blow up the house?
- We blow up the house!

1567
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:20,210
And it's all legal.
I own it.

<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

1569
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,981
How's my plan now?

1570
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,150
You're so brave.

- This is for them.
- Yeah.

1575
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,533
They should have
a beautiful place to come

1576
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:50,738
with their family to fight off
this... terrible disease.

- Hey, Rhonda!

Good morning, ray.

<font color="#F5DA81">- Rhonda: </font> Good morning.

1583
01:09:28,908 --> 01:09:30,442
Got a little surprise for you.

1584
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:33,411
They call it vanilla latte.

1585
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:34,712
Aw, you're the best.

1586
01:09:34,813 --> 01:09:37,748
I observed you the other day,
I saw what you ordered.

1587
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:39,317
I took a little note, you know.

1588
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:40,651
And you in the seersucker.

1589
01:09:40,752 --> 01:09:42,687
- Mm? What do you think?
- Wow.

1590
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:44,556
I mean, it takes a lot
to pull that off.

1591
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:46,823
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Scoffs]</font> What? Are you kidding?
I was raised on seersucker.

1592
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:48,292
Got bar mitzvahed
in seersucker.

1593
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,726
I got a closet full of these.

1594
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:51,161
- Well...
- It's all I wear.

1595
01:09:51,262 --> 01:09:53,930
- You wanna come inside?
- Love to.

are you looking at?

01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:58,935
- Get the fuck over here.
- Yes, sir.

1599
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:01,504
Throw those bags in...
God damn it!

1600

sippy lid with the hole in it.

1601
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:06,242
- Yeah?
- I invented that.

1602
01:10:06,343 --> 01:10:07,910
Really? You know
what else you invented?

1603

- What?
- Ah. <font color="#A9F5F2">[Chuckles]</font>

1605
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,784
I hope it really catches on.
I gotta tell you something.

1606
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:17,586
Because I would love to be
remembered

1607
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:20,222
as the guy who invented
the eye-level outlet.

1608
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:21,590
What a legacy that would be.

1609
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:23,024
Yeah. It would be amazing.

1610
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:25,260
And then you could get into
designing the plates...

1611

- Hey.
<font color="#F5DA81">- Rolly: </font> Hey.

- Yeah, it's seersucker.
- Yeah. Sharp.

around seersucker.

My friend Frank
can drive the boat.

1628
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:56,756
Take it out.
It's there to be enjoyed.

- Sure.

Or at least a senator.

- A councilman, a city council.

- A councilman?

You're very sweet,
thank you so much.

You gave me a smudge thing.

1811
01:18:37,556 --> 01:18:39,457
A smudge?

1812
01:18:39,558 --> 01:18:41,958
Yeah. A tooth check. <font color="#A9F5F2">[Mutters]</font>

1813
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:44,927
- Get in your car!
- I'll get in the car.

1814
01:18:45,028 --> 01:18:47,197
- A smudge?
- Sorry.

1815

What are you,
in fucking middle school?

1816
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:50,900
A misunderstanding.

1817
01:18:56,507 --> 01:18:59,774
I don't know what I was
thinking. I don't know.

1818
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:01,977
No, you placed too much emphasis
on a tooth check

1819
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:03,312
I don't know what I was
I can tell you that right now.

1820
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:05,914
Tooth checks don't mean
what they used to be, you know.

1821
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:08,283
<font color="#F5DA81">Rags: </font> So what now,
what do we do now?

1823
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:11,786
This is exactly what we should
have done in the first place.

1824

Now we're right back,
full circle, it's on.

Ok.

Good news. Hot dog!
What's the plan?

1829
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,570
Well, next week's
the Chicago concert.

1830

I know that haneys are going,
nobody's gonna be home.

1831
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:35,642
All right. The day of the
Chicago concert, that's it.

1832
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:38,612
This is great. This is great.

Do me a favor, will you?

1834
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:41,381
Sure.

1835
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,316
There's a painting
of mine in that house.

1836
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:44,651
- Ok.
- It's a plepler.

1837
01:19:44,752 --> 01:19:47,620
He stole it from me.

1838
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,555
It's a painting
of a shopping cart.

1839

- It's a painting of a shopping cart...
- Shopping cart.

1840
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:54,426
Is a plepler is a type of shopping
cart or is that who painted it?

Put your hand in there.
Nice work.

1848

Hey, you better
hold on to these.

I plan on getting fucked up.

1852
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:39,535
All right. I'm gonna meet you
in the lobby in a few minutes.

1853
01:20:39,636 --> 01:20:43,072
- I gotta do something.
- Whoo! Fucking Chicago!

1854
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:44,907
- Do you have a pass?
- No.

1855

I can't let you in
without a pass, my man.

I'm gonna level with you, ok?

1857
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:51,112
- Ok, level with me.
- Here's what happened.

1858
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:53,415
My ex-girlfriend, who I lived
with for three years,

1859
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,618
I found out now that
it's possible that she had

1860
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,188
some kind of oral activity
with them 20 years ago

1861
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:01,690
after they played here.

1862
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,758
So it's kind of...
It's bugging me

1863
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,893
and I need... I just want
to find out if it's true.

1864
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:08,795
I understand
you might wanna know,

1865
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:11,632
but I just can't let
you back here without a pass.

1866
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,166
Ok. Yeah, you did a good job.

1867
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,236
- You're doing your job.
- That's what it is.

1868
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,171
Where do they want us for this photo shoot?
Excuse me...

1869
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,541
I'm not a nut. I just
have one quick question.

1870
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,942
- I'm sorry. One question.
- Yeah. Sure.

1871
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:26,912
When you guys were here,
um, 20 years ago,

1872
01:21:27,013 --> 01:21:29,782
do you remember getting blown
by a woman named Wendy?

1873

- What?

1874

- You're serious?
- Sorry to be so blunt.

1875
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,388

what she looked like.

- You do? Really?

- Yes.

Oh, yeah that was me.
Yes. I remember her.

wasn't she?

- I think that was you.

Why didn't you tell me
you were you?

so badly between us,

it was doing there.

You got all cleaned up.

2106
01:35:03,177 --> 01:35:05,379
I was prepping these dudes
for the homeless wizard look.

2107
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,713
Yeah. I got a little
shave and a haircut.

2108
01:35:06,814 --> 01:35:08,715
I didn't want to scare
anybody, you know.

2109
01:35:08,816 --> 01:35:12,152
Hey, what do we call you?
Rolly? Nathan? What...?

2110
01:35:12,253 --> 01:35:13,686
Rolly.

2111
01:35:13,787 --> 01:35:15,488
- Rolly it is.
- Yeah. Rolly.

2112
01:35:15,589 --> 01:35:17,590
- Welcome home.
- Thank you very much.

2113
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:19,258
So, rolly, am I the first
woman you've seen

2114
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:20,493
since you've been out?

2115
01:35:20,594 --> 01:35:22,028
Dottie, you're the first.

2116
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:23,396
You and me, come on,
let's go. Let's do it.

2117
01:35:23,497 --> 01:35:25,565
You're the first, dottie.

2118
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:28,334
- <font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>
<font color="#F5DA81">- Rolly: </font> What's the game?

2119
01:35:28,435 --> 01:35:30,736
Five-card draw. I think
that's your favorite, isn't it?

2120
01:35:30,837 --> 01:35:33,739
Same shit-game that he always
plays, nothing's changed.

2121
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,940
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Laughing]</font>

2122
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:36,474
Ante up, you guys.

2123
01:35:36,576 --> 01:35:39,545
Well, whether you
know it or not, rolly,

2124
01:35:39,646 --> 01:35:42,548
you have become a bit
of a hero in these parts.

2125
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,049
A lot of people
were happy to see

2126
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:47,418
that monstrosity of a house
hit the dust.

2127
01:35:47,519 --> 01:35:48,753
- Local hero.
- You're the guy.

2128
01:35:48,854 --> 01:35:50,588
Ballsy move.

2129
01:35:50,689 --> 01:35:53,457
Your three years in prison was
worth getting rid of that house.

2130
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:56,060
- Absolutely.
- Hey, what happened to money bags?

2131
01:35:56,161 --> 01:35:57,728
They got him on some treatment.
He's in remission.

2132
01:35:57,829 --> 01:35:59,430
- They went back to California.
- No kidding?

2133
01:35:59,531 --> 01:36:01,098
Are they ever coming back
to the island?

2134
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,399
I don't think they should,

2135
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,834
knowing that rolly's
back in town.

2136
01:36:04,936 --> 01:36:06,235
Oh, yeah.
What am I thinking?

2137
01:36:06,336 --> 01:36:07,938
<font color="#A9F5F2">[Lively chatter]</font>

2138
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:09,372
All right, ante in.

2139
01:36:09,473 --> 01:36:11,775
My only regret, rolly,
is that you missed

2140
01:36:11,876 --> 01:36:13,743
the Chicago concert that night.

2141
01:36:13,844 --> 01:36:16,312
My God! Best show
I've ever seen.

2142
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:17,881
The entire island was there.

2143
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:19,582
- They were great.
- Yeah. All three encores.

2144
01:36:19,683 --> 01:36:21,650
Everybody had a great time,
especially the band.

2145
01:36:21,751 --> 01:36:23,085
<font color="#F5DA81">Rolly: </font>
Why is that?

2146
01:36:23,186 --> 01:36:24,820
Jennifer blew them
in the parking lot.

2147
01:36:24,921 --> 01:36:27,389
- I forgot about that.
- Jennifer? The whole band?

2148
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,325
- Lee loughnane, for sure.
- Definitely Jimmy pankow.

2149
01:36:30,426 --> 01:36:33,062
No. No. Not pankow. It was
loughnane and Robert lamm.

2150
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:34,563
<font color="#F5DA81">Dottie: </font> No.
It was all three.
