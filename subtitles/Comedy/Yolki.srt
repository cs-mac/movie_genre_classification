Gorky Film Studio

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,032
Based on the stories by
Vasily SHUKSHIN

3
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,879
Knyazev's works

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,555
Knyazev's clothes

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,835
Knyazev's perpetual motion machine

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Spinoza
Knyazev

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,878
Oh, hi, my friend!

8
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,354
Give me a ruble till the year's end!

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,909
This day, dear
Nikolai Nikolayevich,

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,275
will live in the children's memory
for a long time.

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,589
When they grow up

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,159
and become adults,

13
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,278
this day will remain for them
one of the most precious

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,158
recollections from their childhood.

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,108
Accepting such an expensive
thing as a color TV set,

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,431
our boarding school
is getting much more

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,318
than this valuable gift.

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,996
You demonstrated to us a fine lesson
of kindness and disinterestedness.

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,115
You, Nikolai Nikolayevich, is,
undoubtedly, a man of the future!

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,191
Children, you're looking at a living
example of a man of the future!

21
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,837
And specially for you,
Nikolai Nikolayevich,

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,675
Sasha Illarionov will sing
"The Sail I Whitening Alone" .

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,440
At the piano is Lenochka Opalyova.

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,271
The sail is whitening alone

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,477
In blue obscurity of sea!..

26
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,792
What did it leave in country own?

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,191
What does it want so far to see?

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,558
The wind is strong, the mast is
creaking,

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,996
The wave is playing with the wave...

30
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,674
Alas! Not a fortune is it seeking...

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,437
Sergey NIKONENKO

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,037
Yekaterina VORONINA

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,637
Galina POLSKIKH

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,237
Leonid KURAVLYOV

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,837
Yevgeny YEVSTIGNEYEV

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,437
Leonid YARMOLNIK

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,439
in a film

38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,189
HELL'S BELLS!..

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,516
He's nuts.
Gave them a color TV set.

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,038
Assembled it from old parts.

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,558
And it worked
like a new one.

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,192
As if he's a rich man.

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,112
Just to make an impression.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,676
He would've done better if he sold it
and bought himself decent clothes.

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,517
He's as poor as a church mouse.

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,717
I was telling him, but he won't
listen! Not expedient.

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,557
God has blessed him with golden
hands and a featherbrain.

48
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,116
And he neither drinks nor smokes.

49
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,719
And what's the use?

50
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,952
I'd rather he drank
and was like everybody else.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,678
But he's slaving away from morn
till night, and writing at nights.

52
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,834
And making people laugh
at his stupidities.

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,275
Why don't you get him married
to yourself?

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,594
It's easier to say than to do.
He won't even look in my direction.

55
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,599
Getting him married...
I wouldn't mind to.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,754
And my Vovik follows him like a tail:
"Uncle Kolia this, uncle Kolia that..."

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,637
The sleeping fox
catches no chickens.

58
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,037
Are you suggesting I invite
him to a dance floor?

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,713
Why not?

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,951
Leave Vovik with me, I'll baby-sit.

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,712
What's so bad about it?

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,036
Jerking with milksops.
You've got to be kidding!

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,749
You can go to a restaurant.
Or for a walk in the woods.

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,109
Or go to the park.

65
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,910
They say the bikers are here,
racing in circles.

66
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,312
I don't know how to approach him.

67
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,199
Do it through Vovik.
He can't turn him down.

68
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,397
He loves kids,
gives them color TVs.

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,508
Make Vovik say, " Mom is busy,
too much work at the post office."

70
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,356
And you meet them
all dressed up, with a hairdo.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,393
Well, ice cream, cakes,
this and that.

72
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,998
You know,
the whole regimen.

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,358
Oh, I don't know.

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,876
Uncle Kolia, what will
this thing be called?

75
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,157
Perpetuum mobile.
Ever heard of it?

76
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,275
No.

77
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,592
Many have forgotten, have given up.
We call it a perpetual motion machine.

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,478
I'll get it into shape, push it with
my foot, and it will get going.

79
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,995
See, they said friction would stop it,
it's the laws of physics.

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,957
And gave up on it. Impossible!

81
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,795
What do you mean, impossible? And what
about the photon, the solar energy?

82
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,030
It's still a granny's guess.
Impossible!

83
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,428
What granny?

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,879
Grandmother History,
an interesting granny, a cunning one.

85
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,470
There was time when tuberculosis
was incurable.

86
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,916
And now, six months -
and a man is as fit as a fiddle.

87
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,559
Was it that granny who cured him?

88
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,398
Not without her help.

89
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,510
Today the medics are storming cancer.

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,839
What cancer?

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,517
A cruel tumor,
a very bad sore.

92
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,150
And here comes a psychic
and begins treating it right and left.

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,112
And it vanishes without a trace.

94
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,075
In fact, they remove all kinds
of tumors with their hands.

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,396
Come here.
Give me your hand.

96
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,471
C'mon, hell's bells,
put your hand here.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,353
Feel warm?

98
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,635
Nah.

99
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,593
- And now?
- Yes.

100
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,875
- Yes what?
- I feel.

101
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,632
- Feel what?
- Warm.

102
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,233
You see?
And now?

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,836
- Feel cold?
- Yes.

104
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,189
There you go.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,029
And they say, impossible.

106
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,716
Healer Knyazev

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,118
Help!

108
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,470
Quick!
Come here!

109
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,675
Let's go, uncle Kolia,
or the ponies are going to leave.

110
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,835
Like an ice mountain emerging

111
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,475
From the fog, the iceberg rose,

112
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,315
And the tide carries it over

113
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,109
Across the wide, boundless seas.

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,829
How fortunate are those

115
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,470
Who know the danger in the ocean,

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,118
Who know the danger in the ocean
for a ship meeting an iceberg on the sea...

117
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,030
What's going on!
So much joy!

118
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,711
An intelligently organized recreation.
Joy for people, benefit for the state.

119
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,030
They're saying goodbyes

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,551
as though they go
on a round-the-world trip.

121
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,548
Psychologically, this is
a round-the-world trip for them.

122
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,234
Really?
So much joy!

123
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,990
Such a joy!

124
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,355
Nikolai Nikolayevich!

125
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,032
I've been looking for you.
Is Vovik taking a ride?

126
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,555
Yes, he went on
a round-the-world trip.

127
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,156
And I got time off.
I can spend it with you.

128
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,719
- Really?
- Yes.

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,792
We had a party at the post
office, so I had to.

130
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,988
So you're here
and I can go?

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,439
Why go away? It's your day off.

132
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,396
They brought a gorilla and show him.
It's such a rarity.

133
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,074
Let's look together,
at the gorilla.

134
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,993
- I'd rather be alone.
- Vovik and I won't be in the way.

135
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,479
We'd better not.

136
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,950
I cooked borsht,
we could dine together.

137
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,999
Thanks, Lyuba, but it's not expedient.
Some other time.

138
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,152
Not expedient.

139
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,550
And five rubles for a hairdo,
is it expedient?

140
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,430
Did man really
originate from the monkey?

141
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,795
Do you doubt it?
It's been proved.

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,910
I'm used to putting
everything to doubt.

143
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,276
From whom, then?

144
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,429
From whom?

145
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,438
Who knows?
The universe is infinite.

146
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,672
Don't you ever suppose
that we're extraterrestrials?

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,997
I don't know about you, but I'm not.

148
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,196
Idiots!
They drink beer at Buratino's !

149
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,672
You damned alcoholic!

150
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,909
Thank you.

151
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,071
- Is it occupied here?
- No.

152
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,913
Will you take half a glass?

153
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,149
No.

154
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,152
Why not?
You don't drink?

155
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,908
No, I don't .

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,274
Alright, then.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,117
So the problem of
free time has been solved.

158
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,717
It's that simple.

159
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,836
- What's simple?
- The problem of free time.

160
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,516
What free time?

161
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,230
They're arguing about it,
and here everything's clear.

162
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,719
Who's arguing?

163
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,634
Arguing about how
to spend free time.

164
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,719
And you know how - a glass in
the morning, and you're free all day,

165
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,595
Yes, yes.

166
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,878
Been watching the beasts?

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,150
Yeah, was passing by,
and thought why not go in?

168
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,032
I remember when I was a kid...

169
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,596
It must be expensive
to keep them here.

170
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,118
How much does he gobble in a day?

171
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,670
- Who?
- Say, a gorilla.

172
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,393
Who knows?

173
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,313
If it were unprofitable,
they wouldn't keep them.

174
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,875
There must be some interest, right?

175
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,190
That's right, but you're
overlooking the process of cognition.

176
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,115
Not all come because they have nothing
to do, they want to cognize something.

177
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,236
Come on!

178
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,552
What is there to cognize?

179
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,993
A gorilla?
Some shit!

180
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,473
I'll go and report on you now.

181
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,998
What? Are you surprised?
But I should have.

182
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,833
All right, I drink two, you - one,
you owe me a pail.

183
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,998
I drink three, you - one, then 3 pails.
Let's get going.

184
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,592
You're spilling some.

185
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,476
That's it.

186
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,113
You can't drink.

187
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,395
Two pails.

188
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,597
Help!

189
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,869
What is it?

190
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,999
I wanted to ask you.

191
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,438
I didn't get it alright.
Were you really?

192
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,868
What really?

193
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,833
Going to snitch.

194
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,277
No, of course I wasn't . But I ought
to knock some sense into your head.

195
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,395
Come on.

196
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,389
Please.

197
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,998
You see, I got nothing
against people drinking.

198
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,275
But there is an intelligent
organization of people.

199
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,399
Generally, this organization
is called the state.

200
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,831
Imagine that everybody in
the state would begin drinking.

201
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,357
I'm not doing it at working time,
only on my day off.

202
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,637
That's what we should talk about.

203
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,110
What is it - the day off?

204
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,636
Suppose we are
putting up some...

205
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,034
say, we're mounting
a complex steel construction...

206
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,633
I'm an electrician.

207
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,318
Suppose we're laying down
a complicated circuit.

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,313
On weekend we get drunk.
Then get sober.

209
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,075
Work for a week.
Then get drunk again.

210
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,554
You mean I'm an alcoholic or what?

211
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,235
I mean that our state
gives us a day off,

212
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,277
even two. And what for?

213
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,589
First, that we would have
a good rest,

214
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,399
and, second, that we wouldn't have
fallen behind in our development.

215
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,199
For example, you got a day off
and you don't know what to do with it.

216
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,796
You were passing by the Zoo -
shall I go in!

217
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,869
And if you were passing by,
well, I don't know... a pharmacy?

218
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,519
Passing by a pharmacy.

219
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,196
Shall I go in
and buy a purgative, right?

220
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,792
You can't drift with
the tide like a log,

221
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,951
whichever way it washes me,
I don't care.

222
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,317
The state
affords us a free time,

223
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,313
for us to cognize
something useful.

224
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,838
Are we going to lush up
that moonshine forever?

225
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,552
Enough, my dear, enough of
this lushing, enough is enough.

226
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,676
The state is accelerating its pace.

227
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,308
It's not a cart anymore, it's a liner.

228
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,994
And we try to catch up with
this liner on foot,

229
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,311
we keep bending down
and pouring it into a glass.

230
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,075
What movement, what
acceleration are we talking about?

231
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,752
Not a chance for us on that liner, with
our bloodshot eyes and throwing up...

232
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,275
You bastard!

233
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,474
You want to make a career
at my expense?

234
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,273
Where do you work?

235
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,558
At the repairs shop. He says
I'm throwing up all over.

236
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,596
Occupation?

237
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,553
- Was I talking about you?
- About whom, then?

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,950
- I was developing an idea.
- Quiet.

239
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,792
Can you keep silent?

240
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,709
What's your occupation?

241
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,915
An electrician.

242
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,390
You should work not as an electrician,
but as a sewage cleaner doing 2 shifts.

243
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,794
Letting loose with his fists.

244
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,872
You'll come with the sergeant.

245
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,151
And you're fined 10 rubles.

246
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,833
Leave the sugar here.

247
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,755
There're 12 kilos of it,
watch it doesn't disappear.

248
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,435
Yes?

249
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,633
It's open.

250
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,475
Hello.

251
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,672
May I introduce myself?
Nikolai Nikolayevich Knyazev.

252
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,432
I've been observing your work twice.

253
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,874
Hello.

254
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,035
Sit down.

255
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,757
- Thanks.
- Wait.

256
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,953
Why are you scattering
your things around?

257
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,395
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,599
And the room is not so good.

259
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,795
Really?

260
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,710
Well, it's like this.

261
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,476
I want to invite you to my place.

262
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,155
- Why?
- To visit, to have tea.

263
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,914
I live not far from here,
only 6 bus stops away.

264
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,152
- Interested in new discoveries?
- No, not interested.

265
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,192
Then just come.

266
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,635
- Why?
- To visit, for God's sake.

267
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,914
What's so strange about it?

268
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,236
I'm not inviting you
for a threesome drink.

269
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,750
What do you want?

270
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,035
Shut up.

271
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,795
Why do you get offended?

272
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,394
I'm not offended. But, on the other
side, I don't get it.

273
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,838
I'm explaining: let's go to my
place, and it'll be the other side...

274
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,639
I'm not going.
I don't want any tea, you get it?

275
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,949
Why not?

276
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,868
Shall we step out?

277
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,911
- Grisha.
- Shut up.

278
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,999
- Let's step out.
- Where?

279
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,634
To the hall.
And you'll explain what you want.

280
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,268
- I can explain it here.
- Better there.

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,793
Don't think
I'm aiming at something.

282
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,872
I just wanted to talk
to the new arrivals.

283
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,592
Grisha, but you're free.

284
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,071
And I can't , we're leaving
tomorrow, I have to pack.

285
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,913
I know you're leaving,
that's why I came.

286
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,116
I'm sorry, I just wished for the best.

287
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,477
Did it offend you
that I began to giggle?

288
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,438
I'm just being shy,
you're so famous.

289
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,071
Well, alright.
Why not go?

290
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,435
You go, and I'll pack.

291
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,793
Come on, you'll see
how provincials live.

292
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,599
Shut the door.

293
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,559
You're lying down anyway.

294
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,950
What?

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,035
Straight ahead.

296
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,474
Grisha...

297
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,198
Oh, God, Heavenly Mother...

298
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,828
What's it all about?

299
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,998
What's your patronymic?

300
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,799
What do you want?

301
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,632
Did you get scared or what?

302
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,592
What do you want?
I don't like those things.

303
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,836
I'm inviting you for tea.

304
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,437
My house is by the water,
I got a sister at home, and TV sets.

305
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,675
A sister!

306
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,196
You got a weird manner,
giggling all the time.

307
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,917
To the left.

308
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,757
My manner?
You noticed?

309
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,117
A manner developed in
the contact with human stupidity.

310
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,794
After beating your head against it,
you start giggling.

311
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,430
At first you want to yell
and curse, then it gets funny.

312
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,870
To the right.

313
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,790
Brake it, we're here!

314
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,634
Have you heard
of Spinoza?

315
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,028
Of whom?

316
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,998
Spinoza.

317
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,750
Oh, that... Sure...

318
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,429
The composer.

319
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,194
No, not a composer,
a thinker, a philosopher.

320
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,272
Once Spinoza came
to some town.

321
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,989
He settled down to live with some
people, sitting and writing all day.

322
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,276
And those simple folks made fun of him -

323
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,591
look, the man is doing
nothing but writing.

324
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,796
What was Spinoza to do?

325
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,471
Are you asking me?

326
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,756
Yes, I'm asking.
What is the thinker to do?

327
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,472
What to do?
The same thing as before - to think.

328
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,075
And to write.
What?

329
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,509
Write! Write!

330
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,591
It's easy for you to say it now,
300 years later.

331
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,709
But he was only human,
those jokes were driving him mad.

332
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,192
I should warn you,
my sister's not very cordial.

333
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,954
Don't pay attention
to her displeasure.

334
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,315
Perhaps I'd better not go?

335
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,271
- And what did Spinoza do?
- What?

336
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,595
More courage, artiste!

337
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,389
Let them condemn us later, if,
historically, they're more intelligent.

338
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,869
I'm not scared, but I shouldn't
have gone with you.

339
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,952
Who knows.
Straight ahead, and then left.

340
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,354
Oh, two of you all at once!

341
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,594
The comrade is from the State Circus.
Fix us some tea, and we'll talk.

342
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,472
This way, comrade Kaigorodov.

343
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,959
Excuse me.

344
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,916
Watch your head here.

345
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,752
Another victim.

346
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,634
Don't pay attention.
Come on in.

347
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,593
- Why so many TV sets?
- I'm repairing them.

348
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,958
Spinoza polished the glass, and I'm
soldering, earning my living.

349
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,190
Fixing up this and that
for our citizens.

350
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,511
Our workshop is too cramped,
so I have to do it at home.

351
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,432
C'mon, sit down.

352
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,754
I don't like people standing.

353
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,230
Perhaps we'll even get tea
if her conscience wakes up.

354
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,239
Take a seat,
I don't like people standing.

355
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,910
This is my work of many years.

356
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,833
Reflections on the state.

357
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,195
On what?

358
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,029
I just need an hour
and a half of your time.

359
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,876
Why are you standing?
Give me a rag.

360
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,756
Please,
we don't want any tea of yours!

361
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,270
Just don't be nervous,
I beg you, and no scenes!

362
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,833
- All the ducks go in pairs...
- Now she'll gad about all night.

363
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,433
Having one of her fits.

364
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,348
The state is
a very complex organism.

365
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,956
To put it to use you have...

366
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,312
It has to be comprehended as a whole.

367
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,950
Not in these conditions, of course.
I ought to have built my own house.

368
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,159
She's waiting for me to get married.
Even picked a bride for me. That one.

369
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,108
A serious woman, has
a nice boy, but all this...

370
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,558
Here is, in fact,
my idea of a state.

371
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,511
Here.
Chapter one.

372
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,675
The outline of the structure
of an expedient state.

373
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,869
The state is
a many-story building,

374
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,430
with all floors having a phone link
and connected by a staircase.

375
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,910
The floors are gradually tapering
until only one room is left on the top,

376
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,672
where the control center is situated.

377
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,400
The meaning of such a state
is as follows.

378
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,353
Mobilize your imagination

379
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,159
and we'll string on phenomena
that we can't feel.

380
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,792
The Russian man likes
to feel everything with his hands.

381
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,235
He's not yet used to
thinking in categories.

382
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,755
Do you get the sense of
what I'm reading about?

383
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,829
Everything's clear to you?

384
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,559
Let's picture that
huge building in a cross section,

385
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,918
and the population as
the figures supporting the floors.

386
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,469
Thus, the whole building
is supported by the figures.

387
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,918
To change the picture, let's assume
that some figures on floor X

388
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,552
evaded their responsibilities
and stopped supporting the ceiling.

389
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,597
The ceiling sagged in.

390
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,116
The figures conscientiously supporting
their floor got an additional burden.

391
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,635
The laws of fairness and
balance have been violated.

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,597
The control center
receives an alarm signal.

393
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,069
The controls send a query -
where does it sag?

394
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,794
They call all the floors.

395
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,155
People of goodwill
plus modern technology.

396
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,118
It's been established:
the sagging is on floor Y.

397
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,633
From the control center...

398
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,949
Are you serious?

399
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,788
Meaning?

400
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,715
Are you doing all this for serious?

401
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,239
Goodbye.

402
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,597
Why are you playing the fool?

403
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,233
Did no one ever tell you this?

404
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,078
I understand, the motorcycle
engine is an objective thing,

405
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,073
you can also fantasize
some centrifugal force.

406
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,553
But this is different.
Goodbye.

407
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,589
Listen...
Come with me.

408
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,399
I've got half a bottle, we'll
have a drink.

409
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,950
Why should you sit here alone?

410
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,914
Don't get pissed off, don't be like...

411
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,472
Sorry, what's your name?

412
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,630
You didn't tell me.

413
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,678
I told you at the hotel.
Nikolai Nikolayevich.

414
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,910
So, you're Kolia.
And I'm Grisha.

415
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,552
C'mon, let's have a drink.

416
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,995
Forget about that state.
They'll sort it out without us.

417
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,116
That's what we all are saying.

418
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,995
You didn't even want to grasp
what it was all about.

419
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,711
You should've listened to at least
two chapters, it's just one notebook.

420
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,036
What education have you got?

421
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,792
Whatever I got, it's all mine.

422
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,198
Stop making people laugh.

423
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,474
Goodbye.

424
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,552
This one didn't take too long.

425
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,439
There was a military man whom
he was pulling the wool over all night.

426
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,349
We're not at counsel with
Kutizov in Fili!

427
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,036
- Will you have supper?
- I'm working.

428
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,992
Oh, you may write till you're dead.

429
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,390
- Nikolai Nikolayevich.
- I'm working.

430
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,029
- Maybe it's something important.
- Oh, you're no better than him!

431
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,754
Why not make him marry you,
then you would write together.

432
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,832
Or he would read to you
and you would listen openmouthed.

433
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,558
Why not? I would listen.

434
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,632
Look, last summer
I saw in the theatre

435
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,314
how one woman was netting a man.

436
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,957
She pretended she fainted.

437
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,078
He began running about and fussing,
and the woman was lying down.

438
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,114
He tried everything - blowing on
her, sprinkling her, shaking her.

439
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,635
And then she drew him to her!

440
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,192
And he got stuck.

441
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,034
- Did they get married?
- You bet!

442
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,033
How did she draw him?

443
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,272
Oh, God!
Don't you know how to draw?

444
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,638
I wince every time I remember it.
Don't feel like drawing at all.

445
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,349
When is your name day, Vera, Nadezhda,
Lyubov and their mother Sofia?

446
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,915
In the fall.

447
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,679
We'll celebrate it next Wednesday.

448
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,558
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

449
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,115
- What for?
- Why should we draw it out?

450
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,358
He won't understand anyway.

451
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,593
And we two will sit and
drink a bit to brave ourselves up.

452
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,558
Then I sort of go
and you will fall.

453
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,235
- Fall where?
- Into a swoon.

454
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,708
How am I going to fall?

455
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,635
Just fall and lie like a log.
And I'll be near, outside the window.

456
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,354
And what then?

457
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,159
And then, go on pretending.
He'll run to you.

458
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,233
And you do your act.
Moan or something like that.

459
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,551
And when the real thing starts,
I'll catch you in the act.

460
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,914
What real thing?

461
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,072
Oh God...
He won't eat you, will he?

462
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,748
Why do you have to catch us?
Can't we settle it between ourselves?

463
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,959
I see how you've been
settling it for three years now.

464
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,437
You're so slow-witted.
If I catch you, there'd be a witness.

465
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,116
He won't get away with it.
That's what they showed in the theatre.

466
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,958
No, I don't know.

467
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,833
What is it you don't know?

468
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,596
Maybe you shouldn't catch us?

469
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,432
If I shouldn't , I wouldn't .

470
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,234
We'll see
if I should or not.

471
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,431
Excuse me... Could you tell me
where the marriage registry office is?

472
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,678
It's downtown,
six bus stops from here.

473
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,955
Thank you.

474
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,079
- Where do you need to go?
- To the marriage registry office.

475
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,832
We'll give you a lift.

476
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,113
Come on, Josephine.
Careful, she's very fragile.

477
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,833
Good afternoon, Lyuba.

478
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,036
Any letters for me
from the Academy of Sciences?

479
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,836
No, Nikolai Nikolayevich.

480
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,436
You could at least look.

481
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,436
I look every day,
Nikolai Nikolayevich.

482
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,473
If you want, I can look again
while you're here.

483
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,236
No, nothing for you.
Still writing.

484
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,436
And from UNESCO?

485
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,994
- From what?
- UNESCO.

486
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,113
Nothing from there, either.

487
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,195
- Goodbye.
- Nikolai Nikolayevich.

488
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,029
The day after tomorrow is my name day.

489
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,155
Congratulations.

490
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,880
Maybe we'll celebrate it together?

491
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,235
In the evening.

492
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,954
Maybe, I don't know.

493
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,917
I'm in a hurry now, sorry.

494
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,991
Sergey Nikolayevich.

495
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,433
- We got a complaint here.
- Another complaint?

496
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,079
Another complaint.

497
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,398
Do it yourself

498
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,389
Today we have
a very interesting guest,

499
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,551
Nikolai Nikolayevich Knyazev.

500
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,872
He came to share with us his thoughts
about the organization of the state.

501
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,114
Once I thought about
what would happen

502
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,750
if we, like ants,
brought the maximum to the state?

503
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,270
Just imagine the situation
when no one steals and no one drinks.

504
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,634
A very important thought.

505
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,234
- No one is loafing.
- Just great!

506
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,995
No one gives and no one takes
bribes, no one profiteers.

507
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,114
Everyone at his or her place
puts his or her little brick

508
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,158
in this grandiose
building - the state.

509
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,117
When I pondered over it and saw
in my mind's eye all our expanses,

510
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,509
itjust took my breath away.

511
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,432
My goodness, I thought,
what are we doing?

512
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,309
We could have covered with
asphalt the entire globe,

513
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,154
dug the subway through
to Vladivostok,

514
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,791
built a staircase up to the Moon.

515
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,268
One global idea should
subordinate all the minor ones

516
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,318
related to our
behavior and everyday life.

517
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,671
Kolia Knyazev, pedal over here.

518
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,674
- How are you?
- Hello.

519
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,873
Take a look at our telly.
We turn it on - there're some flakes.

520
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,153
Whoever can compare
to Mathilda of mine,

521
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,076
Whose pretty black eyes just sparkle
and shine...

522
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,993
Just fine...

523
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,075
Something must be wrong
with the aerial.

524
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,512
Would you like to go fishing?

525
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,712
We're planning to,
with Yuri Viktorovich.

526
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,234
I don't like it.

527
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,716
You don't like fishing?
How come?

528
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,473
Well, you know...

529
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,071
- It's just a waste of time.
- It's a rest.

530
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,748
What difference does it make what kind
of rest you're wasting your time on?

531
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,393
There's an active rest
and a passive rest.

532
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,919
The active rest means
some useful event.

533
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,039
Those events make
your head reel as it is.

534
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,114
I don't mean those events,
I mean expedient ones.

535
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,636
- Getting the difference?
- No, I'm not.

536
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,117
Be so kind
and explain, please.

537
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,992
What is your occupation?

538
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,915
- What difference does it make?
- And anyway?

539
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,192
A makeup artist.

540
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,508
Are you aware
how burial mounds are made?

541
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,033
What do mounds have to do with it?

542
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,033
- You ever seen how they're raised?
- Have you?

543
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,839
You might have seen it in a movie?
Do you have a general idea?

544
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,030
I want you
to recall in your mind's eye

545
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,236
the picture
of a mound being raised.

546
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,914
People are walking one after another.

547
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,350
Each takes a handful of
earth and throws it.

548
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,078
First they fill up the pit,

549
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,913
then a mound begins to grow.

550
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,399
Have you visualized it?

551
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,269
Note the disproportion between the
size of a mound and a handful of earth.

552
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,989
A handful of earth is this small,
and on the other side, a big mound.

553
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,513
Was it magic?

554
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,274
No magic.
The accumulation of quantity.

555
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,193
This was how the states were formed,
from Urartu to modern ones.

556
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,316
What can
a weak human hand do?

557
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,109
A fishing rod.

558
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,115
The fishing rod is
also the work of human hands.

559
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,873
In this case, it's only one man.

560
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,350
But when they continuously
walk one after another

561
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,358
and throw a handful of earth each,
a hill is formed.

562
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,875
A fishing rod and a hill.
Are you getting it?

563
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,599
No, I'm not.

564
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,268
What do one and
the other have in common?

565
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,634
We were talking about
how to spend free time.

566
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,270
I believe,

567
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,671
I think that
whatever you're doing,

568
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,559
if you like it,
it means you had a good rest.

569
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,030
Nonsense, rubbish, it's reasoning
at the level of the Stone Age.

570
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,073
The moment you begin
to reason that way,

571
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,192
you're leaving
the continuous chain of mankind

572
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,588
that is accumulating quantity.

573
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,991
I gave you such a graphic example -
how a mound is raised.

574
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,357
Everybody threw a handful
of earth, and you didn't .

575
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,511
Then what's the meaning of your life?

576
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,193
It makes no sense.

577
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,396
It's really some rubbish.
What mound?

578
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,917
I'm telling you,
I came here to have a rest.

579
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,357
Close to nature, to the sea.

580
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,509
I like fishing and I'll fish.

581
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,632
I came to have a rest, too.

582
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,279
- Well?
- What?

583
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,632
Did you come here
to raise a mound?

584
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,031
If you don't like thinking in
categories, then you don't like anything.

585
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,316
Such a graphic example!

586
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,310
- What's the meaning of our life?
- It depends on a person.

587
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,109
No, answer me, what's
the universal meaning of life?

588
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,156
In universal statehood.

589
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,835
If the state prospers,
we all prosper.

590
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,110
- Am I right or not?
- Right.

591
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,794
Figuratively speaking,
we all carry on our shoulders

592
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,313
a certain burden.

593
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,273
Suppose you, me,
the granddad here are carrying a log.

594
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,192
We have to carry it over 100 meters.

595
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,036
We've got over 50 meters, and
suddenly you say, " I'm on leave."

596
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,794
You mean we don't need leaves?
It's nonsense, too.

597
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,080
A leave is possible after we've carried
the log 100 meters and thrown it down.

598
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,595
I don't understand
what you're meaning to say.

599
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,479
First a mound, then a log.
Did you come here to rest?

600
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,356
Yes, to rest.

601
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,354
Or you came here
to throw a log on the road?

602
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,315
Are you doing it on purpose,
refusing to understand?

603
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,758
I really don't understand it.
It's some nonsense, some rubbish.

604
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,436
A total gibberish.
It's a total gibberish!

605
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,195
It makes absolutely no sense.
Granddad, do you understand anything?

606
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,396
Do you understand what he's jabbering?

607
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,596
I'm listening. It's serious.

608
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,957
Sure, serious.
But I can't understand anything!

609
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,634
Cool it. Why get so nervous?

610
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,438
And why are you jabbering
some gibberish?

611
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,318
You didn't even get to the crux
of the matter.

612
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,277
When are we going to learn
to reason logically?

613
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,077
And what about you?

614
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,676
If I don't understand it, it means
it's gibberish. A splendid logic!

615
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,639
For how long are we going
to brush it aside like this?

616
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,038
Well, let's make it
clear, simple and precise.

617
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,919
What do you want to say?
In plain Russian.

618
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,991
- Where do you live?
- In Tomsk.

619
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,673
No, more broadly, as a whole.

620
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,630
I don't understand,
in what whole, in what, where?

621
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,518
You live in a state.

622
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,353
With what do your
main interests coincide?

623
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,755
- I don't know.
- With the state interests.

624
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,196
Your interests coincide
with the state interests.

625
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,112
- Is it clear now?
- Well?

626
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,396
- What's the meaning of your life?
- Well? Well?

627
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,394
Not " well-well" ! What's the meaning
of the life of each citizen?

628
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,039
Well, I don't know!

629
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,837
Working, being honest,

630
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,477
not betraying anyone,

631
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,949
defending your country
if need be.

632
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,635
That's all true.
But it's only offshoots.

633
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,998
What's the principal meaning?
Where's the main stem, so to speak?

634
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,832
- Where?
- I'm asking you!

635
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,877
But I don't know!

636
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,395
Do with me whatever you like!
I don't know!

637
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,358
Are you stupid or what?
Fuck it!..

638
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,956
What do you want from me, huh?

639
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,636
What do you want from me?
Or I'll send you packing from here!

640
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,474
What do you want from me? What?!

641
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,392
Yura, calm down.

642
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,558
Oh, holy God...

643
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,835
In the blue sea and the ocean,
Each to his own merits,

644
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,716
Making such a wild commotion
A band of evil spirits.

645
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,795
Future prospects, that's their worry,
That's why all this brawl.

646
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,749
Evil force would rage and scurry,
For years been having a ball.

647
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,396
A pike in the sea,
water in the mortar, water in the sieve...

648
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,994
Uncle Kolia, when
shall we launch the perpetuum mobile?

649
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,879
- When I finish it tomorrow.
- All right.

650
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,516
Water sprite waving his hands,
All dried up from speeches:

651
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,310
Been reforming all our fiends,
Werewolves, devils and witches.

652
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,270
Past are the years of stagnation,
Those were a great time,

653
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,268
Now we robbers have to be patient,
It's hard to commit a crime.

654
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,036
A pike in the sea,
Water in the mortar, water in the sieve,

655
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,188
There's no other way for us
To muddle the bottom of the sea.

656
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,791
Our Neptune gotjust insufferable,
Going against us all,

657
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,949
He wants to make the quagmire arable
And clean the bay of gall.

658
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,915
We're bringing sabotage
To the very forefront,

659
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,915
So that underwater gardens
Would never bear a plant.

660
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,795
A pike in the sea,
Water in the mortar, water in the sieve...

661
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,590
Hell's bells!
So many loafers!

662
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,955
If each of them broughtjust a handful...

663
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,358
And to not overlook the morals,
Just in case anyone cares,

664
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,390
We'll call up mermaids as well
For amorous affairs.

665
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,674
So, no hackwork, dear girls,
Don't spare your tails.

666
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,475
We got to attack all at once,
From all fronts and trails.

667
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,156
A pike in the sea,
Water in the mortar, water in the sieve,

668
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,194
There's no other way for us
To muddle the bottom of the sea.

669
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,119
I thought you were at home,
but you're at work.

670
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,678
What was it you had there?

671
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,913
Because...

672
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,269
everyone keeps telling me.

673
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,633
What are they telling?

674
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,077
Comrade Knyazev, I hate
to do it, but I have to...

675
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,870
Why do you have to? You think
I don't understand what I've done?

676
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,714
Comrade Knyazev.

677
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,070
To hell with them!
Let them live as they like.

678
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,754
Thank you.

679
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,876
Hell's bells!
Did I say something wrong to him?

680
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,032
I was suggesting that he would
see his objectives more clearly.

681
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,872
He could make a speech at the club.

682
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,316
Telling us about the actors.
Oh, God...

683
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,758
He's a makeup artist.

684
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,510
But what do life objectives
have to do with it?

685
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,394
He would have done a useful thing.

686
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,031
That's what I began with yesterday,
that people are filing,

687
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,668
and each takes
a handful of earth and throws it.

688
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,912
And a hill is formed.
The hill is an expedient state.

689
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,914
If we assume that
the meaning of life of every man,

690
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,229
figuratively speaking...

691
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,992
No, no.

692
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,478
No, comrade Knyazev.

693
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,193
I got a meeting at 10,
a conference.

694
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,673
I'll be glad
to listen to you some other time.

695
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,518
Eat it with bread. Don't
choke on it, no one will take it away.

696
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,513
Let me cut it, I'll cut it.

697
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,509
Uncle Kolia and I are going to launch
the perpetuum now, I mean, mobile.

698
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,590
What?

699
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,268
It's a machine of perpetual motion.

700
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,471
It works on its own.
And everybody's happy, no crisis.

701
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,232
What crisis?

702
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,469
There's an energy crisis now.

703
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,030
But we'll launch the perpetuum,
and there'll be no crisis.

704
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,236
I don't understand what you're
talking about.

705
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,672
Mom, it's all very simple.

706
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,592
This is the Sun, and this is the Earth.

707
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,797
No one spins them,
yet they're rotating.

708
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,714
And the solar system is rotating.

709
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,155
And whole galaxies are rotating.

710
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,479
You think you're standing?
No, you're rotating.

711
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,631
As for me, I sure spin, like
a squirrel on a treadmill.

712
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,870
- Where're you going?
- To uncle Kolia's .

713
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,032
Isn't this thing dangerous?

714
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,238
- It may be dangerous.
- What if it blows up?

715
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,956
Oh, I don't know.
He's wasted so much salt.

716
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,032
Vovik explained to me that they're
making a perpetual motion machine.

717
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,632
He says they'll put a monument to uncle
Kolia for this thing in his lifetime.

718
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,469
They will.
They'll catch him and put another.

719
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,553
Vovik told me about the stars and the
Moon like he was reading from a book.

720
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,071
He who lives with a cripple
learns how to limp.

721
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,272
There's nothing bad about it for Vovik.

722
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,835
Once he starts to explain,
there's no stopping him!

723
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,072
When you get married to him, you'll
be making a perpetual motion machine

724
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,708
from morning till night and back.

725
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,669
The day will be too short for you.

726
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,670
Well, Vovik,
shall we start perpetual motion?

727
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,472
Let's start it, uncle Kolia.

728
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,349
Well...

729
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,953
The mankind's centuries-old dream.

730
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,828
There we go!

731
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,194
Uncle Kolia, it's going to stop.

732
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,230
I admit I didn't recognize you,

733
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,271
You had changed, got so mature by far.

734
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,349
Oh, how quietly I stood there

735
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,792
When you sang for the boys to your
guitar.

736
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,756
It was so long ago...

737
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,515
So you didn't leave?

738
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,758
It's hard to recognize you now.

739
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,909
First the cars move the equipment.
We decided to stay and get a tan.

740
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,672
What do the scientists think now
about the perpetual motion machine?

741
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,514
What?

742
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,076
About the perpetual motion machine.

743
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,073
What machine?

744
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,429
The perpetuum mobile
that they just couldn't build.

745
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,074
Who's supposed to think?

746
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,915
The academic world.
Have they given up on the idea?

747
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,273
It seems they have.

748
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,234
Wasn't it too soon?

749
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,353
What too soon?

750
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,719
Dismissing the idea.

751
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,748
Have you invented the perpetual
motion machine?

752
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,035
Yes, I have.

753
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,955
Congratulations.

754
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,474
The man invented the perpetual
motion machine, and you...

755
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,472
The water's so cold.

756
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,513
And what's next?

757
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,198
What's next, I say?

758
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,159
Meaning?

759
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,078
You congratulated me, and what's
next?

760
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,719
Run to the store.

761
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,993
- No, I'm serious.
- It's just some bullshit.

762
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,428
And if it's not?

763
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,192
You're not Kulibin, are you?

764
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,557
The world's best scientists rack their
brains, and you - bang! - invented it.

765
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,752
They brushed it away just like you.

766
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,472
They didn't brush it away, they proved
it's impossible, you must know it.

767
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,956
But it revolves.

768
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,629
- What revolves?
- The wheel.

769
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,240
It was revolving all night,
and is now.

770
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,080
I got tired of watching it,
so I decided to take a walk.

771
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,313
What wheel?

772
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,553
The bike's wheel.

773
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,959
Right.

774
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,437
It's got a good bearing,
so it's revolving.

775
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,118
But not through the whole night.

776
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,031
Uncle Kolia, let's go and give it
another spin, maybe it'll spin then?

777
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,509
Uncle Kolia!

778
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,150
I'm going to my workplace.
As though I forgot to turn in the keys.

779
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,153
And you don't lose your chance.
Most important is to be aggressive.

780
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,038
Fall down and lie there.

781
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,391
C'mon, to brave you up.

782
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,796
He got no choice, he'll come.

783
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,869
- But why shall I fall?
- What do you mean, why?

784
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,550
- Did I get poisoned or something?
- No, not poisoned.

785
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,673
You got scared and fainted -
ah! and you're lying down.

786
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,559
- What did I get scared of?
- A mouse or something.

787
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,280
Your head went round,
and you're lying in a swoon.

788
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,839
You've got mice?

789
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,271
Oh, what do you care?
Just fall and lie.

790
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,358
All right, I'm off.

791
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,279
Lyuba, I'll run to my work.
I forgot to leave my keys there.

792
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,590
Don't be lonely here.

793
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,839
Fall! Fall!

794
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,957
Lyuba, fall with a cry.
He can't hear you. Got it?

795
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,792
Lyuba, get up.
He can't hear, cloth-ears.

796
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,599
Take the vase with chocolates
and smash it to smithereens.

797
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,116
And yell at the top of your voice,
or you won't get through to him.

798
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,835
Lyuba?

799
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,232
Lyuba, are you all right?

800
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,110
Lyuba?

801
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,910
Klava.

802
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,871
Klava, where're you?
Klava!

803
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,709
Klava!

804
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,709
Damn it!

805
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,910
Lyuba, what's wrong?

806
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,431
What happened, Lyuba?

807
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,838
What is it? What happened?

808
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,749
Lyuba?

809
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,991
Are you all right?

810
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,714
Is it your heart?

811
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,037
What are you feeling?

812
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,199
What?

813
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,314
- Kiss me.
- What? What?

814
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,191
Kiss me.

815
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,349
Lyuba...

816
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,592
Lyuba, it's ...

817
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,511
Not expedient, Lyuba.

818
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,151
That's how gradually we learn our
dreams to subdue.

819
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,154
The sailboat moves away into obscurity,

820
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,835
Between us, more and more of
insincerity.

821
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,195
My dear boy, it couldn't be
really you?

822
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,753
I so much believed your eyes,

823
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,355
I so much believed your lies...

824
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,238
Lyuba, how was it?

825
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,193
It's silly and ridiculous,
Oh, what the heck, it's so obvious.

826
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:56,197
No, I won't even recall
How could I wait for it at all...

827
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,316
Not expedient.

828
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,835
That's it.

829
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,634
Lyuba.

830
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,991
Don't get in the way of studying!
Don't get in the way of working!

831
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,550
One-two, arm-in-arm,
Three-four, our ranks intact!

832
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,076
If need be, we'll sound alarm,
It's the only way to act!

833
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,869
Our pioneers' salute
to patron Knyazev, for him we root!

834
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,755
Beer, vodka and moonshine
Out of our planet, as any wine!

835
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,430
Long live the science,
Long live the progress

836
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,956
And the wise policy of our Party
and its press!

837
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,792
Good afternoon, Lyuba.

838
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,554
Good afternoon.

839
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,751
See, I got 8 notebooks here.
I would like to send them.

840
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,511
Should I put them in a box or..?

841
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,435
I'd like to have a guarantee
that none of them gets lost.

842
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,393
I guess I'd better send them
by a registered parcel?

843
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,074
Nikolai Nikolayevich, dear.

844
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,195
Let's not be in a hurry with your
parcel.

845
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,471
I know it's none of
my business, Nikolai Nikolayevich.

846
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,799
But listen to my advice,
wait a little bit.

847
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,593
We can always do it.

848
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,196
What if you change your mind?

849
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,509
You fool!
You toad-eyed fool!

850
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,950
Why are you sitting and croaking here?

851
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,874
Can you at least spell the word
"statehood" correctly?

852
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,713
You'll spell it like " stategood" !

853
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,036
Don't you dare shouting at me!

854
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,755
Sergey Nikolayevich!

855
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,550
Sergey Nikolayevich,
come here!

856
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,871
There's some shit here
about stategood!

857
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,429
- Sergey Nikolayevich!
- What's the matter?

858
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,158
Some shit about stategood!

859
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,836
Come here,
let's goggle together.

860
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,355
Maybe at least you
got some brains in your bean?

861
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,397
- What's up?
- It's all sewn up!

862
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,113
- Away!
- What is it, you drunken lout?

863
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,475
C'mon, get him!

864
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,109
Let go!

865
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,229
Tie him up!

866
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,197
Give me his hand!

867
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,279
Hurray! Our side has won!
Tie me, tie me up.

868
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,475
He's drunk.

869
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,997
No, I'm not drunk.
You can't pull it off!

870
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,032
I just took the liberty of
sending my work by mail.

871
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,156
Whose post office is this?
Yours?

872
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,959
It's my post office, you idiot!

873
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,959
Oh, you toads!

874
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,998
I wrote down my thoughts and by
accident dropped a stone in your bog.

875
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,559
And what a croaking it has raised!

876
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,632
I hope I didn't catch against
your head, Sergey Nikolayevich?

877
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,995
Go on, shout.
To the police.

878
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,193
He's absolutely off his rocker.

879
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,635
Dimwits!

880
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,349
They don't like being
dimwits, that's the problem,

881
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,275
but then they like being
dimwits, they do!

882
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,552
They're leading Spinoza!
Have you ever seen Spinoza?

883
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,553
Here I am, a Spinoza
in a hat and with a tie.

884
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,109
Hello!
Hell's bells!

885
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,391
Well, I kicked up a racket, I did.

886
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,231
But I'm not drunk.
I never drink.

887
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,956
Did I insult anybody?

888
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,792
What about Sergey Nikolayevich?
And this one, Lyuba, too?

889
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,996
Take me to a hospital.

890
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,472
I have a headache.

891
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,515
You mean my calling them dimwits?
And what do you think they are?

892
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,916
All right, let it be a hospital.

893
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,069
Thank God the police was near,
or he would've said I don't know what.

894
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,836
- Well, what soberness conceals...
- ...drunkenness...

895
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,638
He doesn't drink.

896
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,030
I was born to a poor peasant
family, a ninth child.

897
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,634
Giving me any education
was out of the question.

898
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,917
As there was no upbringing.
We were brought up by labor.

899
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,116
Open your eyes and sit down.

900
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,358
Cross your legs.

901
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,988
I myself broke through
those strata of life over my head.

902
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,311
I displayed the signs of philosophical
consciousness since childhood.

903
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,835
I remember a foreman yelling at me,

904
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,391
and it made me wonder in some
while why he was yelling.

905
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,912
I read a lot, though I got into
much trouble because of it.

906
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,993
My father didn't approve, he made me
work more, but I kept reading.

907
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,033
Don't move your head, please.

908
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,397
Follow the hammer with your eyes.

909
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,631
And the more I read,

910
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,553
the more
troubled I became.

911
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,350
I looked around me and I thought
about how much they had piled up.

912
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,039
But there was no order.

913
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,473
Get dressed.

914
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,709
And so gradually I got preoccupied
with the thoughts about the state,

915
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,519
and, with sadness and amazement,
I came to understand

916
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,671
that we all were living
each to his own liking,

917
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,229
and hardly anyone cared
for the state's interests.

918
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,516
And even if anybody shouts at every
street corner about its interests,

919
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,114
he's just pretending,
his self comes first,

920
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,068
he just wants to look vanguard,
and thus steal more.

921
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,318
Take sedatives.

922
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,597
I saw how our state
was being squandered.

923
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,796
Each does his best at his place.

924
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,359
And still our state is alive.
What is it alive by?

925
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,155
And I came to a conclusion -
by its structure.

926
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,310
The structure of the state is such

927
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,789
that even with the minimum
that we're giving it,

928
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,434
it is still capable of
strengthening itself by some way.

929
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,073
But what if we, like ants,
brought the maximum to the state?

930
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,919
An absolutely normal man.

931
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,479
What happened, Knyazev?

932
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,954
To hell with them.
I just exploded.

933
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,796
I couldn't stand
human stupidity any longer.

934
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,396
I tell her one thing, and she -
let's wait and think.

935
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,118
She will think, that hen.

936
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,032
But why insult her?

937
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,955
She insulted me even more.
She thinks I'm an idiot.

938
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,792
She hasn't read a single line of this.

939
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,750
She's my sister's friend, and my sister
says it's bullshit, waste of time.

940
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,310
But what's it all about?

941
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,077
My thoughts about the state.
I've been writing it for 7 years.

942
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,356
Let's not start it now...

943
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,476
No, leave it, I'll take a look.

944
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,160
Take a look.
May I go now?

945
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,236
You may, only you'll have
to apologize to the post workers.

946
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,953
All right, I'll apologize.

947
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,388
I'll apologize.

948
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,996
All right, go then.
I'll return it later.

949
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,154
- There're 8 notebooks there.
- So what?

950
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,675
In case something happens.
There're eight of them.

951
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,434
- All right, eight.
- I don't want them to get lost.

952
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,835
Nothing will get lost.

953
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,672
You know... here... perhaps it is...

954
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,714
Inventory of the life of Knyazev
Notes and drawings

955
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,474
A cornflower field,

956
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,438
And the grass a-little stings.

957
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,237
I'm lying as though drunk,

958
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,072
I forgot about all things.

959
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,708
I'm lying, arms spread out,

960
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,478
The wind bends the bushes down,

961
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,914
And a melancholy willow

962
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,472
Sings a sad song with a moan.

963
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,154
Oh, you, my dear willow,

964
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,668
What do you sing about my fate?

965
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,148
Maybe I will know glory

966
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,832
Orjust die before my date.

967
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,309
In that song of yours so doleful

968
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,795
I do not understand a bit.

969
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,435
Itjust brings me more depression,

970
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,318
Though there's no lack of it.

971
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,835
A cornflower field,

972
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,349
And the grass a-little stings.

973
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,914
I'm lying as though drunk,

974
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,956
I forgot about all things.

975
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,156
Look,
the farther a stick is from the shore,

976
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,195
the longer it takes to throw it out.

977
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,276
Yes, yes.

978
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,431
Excuse me, sir, you reinvented
the wheel.

979
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,714
- Why?
- It's been known since long ago.

980
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,271
During a storm, ships try to get
as far from the shore as possible.

981
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,960
I didn't mean the law as such.

982
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,315
It's just so like people.

983
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,154
- Any Salem's left?
- Here.

984
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,478
The strongest go farther.

985
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,638
As a result, we have a storm,
a storm in our everyday life.

986
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,078
And the winner is the strongest,
the one who rows away farthest.

987
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,593
It's too clever.

988
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,274
It's too wrong
to be clever.

989
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,156
Why?

990
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,118
The point is how
to get the farthest from the shore.

991
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,069
I'm not saying
"the strongest" .

992
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,390
Perhaps it should be
"the most cunning" ?

993
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,275
Help!

994
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,918
Quick!
Come here!

995
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,749
I meant another
strength, a real strength.

996
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,069
What matters is the result.

997
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,068
When we estimate
our strength correctly,

998
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,869
we can clearly see what we have
to do to achieve our aim.

999
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,116
Excuse me, what did you say?

1000
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,396
- It wasn't I who said it.
- Who, then?

1001
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,550
- Benedict.
- Benedict?

1002
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,715
Spinoza.

1003
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,750
- But he was Boruch.
- Baruch. Baruch Spinoza.

1004
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,593
Excuse me, I didn't get what he said.

1005
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,433
You'll never get it.

1006
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,236
Oh, hell's bells!

1007
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,234
Where're you going?
You'll catch cold.

1008
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,235
The water is 7 C., man.

1009
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,673
He's sloshed.

1010
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,912
You're going to catch cold!

1011
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,235
Must be a polar bear.

1012
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,030
I'll bet he's added 40
to his own 36.

1013
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,354
A Siberian, they fear nothing.

1014
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,236
76 degrees, for sure.

1015
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,235
Come on!

1016
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,278
I'm drowning!

1017
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,477
- Is he serious?
- Kidding.

1018
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,755
He's drowning!

1019
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,036
Hey! Are you serious?

1020
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,316
Of course, he's serious!
What the damn!

1021
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,118
Help him!

1022
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,670
Guys, why are you standing?

1023
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,070
- He's going to drown.
- He'll swallow a bit of water and...

1024
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,355
Holy shit!

1025
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,597
Hey, hold on!

1026
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,193
Why did he go in in the first place?

1027
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,229
He's under me.

1028
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,235
I grabbed him by his shorts,
but he slipped out of them.

1029
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,512
- Where's he?
- He was here.

1030
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,830
A boat.

1031
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,469
The boat!

1032
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,317
The boat!

1033
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,874
There he is.

1034
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,670
- He's slipping away.
- Catch him.

1035
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,869
They got him.

1036
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,228
They got him!

1037
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,719
Boys!

1038
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,592
- Hold his head.
- I got it.

1039
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,795
Can you do mouth to mouth?

1040
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,748
Wait with mouth-to-mouth.
Shake him and get the water out.

1041
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,148
Oh, what's this?

1042
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,392
Come on.
He gulped down chockfull of water!

1043
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,993
Is his mouth open?

1044
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,318
Hold him vertical.

1045
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,154
Enough, put him down.

1046
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,509
Lay him down.

1047
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,275
Boys, put his pants on.

1048
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,350
Pump him up.

1049
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,795
First put them on, then pump.

1050
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,439
You'd better run to the store.

1051
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,352
Or they'll do us in,
those polar bears.

1052
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,355
I guess you'll be awarded
a medal now, right?

1053
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,832
With no pants on, it doesn't count.

1054
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,719
What do you mean, without pants
it doesn't count?

1055
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,793
If a drowning person has no pants on,
it doesn't count that you saved him.

1056
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,952
We have to get his pants,
then there will be a medal.

1057
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,076
Ira, come here, hold his head.

1058
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,148
Boys, put the pants on!

1059
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,395
Ira, we all got our pants.

1060
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,353
He seems to have gathered his wits.

1061
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,594
Are you back with us?

1062
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,834
Well, happy birthday, man!

1063
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,719
He looks quite alive.

1064
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,548
Just look at him making a run of it!

1065
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,637
And he didn't even say thank you.

1066
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,471
Oh, boys!

1067
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,633
Greetings to Benedict Spinoza!

1068
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,190
Mom!

1069
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:40,110
Mom, uncle Kolia's coming to see you!
He's starting a new life.

1070
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,755
Lyuba.

1071
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,873
You see, I...

1072
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,470
I got totally free of those...

1073
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,678
ideas that...

1074
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,913
for a long time...

1075
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,553
Well, that's not the point.

1076
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:41,633
The point is that
I'm proposing to you.

1077
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,799
I love you.

1078
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,799
And I don't love you.

1079
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,353
Well, think about it, Lyuba.

1080
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,919
This is for you.

1081
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,268
And something else.

1082
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,311
Please forgive me if you can.

1083
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,512
Well, for what was today
at the post office.

1084
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,838
I'm very sorry.

1085
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,559
Uncle Kolia, mom is saying 'yes'.
She was just kidding.

1086
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,513
I've invented a new machine, Vovik.

1087
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,638
- Perpetual?
- No.

1088
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,633
Not perpetual, but very powerful.

1089
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,432
It's powerful, but it's
the size of a matchbox.

1090
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,795
The principle of its construction
is very simple.

1091
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,236
We'll talk about it later, uncle Kolia.
It's high time for you to get married.

1092
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,789
My mom is the best. Let's go.

1093
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,196
It's time, Vovik, it's time.

1094
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,434
Come on!

1095
