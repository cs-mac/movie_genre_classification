1
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,085
Mama, it isn't even finished.

2
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,587
it is as far as you're
concerned, young lady.

3
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,589
This is hardly the way to
spend a sunday morning

4
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,591
listening to a minstrel song.

5
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,095
It's papa's favorite.
It's not mine.

6
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,097
I'm going to put it up here
out of your reach.

7
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,103
No, mama I can pull the chair here

8
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,109
step up here,
and I've got it.

9
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,619
Well...

10
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,624
I'm going to put it up here
on top of the book shelf.

11
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,636
I see.

12
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,149
How about there?

13
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,153
I haven't figured that out... yet.

14
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:48,160
Well, at least
you're an honest child.

15
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,662
Mother?

16
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,663
Mother?

17
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,166
Yes, augusta?

18
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,667
When I get ready
may I go on ahead?

19
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,169
I have to meet
stanley henderson.

20
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,672
You can't go like that, you're naked.

21
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,674
We're going to wait for your father

22
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,177
and then we're all going
to church together

23
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,180
just as if we belong
to the one family.

24
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,184
Oh, mother, his train might
not even get here on time.

25
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,186
If it doesn't, walter will call
from the station.

26
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,190
Walter?
Walter?

27
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,691
Yes, ma'am?

28
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,194
Isn't it time that you were
leaving for the station?

29
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,195
I was just going, mrs. griffith.

30
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,697
Good.
Oh, mama I'm all ready.

31
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,699
Can I go with walter
to pick up papa?

32
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,703
Please, mama, please?
Can I, can I?

33
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,206
May i.
Please?

34
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,706
All right.

35
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,710
Weee! I'm going to pick up papa
I'm going to pick up papa!

36
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,712
I'm going to pick up papa!

37
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,714
I'm going to
pick up papa!

38
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,716
She does get a little hysterical
at the mention of papa,

39
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,719
doesn't she?

40
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,723
Now, stand up, there.

41
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,225
You see you keep
your dress clean.

42
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,227
Yes, mama.

43
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,730
My little consolation prize

44
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,735
come on now.

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,741
We're going to pick up papa, we're going...

46
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:14,246
slow down, child, or you'll us
yourself up before we get there.

47
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,249
Walter, does papa own the whole rail road?

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,751
No, he's just a superintendent.

49
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,254
Oh.

50
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,734
Being a superintendent is much
better than being the fellow

51
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,259
who owns the rail road.

52
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,263
- It is?
- Sure.

53
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,763
He gives out all the orders

54
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,767
and don't have to pay out
any salaries.

55
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:40,272
Walter, what's a consolation prize?

56
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,274
A consolation prize?

57
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,277
Oh, that's just a trifling
no-account nothing

58
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,779
that someone gets
when they loses.

59
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,282
Do you think I'm a trifling
no-account nothing?

60
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,284
Not you, child,
not you.

61
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,288
I bet neither does papa.

62
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,045
Won't you come home,
bill bailey?

63
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,047
Won't you come home?

64
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,550
She sings the whole night through?

65
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:12,054
I'll do the cooking, honey,
I'll pay the rent?

66
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,057
I know I've done you wrong?

67
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:18,560
Remember that rainy
evening, I threw you out?

68
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,064
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?

69
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:25,567
I know that I'm to blame
and ain't it a shame?

70
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:29,071
Bill bailey won't you
please come home?

71
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,073
Won't you come home,
bill bailey?

72
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,075
Won't you come home?

73
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,578
She sings the whole night long?

74
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:40,082
I'll do the cooking, honey,
I'll pay the rent?

75
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,585
I know I've done you wrong?

76
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,588
Remember that rainy
evening I threw you out?

77
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,093
With nothing but a fine-toothed comb?

78
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,596
I know that I'm to blame
well ain't it a shame?

79
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:57,599
Bill bailey won't you
please come home?

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,104
Come home?

81
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:10,112
Bill bailey won't you
please?

82
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:15,118
Come home?

83
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,122
How sweet it is.
Have a little booze, pal.

84
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,124
Ah, no more for me,
I'm driving.

85
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,127
Oh, well how about you?
Oh, no thanks.

86
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,628
Then, in the case
of that thought

87
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,130
I'll just drink a little toast

88
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,634
to the best emergency crew
on the moonstar railroad.

89
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:38,640
Still got a little left. I'll
make it one for the road.

90
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,142
Well...

91
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:43,145
looks like we're gonna be
in grainseville on time.

92
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,147
I promised the family I'd
go to church with them

93
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,148
this morning.

94
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,649
Well, I could slow her up

95
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,151
or head off into the next siding.

96
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,654
Or drive into a creek
or something?

97
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,156
No, no, no.

98
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:56,339
It's about time I started
going to church again.

99
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,659
I'm a big boy now.

100
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,206
Got my library card
and everything.

101
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,301
I used to go all the time, you know.

102
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,168
I didn't mind it at all.

103
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,672
But then after...
hey, there's corrie!

104
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:21,184
Well, fellas,
thanks for the whistle.

105
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:36,698
Hiya, sweetheart!

106
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,200
Gosh, did I miss you!

107
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,202
Did you, papa?
Did you really?

108
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:42,704
You know you're just
like all the other females,

109
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:45,207
in desperate need of reassurance.

110
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
I promise,
while I was away

111
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,712
I didn't even think of any
other girl of six but you.

112
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:53,215
Oh, papa,
you're wonderful.

113
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:56,219
When I'm around you, I think I am.

114
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,221
How are you, walt?
How are you, mr. griffith?

115
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:02,224
Say you do look lovely in
that little white ensemble...

116
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,226
morning, mr. griffith,
back for a while?

117
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,727
Well, until the next
emergency, bert.

118
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,729
Good, good.

119
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,232
Before we go any further,

120
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,734
it's time for our history lesson.

121
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:16,238
Now, what is today,
july 8th, famous for?

122
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,740
You're going to church.

123
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,243
Besides that.

124
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,744
I don't know, papa.

125
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,246
There you go.

126
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,747
You forgot to look
at the calendar

127
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,250
before coming out of the house.

128
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,254
Now on july 8th 1779 the british
burned fairfield, connecticut.

129
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,756
You know, augusta came into the living room

130
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,759
almost naked.

131
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:42,764
I'm afraid my history lessons
are lost on you, corrie.

132
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,267
I think you're a trifle
more basic.

133
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:48,771
Now you wait here while papa
goes in and sends his report.

134
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,773
Morning, mr. griffith,
everything go well?

135
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,775
Well, I'd say fair
what?

136
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,778
Send this to the main office at fort worth.

137
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,781
Wreck at sidden's landing.

138
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:03,285
Two freight cars and one flat car derailed.

139
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:06,289
Track clear,
traffic proceeding normally.

140
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:13,296
Hey, mr. griffith, look
at the apple of your eye.

141
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:20,803
Corrie, get down from there!

142
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:25,808
You get down from there
right away!

143
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,811
That was right away,
wasn't it, papa?

144
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,317
Now what is your poor mother going to say

145
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,818
when she sees that dress.

146
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,321
Maybe if
I don't turn around.

147
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,824
You know who's gonna get
blame for this, don't you?

148
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,325
I'll tell her the truth

149
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:47,329
mother knows
I'm an honest child.

150
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,833
Never mind, I'll take the
rap, I'm bigger than you.

151
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,345
Now, I'll cover you
from the back

152
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,846
when you get into the house

153
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,848
you run up to your room
and take your dress off.

154
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,850
Thank you, papa.
Oh, it's really nothing

155
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,355
you only get one to five
as an accessory.

156
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,860
Good morning.

157
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,363
Now let's get right back
into the car,

158
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:22,364
we're late for church.

159
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,867
Nice to see you, dear.
Thank you.

160
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:26,369
Hello, papa.

161
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:35,878
Miss corrie, what happened to your dress?

162
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,382
Turn around.

163
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,886
Well young lady?

164
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,888
A funny thing happened to
us down at the station,

165
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,390
I was holding corrie
in my arms...

166
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,393
mother, I slid down
the coal chute.

167
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,395
With no help from your father?

168
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,897
No, I did it all by myself.

169
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,901
You really look a mess, corrie,
when are you gonna grow up?

170
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,904
Never! I've seen what it's done to you.

171
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,635
Now that's enough of that.

172
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:09,411
You go right into the house and
have ellie give you a bath.

173
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,185
Can't I stay home with her? after all,

174
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,416
that's a large bath tub,
she's liable to drown.

175
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,918
She's a very strong swimmer.

176
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,420
We are going to church

177
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,423
and corrie is going to say
her prayers at home.

178
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,926
I'll only pray for papa.

179
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,431
I think that's a very good idea.

180
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,934
Now you go.

181
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,937
Can't we wait for corrie to take a bath?

182
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,439
We'll only be a few minutes late.

183
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,941
Oh, father, we have
to be there on time.

184
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,444
I have a young man waiting
for me at the church steps.

185
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,945
Only one? hm!

186
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,948
Hardly seems worthwhile to make the trip.

187
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,926
Besides, mother has to
play the organ

188
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,453
at the services.

189
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,956
Your father seems to have
forgotten about that.

190
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,958
You two are up to it again.

191
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,460
Up to what?

192
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,463
Cutting corrie out,
excluding her from the family.

193
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,965
Jack, you talk such nonsense!

194
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,467
I get it's just a feeling

195
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:08,470
whenever I see the two of
you gang up on her.

196
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,972
I admit I could be wrong.

197
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:14,477
After all I voted for
william jennings bryan.

198
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:15,978
Three times.

199
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,982
It's no use trying to
discuss anything with you.

200
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,985
You just turn everything into a joke.

201
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,489
That's how I find things.

202
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,763
Well, I haven't got the
same escape that you have.

203
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:33,995
You've been in this condition
more and more often.

204
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,498
I am not in that condition.

205
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:40,001
If I were I would have slid down
the coal chute with corrie.

206
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,003
And you'd be taking a bath too.

207
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,506
And you wouldn't need to go to church.

208
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:47,509
It's a wonder
you didn't do it.

209
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,011
I didn't think of that.

210
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:55,517
Walter, I have told you again
and again not to come this way.

211
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:59,521
Just looking at that house
makes me physically ill.

212
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,523
Imagine anybody having the bad taste

213
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:04,025
to paint their house
that awful color.

214
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,029
I admit it's a little nauseous
at this time of the morning,

215
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,532
but at sunset it does have
a pretty effect.

216
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,534
It's original anyway.

217
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,035
I'd be eternally grateful

218
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:17,038
to anyone who would do something
about that terrible house

219
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,042
up to and including
burning it to the ground.

220
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,544
Father, if we're so late to church

221
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:25,046
that stanley henderson
III doesn't wait for me,

222
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:27,550
I'll... i'll not forgive
you till my dying day.

223
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,551
Step on it, walter,
we have two heathens

224
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:32,555
who are in desperate need of salvation.

225
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,560
Good morning, ma'am, good morning, augusta.

226
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,564
I'm sorry I'm late, stanley.
Oh, that's all right.

227
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,567
At least I won't have to
wait till my dying day.

228
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,568
I'll sit with augusta.

229
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,571
Suit yourself.

230
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:51,709
Good morning.
Good morning, amberlyn.

231
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,575
Good morning, stanley.

232
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,076
You can take your hands out
of your pocket, stanley,

233
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,759
the collection plate won't be
around for another half hour.

234
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,083
How would you even know they have one?

235
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,086
Good morning, amberlyn.

236
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,088
How do you do, dr. elkins?

237
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,590
I found this lost sheep

238
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,091
wandering around
the neighborhood.

239
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,593
Congratulations.

240
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,596
Now you'd better get to the organ.

241
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,598
Well, it's been a long time, jack.

242
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,601
Yes, it has, it has.

243
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,579
I haven't missed any of your sermons,

244
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:23,104
amberlyn repeats them
at home word for word,

245
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:26,608
especially the fire and brimstone type.

246
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,610
I think she's a little
worried about my soul.

247
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,111
Aren't you?

248
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,615
Well I have other problems like
keeping the trains on time.

249
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,117
Where's little corrie? she
following in your footsteps?

250
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:39,121
No, she's at home, praying for my soul too.

251
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,623
I've got so many people
praying for my soul,

252
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:45,127
anything I do personally
would be an anti-climax.

253
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,130
Mr. griffith, would you buy a raffle

254
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,132
for the church for 50 cents?

255
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,135
Now what would I do
with a church if I won one?

256
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:57,139
Jack, this is for the benefit
of the church fund.

257
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,144
Are you coming?

258
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,649
No, no, i...
i just thought of an emergency.

259
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,149
I'll see you next sunday.

260
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,151
Fortunately for you
I'm not a betting man.

261
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,630
You'll be missing a good sermon.

262
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,657
Ha ha, don't worry about
that, I'll hear it tonight.

263
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,923
Well, mr. loubie, how are you
this fine sunday morning?

264
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,926
Busy, mr. griffith,
very busy.

265
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,905
Mr. loubie, I'd like you
to have the pleasure

266
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,431
of purchasing the last ticket
on a very unusual raffle.

267
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,433
Raffle?
Not interested.

268
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,436
Oh, but this raffle was organized

269
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,438
by the railroad brotherhood,

270
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,440
for little tots left
homeless by train accidents.

271
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,944
Now you couldn't turn
down a cause like that?

272
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,445
Watch me.

273
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,447
But the tickets
are only 50 cents.

274
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,950
Oh, I know it's a real bargain,

275
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,953
but I think I'll have to turn it down.

276
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,461
Uh, in view of the fact that
this is the last ticket,

277
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,464
I have been given the authority
to reduce the price to 25 cents

278
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,466
and my daughter, corrie,
will draw the winning ticket

279
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,469
right here.
I have no change.

280
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,470
Don't worry about that, mr. loubie,

281
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,474
I personally will lend you a quarter.

282
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,953
There's the quarter
and here is your ticket.

283
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,977
Would you please draw?

284
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,480
I never win in a raffle
anyhow, number seven.

285
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,481
Number seven.

286
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,483
See what did I tell you?

287
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,486
Number seven?
That's me, I won.

288
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,669
You really couldn't lose mr.
Loubie, because...

289
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,971
here's the quarter you loaned me.

290
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,496
- Thank you.
- Now, what's the first prize?

291
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,500
Oh-ho-ho-ho,
now for the big moment.

292
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,004
Incidentally, the contents of this envelope

293
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,007
were sealed and unseen by any human eyes

294
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,009
since slipped within by a blindfolded

295
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,513
justice of the supreme court.

296
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:10,522
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

297
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,024
What is it, mr. griffith,
what is it?

298
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,844
Oh, mr. loubie,
you're gonna be thrilled

299
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,029
by this first prize.
What is it?

300
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,032
It's a complete paint job on
your house, free and clear

301
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,534
a paint job?

302
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,036
Everybody in town's been
trying to win this.

303
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,628
Well, I guess it's worth a quarter.

304
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,539
Now what color
would you suggest?

305
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,542
Oh, same color we got now,
just touch it up a bit.

306
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,546
Oh, uh, I'm afraid that we
couldn't possibly match that.

307
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,050
Well how about aquamarine?

308
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,052
Orange?

309
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,054
Yellow?

310
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,555
What colors do you have?

311
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,059
Ah, the raffle committee s
ays a beautiful ivory white,

312
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,062
this is used exclusively
by the country club set.

313
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,563
White...

314
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,565
well, just go ahead
and have it painted.

315
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,570
I'm sorry I got mixed up
in the whole thing.

316
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,577
I just don't know what's
happened to walter.

317
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,080
He always picks us
up after church.

318
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,082
It's a lovely day for a walk.

319
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,587
And mr. griffith will have
some explaining to do too.

320
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,093
Papa?

321
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,597
My father's right
about your father,

322
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,099
he tipples.

323
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,101
As far as I am concerned, stanley,

324
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,603
your father can go climb a tree.

325
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,108
Seems like that would be one
of your father's specialties.

326
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,111
I'm sorry you caught m e
spending my time like this

327
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,616
on the sabbath but mr.
Loubie just won a raffle.

328
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,120
And first prize
was painting his house?

329
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,125
I figured that was better than
burning it down to the ground.

330
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,130
I love you, jack griffith.

331
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,135
I think mr. loubie and I
are two very lucky people.

332
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,141
Mr. loubie wasn't so lucky,

333
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,645
every ticket had number seven
on it, he couldn't lose.

334
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,648
Well that's what happens
when you hire cheap labor,

335
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,651
they talk too much.

336
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,154
You look as though you're read
for another bath, young lady.

337
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,157
I haven't taken the first one yet, mother.

338
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,659
Well, all right.

339
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,161
You're not angry at me?

340
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,662
No more than george's mother

341
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,666
when he told her about the cherry tree.

342
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,170
See you later, darling.
All right, sweet heart.

343
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,172
Back to work.

344
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,280
Come in, father,
come in.

345
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:10,284
Folks, I'd like you all to
meet my father, anthony ghio,

346
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,286
mayor of texarkana.

347
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,424
How do you do, everybody?

348
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,791
Now I'm sure we'd all
appreciate a few words?

349
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,793
Of course, of course.

350
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,795
Last time your grandfather
restricted himself

351
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,797
to a few words, he was six months old

352
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,299
and his mother stuck a bottle in his mouth.

353
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,301
Dear friends of grangeville,

354
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,804
it's a constant pleasure to
come to your beautiful city

355
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,806
and spend a few days
with my daughter

356
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:34,308
and my two lovely grandchildren.

357
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,812
Notice how he left me out?

358
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,314
And it is also interesting
to see my son-in-law,

359
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,817
jack griffith, every once in a while.

360
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,820
I liked it better when he left me out.

361
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:50,324
But this party is not for
family reminiscences, no,

362
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,326
nor should I squander my, uh,

363
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,328
charming politic al personality

364
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,831
on citizens who are not
eligible to vote for me.

365
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,836
That reminds me of a story...

366
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:06,340
- father, father...
- there was... um...oh, yes.

367
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,842
Sit here, mr. ghio.

368
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:09,844
No, no, I'll just sit
back her out of the way,

369
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,346
thank you so much. thank you.

370
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:18,853
Everybody, miss freda summers
will now sing, "rose of tralee".

371
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:30,865
Papa, will you sing bill bailey later?

372
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,368
My agent couldn't book me in.

373
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:46,881
<i>The pale moon was rising
up on the green mountain?</i>

374
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:50,384
<i>The sun was declining?</i>

375
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:54,889
<i>Beneath the blue sea?</i>

376
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,392
<i>When I strayed with my love</i>

377
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:02,897
<i>to the pure crystal fountain?</i>

378
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:07,401
<i>That stands
in the beautiful?</i>

379
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:11,406
<i>Vale of tralee</i>

380
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:26,922
<i>the cool shades of evening
their mantle were spreading</i>

381
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:35,422
<i>and mary was smiling, was listening to me</i>

382
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:40,935
<i>the moon through the
valley her pale rays...</i>

383
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:44,438
I think I'd better go for the ice cream.

384
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,942
<i>When I won the heart</i>

385
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:53,447
<i>of a rose of tralee</i>

386
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,950
I bet he'll bring some
strawberry ice cream,

387
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,953
my favorite.

388
00:23:58,453 --> 00:23:59,954
Well, I know he won't bring vanilla

389
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:02,457
because that's my favorite.

390
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,998
- Hi, norman.
- Hello, mr. griffith.

391
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,500
Gallon of ice cream, strawberry.

392
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,002
Yes, sir, right away.

393
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:50,004
You want me to mix it up
with a little vanilla?

394
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,507
- No, just strawberry.
- Yes, sir.

395
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,510
What is the matter with you?

396
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,512
Well, mr. griffith,
today is the day

397
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,015
joan ought to be having
that baby any minute now.

398
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:04,019
Oh, oh. well, what are you doing here?

399
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,520
Oh, it's all right,
I'll get a report.

400
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,024
We don't have a telephone
but old doc wright,

401
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:11,025
he's gonna wave
a handkerchief,

402
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:14,028
two waves if it's a girl
and one if it's a boy

403
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,030
and the wilson's
will call me here.

404
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:26,040
A boy or a girl? huh?

405
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,042
No, he's not in the store.

406
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,044
Yes, I'll tell him, goodbye.

407
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:34,048
Yes, honest, I'll tell
him, please, goodbye!

408
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,050
Norman, you should be home.

409
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,552
Why didn't cosgrove
give you some time off?

410
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,554
Oh, he had to go home for lunch.

411
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:42,556
Look, you go ahead
and I'll fill in for you

412
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:43,058
till he gets back.

413
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:44,558
Oh, mr. cosgrove
would kill me.

414
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,060
A husband should be with his wife

415
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:47,561
at a time like this.

416
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,063
Are you sure you have time, mr. griffith?

417
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:52,066
Oh, don't worry about that,
there's still three tenors

418
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,068
and a coloratura
on the program.

419
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,070
You can have a large
family before they finish.

420
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,571
Well thank you, mr. griffith, thank you.

421
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,574
Go ahead.

422
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:04,078
<i>Won't you come home
bill bailey</i>

423
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,580
<i>won't you come home</i>

424
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,081
<i>she sings the whole night through</i>

425
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:13,588
anyone here?

426
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,091
Well...

427
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,592
what can I do for you, sir?

428
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,094
A penny's worth
of jelly beans.

429
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:23,097
A penny's worth of jelly beans.

430
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:26,600
A penny's worth
of jelly beans.

431
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,603
There doesn't seem to be any jelly beans.

432
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:31,605
You see the trouble is
they've been shifting...

433
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,608
are you new or something?

434
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,610
As a matter of fact, I am.

435
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:39,613
Say...
would you do me a favor?

436
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,614
What?

437
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:43,117
You see I gotta make
some banana splits,

438
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,618
and I'm a little
out of practice,

439
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,620
now if I made one,
would you eat it?

440
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,622
I don't have enough money.

441
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:52,126
Oh, don't worry about that,
sit right down, son.

442
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,628
You see today we have a
special on banana splits,

443
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:55,629
one penny.

444
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,132
Can I go get my brothers and sisters?

445
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:02,137
Well, when you taste it
you might not like it.

446
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:21,215
Try that on for size.

447
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,717
You forgot the cherry.

448
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,721
Well I told you I was out of practice.

449
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:29,724
Hi, cosgrove.

450
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,232
There's one for your sister.

451
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,234
That's better, here's your penny.

452
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:41,735
Penny?

453
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:44,738
Keep your shirt on, cosgrove,
I'll make up the difference.

454
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,739
Where's norman?

455
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,241
I sent him home to his wife.

456
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,243
Well he can stay there
as far as I'm concerned

457
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,245
- he just lost his job.
- Wait a minute,

458
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,747
you can't fire norman
with a new baby

459
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,249
and another mouth to feed.

460
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,752
Any law in the land says
I have to feed it?

461
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:01,255
How can you be so mean? because I enjoy it,

462
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:04,259
a man can't really do anything
well unless he enjoys it.

463
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,742
Let's go in the back for
a little cough medicine.

464
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,767
Not on me, you don't have a drink!

465
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:16,271
I'll buy the bottle, diamond jim.

466
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,782
Nothing like security.

467
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,790
Oh, pardon me.

468
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:42,797
And 49 cents for the triple banana split.

469
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,303
Here's 50 cents, I gave
him an extra cherry.

470
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:02,316
...
you, uh.

471
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,819
You didn't pour me even, jack.

472
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,334
There you are, doctor.

473
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:23,338
Good luck.

474
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,345
...
say.

475
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,847
Did you ever think of selling this store?

476
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,349
Well, I might.

477
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,851
You can't get any decent
help around this town.

478
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:41,855
Now I have to look around for
somebody to take norman's place.

479
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,859
That'll be a kick in the head for him.

480
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:50,365
You're a tough man to get mellow.

481
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,371
You, uh, you thinking of buying?

482
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,373
Well, I got a little
syndicate lurking around

483
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:00,874
for a small investment.

484
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,377
You've got it if I get the right price.

485
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,880
What do you consider the right price?

486
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,904
How about that?

487
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:34,409
No, but I'll come down a little.

488
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,915
Tell you what, cosgrove,

489
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,919
- suppose we split the difference?
- Ok, I'll be losing money

490
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,922
but I don't want to use
any more of that pad.

491
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,426
Of course if we make a deal

492
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,428
I'd expect you to hang around for a month

493
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:56,930
you know, so the new owner
gets things ship-shape.

494
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,932
I'd put that in the agreement.

495
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,935
Well, cosgrove,

496
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,939
I think we could say we got a deal.

497
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,123
Here's the ice tea.

498
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,124
Oh, how nice.

499
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,627
And the sandwiches are in the icebox.

500
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,628
Thank you sweetheart.

501
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,129
Now then, dear,

502
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,632
I'll be back,
in two to three hours.

503
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,133
Don't rush, darling,
take your time.

504
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:35,636
Bye, bye daddy.
Bye, sweetheart.

505
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,638
Now as to the notes
of our last meeting...

506
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,154
feed the kitty

507
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,161
don't you ever bring a full bottle?

508
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,174
Clear the court.

509
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:19,680
Gentlemen do you realize
on july 19th, 1848,

510
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,682
the first women's rights convention

511
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:24,685
was held at seneca falls
in the state of new york.

512
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,687
The north is just the only place
they can get away with it.

513
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:29,189
Ever since that day we men
have been in trouble.

514
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,691
Women are running everything.

515
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,670
It's on account of women
that the drug stores

516
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:34,195
don't open on a sunday morning.

517
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,198
No speeches, just shoot.

518
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:43,204
How sweet it is.
I let it ride.

519
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,208
Now, if we get a cold or a cough
and want a shot of medicine,

520
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,211
we have to wait till sunday afternoon.

521
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:54,215
But for the measly sum of $500 each,

522
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,719
we can own that drug store
lock, stock and barrel

523
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,220
and it's the barrel we're interested in.

524
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,223
Are you going to shoot?

525
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:05,727
Oh!

526
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,729
Ha ha,
there it is again.

527
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,231
I should have let him keep talking.

528
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:14,234
Well don't let it be lonely,
fill it up, fill it up.

529
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:16,737
Also for the measly sum of $500,

530
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:19,740
we'll each receive a
nice profit every month

531
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:23,243
besides, each having a private key,

532
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,746
in case we get thirsty on a sunday morning.

533
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:28,248
A key, sounds good to me.

534
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:30,751
- Count me in.
- Not me, not a chance.

535
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:33,754
I have more practical
things to do with my money.

536
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,256
You're covered.

537
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,759
You know my station
agent' s been telling me

538
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,262
about those little train trips
you've been making to waco.

539
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,264
I told him that they were undoubtedly

540
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,766
for business purposes

541
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,769
and that girl you meet
every week up there

542
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,771
must be a close relative
like a cousin or something.

543
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,274
Come to think of it,

544
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:56,777
I've always wanted
to own a drug store.

545
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,779
Count me in.

546
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,782
I thought you'd feel that way.

547
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,784
How about you, frank?

548
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:05,787
Sorry, not me.

549
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,291
Now, I never wanted to bring this up but...

550
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,794
remember you were filling
out that bill of lading

551
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:17,297
for the insurance company
to get your settlement?

552
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,800
Now I wonder if they knew... count me in.

553
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:25,806
Me too before you start
digging in to my past, ho-ho!

554
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:26,853
How about you, leopold?

555
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,811
I've never done anything wrong in my life.

556
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:34,816
Except that once at the creek...

557
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,317
ok, shoot, blackmailer

558
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,322
I will pass out the keys
to my friends next week.

559
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:45,826
On with the game.

560
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:48,329
How sweet it is.

561
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:02,843
My partner, mr. keith,

562
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:04,344
will give you some passes for the circus

563
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:05,847
in return for your graciousness.

564
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,849
There you are, young
man, two passes for you.

565
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,851
- Thank you.
- And two passes for you, sir,

566
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,354
thank you very, very much.

567
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:15,356
Now just a minute,

568
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,858
since you won't be working here next week,

569
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:21,362
you won't be needing these.

570
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:25,366
- Hello, norman.
- Hiya, cosgrove.

571
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,870
Here's the paper,
here's the check.

572
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,874
Sign the paper and the check is yours.

573
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,382
Norman, you are now in
full charge of the store.

574
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,885
- Me?
- Oh yes...

575
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:48,388
my syndicate requires that they
receive 50% of the profits

576
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:49,389
for their investment.

577
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,893
The other 50% is yours.
Agreeable?

578
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,895
I can't believe it.

579
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,396
Now you can have all the
babies you wanna have.

580
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,899
50%, my goodness.

581
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,902
Oh yes, ah, there is another
little clause in the contract.

582
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,905
Mr. cosgrove will stay on for one month

583
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,406
and work under your supervision.

584
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:09,410
Well I guess you can't really
find good help in this town.

585
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,913
Well, I guess that's true.
But do the best you can.

586
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:16,417
You poor soul.

587
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,421
Oh, uh, cosgrove. what do you want?

588
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,422
Those passes for the circus,

589
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,926
I don't think you'll have time to go.

590
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:27,427
Oh and clean up the prescription counter.

591
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,430
It's a mess.

592
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,441
I want to talk to you, jack.

593
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,944
Well, shall I drop everything?

594
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:47,448
Later will do, smarty boots,
let's get corrie to bed.

595
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:57,958
What do you want to talk to papa about?

596
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,459
She's my manager.

597
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,961
Young lady,

598
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,463
I'm going to be as honest
with you as you are with me,

599
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:05,465
it's none of your business.

600
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,967
Now you get down and say your prayers

601
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,969
- and then you get into bed.
- Just a moment,

602
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,472
we will now have our history lesson.

603
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,474
What is tomorrow famous for?

604
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:17,978
Washington went to connecticut
to become general.

605
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,480
Not even close

606
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:24,485
- wyoming made it to the union.
- No chance.

607
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,486
I don't know, papa.

608
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,989
The circus is coming to town.

609
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,990
Oh, papa, can we go, can we go?

610
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,993
Sure we can go.

611
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:35,495
Yes, well, now that's the end
of her sleep for tonight,

612
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:40,000
she'll be dreaming of giraffes
now you say your prayers.

613
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,504
God bless mama, god bless
papa, god bless augusta,

614
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,506
god bless walter and ellie, good night.

615
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,008
How about grandpa?

616
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:53,014
- But he's back in texarkana.
- God looks over that city too.

617
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,516
God bless grandpa.

618
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,025
Goodnight, baby.

619
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:33,554
Good night, sweetheart.

620
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,073
And please, god, if you
make mama happy with papa,

621
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:56,577
I'll mind my own business, thank you.

622
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,593
Jack, remember me?

623
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:16,596
Oh, yes, you wanted to talk to me.

624
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,598
So that's what you did with my cigars.

625
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,601
How much did you pay for the drug store?

626
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:24,605
- What drug store?
- How much?

627
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:29,609
Well, I didn't buy it alone.

628
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,111
I happen to represent a syndicate.

629
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:32,113
How much?

630
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:34,114
You see fred thought it
would be a good idea

631
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:36,117
if we all chipped in, I was against it.

632
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,118
I didn't want to be the
only one to hold out.

633
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,119
How much?

634
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,621
$500 a piece, but we'll get it back.

635
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:45,125
Sure, in cough medicine alone.

636
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:48,129
This happened to be a very
smart business maneuver.

637
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:50,630
Every time you have one too many,

638
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:54,134
you make a smart business maneuver.

639
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:57,137
Are you through with me? yes.

640
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,639
Then I beg to be excused.

641
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,143
Sure, why don't you run
down to the drug store

642
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:05,146
and start liquidating your investment?

643
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:12,153
Well, now, I just might do that.

644
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,169
Papa, pick me up.

645
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,178
Tell me what you see.

646
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,683
Wild animals,

647
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:46,686
ladies on horseback,

648
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,689
cowboy and indians,

649
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,693
two elephants,

650
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:57,197
and oh, papa! what is it?

651
00:41:57,198 --> 00:42:03,203
Oh my, the most beautiful
pony and cart I ever saw!

652
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,705
You must really like it from
the sound of your voice,

653
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:08,709
It went up two octaves.

654
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:17,217
Oh, papa, if someone
ever bought that for me,

655
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:20,720
I'd never want another
present in my whole life.

656
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,723
Would you mind putting that
in writing, young lady?

657
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:27,728
Oh, papa, don't make a joke I love tossy.

658
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,230
Who?

659
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,234
Tossy, that's the pony's name.

660
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,235
You've named her already?

661
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:38,238
Sure, when you love someone very much,

662
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,241
you've got to call it by a name.

663
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:44,244
That's the quickest love affair on record.

664
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,246
And when you're away on a trip,

665
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:48,249
I'd have someone to talk to.

666
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:50,750
What about mama and augusta?

667
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,752
Oh, they're always too busy,

668
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:55,256
besides I could do errands for you

669
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:58,758
and tossy could take me to school.

670
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,261
You can't beat that for a practical gift.

671
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:04,764
Then you mean you'll get it for me?

672
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:06,766
It might warp your whole life if I didn't.

673
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,268
Besides, 20 years from now

674
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:10,770
I wouldn't want you to blame
everything on your poor father

675
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:12,772
just because he refused to buy you a pony

676
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,274
you could talk to.

677
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:18,278
Oh, pop, I love you, love you, love you.

678
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,290
Where's the pony and cart?

679
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:32,792
Now, corrie, there are other
wonders in this world

680
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:35,296
just look around, look at all this.

681
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:38,299
I can't see tossy.

682
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,350
Thank you.
Ok, up you go.

683
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:33,353
What about tossy?
When do I see her?

684
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,355
Well, don't you wanna see
the bareback riders,

685
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:37,357
they're terrific and the trapeze artists

686
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,361
- are coming on soon.
- I wanna see tossy.

687
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,863
You're a railroad man's daughter all right.

688
00:44:43,864 --> 00:44:45,865
You've got a one-track mind.

689
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,867
Well, I'll look for the circus owners.

690
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:50,870
Your father is about to
drive a hard bargain.

691
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:54,374
Please, papa, not too hard bargain.

692
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,378
You're right, I wouldn't want
Tossy to think she came cheap.

693
00:44:57,878 --> 00:44:59,379
She might get a little sulky.

694
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,382
All right, hop up.

695
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:05,886
Now you sit right here
and I'll be right back.

696
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,903
Who do you think that is?
Oh-oh, could be the sheriff.

697
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:26,406
Nah, he doesn't come around
till about the second day.

698
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,909
Besides he's too fancy.

699
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:34,415
Hey, you don't think it could
anyone with good news, do you?

700
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:38,419
Not a chance. but we
might as well find out.

701
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:41,329
Such terrible trouble now,
nothing else could happen.

702
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:45,925
All right, what do you want?
Are you a kicker?

703
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:47,608
Or a rube with a paper up his sleeve.

704
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:49,929
Well, your language is very fascinating

705
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,930
but I'm afraid I don't understand you

706
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:54,435
all right, pal, now are you or
are you not a process server?

707
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,437
Oh, no, my name's jack griffith.

708
00:45:56,937 --> 00:45:57,938
I'm a railroad man.

709
00:45:58,439 --> 00:45:59,439
I came here to make an arrangement

710
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,942
with the circus owners for
their financial benefit.

711
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,944
Are you harvey and keih? we ain't saying.

712
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:06,946
I'm harvey and this is keith.

713
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:09,449
Why don't you step inside and have a drink?

714
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,951
Thank you.

715
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:16,957
What are you doing...
financial benefit, you idiot.

716
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:56,496
Well, looks like somebody's
having a good time.

717
00:46:56,497 --> 00:47:00,501
Oh, papa, he ate fire and cooked a chicken.

718
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,001
Wonderful!

719
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,004
Say, uh, didn't you want a pony?

720
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,096
- Yes.
- And didn't you want a cart?

721
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:07,007
Uh-huh.

722
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:09,008
Well, you have a pony and a cart.

723
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,511
Oh, thank you, papa!
Thank you!

724
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:15,014
I'll never want another
present in my whole life.

725
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:16,516
I hope not.

726
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:18,017
You know the owners wouldn't sell the pony

727
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:21,521
and the cart by itself, I had
to buy the whole circus.

728
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:23,022
I just want tossy and the cart.

729
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:25,024
You can keep the rest of it.

730
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,027
Thank you.
I sure hope that pony can talk.

731
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,530
Let's go get her.

732
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,531
Well, I promised mr. harvey and mr. keith

733
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:33,260
that I'd keep mum about the whole deal

734
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:34,535
for at least 24 hours.

735
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:38,037
Yeah, we wanna break the news
to our kinkers in our own way.

736
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:39,039
Kinkers?

737
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Kinkers are what they call the people

738
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,041
who work in a circus.

739
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:45,545
How do we know we can trust
the kid to keep quiet?

740
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:47,547
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

741
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:52,052
Can I see my pony now? sure, sure.
Follow me.

742
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:58,558
Oh, tossy! you're all mine.

743
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,560
We'll have such fun together.

744
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:02,563
Well, I guess it was a bargain at that.

745
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,565
We can take her home now, can't we, papa?

746
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:09,068
The pony goes with the
works when it's paid for.

747
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,571
You see the money to make
the purchase is in the bank

748
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:13,573
and the bank doesn't open until tomorrow

749
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:16,076
and they have another show
and another parade tomorrow

750
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,077
and they need tossy to advertise it.

751
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:20,580
Well tomorrow
it'll be my pony,

752
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,082
and I want to ride her
in the parade.

753
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,085
It'll be perfectly all right.

754
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,588
I mean, as soon as the deal goes through.

755
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:34,094
I suppose, I'll own these too?

756
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,573
You know I always wondered
what it would be like

757
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:39,098
to own an elephant. now I own two of them.

758
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:41,100
They don't take any care at all.

759
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:45,605
Nope, all you gotta do is feed 'em.

760
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:49,108
I never thought of that. they
never lay down to sleep.

761
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:51,611
They rock and eat, eat and rock,

762
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:55,114
take on better than a hundred pounds a day.

763
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:56,616
Each?

764
00:48:56,617 --> 00:48:59,119
- Sure.
- Will you shut up.

765
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:04,624
100 pounds a day.
I never figured on that.

766
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:08,628
- Just hay, hay is cheap .
- just hay?

767
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:11,130
Well, you don't have to buy
grass when you can find it.

768
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:13,132
Don't forget people feed 'em all the time,

769
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:15,636
apples, peanuts, sugar
candy, they'll eat anything.

770
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:17,136
But 100 pounds a day,

771
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,639
people would have
to feed them people.

772
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,141
They aren't any more are there?

773
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:25,145
No, just these two.
Oh, they never touch meat.

774
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:29,148
The way things are going
I'm not likely to touch it

775
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:31,150
for quite some time either.

776
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,655
Well, see you at the bank in
the morning bright and early.

777
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,663
A hundred pounds a day. each.

778
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:48,668
That's 36,500 pounds a year.

779
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,670
And all on account of a pony.

780
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:53,674
Oh, you'll get to love tossy
as much as I love her.

781
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,175
Oh I'm madly in love with her now.

782
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:58,679
Let's hurry home, papa, I'm hungry.

783
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,182
You'd better get used to that, corrie.

784
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:06,185
Beginning tomorrow we have
two of the largest mouths

785
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,188
in show business to feed.

786
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:13,060
Now we don't wanna get
caught so eat quietly.

787
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,563
Mama told me to chew my food well.

788
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:19,566
Then we've reached an impasse.chomp away.

789
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:22,069
Who's in there?

790
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:24,071
Nobody but us chickens

791
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,074
and one of the chickens
is starving to death.

792
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:31,577
She's had a long day at the circus.

793
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:32,578
I've been worried.

794
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,081
The circus has been over for hours.

795
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,583
Well, I had no way to
get in touch with you.

796
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:40,086
Didn't you give her anything?

797
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:42,588
She's eating like a...
like a young elephant.

798
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:47,094
No mama, an elephant eats 100 pounds a day.

799
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:49,095
Mostly grass.

800
00:50:49,096 --> 00:50:52,598
Don't talk while you're eating
even when you're not eating.

801
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,603
I think she has a fever. just
look how flushed she is.

802
00:50:57,604 --> 00:51:01,107
And look how flushed you are.

803
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:02,608
It's my natural coloring,

804
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:04,111
I spent a lot of time outdoors.

805
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:08,114
I know that flush. that
flush comes from indoors.

806
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:10,206
Now come along, young
lady, you've had enough.

807
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:12,119
I'm gonna put you to bed.

808
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:13,620
I'll get an apple,

809
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:15,622
for tossy.

810
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:24,130
And who is tossy?

811
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:26,632
Oh, it's a new little friend of corrie's.

812
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:29,135
She's going to walk her
to school every day.

813
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,136
Very cute too.

814
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:33,639
Has big grey eyes,
long pony tail.

815
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,141
Goodnight, papa.

816
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:38,144
I'll say a special prayer for you tonight,

817
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:41,648
because you're the smartest one of all.

818
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:48,154
Out of the mouth of babes
comes sheer nonsense.

819
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:50,657
Come along.

820
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,060
Better make up your mind soon
the carpet's beginning to go.

821
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,152
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, jack?

822
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,563
I certainly do,

823
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,565
so take your hands
out of your pockets

824
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,566
and start counting.

825
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,569
Well I thought that drug store transaction

826
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,072
was pretty simple minded,
but this takes the cake.

827
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,575
Why are you buying a circus?

828
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,579
I happen to be madly in love
with the coochie dancers.

829
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,082
It is a wonder amberlyn
doesn't have you committed.

830
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,085
That's because she is
madly in love with me.

831
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,589
Now will you please give them the money?

832
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,591
It'll be all right,
henry.

833
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:47,096
Ah, thank you mr. griffith,
and, ah, see you at the circus.

834
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,599
Oh, we think the elephant's pregnant.

835
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,601
Gee!

836
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:57,106
Well you're over 21, but my son isn't.

837
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,109
Well know what is that supposed
to mean, your son isn't?

838
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,112
It means that a father can
still influence his offspring

839
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:07,117
in the choice of family
he might marry into.

840
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,618
You listen to me laughing gas,

841
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,621
there's two sides to that coin

842
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,623
and when the profits from
that circus start to roll in

843
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,125
I might put them in another bank.

844
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,627
I hope you'll be happy
with your coochie dancer,

845
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,631
- mr. griffith.
- Thank you, stanley

846
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,634
don't forget,

847
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,638
he thinks the elephant is pregnant.

848
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:32,142
If it's a boy I'll name him after you.

849
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,657
Well, I guess there's nobody in there.

850
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,660
Oh, uh, pardon me, sir, uh, ma'am,

851
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,662
could you tell me where
I might find mr. harvey?

852
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,164
Why?

853
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,938
Well I'm supposed to meet him
here at the head of the parade.

854
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,850
Went to town this morning with keith.

855
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,170
I know that I met him there

856
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,671
and did a little business with him.

857
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,675
But he was supposed to be back here.

858
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,676
Hold on.

859
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,679
Sparrow!

860
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,182
Talk to this guy, will ya?

861
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,683
I'm in charge here what's the trouble?

862
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,685
Well, there's no trouble,
I'm looking for mr. harvey.

863
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,188
Well that usually spells
trouble he's not around

864
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,190
you better go back to town and hunt him.

865
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,693
Oh, look for some beautiful
dames. You'll find him.

866
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,196
Let's get the parade moving!

867
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,199
No, the parade can't start without us,

868
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,700
it mustn't start!

869
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,703
Well, I'm afraid it'll have to, young lady.

870
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,705
- Papa, do something!
- Just a minute.

871
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,208
This parade doesn't start
until I say so.

872
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,217
What were you saying about
this parade not moving?

873
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,720
Wait a minute, you people
are getting the wrong idea.

874
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,722
I happen to be the new
owner of this circus.

875
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,224
What?

876
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,727
- Well didn't mr. harvey tell you?
- No

877
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,231
well here are the papers.

878
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,735
Oh, it looks legal all right.

879
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,738
Oh, don't worry about that, it's legal,

880
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,740
and my daughter, corrie, has her heart set

881
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,243
on riding that pony and
cart during the parade.

882
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:18,247
Well, let's not hold up the
parade it's getting late.

883
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,250
What are you standing around?!

884
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,753
Go with your daddy.

885
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:29,259
Ok, leo, out, and get in the back wagon.

886
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,763
Get in, honey.

887
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,765
We'll talk this over I
ater in the cook tent

888
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,768
- while we're having some
grub.
- that's ok with me.

889
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,272
Well, here we go.

890
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,773
Well hold her down, lou, hold her down!

891
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,278
Step up front, mister, step up front.

892
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,785
Now do you think tossy
will be strong enough

893
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,787
- to pull the both of us?
- She better be

894
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,791
after all the trouble you've
been through for her.

895
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,293
You could have fooled me,

896
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,295
I thought I went through
all this trouble for you.

897
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,299
Let's move it out, mister. move it out.

898
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:20,809
I'd like to speak to mrs. griffith, please.

899
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,811
Why mr. henderson, how nice.

900
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,313
Amberlyn, I didn't want to intrude

901
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,292
while you were having
your friends for tea...

902
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,089
well, come on in and have some with us.

903
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,819
Oh, no, thanks, no, thanks,
I just thought, uh...

904
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,821
there is something you ought to know.

905
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,328
You'll know it in a minute.

906
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:16,365
I suppose he's in that
delicat condition again?

907
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,368
Oh, mother, in front of stanley's father

908
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,870
and all your friends.

909
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:28,377
Do you know about that drug store madness?

910
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,380
Well, this folly he took on all by himself,

911
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,383
he owns the circus.

912
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,388
Augusta, what am I going to do?

913
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,390
Faint, mother, faint.

914
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,897
Get some water, somebody.
Help me get her inside

915
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,911
that's pete,

916
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,913
he's always playing up to
the owner of the circus

917
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,416
I guess he got the word on you

918
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,919
I wonder what he's bucking for
you suppose he wants my job?

919
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,511
Maybe he wants to become a partner?

920
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,425
Nah, he's to smart for that.

921
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,426
Did you see harvey anywhere in town

922
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,927
while the parade was going through?

923
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,929
No, isn't he here?

924
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,612
He promised to run the circus for me,

925
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,435
that's a fine way to run a circus.

926
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,438
Oh, will you get lost, pete,

927
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,440
don't you see this fella's in trouble?

928
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,942
- Trouble?
- Oh, quiet, sparrow

929
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,446
- mind your own business.
- Let him talk,

930
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,949
I feel sorry for the poor
guy, he's really been took.

931
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,451
You know, I'm just starting to get it.

932
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,455
No, you got it. did you give him a check?

933
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,459
No, they insisted on cash.

934
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,960
They didn't dream about girls
when they went to bed,

935
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,465
they dreamed about someone just like you.

936
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,969
All right, petey, that's good.

937
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,743
I guess they didn't bother to tell you

938
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,474
the show carried over 20,000 in mortgages?

939
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,977
And they're way overdue and
just about to be called in

940
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,979
let's stop worrying about mortgages

941
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,482
and start doing a little
talking about back salaries.

942
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:17,486
- Back salary?
- All right, pete.

943
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,987
And you're the new owner,

944
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,989
and what are you going to do about it?

945
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,493
Well, I could climb up on a
high wire and end it all,

946
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,358
but for some reason rather I feel sorrier

947
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,497
for harvey and keith than I do for myself.

948
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,499
I don't understand you, mr. griffith,

949
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,001
aren't you gonna get the
law on those two grifters?

950
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,504
No, I don't think so.

951
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,506
Whatever they're looking for I
don't think they'll find it.

952
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,508
Besides, they haven't even got pete now.

953
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,511
Go, pete!

954
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,012
Hey, birthday time.

955
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,516
Happy birthday!

956
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,524
Happy birthday, dear.

957
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,027
This is very nice, but it isn't my birthday

958
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,847
you mean your father bought you a circus

959
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,030
and it isn't your birthday?

960
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,033
- No.
- Now wait a minute!

961
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,536
Any time a father buys his girl a circus

962
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,037
that's her birthday!

963
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,543
Ladies and gentlemen,

964
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,545
since I am the new owner of this circus

965
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,048
I feel that I should take
care of my obligations.

966
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,550
I'm going to make out a check

967
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,052
for the rest of the balance
I have in the bank,

968
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,781
I don't know whether it will take care

969
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:31,060
of all of the back salaries,
but it's the best I can do.

970
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,563
For he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly...?

971
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:37,065
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

972
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,067
I don't wanna give you
the wrong impression,

973
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,071
I am not a jolly good fellow.
It just so happens,

974
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,573
that the fellow who owns and runs the bank

975
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:47,075
is a mean, nasty old man.

976
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,578
And I'd rather not leave
my money in that bank.

977
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,588
There's the check.

978
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,592
Corrie, let's go home.

979
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:08,597
Come on, up to now it's been a
very long, unbelievable day.

980
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,099
Shouldn't we take some cake?

981
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,601
I don't think so.

982
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,604
Let's not get used to the good life.

983
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,107
- So long everybody.
- So long.

984
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,619
Ho-ho, well, thank you, pete.

985
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,122
What are we gonna do now, papa?

986
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:36,626
Well, I guess it's time to
go home and face the music.

987
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,629
There might not be much music.

988
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,131
Well...

989
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:47,136
first I wanna make a stop.
At the drug store?

990
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,643
You know, there's a lot
of your mother in you.

991
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,521
Augusta?

992
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,523
Why are you crying? what happened?

993
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,526
Oh, like you care!

994
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,529
Of course I care, what is it?

995
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,033
My life's over that's all.

996
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,036
Stanley's father won't
let him see me any more.

997
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,039
Well, that's the best
news I've heard today.

998
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,542
Of course, it hasn't been such a good day.

999
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,543
Don't you understand that
this is the best thing

1000
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,045
that could have happened to you?

1001
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,547
Now if he really loves you,
nothing his father will say

1002
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,050
will keep him from coming around.

1003
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,053
You know, your mother's father
didn't want me around either.

1004
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,555
She mentioned that several times today,

1005
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,057
after mr. henderson
told her about

1006
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,560
how you bought that circus. aha!

1007
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,563
I promise you father, if I
can't see stanley any more...

1008
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:53,069
I know you won't forgive
me until your dying day.

1009
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,071
Corrie, you better go home with her

1010
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,572
she's liable to try something desperate

1011
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,075
like tearing my pictures
out of the family album.

1012
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:03,579
I think mother's done that already.

1013
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,598
Walter.

1014
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,118
What's going on here?

1015
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,619
Walter, will you please tell mr. griffith

1016
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,122
that we are go ing to my father's

1017
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,623
and that ellie will see to his needs here.

1018
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,126
Mrs. griffith says she's...
i heard, I heard.

1019
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,129
Amberlyn, will you please let me explain.

1020
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,131
I don't wanna go.

1021
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,633
I don't wanna leave papa and tossy.

1022
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,136
Father, you have ruined my life.

1023
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,139
Will you come to your senses?

1024
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,142
Walter, what are you waiting for?

1025
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,143
Can I go and kiss ellie goodbye?

1026
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,647
Nobody's kissing anybody,
goodbye, just drive, please.

1027
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,721
How about a belt?

1028
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,727
Don't look at me like that

1029
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:42,737
so I bought the kid a pony and a cart.

1030
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:46,741
What's so excruciating about that?

1031
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,746
You know, she's your baby too.

1032
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,749
All right...

1033
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:00,256
so I'm impulsive, expulsive,
repulsive, pulsive.

1034
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,765
Oh, you beautiful doll,

1035
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,769
you miserable soul.

1036
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:21,776
<i>Call me irresponsible</i>

1037
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:26,281
<i>call me unreliable</i>

1038
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:31,787
<i>throw in undependable too</i>

1039
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:38,293
<i>do my foolish alibis</i>

1040
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:42,297
<i>bore you</i>

1041
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:49,305
<i>well I'm not too clever I just adore you</i>

1042
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:55,810
<i>call me unpredictable</i>

1043
01:06:55,811 --> 01:07:00,315
<i>tell me I'm impractical</i>

1044
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:05,321
<i>rainbows I'm inclined to pursue</i>

1045
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:11,826
<i>call me irresponsible</i>

1046
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:17,832
<i>yes, I'm unreliable</i>

1047
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:23,339
<i>but it's undeniably true</i>

1048
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:30,846
<i>i'm irresponsibly mad</i>

1049
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,848
<i>for you</i>

1050
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:54,369
what's happened to us

1051
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,873
we used to have fun together

1052
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:02,378
whenever I did anything cr
azy you'd start laughing.

1053
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,381
Remember the time at the picnic

1054
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,385
when I put the sack over mrs.
Bonetti's head?

1055
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,897
You fell down laughing

1056
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:30,406
that was the 4th of july
picnic, remember that?

1057
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,410
Later on we went down to the river

1058
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:39,914
and we watched the fireworks.

1059
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,918
Just you and I

1060
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,922
what happened to us?

1061
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:54,430
It's like you never left.
You still won't talk to me.

1062
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,955
What's goin' on down there?

1063
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,457
Oh, hello, mr. griffith.

1064
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,549
We just ran out of grass
up at the fairground.

1065
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,463
Is this all right?

1066
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,465
Maybe grass ain't the answer

1067
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:35,970
a pregnant elephant might want
some ice cream and pickles.

1068
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,974
100 pounds a day.

1069
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:45,481
I'm gonna end up with a fat elephant.

1070
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:01,997
First time I ever ended
up with two empties.

1071
01:10:12,758 --> 01:10:13,758
Thank you, walter,

1072
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,260
and now will you go and help the girls

1073
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:17,762
with their things please? yes, ma'am.

1074
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:19,264
I must say, father,

1075
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:21,267
you don't seem to make us very welcome.

1076
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:22,767
Well, what do you expect?

1077
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:25,270
Descending on a man like a gypsy caravan,

1078
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:29,774
flowers and candy? of
course you're welcome.

1079
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:33,278
I never understood how you
tolerated that buffoon

1080
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:35,280
for the last 15 years.

1081
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:37,782
18 years.

1082
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:41,786
And we could go and stay with
aunt harriet in houston.

1083
01:10:41,787 --> 01:10:45,290
Oh, stop talking like either
one of your children.

1084
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,292
It's just that you arrived a couple of days

1085
01:10:47,293 --> 01:10:49,795
before an election, that's all.

1086
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:53,298
My campaign manager tells
me I'm going to lose.

1087
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:55,301
Oh, father, you never lose an election.

1088
01:10:55,801 --> 01:10:57,302
That's what I told him.

1089
01:10:57,303 --> 01:11:00,305
But he says I've got to stoop
to modern methods now,

1090
01:11:00,306 --> 01:11:02,307
I've gotta start kissing babies

1091
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:05,310
and giving away free beer and hot dogs,

1092
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:08,814
and shaking hands with people.

1093
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,315
I'd just like to see that.

1094
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:13,319
I have been mayor of
texarkana for eight years

1095
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:17,822
on a simple platform, texas for texans.

1096
01:11:17,823 --> 01:11:18,823
And if they don't like it

1097
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:21,826
they can go across the str eet to arkansas.

1098
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:26,331
None of this nonsense about all
men are created free and equal.

1099
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:27,332
If they were so free and equal

1100
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,335
let 'em shake hands with each other.

1101
01:11:30,336 --> 01:11:31,837
That's the spirit, father!

1102
01:11:32,338 --> 01:11:34,339
You'll give us back to england again yet.

1103
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,841
Now, don't you get sarcastic
with me, young lady,

1104
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:39,845
just because you can't
hold on to your husband.

1105
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:45,850
Now what did I say?
What did I say to...

1106
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:48,853
oh, nobody understands me.

1107
01:11:48,854 --> 01:11:50,355
It's a good thing women can't vote,

1108
01:11:50,356 --> 01:11:53,859
we'd be worse off than we are now. i...

1109
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:56,862
nice to have you back, honey.

1110
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:01,866
Please, ellie, you'd better talk to mr.
Griffith,

1111
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,868
otherwise we'll never get home.

1112
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:06,371
Oh, what's wrong now?

1113
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:07,872
Nobody's talking to nobody down here,

1114
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:09,374
the children are crying,

1115
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,376
mrs. griffith locks herself in her room,

1116
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:13,378
and if mr. ghio don't win this election,

1117
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:14,879
things are gonna get worse.

1118
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,881
You've got to talk to mr. griffith,

1119
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:18,019
he might know what to do.

1120
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:21,386
But, walter, mr. griffith
is in that condition again.

1121
01:12:21,387 --> 01:12:24,889
Honey, that's where he gets his best ideas.

1122
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,393
Oh, I gotta hang up now.

1123
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:38,569
And there's never been a man
in the history of texas,

1124
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:42,573
and texas has had a long
and illustrious history,

1125
01:12:42,574 --> 01:12:48,079
who has done more for the town
than our incumbent mayor,

1126
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,580
anthony ghio.

1127
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:57,588
I feel that all of you good
people are in my family,

1128
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:01,592
and if there's anyone with
in the sound of my voice,

1129
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:05,096
that hasn't met my katie or my children,

1130
01:13:05,097 --> 01:13:07,598
I want y'all to come up to the house

1131
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:10,101
and have a sunday dinner with us.

1132
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,606
And now, for the third time,

1133
01:13:15,607 --> 01:13:17,608
our honorable mayor is appealing

1134
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:20,611
to the decent citizens of
texarkana for their votes.

1135
01:13:20,612 --> 01:13:25,616
Without succumbing to the
low tactics of his opponent

1136
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:30,621
who is procuring his votes
by giving things away.

1137
01:13:30,622 --> 01:13:33,624
Giving things away!

1138
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:36,127
What did you ever get from ghio?

1139
01:13:36,128 --> 01:13:38,129
Nothing!

1140
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:41,132
But I promise you if I am elected mayor,

1141
01:13:41,133 --> 01:13:44,635
I promise you from the
bottom of a big texas heart

1142
01:13:44,636 --> 01:13:47,138
that I'll listen to my neighbor's opinions,

1143
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:49,140
both big and small.

1144
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:57,648
I think grandpa better
start giving things away.

1145
01:13:57,649 --> 01:13:59,651
You be quiet, young lady.

1146
01:14:00,152 --> 01:14:04,655
And now good friends, folks,
good friends of texarkana,

1147
01:14:04,656 --> 01:14:07,659
it is now my extreme privilege and pleasure

1148
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:14,165
to introduce our candidate,
the julius caesar of texas,

1149
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,666
anthony ghio.

1150
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:21,172
You just got here in time
for the decline and fall

1151
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:24,175
of the roman empire. no chance?

1152
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:29,180
The ides of march are upon us,
caesar should have stood in bed.

1153
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:32,683
My friends of texarkana,

1154
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:35,686
if you want to get your babies kissed,

1155
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:39,190
if you don't care what happe
nsto this beautiful city,

1156
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:42,194
if you don't...

1157
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:46,697
vote for ghio!

1158
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:53,204
A vote for ghio is a vote for progress!

1159
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:55,207
Come on and join the ghio bandwagon!

1160
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,209
Vote for ghio!

1161
01:15:02,214 --> 01:15:05,717
Vote for ghio!
Everybody welcome!

1162
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:12,724
Vote for ghio!

1163
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:24,235
You're all invited, come one come all,

1164
01:15:24,236 --> 01:15:28,240
enjoy the circus and it's for nothing.

1165
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:32,244
You're all guests of the voter's friend,

1166
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:35,246
mayor ghio!

1167
01:15:54,766 --> 01:15:57,769
Vote for ghio!

1168
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:04,276
- Papa
- corrie, come on, get in.

1169
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:07,279
I knew you would come, I knew you'd come.

1170
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:09,780
If I had as much confidence
in me as you have,

1171
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:12,783
I'd run for mayor myself. I'd vote for you.

1172
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:13,785
Yeah?

1173
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:17,789
I wonder if your mother would.
Let's go there.

1174
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:21,292
What a trick!

1175
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:23,795
How did you happen to think of it?

1176
01:16:24,296 --> 01:16:26,797
My son in law bought the
circus just for tonight.

1177
01:16:26,798 --> 01:16:28,799
Pretty smart, huh?

1178
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,802
- Speech!
- No, no, wait.

1179
01:16:31,803 --> 01:16:34,806
This is no time for long-winded speeches.

1180
01:16:35,307 --> 01:16:37,308
So what do you say we all go to the park

1181
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:40,812
and get free ice cream and free hot dogs?

1182
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:49,001
I think I'll go with grandpa, mother.

1183
01:16:49,321 --> 01:16:50,821
Where's corrie?

1184
01:16:50,822 --> 01:16:53,824
In the pony cart with papa,
on the arkansas side.

1185
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:56,327
So that's his plan . he's kidnapping her,

1186
01:16:56,328 --> 01:16:59,831
he's taking her across the state line.

1187
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:08,840
I want corrie.

1188
01:17:09,341 --> 01:17:10,841
Not as much as I do.

1189
01:17:10,842 --> 01:17:12,844
Remember, you're in arkans as now amberlyn,

1190
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:15,346
you try to get her back
without extradition.

1191
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:16,847
You've been drinking?

1192
01:17:16,848 --> 01:17:18,849
Yeah, but I'll be sober
in the morning. get up!

1193
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,852
You come right back here!

1194
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,861
Amberlyn, amberlyn,
what happened?

1195
01:17:30,862 --> 01:17:32,363
My hand!

1196
01:17:32,364 --> 01:17:34,366
Help me, sparrow.

1197
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,265
You can go in now, mr. griffith.

1198
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:52,767
How is she?

1199
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,269
There's some muscle
damage on the right hand,

1200
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,272
oh, it'll be fine for all normal purposes.

1201
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:03,778
As far as playing the
piano, I don't think so.

1202
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,780
You could be mistaken.

1203
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,283
Well let's say that...
i have been.

1204
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,787
Don't stay too long,
I've given her a sedative.

1205
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:32,808
Amberlyn..

1206
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,311
I'm sorry.

1207
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:45,820
Don't be too sorry.
It was partly my fault.

1208
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,323
Chasing that stupid pony cart.

1209
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,329
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

1210
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:04,339
I thought that if we left
you for a little while...

1211
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,342
it might bring you to your senses.

1212
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,847
Had the opposite effect.

1213
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,349
Amberlyn, you've gotta believe me.

1214
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,854
I've had enough.

1215
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,867
There's nothing I can say?

1216
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,872
I've heard all the words

1217
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:53,387
and don't tell my father about my hand,

1218
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,390
I don't want to spoil this day for him.

1219
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,400
Can I go in and talk to mama?

1220
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,903
I don't think so, sweetheart,

1221
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,904
the doctor gave her some medicine.

1222
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:13,408
Like the medic ine you take, papa?

1223
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,410
No, not exactly.

1224
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,414
I don't feel like going
back to the circus, do you?

1225
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,919
No, I don't either.

1226
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:33,928
<i>My bonnie lie
s over the ocean</i>

1227
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:37,432
he's making friend
s.
and votes.

1228
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,935
Thanks, frank, here, have
a cigar, have a cigar.

1229
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:43,437
Well, jerry, have a cigar.

1230
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,439
What happens to the circus now?

1231
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,442
Oh, your son in law will lose it.

1232
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,444
Easy come, easy go

1233
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,947
but at least he made two children happy.

1234
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,085
What do you mean by that?

1235
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:56,451
Well, corrie got her pony,

1236
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,954
and you're a cinch to get yourself elected.

1237
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,956
Y... huh?

1238
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,960
Thank you...

1239
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:08,463
have a cigar.

1240
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,968
That's the fourth time
he's shaken hands with me.

1241
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,970
What do you think he wants?

1242
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,472
Would lieutenant governor be too much?

1243
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:24,980
Have a cigar.

1244
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:04,078
Have you got a letter for me too?

1245
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,581
I ran out of ink.
Have you been spying?

1246
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,083
I sure have.

1247
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,085
You remind me of george washington

1248
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:14,088
saying farewel I to his troops.

1249
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:17,591
More like sherman retreating to the sea.

1250
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,593
Too bad you're going,

1251
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:23,597
I was just getting to the point
where I could tolerate you.

1252
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:26,101
If I could believe that, I'd stay.

1253
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,603
So long.

1254
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,619
Mother!

1255
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,121
Where's papa?

1256
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:51,125
I looked everywhere. he's not around.

1257
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,127
He went away, darling.

1258
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,129
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

1259
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,632
Did he leave you a letter?

1260
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:02,136
I got one too.

1261
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:05,640
"Dear augusta, take good
care of your mother,

1262
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,642
"try to be as much like her as you can."

1263
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:12,146
"she's the sweetest
person I've ever known."

1264
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:16,150
well then why did he go awayr?

1265
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:20,154
Perhaps we...
we were both at fault.

1266
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:23,657
I don't want any old letter,
I wanna be with papa!

1267
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:27,161
Now where is he?

1268
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,164
I don't know, baby,

1269
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:33,668
but when he's ready, he'll let us know.

1270
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,671
All we can do now is pray.

1271
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:41,676
I'm not gonna pray again
until papa comes back.

1272
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:50,684
She's just a child, she
really doesn't understand.

1273
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,689
She may understand.
Better than either of us.

1274
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:11,205
Grandpa, please.

1275
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:14,709
Please what?
Please find my papa.

1276
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:21,715
Oh, what are those?
Tears?

1277
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:25,220
Ooh, my, my, my.

1278
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,222
Young lady, I think you and I

1279
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,726
had better have a heart to heart talk, mm?

1280
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,732
Do you see that picture
over the mantelpiece there?

1281
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,734
Yes, sir.

1282
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:43,737
Well that is the ghio family crest.

1283
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,739
Yes, grandpa.

1284
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,741
And do you see the armored helmet,

1285
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:51,745
with the three feathers of
royalty on top of the shield?

1286
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,747
Yes, sir.

1287
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:56,251
Well that means that the ghios

1288
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:01,755
were members of the knights
of the royal army of tuscany

1289
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:06,260
and no knight worthy of
his name ever cried.

1290
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,762
No, sir.

1291
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:13,267
No one of the house of ghio ever cries.

1292
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,270
Yes, sir.

1293
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:18,272
Now wouldn't you like to carry on

1294
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:19,274
the tradition of this

1295
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:23,777
great and noble family?

1296
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:26,280
Wouldn't you like to be the most beautiful,

1297
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:31,786
- the most aristocratic and...
- I want my papa

1298
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,793
all right, we'll find your papa.

1299
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:43,664
Thank you, grandpa

1300
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,166
somewhere in these united states,

1301
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,669
he has a job with the railroad, find him.

1302
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,672
But, mayor, there must be
thousands of railroad lines

1303
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:53,174
In continental america

1304
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:56,176
well, that gives you
lots of places to look.

1305
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,678
Goodbye.

1306
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,680
Oh

1307
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,705
Mother, you're playing!

1308
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,207
Corrie, what are you doing
home from school so early?

1309
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:31,712
I spilt some ink on my dre ss,
but your hand is all better.

1310
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:33,714
You can play. yes, corrie.

1311
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:38,218
Papa will be so happy
when grandpa finds him

1312
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,220
papa isn't going to know,

1313
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,723
and I didn't mean for you to find this out.

1314
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:45,225
But why not?
Does augusta know?

1315
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:47,729
She's older. she can keep a secret.

1316
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:49,229
A secret?

1317
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,733
Corrie, you're six going on seven.

1318
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,736
I don't think that that's
quite old enough to be trusted.

1319
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:59,239
I'm an honest child, you said so.

1320
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,242
A little too honest sometimes.

1321
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:07,247
Now, this is a secret and
if papa comes back to us,

1322
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,249
it has to remain a secret.

1323
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,752
He must never, never know

1324
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,754
that my hand is well enoug to play again.

1325
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:16,257
He must not be told, you understand?

1326
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,759
No,
he loves your music,

1327
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,763
he'll be so glad your hand's not broken.

1328
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:28,268
I see that I'll have to
explain this more clearly.

1329
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:30,771
When your father has had
too much to drink...

1330
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:33,273
medicine.

1331
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:37,277
Well, we'll call it that
for the time being.

1332
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,781
When he has too much medicine,

1333
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:44,284
he does foolish things
and that keeps us apart.

1334
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:45,786
Oh!

1335
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:49,790
Well, now, if he doesn't
know that my hand is better,

1336
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,792
there's just a chance

1337
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:54,294
that he won't drink the medicine any more

1338
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,797
and then we can all be together again.

1339
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,298
Now do you understand?

1340
01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:59,300
I think so.

1341
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,804
I'll keep it a secret,
but I think it's foolish.

1342
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:06,807
Well you just indulge
your foolish old mother.

1343
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,308
Now then,

1344
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:12,312
I think it's about time we all
went back home to grangeville.

1345
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:15,816
And wait for papa there? perhaps.

1346
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,819
Oh, mother, I love you.

1347
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,823
I don't care if I am a consolation prize.

1348
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:27,829
Now then, you just run upstair
s and get into a clean dress.

1349
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:39,339
I can't understand why you'r
all rushing off so quickly.

1350
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,842
Well, we felt that we'd
overstayed our welcome,

1351
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,845
practically as soon as we got here.

1352
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:47,347
I'll miss you, grandpa.
I'll miss you too, dear.

1353
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:50,851
Your daughter seems all smiles
and cheerful for a change.

1354
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:53,353
Yes, well, she received
a letter this morning.

1355
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:54,855
From stanley henderson III,

1356
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,857
he says he's gonna stand up to his father.

1357
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,359
- Stanley henderson II.
- the second.

1358
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,861
And see me whether he likes it or not.

1359
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:03,363
Aha, well, nothing's changed.

1360
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:05,866
I remember when a daughter of
mine went with a young fellow

1361
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,368
that I didn't approve of
and she stood up to me

1362
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:11,371
whether I liked it or not, 15 years ago.

1363
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:13,874
- 18 years ago.
- All right, 18.

1364
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:14,875
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, father.

1365
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:16,877
- Goodbye, children.
- Thank you.

1366
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:18,378
All right, walter, have a good trip.

1367
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:20,881
Goodbye.

1368
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:25,886
Grandpa, don't just stand
there start looking for papa.

1369
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:29,390
I've started, honey, I've started.

1370
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,402
Well, mr. ghio,

1371
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:45,405
did your train get on the wrong track?

1372
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:48,408
No, the right one.

1373
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:52,412
It's been a long dusty ride
though, I'll tell you that.

1374
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,916
I'm a little parched.

1375
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,919
Oh.

1376
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:09,930
You're looking well.

1377
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:12,933
Uhh, no thanks.

1378
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:15,936
My cough has been cured for good.

1379
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,438
Oh!

1380
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:24,945
I've... i've been talking to
the president of the railroad,

1381
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,948
he tells me you're doing a great job.

1382
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,949
Is that so?

1383
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,954
I could put you in touch wit h
my parole officer if you want.

1384
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,456
You like ah, working here
in louisiana, do you?

1385
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:40,461
Ha ha, it's better than
wrestling alligators.

1386
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:44,965
I suppose I could be standing here all day

1387
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,468
before you'd break down and ask me,

1388
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,972
but your family is fine,
they went back home.

1389
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:56,477
They're waiting for you, jack.

1390
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,481
Which of the family is waiting for me?

1391
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:06,987
You're worse than I in my prime.

1392
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,489
All right I'll give it to you straight,

1393
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,491
that little heathen corrie,

1394
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,494
practically made me take an oath in blood

1395
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:16,497
that I'd find you and get you back to her.

1396
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,005
It's a notion.

1397
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:27,507
I could take a little train
trip on the weekend.

1398
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:31,012
I get to ride free, you know?

1399
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:34,514
I wouldn't want to miss
an opportunity like that.

1400
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:38,018
Especially when you've got
some place to ride to.

1401
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,019
Yes, yes.

1402
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,521
Well, in a case of that sort

1403
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,023
I guess I ought to get a lot of work done.

1404
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,025
Good, good.

1405
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:46,026
Uh, thank you very much for dropping in.

1406
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,527
All right.

1407
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:51,032
- Oh er, pop
- yes?

1408
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:55,535
Don't alert the enemy that I'm coming.

1409
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:59,539
You don't think I want them
back on my hands, do you?

1410
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,043
Son.

1411
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:09,550
...
oh, pop.

1412
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,055
Clear as a bell.

1413
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:50,591
Corrie, will you come away from that window

1414
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:53,093
and sit down please?

1415
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:55,596
Are you sure he's coming?

1416
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:58,098
According to your grandfather,

1417
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:00,101
who wasn't supposed to alert the enemy,

1418
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,603
he should be here by now.

1419
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,878
Maybe he stopped off at the drug store,

1420
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,108
- I'll go get him.
- Now, corrie, you sit down,

1421
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,610
and don't get yourself so worked up.

1422
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:12,612
She didn't even touch her
breakfast this morning.

1423
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,116
- Neither did mommy.
- I wasn't hungry.

1424
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:32,133
There he is!
There's papa!

1425
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:06,667
Oh, please mommy, can I go
outside and bring him in?

1426
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:10,670
No, he's old enough to
come in here by himself,

1427
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:13,674
without any encouragement from any of us.

1428
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:31,191
Mommy, he's writing another letter.

1429
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:34,195
That means he's going away.

1430
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:11,731
Oh, mommy I love you, he's coming in.

1431
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:13,733
He's coming in!

1432
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:15,780
But then he'll know your
hand is all better,

1433
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,238
what about the secret?

1434
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,241
I think it's a foolish secret.

1435
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:21,741
Besides,

1436
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,246
I learned about honesty from you.

1437
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:47,267
Looks like bill bailey
finally made it home.

1438
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:50,271
Oh, let's hope he stays.

1439
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:07,287
Remember that rainy
evening I drove you out?

1440
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:11,291
With nothing but a fine tooth comb?

1441
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:15,295
I know I'm to blame and ain't it a shame?

1442
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:19,299
Bill bailey won't you please come home?

1443
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,302
Come home?

1444
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:23,803
Papa, when I grow up,

1445
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:26,307
I'm gonna marry a man just like you.

1446
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,809
You do, and I won't let him in the house.

1447
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:35,816
Bill bailey won't you please stay home?
