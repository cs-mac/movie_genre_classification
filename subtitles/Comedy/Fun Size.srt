WREN: Everyone loves Halloween,

3
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,184
especially in Cleveland.

4
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,396
When you're known as
"The Mistake By The Lake,"

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,774
the chance to pretend you're somebody
else for a night sounds pretty good.

6
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,657
My dad grew up here, too.

7
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,286
His theory was, "No matter
what happens in high school,

8
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,372
"college is where you figure
out who you really are."

9
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,627
Not just some pretend-for-a-night
version of yourself, but the real deal.

He went to NYU after he graduated,
which is where I'm planning on going,

provided I can survive
the insanity that is my family.

Oh, again with that jacket.

Why couldn't you have gotten attached

to something of your dad's

We need to talk about this, Wren.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,460
I understand that you want to go to NYU,

33
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,796
but Ohio State
is just much less expensive.

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,841
I know it's a lot of money
and I promise not to major in English

35
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,133
so I can help pay it off.

When my dad died,
my mom kind of lost it.

37

She started dyeing her hair blonde,

Apparently, dating a 26-year-old

45
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,494
is one of the seven stages of grief.

47

So, which do you think,
sexy kitty or sexy mouse?

48
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,595
Can't you be a kitty without being sexy?

49
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,096
Um, no.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,181
Hello? Being sexy is what's gonna get us

into Aaron Riley's party tonight.

00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,352
We're never getting into
Aaron Riley's party.

53
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,437
We're not that cool.

54
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,522
Huh. It's really sad
that you're a pessimist.

55

Realist.

56

I read a statistic that
a good Halloween costume

57
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,864
can increase your chance
of popularity by 32 %. So,

have you thought about
what you're going as yet?

maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

Aaron Riley is a musician.

64
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,297
He is not a law-abiding citizen.

65

He's not gonna know who that is.

66

What if I did a rap explaining who I am?

Not only is she an iconic female hero,

You're either Kevin or you're Steven.

00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,531
Ow. Okay. All right.

328
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,130
What's up, Spidey?
You just chilling out here by yourself?

329
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,215
Okay.

330
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,136
Well, no man should ride alone tonight.

331
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,972
You don't have any friends or anything?

332
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,475
Look who's talking.

333
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,560
I tell you what.

334
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,646
I need a man for a mission.

335
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,817
One man for one mission
to avenge one broken heart.

336
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,154
Will it be dangerous?
Yes. Very much so.

337
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,782
In fact, I'm quite scared about it.

338
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,534
Will we make it back alive?
I don't know, to be honest.

But I can promise you this.

341

He who follows me
unto the breach, my dear friends,

342

will be rewarded
with unlimited free Funyuns

I just feel like
we could help each other out tonight.

347
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,722

and we'll roll, man, like homeys.

I'm not luring a kid into my car.

Let's check in here.
Albert's nursing a major Slushee habit.

357
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,465
Okay, seriously, what is wrong with you?

358
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,134
Okay, I wasn't going to bring this up,
(EXHALES)

359
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,970
but it has reached crisis stage.

360
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,722
I put Nair on my butt this morning.

361
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,141
Oh, my God, it is chafing
something fierce.

362
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,311
FUZZY: Here we go, Spidey.
The adventure begins.

363

APRIL: It was an accident.

364
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,149
- You Naired your butt?
- Yeah, and it burns.

365
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,734
Why in God's name would you do that?

366
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,987
It's like fire shooting out of my ass.

367
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,031
Oh, nerd alert. Other way.

Please do not forget that in our cross-ex.

Just chill, bro. It's Spring Lake.

Peng! Hey, guys, what's going on?

374
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,798
We were just actually
going over our strategy

375
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,924
for tomorrow's match.

- PENG: Debate, actually.

First co-captains in school history.

378

- That's really cool.
- Um, Wren?

379
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,437
So, how do you get to the big match?
Is there a team bus?

380
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,023
No, I drive my car.

381
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,192
Well, it's not my car,
but I can get permission.

382

So could you get permission tonight?

383

Tonight? You want me to drive the car...

384

to say is we would love to drive around

387

Great.

388
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,086
So, yeah. Let's, uh...
Let's hit the road. Let's go.

Uh, the thing is...

390

I haven't fully completed
my trust window yet.

391

Your trust window?

392
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,473
It's like a second learner's permit,
but between me and my moms.

393
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,476
You know, for six months,
I can't drive with anyone

and/or social circles.

One more thing.

00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,141
Do either of you carry
any sort of unusual scents

413

would smoke a cigarette.

Fuzzy. Bus stop. That way.

811
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,901
So we went to the tow yard
and my car was there.

812
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,279
Spidey wasn't. Where could he be?

813
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,738
Mind telling me
why you were hanging out

814
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,573
with an eight-year-old in the first place?

815
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,992
I was lonely.

816
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,203
Ever since you left,
I've been roommates with my sadness.

817
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,831
Hey, girl, where were you?

818
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,749
Don't ask. I spent my night with Fuzz

819
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,252
trying to find some
one-armed spider-midget.

820
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,754
Oh, my God. We know that dude.
We were partying with him.

821
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,464
- LARA: You were?
- Yeah, he's awesome.

822
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,549
See, Lara?

823
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,343
It's not like I hang out with
lame eight-year-olds. God!

824
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,553
Where is he now?

825
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,096
I don't know. We lost him.

826
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,389
He was hitting the Rolos pretty hard.

827
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,641
- Yeah, that's him.

who squats when he pees?

00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,656

are you mixed up in?

Hey.

841
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,206
I heard a rumor you shot
Mike Puglio with a musket.

842
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,457
Is that true?

843
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,625
Yeah.

844
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,043
My man.

845
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,253
Come on, I want to hear all about it.

846

Hey, everyone.
This is the guy who shot Puglio.

847

Oh, my God, at last.

848
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,634
I just saw him in the living room.
Come on.

849
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,177
Um...

850
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:26,306
Good idea. We'll split up,

thought you found my brother.

for a mammogram last week?

859

I think I was, actually.

860
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,851
I did get a mammogram last week, so...

861
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,854
Does everything come out okay?

862
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:18,608
Oh, yes. Yes, they're...
Thank you. How are yours?

00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,235
Oh, me, too. I'm good.

Oh, good, good, good.

865
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,032
How'd you meet Keevin?

866
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,827
Oh, I met him
at the Starbucks on Shattuck.

867
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,328
We go there.

868
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,040
My son loves Caramel Macchiatos
and that's Keevin's specialty.

869
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,209
- Oh, you have a son?
- Yep.

00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,878
I have a son and a daughter.

871
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,006

Lawrence Reuben Brueder.
I am sorry. He's so nosey.

877

He's been watching a lot
of Dr. Drew lately.

878
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,980
It's okay. He's dead, actually. He died.

879
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,857
He passed away, and so, um...

880
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,400
You miss him?

881
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,319
Um...

882
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,113
Yeah, I miss my husband.
I miss him a lot.

883
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,325
You know, he was... He was my husband

884
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,578
and so I'm kind of alone.

885
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,913
I have the kids there,

886
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,541
but that's not really comforting
because I'm their mother

887
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,502
and I kind of have to take care
of them all the time.

888
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,796
And my son doesn't really
talk a lot to people.

889
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,635
And then my daughter is talking about
going to school in New York City

890
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,386
and she wants to run across the country,

891
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,096
which is really terrifying to me

892
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,599
because then
she's not gonna be near me

893
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,851
and I don't know how quickly
this all happened

894
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,230
because it feels like she was just a baby
a couple of months ago.

895
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,940
You know, these are things
that happen to people,

A lot of people don't even get it.

And I'm a single mother. You know?

I'm a single mother, and I'm sitting here

This morning, all I wanted was
to get away from my little brother, and...

978
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,066
Now that I've lost him,
I'd do anything to get him back.

979

You will.

980
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,028
Are you sure?

981
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,615
I mean, as E.O. Wilson says,

982
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,660
"You are capable
of more than you know."

983
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,538
Of course, he was talking about ants

their body weight.

985

if it's applicable to this situation.

the best night of my life.

1292
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,517
And I'm gonna have to get a part-time job

1293
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,602
at Captain Chicken just
to pay off the damage I caused.

01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,607
But I wouldn't trade a minute of it,
'cause I got to spend it with Wren.

Hello, Wren. Don't worry.

As you can see,
I have the situation in hand.
