1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,272
So how did you get
this job, andrew?

2
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:03,673
I was a client.

3
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:05,542
I was just like
you once, charlotte-

4
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,077
Lost, lonely,
looking for love.

5
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:10,647
Clumsy, hapless, pathetic.
- Okay, I get it.

6
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:13,283
Sitting right
here was james -

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,885
Beautiful full
beard, devastating.

8
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:18,321
Oh, so james was
your soul mate.

9
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,490
At first, until he
shaved off his beard.

10
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:22,458
And I was like, "what'd you do
with my boyfriend, al roker?"

11
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:26,062
So was the beard the only
reason you and james broke up?

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,298
Well, that and his wife.

13
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,533
No more talk about me.

14
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,235
Let's move on to the
next question on the test.

15
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:33,236
Okay.

16
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,972
Tell me more about...Wayne?

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,740
That can't be
the next question.

18
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,275
I have the power
to change the test,

19
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,578
Because I have the pencil.

20
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,581
It's complicated.

21
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:46,516
Mike, jill, leslie,
and I were all friends,

22
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:47,884
And it was all
going along fine,

23
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,953
And then wayne comes along.

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,387
I smell passion.

25
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:55,124
Start from the beginning
and don't leave anything out.

26
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:00,530
Do you know tom
cruise is only 4'12"?

27
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:03,600
Isn't that actually 5 feet?

28
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,836
It's all camera angles.

29
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:09,372
And musical superstar prince?

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,474
Technically a dwarf.

31
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,709
Ah!

32
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,410
Did not know that.

33
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,179
It's going pretty well,
don't you think, charlotte?

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,181
I mean, usually
first dates are awful.

35
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,251
Yeah, awful...

36
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,887
Dreadfully awful.

37
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:25,688
No, no, this is good.

38
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,658
I've never done it with
an irish chick before.

39
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,427
I'm english.

40
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:34,163
Good luck with that.

41
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,233
Oh, you're feisty.

42
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:40,837
Just like the 4'6"
sarah jessica parker.

43
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,839
All right, hold your horses.

44
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,540
I'm gonna go
squeeze the lemon,

45
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,143
And then we'll go
back to your place.

46
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,150
He's a doll.

47
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:56,653
Sorry, were you talking to me?

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,556
Your date. He's actually
the size of a doll.

49
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:03,660
Oh, he's harmless.

50
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,595
What is it with girls like you

51
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:07,664
Wasting your time
with guys like that?

52
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,899
Girls like me?
You don't know me.

53
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,301
You don't know
anything about me.

54
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,802
I bet I know more
than you think.

55
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:15,204
I bet I don't care.

56
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:17,172
All right.

57
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,311
What do you think
you know about me?

58
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:25,081
Well, you're wearing
your hot -date dress.

59
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,016
You have long brown hair,

60
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,351
Pretty eyes.

61
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:32,155
You only date harmless
guys like short stack...

62
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:34,590
When you really should
be dating a guy like me.

63
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:36,859
Oh, right-

64
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:40,296
A cocky jackass who spends
his time scruffing up his hair

65
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,298
Just enough to make it
look like he doesn't care

66
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,167
So girls will fall
into bed with him.

67
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:47,203
So you're into me.

68
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:49,605
Who the hell do
you think you are?

69
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:51,174
Wayne!

70
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:53,075
Mike!

71
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,646
Oh!

72
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,314
Charlotte, this is wayne.

73
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,515
Have you guys already met?

74
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,150
Oh, we've met.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,153
In fact, charlotte and I were
about to go back to her place.

76
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:05,955
Not true.

77
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:08,992
Wayne and I have been best
buds since camp watahachie.

78
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,059
It was a rich kids' camp.

79
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,160
I worked there-

80
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,795
And I was rich there.

81
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,696
<i>This is wayne wayne?</i>

82
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:15,965
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,300
Last time we spoke,

84
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,968
You were living
in "barthelona."

85
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:19,969
Yeah.

86
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,870
Man, I crashed
my cigarette boat

87
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:22,972
Off the coast of majorca.

88
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:23,973
Oh, ridiculous.

89
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,274
Yeah, it kind
of bummed me out,

90
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,509
So I came back here.

91
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,211
So you're back. You're
back in the city.

92
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,712
I am back in the city.

93
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:31,481
Charlotte, wayne
is back in the city,

94
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:32,982
And we are back in business.

95
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:35,318
He is gonna be hanging
out with us nonstop.

96
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:36,486
How great is that?

97
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,988
Oh, I can hardly stand it.

98
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:44,660
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

99
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,636
Well, why'd you even
go out with that guy

100
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:09,771
In the first place?

101
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,306
Well, I didn't
want to judge a book

102
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:14,275
By its tiny, little cover.

103
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:17,879
It's a nice place.

104
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,047
Do you mind?

105
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,583
No, not at all.

106
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,751
I can't believe you
two have never met.

107
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,920
Wayne, has it been four
years since you left?

108
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,889
Yeah, man. Traveled
all over the world.

109
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,491
Actually picked up
a little spanish,

110
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,159
A little french,
a little swedish,

111
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,394
And a hot little hungarian.

112
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,332
Charlotte, he was
talking about girls.

113
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,233
Yeah, I got that.

114
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,069
Are you sure that you
two don't want to catch up

115
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,337
In your apartment downstairs?

116
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,471
Are you kidding me?

117
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,672
I want you two to get
to know each other.

118
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,541
Well, I was gonna
make some tea.

119
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,444
I've developed the
most splitting headache.

120
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,746
Well, I will fix your tea.

121
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,816
I want you to sit down here.

122
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,720
So I'm guessing
from the accent,

123
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,888
You're not from around here.

124
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,657
Is it long island or...?

125
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:05,426
No, charlotte is
from london town.

126
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:08,129
And how do you know mike?

127
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,532
Well, we- - do you
remember leslie?

128
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,433
Charlotte and leslie
met at some lame job,

129
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,002
And then leslie
introduced her to us.

130
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,337
And, uh, here we are.

131
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,606
And how do you like it here?

132
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:20,808
Mike?
- She loves it.

133
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,944
She sometimes gets
lonely for london,

134
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:25,346
But we're like her
family, so she gets by.

135
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:27,649
Oh, my god,
charlotte, you're here.

136
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:29,184
Wayne!

137
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,318
Jill!

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,886
What are you
doing back in town?

139
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,856
Oh, I crashed my cigarette
boat off the coast of majorca.

140
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,925
Ridiculous.
- Right?

141
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,960
Charlotte, how much
do you love wayne?

142
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:40,495
Oh, she loves him.
Are you kidding me?

143
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,797
She absolutely loves him.

144
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,799
Oh, my god, I almost forgot.

145
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,968
I have really bad news.
- What?

146
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,603
Jeffrey is getting married.

147
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:50,405
who's jeffrey?

148
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:53,241
Leslie's ex.
- Oh, yeah, I hated that guy.

149
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,411
Yeah, he's a total tool.

150
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,713
And he's getting married
to somebody else tomorrow.

151
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:00,648
Okay. Leslie cannot find out.

152
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,017
It'll absolutely crush
her. So here's the plan.

153
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,486
When we see leslie,
no one says the words

154
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,388
"wedding," "jeffrey,"
or "married."

155
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,591
wedding...

156
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:13,428
Jeffrey... Married.

157
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:16,564
I think she knows.

158
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,404
Oh, leslie, it's okay.

159
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,940
Everything's gonna be okay.

160
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,412
Were those words?

161
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,081
Did she say something?

162
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,817
She said, "how can you
do this to me, jeffrey?"

163
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:42,957
Kindergarten teachers speak
emotional meltdown fluently.

164
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:46,094
How did you find out
jeffrey was getting married?

165
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,368
She ran into another party
planner named roberta.

166
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:55,803
Sorry. Robin...

167
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,972
At the flower market,
and they got into a fight

168
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,940
Over the last acacias.

169
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,609
Azaleas.

170
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,578
And robin told her that
she needed the flowers

171
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:05,280
Because she's planning
jeffrey's wedding.

172
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,215
God, he knows we're
party planners.

173
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,183
Why didn't he use us?

174
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:12,620
Sorry. That was so
very wrong of me.

175
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,725
Oh, let it out.

176
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:20,094
Whatever we can do to
make you feel better-

177
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:22,230
Whatever you want,
we're here for you.

178
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,798
I want to crash the wedding

179
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,400
And make him see
he should marry me.

180
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,834
She wants to
crash the wedding -

181
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,304
We heard that one.

182
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:32,040
I have a better idea.

183
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:34,309
We don't go to the wedding.

184
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:38,946
We stay here, and we talk
about everything you're feeling.

185
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:46,788
We could always
play scattergories.

186
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:48,056
Weak!

187
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:49,157
What do you mean, "weak"?

188
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,692
She loves scattergories.

189
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,260
We need to get
her mind off this,

190
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:55,129
And in order to do
that, we gotta go big.

191
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,198
Wayne is the
king of going big.

192
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,300
When I got my heart broken
in 10th grade, 11th grade,

193
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:01,268
12th grade, and the
summer after 12th grade,

194
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,604
Wayne was right there for me,

195
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,840
Going big and
making me feel great.

196
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,942
If I were leslie,
I'd get dressed up

197
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,511
In something slutty and
party all night long,

198
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,413
Maybe get it on
with some stranger.

199
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:14,015
Oh, that's very healthy.

200
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,283
Not finished.

201
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,184
I'd have somebody
videotape the whole thing,

202
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,786
And then I'd send
it to this jeffrey

203
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:20,188
As a big "up yours."

204
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,456
Weak.

205
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,790
That is a terrible idea.

206
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,592
No, it's an awesome idea,

207
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,427
And you know what
rhymes with awesome?

208
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:30,398
Atlantic city.

209
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,666
And we could take a limo
there, couldn't we, wayne?

210
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,800
It's the only way to go.

211
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,036
A big limo with a
hot tub in the back.

212
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,371
Do they make any other kind?

213
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,872
We fill it with
the best champagne

214
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:38,973
And crab cocktails.

215
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:39,974
Is crab cocktail okay, wayne?

216
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,075
I could eat me some crab.

217
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,477
"I could eat me some crab."

218
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:43,711
You see why I love this guy?

219
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:44,812
I'm calling for the limo.

220
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,013
Knock yourself out.
- Yeah.

221
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:48,149
Okay, w -wait.
This is ridiculous.

222
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,951
We're not going
to atlantic city.

223
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:53,388
I think I know my friend
slightly better than you, wayne.

224
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,390
What she needs is
to be here with us

225
00:08:55,457 --> 00:09:00,261
In a safe place where she
has time to process and heal.

226
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:04,866
She wants to go
to atlantic city.

227
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:18,513
Hey, guys, I'm naked.

228
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,348
Mike, please,
do us all a favor

229
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:23,251
And turn on the bubbles.

230
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:27,822
Hey, jeffrey, take a look
at what you're passing up.

231
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,058
Good. That's really good.

232
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,660
Um, tiny, little note-

233
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:35,062
You may want to squeeze your
knees together just a bit.

234
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:41,369
Come on, look at
her. She's having fun.

235
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:44,071
Yeah. I think she should
possibly have worn pants.

236
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,073
And I think you really
want to have fun,

237
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,475
But you're stopping yourself

238
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:50,711
Because it was
my awesome idea.

239
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,647
Are you always this confident,

240
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,316
Or is it some sort
of mental illness?

241
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:58,553
You are really into me.

242
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,520
Hey...

243
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,891
Wayne!

244
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,660
More champagne?

245
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:07,462
More champagne!

246
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:10,965
Hey, driver, more
bubbly, my good man.

247
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,100
If I'm stopping to
get more champagne,

248
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:15,069
Should I use the credit
card that I have on file?

249
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:17,572
No, no, no, no, no,
no. That's my card.

250
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,407
Wayne, give him the real card.

251
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,741
Use the black one.

252
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,642
Guys, like, 200
people in the country

253
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:23,878
Have this black credit card.

254
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,348
More like 199 now.

255
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,317
What does that mean?

256
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,885
Why don't we just
use your card?

257
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,421
Are you kidding me?
I can't afford this.

258
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:37,158
Well, neither can I.

259
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:39,126
What?

260
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:42,864
My dad kind of...

261
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,999
Cut me off.

262
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:48,769
I'm paying for this?

263
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:50,238
Hey, driver?

264
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,439
How much would it cost

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,274
If we stopped the limo
right now and got out?

266
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,276
$1,100.
- Stop the limo!

267
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:58,513
Everybody get out! Get
out of the limousine!

268
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,882
Go now! Now!

269
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,849
The meter's running!

270
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,027
Oh, I'm sorry none of us
grabbed your clothes...

271
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:10,896
Or your wallet...

272
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,397
Or your keys.

273
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:16,368
You were quite insistent on
leaving that limo, though.

274
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:18,237
How could you be poor?

275
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,839
What happened to your
cigarette boat in majorca?

276
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:22,174
I crashed it.

277
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,009
That was the last
straw for my dad.

278
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,011
That, and he
thinks I'm a loser.

279
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,347
How could you let
me order that limo?

280
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,049
It's not like I have thousands
of extra dollars lying around.

281
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:32,985
Well, you're a lawyer. I
thought lawyers had money.

282
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:35,454
I don't have
atlantic city money.

283
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:37,122
Can I just say something?

284
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,590
What?

285
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:41,794
This is the best shopping
cart I have ever used.

286
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,029
I mean, you really don't find
ones like this in the store.

287
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,631
Look, I can push
it with one finger

288
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:48,867
And still have
complete control.

289
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,936
I'm sorry, man.

290
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,904
I didn't want to
bring everybody down.

291
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,541
Great job with that.

292
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,709
Mike.

293
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,778
Mike!

294
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,081
All right, I'm out of here.

295
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,951
Wait, you're not gonna try
and sort things out with mike?

296
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,419
He doesn't want to talk to me.

297
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,155
Oh, right. So that's the
kind of person you are.

298
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:11,757
There's a problem,
you avoid it.

299
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:13,725
Leslie's sad, take
her to atlantic city.

300
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,693
I've hurt mike's feelings,
I'll just run away.

301
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:17,462
Have you ever heard
the expression,

302
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,131
"people who live
in glass mansions

303
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,766
Shouldn't throw diamonds"?

304
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,035
Oh, I can't say I have.

305
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:25,537
You act like you've
got it all figured out.

306
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,873
You take care of
everyone else's problems

307
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,107
To avoid your own.

308
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,475
What's that supposed to mean?

309
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:31,977
You have issues.

310
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,112
I mean, I have issues,
but you have issues too.

311
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,614
What issues?

312
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:37,816
Men issues, for one.

313
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:46,058
I feel like a fool.

314
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,560
Am I, jill? Am I a fool?

315
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,729
No, but you should know

316
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,831
You dropped your towel
abt 20 yards back.

317
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,799
What the-

318
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,509
Isn't this fun?

319
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,678
Oh, this is fun!

320
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,447
This is what we need.

321
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,382
Wayne doesn't know anything.

322
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,619
Leslie, do you
want me to feed you?

323
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:20,225
Thanks for the
clothes, charlotte.

324
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:30,402
Mike, what are you
doing for knickers?

325
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,703
Nothing.

326
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,473
Oh. You could keep those.

327
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:39,111
I can't believe wayne's
poor and that he's gone.

328
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,812
No, that's what he does.

329
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,382
One minute he's there,
turns his light on you,

330
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,384
And you know that
everything's gonna be okay.

331
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,219
And then in the next,

332
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,421
He disappears into the night.

333
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:53,325
Like batman.

334
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:54,493
Well, I think it was terrible

335
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,194
He didn't tell you the truth,

336
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:58,095
Leaving you to spend $1,100

337
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,698
And bare your behind

338
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,768
To all those poor
people on staten island.

339
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,370
I thought we were
gonna split the $1,100.

340
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,338
We just told you that
to get you on the bus.

341
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:08,907
Oh!

342
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,810
Do you think they're at
the rehearsal dinner now?

343
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:13,578
It doesn't matter.

344
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:15,280
I just know he's out there,

345
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,882
Wandering around aimlessly.

346
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:20,485
No friends, no family,
no black credit card.

347
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,220
I miss jeffrey!

348
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,355
I miss wayne!

349
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,324
Enough! Enough with jeffrey!

350
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,825
And enough with wayne!

351
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,226
I'm gonna be honest with you.

352
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,127
I'm not crazy about wayne.

353
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,065
Do you know what
he said to me?

354
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,667
He said I distract myself
with my friends' problems

355
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,302
So I don't have to
face my own-get this-

356
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,804
Man issues.

357
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,840
That's ridiculous.
- You? Absolutely not.

358
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:05,931
Do you want me to
have this or not?

359
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,004
Oh, it's you.

360
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,505
Hey.

361
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,107
Hello.

362
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,408
Uh, can you give that to mike?

363
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:19,544
It's just 23 bucks to go
toward covering the limo.

364
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:21,480
It's all the
money I had, so...

365
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:23,682
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

366
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,551
I think I'm the last
person mike wants to see.

367
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,721
He's been shouting
your name in his sleep.

368
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:32,958
I think you two are on some
sort of pirate adventure.

369
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:35,127
Charlotte.
- Hmm?

370
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,395
I can't find leslie anywhere.

371
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:39,031
She's right there.
- Oh.

372
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:40,565
That's a throw pillow
and a pair of socks.

373
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,000
What are you worried about?

374
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,268
What do you mean, what
am I worried about?

375
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,269
It's Saturday.

376
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,238
The wedding.
- The wedding.

377
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:50,342
Captain wayne, skeletons
on the starboard bow!

378
00:15:56,516 --> 00:15:58,683
Right. Here it is.

379
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,886
Hey, this is really
the type of wedding

380
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:02,154
That you and leslie
should be planning,

381
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:04,990
Not those crappy bar mitzvahs.

382
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,258
Thank you, jill.

383
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,759
Right. We have to go inside.

384
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,327
I've never crashed
a wedding before.

385
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,695
I have.

386
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:12,164
Anyone asks, you're the
groom's second cousin,

387
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,331
In from phoenix.

388
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,800
Nobody wants to
hear about phoenix.

389
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:15,801
Right.

390
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:18,103
We'll wait out here.

391
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,008
Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:24,342
I don't know.

393
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:26,578
It's just that...

394
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:28,346
I was embarrassed.

395
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:30,148
Why?

396
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,317
You always talk about me

397
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:33,852
And act like I'm the
coolest guy you know,

398
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:34,920
And now...

399
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:36,455
You think I wouldn't like you

400
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,889
Because you don't have money?

401
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,959
It happens. Trust me.

402
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,298
Do you remember in 11th grade

403
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,966
When you dad
took us to greece?

404
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:50,402
The only think I
remember about that trip

405
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,637
Was the night that you and
I stayed awake all night

406
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,973
Writing that song
about spanakopita.

407
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,676
That was a great song.
- That was a bad song.

408
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:03,348
Lyrically it was weak,
but it was very melodic.

409
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:07,018
I don't care about
the money, wayne.

410
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,454
I do.

411
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:13,091
Well, tell you what.

412
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,993
If you want, you can
stay with me for a while

413
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,761
Till you figure out
what you're gonna do.

414
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:18,597
Really?

415
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,532
For the past 20 years,

416
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,701
Whenever I've been down,
you have picked me up.

417
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:24,803
In a private jet.
- Yeah.

418
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:27,873
I have a couch.

419
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,008
I'll take it.

420
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:31,810
All right.

421
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,178
She's not in there.

422
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,113
But they really pulled
out all the stops.

423
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,115
That is a gorgeous,
gorgeous wedding.

424
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:38,617
Yeah.

425
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,152
Well, if she's not in there
and she's not out here,

426
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:41,520
What should we do?

427
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,922
Maybe we should go up there.

428
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,062
She wouldn't-

429
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,198
Just go.

430
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,568
Leslie!

431
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,006
Are you okay?

432
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,474
This might be a
shot in the dark,

433
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:04,743
But I'm gonna go
ahead and say, "no."

434
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,811
I was going to
go to the wedding,

435
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,547
And I figured when he saw me,

436
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,682
He'd realize he was
making a mistake.

437
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,351
But I couldn't even go in.

438
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,388
Oh, leslie, I'm so sorry.

439
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:18,390
Why don't we just go home?

440
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,357
You don't need to see this.

441
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:26,131
Oh, here comes the bride.

442
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,533
And she's fat.

443
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:29,834
She's not fat.

444
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,036
She's not fat, she's huge.

445
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,037
Look at her.

446
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,805
Really? She's fat?

447
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:36,808
Sure.
- Like circus fat.

448
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,443
I don't see her.

449
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:42,047
That's because she probably
ran off to the buffet.

450
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:43,949
Give me the binoculars.

451
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,117
Oops.

452
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,452
Oh, and look, look.

453
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,321
I think jeffrey's
losing his hair.

454
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:51,356
Really?
- Yeah.

455
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,559
That is so awesome.

456
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,494
Hey, let's make a pact.

457
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,597
If we're not married
by the time we're 35,

458
00:18:58,664 --> 00:18:59,998
We will come back
to this rooftop,

459
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,132
And we will hold hands,

460
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,001
And we will jump off
this building together,

461
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:05,237
Just like thelma and louise.

462
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,172
And mike.

463
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:10,308
Could we make it 37?

464
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:12,444
Sure.

465
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:20,085
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

466
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,355
So you do want
to sleep with me.

467
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,423
Oh, my god.

468
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,192
I'm gonna throw
you off this roof.

469
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:28,760
Oh, feisty.

470
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:32,831
Just like the 4'6"
sarah jessica parker.

471
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,536
I'm sorry I said you
run away from problems.

472
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:41,039
That's okay. It's true.

473
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:43,808
I'm sorry I said
you had man issues.

474
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,711
Yeah, well, you should
be, 'cause it's not true.

475
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,614
Everyone knows it. I
have it all together.

476
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,252
What did we miss?

477
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:56,588
Ring bearer's
picking his nose.

478
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,891
This wedding has
gone downhill.

479
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,626
Well, it's over.

480
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:04,129
They're throwing the rice.

481
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:07,332
I'm sorry, leslie.

482
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,003
It's okay.

483
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,807
Congratulations!

484
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,708
Oh, my god!
- No!

485
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,095
Yeah, it's fine.

486
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,597
You sure it's not
too small for you?

487
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,399
'cause seriously, if you
want, you can have my bedroom.

488
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,700
Yeah, okay.

489
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,769
I'll take the
bedroom. Thanks, man.

490
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,372
O
- okay. Good.

491
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,941
Great. Yeah, uh...

492
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,376
I'll empty my bureau.

493
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,412
Dude, I'm kidding. I'm not
gonna take your bedroom.

494
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,081
I mean, the couch
is more than fine.

495
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,684
You're a good egg, mike poole.

496
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:01,725
So what's the
shampoo situation?

497
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,495
Better not be that
two-in-one crap.
