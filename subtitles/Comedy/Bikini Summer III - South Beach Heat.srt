1
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,765
Tell Ruth Hedeby when she's finished
with the meeting that we are

2
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,290
not shutting anything down and
that the case will remain open.

3
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,000
No, we are not shutting down and those people
who were given time off, will be called back

4
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,755
I will get backing and
the resources from

5
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,707
management once they see
what I have from forensic.

6
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,574
They have not found anything in Jylland.

7
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:13,707
The search of being called off
they have not found anything in Jylland.

8
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:14,704
The search of being called off

9
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:14,774
send them back again
The search of being called off

10
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,509
send them back again

11
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:19,375
requested local police to continue
to search for Emilie Zeuthen.

12
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,908
Coordinate with Lund, we shall give
them all the help that they need

13
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,807
tell Robert Zeuthen that we
have new information and

14
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,776
often to come in for a
briefing As soon as possible..

15
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:29,400
Asbjørn has requested backup,
they have traced the kidnapper.

16
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,707
Asbjørn, Brix here, What is happening.

17
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:35,478
Lund and Borch have traced
him to an old shipyard

18
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:37,174
just outside of town and
we are no our way now

19
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,674
have they captured him?

20
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,249
No, it does not sound good, they definitely
do not have control over the situation

21
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:40,901
what seems to be the problem

22
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,899
apparently they have been
locked in or something

23
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,818
the phone reception was not good,
so I'm not completely sure

24
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,575
what exactly had happened,
but we are rushing there now

25
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,250
hello anything

26
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:34,425
give me the black notebook, slide it
under the door, then you're free to go

27
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,425
he wants the book

28
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,600
give me the phone,

29
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,201
listen up, we do not have
the notebook for fuck sake

30
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:45,050
backup is on the way, listen
to me, turn off the engine

31
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,075
hello, HELLO!

32
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,325
I can't! You do it

33
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,800
you go ahead and come back to me

34
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,825
go on! We do not have time for this

35
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,075
drop the gun the gun.

36
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,750
Book.. gone...

37
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,650
the police and police intelligence
have traced the kidnapper to Jutland

38
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,564
right now it's incredibly
important that you keep a cool

39
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,400
head and get that meeting
with the heads of the party

40
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:21,625
ahh, Kamper... Kamper.

41
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:27,281
Kamper, I have to say, I just
heard about the meeting...

42
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,925
I'll do everything
to back you up

43
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,227
the Minister of finance will try her
best to discredit you, there is

44
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:36,600
no doubt that she has already attended
to influence some of the others

45
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,600
it's completely irrelevant
what she have done

46
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,175
this not going to be any meeting!

47
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,020
Right now we investigating
information that could

48
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,500
exonerates the government
of all wrongdoing

49
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,951
and you call me for this meeting

50
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:57,025
as member of the government you
are accountable to me and only me

51
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,223
and that's why you're
telling everybody here that

52
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,549
your incredible sorry that
you have wasted their time

53
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,851
but what is that information

54
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,535
we now have the witness that will
testify that it was Ussing that was

55
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,400
putting pressure on the prosecutor
that was responsible for the old case

56
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,426
but, what is it that you are saying?
What witness?

57
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,100
The witness is a trusted
member of Ussing staff

58
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,720
the police intelligence
Bureau is investigating it

59
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:18,276
now, I can't say more about
it now, is that clear

60
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,400
yes of course

61
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,775
I hope is not that guy Seifert

62
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,675
of course it's not him, do you
think we are complete idiots

63
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,200
everybody knows that he has been charged
by the police for stealing from Ussing.

64
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:29,899
Mogens! Everybody knows that he has been
charged by the police for stealing from Ussing

65
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:30,025
everybody knows that he has been charged
by the police for stealing from Ussing

66
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,100
while I guess it doesn't matter if..

67
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,425
No matter what, it still
needs to be investigated

68
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,945
I have asked PIB to..

69
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,400
Unless Emilie Zeuthen shows up in
live within the next five minutes

70
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,925
are we going to start the
meeting with or without you.

71
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,050
I'm going to check with
the Ministry of Justice

72
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,125
do that, I was just going
to propose the same

73
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,525
where is he, how could he get away?

74
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,900
I don't know, they're
still searching for him

75
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:07,251
you are right, Emilie Zeuthen
was not shot in the boat

76
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:09,250
have you found any signs of her?

77
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,000
She was not at the boathouse,
this searching his car right now

78
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,000
what the f.. is it then
that you have found?

79
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,000
The crime scene of Louise Jelby

80
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,316
apparently she was picked
up by her killer in a

81
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,776
black car when she was on
her way back from school

82
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,524
and then he drove her
out to an abandoned

83
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:26,925
shipbuilder where she was
kept captured and abused

84
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,150
and after that he apparently drove her out
to the harbor to make it look like suicide

85
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:33,150
and the kidnapper found
out about this place?

86
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,303
Now he's trying to figure
out who have done it

87
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,500
using an notebook that he
managed to get hold of

88
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,399
what notebook?

89
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,216
Well that was a boy who
wrote down all the license

90
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:41,676
plate numbers of cars
passing by that day

91
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,700
the kidnapper took the book from Borch.

92
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,700
Hedeby wants a briefing

93
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:49,345
what are you talking about? Where
did Borch have that book from?

94
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,750
You will have to ask Borch or Police
Intelligence bureau (PIB) about

95
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,125
there was a reason

96
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,100
I would like to explain.

97
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,975
I...

98
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,520
we have sent search dogs
through the plantation and

99
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:17,475
the beach, but the dogs lost
the scent at a stream...

100
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,200
He is no foot and he's injured

101
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,874
yes, but they believe that he
followed a stream leading back

102
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,425
to town through some wetlands,
and now it's dark and even..

103
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,576
I have not withheld information that
could have slowed down the investigation

104
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:33,900
let's get his blood back to forensics
to test his DNA, what about the car?

105
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:37,575
They don't believe that she was ever
in the car, the dogs did not react

106
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,575
okay let's go back to Copenhagen

107
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,275
if you can get anything out of that notebook,
I'm sure that would lead him to Copenhagen

108
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I could not have done it
differently, do you understand

109
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,574
I have told you everything

110
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,975
what is it that you have been covering up?

111
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,475
I cannot tell you anything until it has been
cleared, but he would not have helped you.

112
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm trying to explain

113
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:19,850
it's not a question of a single mistake

114
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,492
it's your relationship with Rosa
Lebech, her ex-husband who apparently

115
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:26,825
is leaking confidential information
from the Ministry of Justice

116
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,125
to the whole management
of the Zeuthen case

117
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,150
you have not been listening
to any warning signs

118
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,300
and instead of just letting the minister
of justice handling his own mess..

119
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,526
It's not the ministry of justice
that have been making any mistakes

120
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:40,237
you have been making the
Zeuthen case personal and

121
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:43,000
thereby jeopardizing the
whole party's credibility

122
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:47,650
you have to understand what kind
of situation you have put us in

123
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:48,951
we have a responsibility to all voters

124
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,250
and to the Zeuthen family

125
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,000
the party can not dispose of Prime Minister

126
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,233
well to my knowledge there has
never been a case of a Prime.

127
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,651
Minister surviving for very long
without the support of his party

128
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:01,466
the question is what kind of
party representing, if we don't

129
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,050
have more sensible things to
spend our time on than this

130
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,750
yes, our credibility is on the
line, and so is our future

131
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,226
our relationship with Zeeland

132
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:10,226
the foundation file financial rescue plan

133
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:13,425
but but you know me, you know
my views no matter what the.

134
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,200
Minister of finance have been telling you.
This is helping no one

135
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:22,025
you elected me because you trusted
me, that trust I need right now

136
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,600
unfortunately that is not going to
make Emilie Zeuthen come back to life

137
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,051
am I to understand that you
are not going to listen to

138
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,501
reason and thereby pushed
party into internal fraction.

139
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,759
Therefore I see no other reason than
to call for party meeting.. Mogens

140
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,695
would you be so kind to take a
seat so we can make some decisions

141
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,025
just a moment I just received new
information from my ministry.

142
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,738
I just got information from the
police, they have just found the

143
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,150
bag that was supposed to contain
the body of Emilie Zeuthen

144
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,000
it's apparently just to bag and
not the body of Emilie Zeuthen

145
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,950
it's quite clear that there's
only material damage

146
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,600
but that is definitely good news

147
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,815
and if we have no objections,
then I think that the

148
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,300
latest news have superseded
the purpose of this meeting

149
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,695
well I guess this is the best picture

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,950
the kidnapper got away and unfortunately that
no evidence suggesting that Emilie Zeuthen

151
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:20,951
was ever in Jutland

152
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,275
but the good news is that
she can still be alive.

153
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,749
Have Zeuthen been informed?

154
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,124
They the police right now

155
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,349
what happened at the meeting?

156
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,650
We need to get hold of PIB

157
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,900
that witness needs to be taken
seriously I need to know what Ussing

158
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,901
the witnesses being interrogated
by the PIB right now

159
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:39,460
but there's more to the case, the
police is accusing PIB of withholding

160
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:42,375
important information regarding
the old case from Jutland.

161
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,151
PIB claim that they knew
nothing about that case

162
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,775
yes I do not know what's going on

163
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,776
I believe everything should be okay again
with regards to the Minister of finance

164
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,800
and I would just like to not hold a grudge

165
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,850
we don't want any more trouble now

166
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:58,725
get hold of PIB I need a briefing right now

167
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,468
the sack had been transported
by the current from

168
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:03,200
the bridge out of the
harbour and into the fjord

169
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:06,649
we found the bag on 12 m of water,
the anchor made it go to the

170
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:10,150
bottom despite the positive buoyancy
of the rest of the material

171
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,388
as you can see the bullet
had gone through the bag

172
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,625
the caliber of the bullets
on the same as previous

173
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,350
a wish I could answer the questions
that this new evidence raises...

174
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,350
she's alive

175
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,631
the kidnapper was traced
to Jutland, but there's

176
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,500
nothing to suggest that
Emilie was with him

177
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,375
so for now the trail of
Emilie stops at the boat

178
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,325
we have intensified the search, but..

179
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,800
Nothing is certain

180
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,800
I will really like it when you against..

181
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,712
Get a hold of our chief
security officer and everybody

182
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,375
else who have competency in
that area and get them updated

183
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,425
no, we'll take care of the search now

184
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,775
I understand your frustration but you cannot
start interfering in the investigation now

185
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,524
we have wasted 48 hours since that bridge

186
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:04,426
we have not waste..

187
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:08,150
We were just about to tell our
son that his sister was dead

188
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,749
do you understand what I'm saying

189
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,601
I do apologize that we were mistaken

190
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:15,225
but you risk complicating
everything more by interfering

191
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,325
it's not the right way to go about it

192
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,650
of course there is an explication

193
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,951
as you know the girl was
found dead in that harbor

194
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,139
as part of the investigation
by the local police

195
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:36,325
uncovered and notebook
containing license plates

196
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,325
and as a routine we were informed cause..

197
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,850
You told me that PIB knew
nothing about this case

198
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,301
yes in hindsight that was a mistake

199
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,301
we did not know anything
about the case details

200
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,519
we were only interested in
the case since the Prime.

201
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,675
Minister's election campaign
car was in that book

202
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,650
what! Can you repeat

203
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,377
we were informed back then
because one of the numbers

204
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,000
in that book was the number
of your campaign car.

205
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,450
Of course we knew that the Prime Minister
had nothing to do with that case

206
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,725
I don't understand

207
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,364
it was during the last election,
your touring around the country

208
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:10,675
and somehow your cost license
number ended up in a kids notebook

209
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:17,325
we contacted the prosecutor he informed us
that it was suicide and we stopped looking

210
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,350
we had no idea that that information
was important until now

211
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,873
but then you found out that the
prosecutor was covering up

212
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:23,875
the case, wouldn't that notebook
then make a difference?

213
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,737
Is obvious now that the rest of the
numbers of great interest, mainly because

214
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:31,325
the car that was used by opposition
leader Ussing was also in that book

215
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,300
okay

216
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,301
it was wrong of me to tell you that we
did not know anything about this case

217
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:36,775
I apologize

218
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,900
what does it mean that
Ussing is in that book?

219
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,164
Now that we know that the prosecutor was
covering up the case and with the witness

220
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,675
that you have brought us, obviously
we are intensifying our investigation

221
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
hmm, as a suspect?

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
It's a possibility, but we are
primarily focusing on the kidnapper

223
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,300
he can't have much use of this book it
only contains license plate numbers

224
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,069
we know he's wounded, my
guess is that will catch him

225
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,725
soon and then we'll know
what happened to Emilie.

226
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,001
What did he say about Ussing?
Will he be investigated?

227
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:12,350
That's something that the police and
the PIB will have to take care of

228
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,253
in the meantime I'll like to shift our
focus back on the upcoming election and

229
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,700
am not going to throw accusations at
Ussing until we have more information

230
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,725
but you have to admit the
things the getting better now.

231
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,200
Lebech wants to meet up with you again

232
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,400
are you kidding me

233
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:30,575
it's too early, can you check up
on the arrangements for tomorrow

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,200
see you

235
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,625
thank you for your hard work Karen

236
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,500
is not that often I get a chance to
say it, but you are important to me

237
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,500
it's what I get paid for

238
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,500
I know but anyway

239
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,125
do you have a minute

240
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,850
no not really.

241
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm going to the Ministry of
Justice to check up on Mogens.

242
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,275
I'm really sorry about
everything that had happened

243
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,976
I can understand if you have
lost your trusted in me

244
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:13,950
look, there's quite a lot of
need to get done for tomorrow

245
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,900
I forward I could keep our
private life and professional

246
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,650
life separate but I am
not a strong as you are.

247
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:24,850
I've had a lot of pressure on me
from my party and from my ex-husband

248
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,875
but it doesn't change my feelings for you

249
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,350
I need you to understand that.

250
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,800
She was at the bridge and the boat
was found in Copenhagen harbor

251
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,100
so that's where we start the search

252
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,226
but the police have already
expanded their search

253
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,150
they have more men searching
the harbor and the coastline

254
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:47,375
the police is basically everywhere
they have checked all the ships

255
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,775
so where have the police been

256
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,025
they have not been looking in all
the containers in the harbor

257
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,850
get them searched

258
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,851
is that realistic.. they are sealed

259
00:20:55,876 --> 00:21:01,025
just contact the owners and tell them that
they will get refunded for the trouble

260
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,673
there are also legal aspects, not all
of the containers Zeelands and the

261
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,900
contents off the containers are the
properties of the individual owners

262
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,600
I get it started

263
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,475
I will contact our legal department
and get them to handle it

264
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
the board wants to have a meeting

265
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,725
you have to take care of that

266
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:32,800
when I got back, Carls..
Was watching the news

267
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,350
don't listen to what they say about Emilie

268
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:40,350
your mom and dad is looking for her

269
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,225
and if there's something that
you like to know, just ask us

270
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
but what if you can't find her

271
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:48,225
will find her

272
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,725
when?

273
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,775
Soon.

274
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,750
I've also been looking for her, I thought she
was in “the in between” but she wasn't there

275
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,300
what “the in between”
are you talking about

276
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,500
the room she goes to, when she
does want to listen anymore.

277
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,100
What is it that Emilie
doesn't want to hear?

278
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,100
When you arguing and ..

279
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,600
Lest go downstairs and get a cookie

280
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,125
I have packed the most basic things

281
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,375
then we have to wait and see
where he wants to sleep

282
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,600
any news

283
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,900
no, not yet.

284
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,150
Have Carl or Emilie ever talked about
something they call “the in between”?

285
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,500
No,

286
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,980
PIB continue to claim that
their protection off the Prime.

287
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,475
Minister and notebook had
nothing to do with our case

288
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,075
we need all the information now, they must
have a copy of those license plate numbers

289
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,275
the head of PIB is coming for
meeting tomorrow morning

290
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,275
have Borch told you anything?

291
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,275
Nope

292
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,251
do you have any news on the kidnapper

293
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:10,080
we cannot know how he got
your mobile phone number,

294
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,800
but we know he got back
to Sjaeland as a stowaway

295
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,125
and blood was found that matches his

296
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,125
okay, but nobody have seen anything.

297
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,125
No, but forensic test.

298
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,024
HI, don't turn on the heat

299
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:22,084
shows that it is 99% sure
that the kidnapper is the

300
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:22,146
biological father of Louise
HI, don't turn on the heat

301
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:29,550
shows that it is 99% sure that the kidnapper
is the biological father of Louise.

302
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,665
I've already started the
search, if the father is

303
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,000
unknown then we need to find
out more about the mother.

304
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,595
I'll keep you updated.

305
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,875
Okay

306
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,318
we can only hope for to get appeared
of time without subzero temperatures

307
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:53,850
otherwise will have to wait with bringing
them outside to the become spring

308
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,050
I made pumpkin soup if you like some.

309
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,850
You did not see it, close the door again,
the pictures from my ultrasound scan.

310
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,150
Let me warm the soup for you

311
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:09,650
no I don't want any soup, candlelight
or ultrasound pictures right now

312
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,950
okay, calm down I'm only
staying till tomorrow.

313
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,475
Did you talk to Mark?

314
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,545
Yes, he only told me that
he didn't know what to do

315
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,600
so I need to start thinking about
what's best for me and the baby.

316
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,400
I'll move in with a friend or I
will move back to my parents.

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,625
Mark will probably change ones he sees
the baby and you have your apartment

318
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,625
no, the apartment is not going to be ready

319
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,530
guy from the management office came
to survey the ceiling, he told us

320
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:48,500
there is asbestos, so the ceiling and
everything needs to be torn down

321
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,850
oh

322
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,825
it's going to be okay, if you could
manage to be a single mom then so can I

323
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,770
I don't think I managed

324
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,150
I thought that I could give Mark a proper..

325
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,825
Well I couldn't

326
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,375
it did not work with Mark's dad and me

327
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,975
so there was not much I could do.

328
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,625
Why did it work?

329
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:19,825
Anymore soup?

330
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,850
You would together and
then you got pregnant

331
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,875
I loved him

332
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,850
I love one before and

333
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:33,700
I broke it up with him to
even though it was him that

334
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,375
well, that's what happens

335
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,800
while I'm okay now

336
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,775
I have to answer this call

337
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,476
you can stay as long as you
want to and of course I would

338
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,875
like to have the ultrasound
picture on the fridge.

339
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,575
What.

340
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Why did you stop me?

341
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,575
Your partner the guy
from PIB deserve to die

342
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,001
you can see that he was
covering up the case

343
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,025
where is Emilie?

344
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,200
I need your help Lund

345
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:06,425
we know you didn't bring her
to Jutland, is she alive?

346
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,026
There are 12 entries of
black cars in the notebook

347
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,600
from that day, one of them
picked up a small girl

348
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,375
I need the names and the ID numbers of these
12 people and then now take care of the rest.

349
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,779
No, I need you to surrender
and give us back Emilie

350
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:24,350
alive and then our promise
to solve the old case.

351
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,350
I'll call tomorrow and then I expect
to get the names and the ID numbers

352
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,800
you know I can't give you
that, don't you thing

353
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:33,375
that your daughter deserve
that we solve the case

354
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,901
your blood matches that of hers

355
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,025
I promise you that your daughters
killer will get his punishment

356
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,625
but you have to give me Emilie

357
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,245
I will get a copy of the
registration numbers

358
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,976
tomorrow and then I'll
get started immediately

359
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:45,800
okay?

360
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,625
Okay, but don't disappoint me

361
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,600
and you don't have to wait till tomorrow,
I have placed a copy on your doorstep.

362
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,735
We have stationed 2 offices
near Sarah Lund's house

363
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,550
in response to the
kidnappers visit last night

364
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:28,800
no thanks! I feel more
unsafe with your guys around

365
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:32,560
I can understand your point
of view, but you have

366
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,143
to understand that our
mission back then was

367
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:35,797
to protect the Prime
Minister ending up in the

368
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,450
tabloids just because his
car was in this book

369
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,446
how can you be sure that
the Prime Minister or

370
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:41,525
any of his staff were not
involved in this case?

371
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,227
It was his campaign car with chauffeur
and staff and everything and if

372
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:48,875
you think it was us who put pressure
on the prosecutor, you're wrong!

373
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,425
We fought that will be a
reasonable assumption

374
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,300
we are just as surprised about the
behavior of the prosecutor is you are

375
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:57,000
and my colleague Matias have been giving
you to correct information at all times

376
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,226
except for the small detail, that
you actually knew about the case

377
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:03,365
and that you grab the notebook
and I'm sure we would not have

378
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,300
been told about it unless we
found out about it ourselves

379
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,451
of course we would have told you

380
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:09,914
I just asked Borch to get
the notebook so we could

381
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,375
gain a clear picture, before
we handed over to you

382
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,125
of course you would

383
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,250
it's not Matias fault. Nobody could have known
that the notebook was important until now

384
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:23,825
so which one of these 12 cars is So
important that the prosecutor would

385
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,125
change the date of the girl's death?
You must know it, which one?

386
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,675
Which one? You must know

387
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
if we knew it we would tell you

388
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,151
what about Ussing? His any
of his cars on the list??

389
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:38,445
Yes, also a election campaign car

390
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,400
we are currently investigating his
relationship with Louise Jelby

391
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:45,350
but it might be an
unreliable witness we have

392
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,676
okay let's bring Ussing
in for questioning

393
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:51,050
you can do that but we
have act carefully, this

394
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,325
is a prominent politician
we're talking about

395
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,326
the girl was abused killed,
and then thrown in a harbor.

396
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:59,550
And if the only thing he wants in exchange
for the safe return of Emilie is justice

397
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:00,375
then we better get started

398
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:03,050
or how?

399
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,050
Yes

400
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,056
we have no clues to the
whereabouts of Emilie so

401
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:10,000
we cannot take your
sensibility into the matter

402
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:13,950
I made him a promise and I do
believe he will give us Emilie,

403
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:16,450
but we need to get started
now, he will call tonight.

404
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:21,325
We agree, you search the harbor
and we will take care parliament

405
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,175
no you can search the
harbor and we do the rest

406
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,149
with a good steady pace he
could have managed to get to

407
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,693
the Copenhagen harbor then
he would have had two hours

408
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,322
before he stole the car giving
him plenty of time to hide

409
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:46,950
the girl well, then it looks
like we're cooperating again

410
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:49,494
well, then it looks like we're
cooperating again you have to go

411
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,275
through everything again, somebody
must have seen something or camera

412
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,351
you have to go through everything again,
somebody must have seen something or camera

413
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:59,300
yes we are trying but it's difficult to
get access with all Zeuthen people here.

414
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:01,300
Brix is trying to do something about it

415
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:05,250
yeah okay what about Borch? Are you okay?

416
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:11,075
I know he fucked up, but it was him who got us
started again when we had given up searching

417
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,775
just call if you find something

418
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,875
it cannot come a surprise to you that there
were some things I couldn't talk about

419
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,850
don't be like that I've
tried to be loyal to you

420
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,875
confidentiality, I understand it

421
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,525
it meant something to me

422
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,550
between us

423
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
let's go

424
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
give me an update

425
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:03,025
the nursery is a job creation
project with about 100 employees

426
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,600
but with the stiff competition they are
about to close with debts in the millions

427
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,825
thank you

428
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,249
something wrong?

429
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:23,150
No, nothing

430
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:29,650
then there are rumors that Rosa
has dropped her backing of Ussing

431
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,650
any comments from Ussing?

432
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,650
I'm sure he will now

433
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,025
I do not want to comment on these rumors, but
if you have any questions on job creation.

434
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,051
Ussing: I'm standing with a glass of water.

435
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,075
Rosa: it was just...

436
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,517
we were asked, if we were willing
to take some additional questions

437
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,275
beyond the agenda, we don't have any
problem with that what about you?

438
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:03,075
As long as we get to talk about job creation
and the governments waste of tax kroner.

439
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,950
Rosa: you can borrow mine.

440
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,326
Kamper: thank you

441
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,350
I need to run it by my advices

442
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,450
that is some serious shit that you are
involved in, that is an unreliable witness

443
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,650
don't think you can win by
using these dirty tricks

444
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:23,750
as far as I understand
it's not only a witness.

445
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,800
I'll explain everything I can assure you

446
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,825
but you should look around for good
lawyer when I sue for defamation

447
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,075
is okay with us.

448
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:48,025
Ussing has been called back to Parliament
to help the police with the investigation

449
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,050
what a pity

450
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,714
now he doesn't want money,
he wants them to solve

451
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,725
an old case and why
should I wait for that

452
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,725
did you find anything.

453
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,051
Its a time-consuming process going
through alll those containers

454
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,650
then hire some more people

455
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:15,796
we're not missing any people, were still
working with some of the shipping

456
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:19,150
operators to get agreements in place, but
some of them are not very cooperative

457
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,175
just get done

458
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,175
excuse us for a minute

459
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
of course

460
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:34,350
I have talked with the board and they all
supported, but we are still without a CEO

461
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,725
share prices falling and
rumors are circulating...

462
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,325
if they have anything to say, they can say to me.
And then just do what I tell you to do

463
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,776
Robert

464
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,425
you get paid to do what I
tell you to do, so do it

465
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,425
there was uncalled for

466
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,950
here is your speech for the TV announcement

467
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:51,950
thank you.

468
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,600
I've been speaking with the
nanny and their teachers,

469
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,150
and none of them have heard
about “the in between”

470
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,150
maybe it's just a game they made up

471
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,449
Robert Zeuthen: Are They Ready?

472
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:06,325
Maja Zeuthen: Yes

473
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,150
the police called and asked us not to do it

474
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,725
no, let's go

475
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:27,930
you have the chance to
save the life of Emilie.

476
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,295
Zeuthen life, I'm sure your
voters will understand

477
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,026
I have already accepted
answering your questions,

478
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:36,104
as you are aware, there is a close
relationship between the old case that your

479
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,051
friend the prosecutor was in charge of
and the kidnapping of Emilie Zeuthen

480
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:44,900
I am deeply shocked but I had already
been question regarding that meeting

481
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,475
there was a witness present.

482
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,725
Thorsten Seifert claims that the meeting
was about to dead girl Louise Jelby.

483
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,575
Thorsten Seifert is completely untrustworthy,
I trust he's not the reason why we're here.

484
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,250
Do you recognise this girl Louise JelbyJ?

485
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:58,326
Sorry, no

486
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:01,192
on the 20 April 21/2 year ago
where you around Gudbjerg.

487
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:03,750
Havn, the town where Louise
Jelby was found dead.

488
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:07,575
Here is a list of occupants
on a hotel nearby under day

489
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,956
I was on the election trail, and
if he had done your homework,

490
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,575
you would have found out that I
was around their at the time

491
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,175
you drove a black car.

492
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,691
A BMW 3 series, it was up-served
on the stretch of the road where

493
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:23,100
Louise Jelby was picked up by a
black car, same place same time

494
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,100
I was likely at a election
meeting with my staff

495
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,525
likely!

496
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,118
Listen, a small girl was
tortured and murdered and your

497
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:31,525
good friend Peter Schultz
made it look like suicide

498
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,951
so for your own sake, I would suggest
that you try to be more precise

499
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:36,016
what exactly were you talking about
at that meeting with Peter Schultz

500
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,900
and don't give me any story about
exchanging University stories

501
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,275
we use this girl and one of our campaigns

502
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,126
what campaign?

503
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:53,050
A campaign for our foster care program

504
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:53,826
who are you?

505
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,825
Per Monrad, Political adviser

506
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,488
her foster care family was a glowing
example of the success of the

507
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,975
work that we had done in the
area and our foster care program

508
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,272
but then we were told that she
had committed suicide and

509
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:07,050
then that ruined our campaign
worth several million

510
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:09,050
we had to stop it all
before it even got started

511
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:12,850
hold on a minute, what had that to do
with your friend the chief prosecutor

512
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:15,705
I had heard that Peter was handling
the case and I just wanted

513
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,275
to make sure that part was not
relevant to the investigation

514
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
what did Peter say about the case

515
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,475
he told me that he could not talk
about the case, and I respect that

516
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,925
so that means you actually
did know that the girl

517
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,438
there is how it works, they find
somebody, I show up for the photo shoot,

518
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:32,500
I wouldn't be able to recognize her
if you showed me a picture of her

519
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,425
so you did not pick up that day?

520
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,076
Are you suggesting that I should
have killed some small girl.

521
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:40,750
I'm not suggesting anything

522
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,775
I have Ussing schedule
for that day right here

523
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,600
as you can see we had a meeting with the
Prime Minister in Esbjerg that day and time

524
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,195
does that answer your questions?
Then we would like to ..

525
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,003
No it doesn't, we need all the
details from both of your organisers

526
00:36:57,028 --> 00:37:00,250
and everything relevant to
that day by the end of the day

527
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,581
and if we doesn't get that,
then will come back again here

528
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:03,025
with a search warrant and go
through everything in your office

529
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,375
thank you

530
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,326
the PR company confirms that they
used the girl for that campaign

531
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:17,275
how is it possible that
the PIB missed that?

532
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,075
They say they are making
a copy of the film now

533
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,175
you know anything about Ussing's private
life that we should know about?

534
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,325
Or is that also confidential

535
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,075
answer!

536
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,525
Ussing Got divorced from his wife
from Thailand five years ago

537
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:41,325
he has two adult children that
he doesn't see very frequently

538
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:45,100
he straight, he is sexually active,
anything else you would like to know

539
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,950
we are going to interview his
staff, admin, campaign managers

540
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,834
and then we're going to talk
with the Ministry of State

541
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,650
they must be able to confirm
whether his alibi sticks

542
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:55,374
Sarah

543
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,950
Robert Zeuthen: we hope that you will help
us get Emilie Zeuthen back home alive again

544
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,325
Maja Zeuthen: if anybody have seen
anything, then please contact us

545
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:10,250
she knows that we are looking for her and
will continue looking until we find her

546
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:14,713
information that will lead
to finding Emilie Zeuthen a

547
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:18,625
live will get a reward of
100 million Danish kroner

548
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:25,272
sources tell us that the amount is
close to what the kidnapper initially

549
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:29,125
wanted and is undoubtedly the largest
reward ever given in Denmark

550
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,225
I thought you had Robert
Zeuthen under control.

551
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,925
Kristoffer: it's going great, the media is all
over Ussing, nobody was to work with him.

552
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,780
Kristoffer: the parties
behind you, the Minister

553
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:44,575
of Finance and even Rosa
is asking for meeting.

554
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,574
Kristoffer: may be Karen
should arrange the meetings.

555
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,076
No, know why don't you take care of it

556
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,100
Karen needs to help the police.

557
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,001
Kristoffer: with what?

558
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:55,600
They want some information regarding
the previous election campaign.

559
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,900
Kristoffer: okay I'll arrange something,

560
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,125
Kristopher,

561
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,975
Kristoffer: yes.

562
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,625
I'm happy that you're back

563
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,250
and thank you for reminding me that
we shouldn't do things halfway.

564
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:08,245
We need to keep on doing that.

565
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,750
Kristoffer: yeah oh what
are you talking about

566
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,325
what is happening with Robert Zeuthen
we made a deal with the kidnapper.

567
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,576
Brix: Robert Zeuthen cannot be controlled.

568
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:23,252
Brix: our phone system have
gone down five times, everybody

569
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,550
thinks they have seen
something worth 100 million.

570
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,424
Brix: and arrested because
of complaints from Ussing.

571
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,051
Lund: Ussing, he was lying through his
teeth, we had to spell it out for him.

572
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:34,875
Brix: if he wins the next election,
our department won't have a budget.

573
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,875
Brix: keep me updated

574
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,050
hello

575
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,050
I am Matias Borch, we spoke on the phone.

576
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,511
And I'm Sarah Lund, we need to
get some information about the.

577
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:45,050
Prime Minister's schedule during
the previous election campaign

578
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:47,075
I understand, please have a seat.

579
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,525
Can you remember whether the Prime Minister had
a meeting with Ussing on 20 April that year

580
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,964
I have already looked it
up, the Prime Minister

581
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,425
did indeed have a meeting
with Ussing that they

582
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,401
and your hundred percent sure about that

583
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:59,775
if they had a meeting in Esberg

584
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,150
any chance that Ussing did not show up

585
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:06,225
no chance of that I would have remembered his
biggest opposition, I would have remembered

586
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,671
do you remember if they
there was anything strange

587
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,400
about them that they,
anything stood out?

588
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,375
No I'm sorry don't remember

589
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
what about the Prime Minister?

590
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,276
I'm just asking.

591
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:22,250
Did he drives around alone or
maybe he took a break in the car

592
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,924
is unlikely to have been
the Prime Minister's car.

593
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:26,725
No, that car is only available as part
of his official duties as prime minister.

594
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,117
We have to pay ourself during the
election campaign we drive around

595
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,350
in buses and in campaign cars and
he does not drive around by himself

596
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:37,075
I have to answer this call, Borch here

597
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:42,250
wait a minute, I found something, it
seems like the meeting was postponed

598
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:44,225
how.

599
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,925
Ussing did not participate in a
meeting with the Prime Minister?

600
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,950
Yes but only a few days later.

601
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:51,225
Ussing ask for a reshuffle of some meetings

602
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,700
is quite common during
the election campaign

603
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,951
I want to know what the reason was and
if there are any other meetings that was

604
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:02,000
reshuffled, who did it and any other
information regarding Ussing from back then

605
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,788
I don't have all the
information right here, then

606
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:05,126
then I have to go back
to the archives again

607
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:07,150
please go ahead, thank you

608
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,450
here's my card if you need to
contact me, thank you, bye

609
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:17,051
I got some information from the workers
bank, we need to talk to Ussing again

610
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:19,075
well then you need to join the queue

611
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,100
Robert Zeuthen: we're getting lots of
phone calls, the need to be sorted

612
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,550
Robert Zeuthen: but there's
got to be something there

613
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,926
Robert Zeuthen: what about Carl?

614
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,025
We just got home, I will come
over as soon as possible

615
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:39,151
Carl we drive over to the “the in between”

616
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,175
no

617
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,200
I know where it is, it's
over in the garage isn't it?

618
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:50,075
No

619
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,075
then tell me

620
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:55,550
is it in the basement?

621
00:41:57,325 --> 00:41:58,000
Answer

622
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:00,875
I don't want to go up
to the “the in between”

623
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:02,875
what you mean by "up"

624
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,500
Carl, what you mean “up”?

625
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,500
Emilie told me not to tell anybody

626
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,000
show me that place, right now!

627
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,425
Did dad know that you are hiding up here?

628
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:06,050
We did not want to tell anybody,
we are just playing here

629
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,950
that's not Emilies iPad

630
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,425
hers is down in her room,
how is this one get here?

631
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:39,375
She told me she got it from the man
with the Cat, down by the fence

632
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:57,950
yes this is the same car that
Ussing was driving back then

633
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:04,050
but it can take several weeks for forensic

634
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,700
what are you doing here

635
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:14,175
no matter what it has to be later

636
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,150
the meeting that you claim to
being was postponed by yourself

637
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,150
okay and then what

638
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,150
that doesn't make me a killer

639
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,381
as you understand I was in the
middle of an election campaign

640
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:26,275
wouldn't have been able to move
around without somebody seeing me

641
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,326
we spoke to your chauffeur from back
then and according to the logbook

642
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:32,375
were you absent for several hours and
you were driving around this car

643
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
okay, that's a possibility

644
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:34,551
I have to leave now

645
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:37,722
we have interviewed your staff,
and nobody can verify your

646
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:41,000
whereabouts to you showed up in
your hotel at about midnight

647
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:42,251
please step aside so I can get into my car.

648
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:45,324
As the chairman of the
workers bank, did you

649
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,600
help your friend the
prosecutor out with a loan

650
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,425
what

651
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,824
you disappear from your election
campaign that they where did you go

652
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:54,300
we're talking several millions,
did he do any favours for you?

653
00:44:55,975 --> 00:44:57,275
You have to answer the questions

654
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,800
you can contact my lawyer

655
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,175
you recognise the girl at the main road, you
picked up her and her bike and then what

656
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,825
if you have an explanation then
explain I don't have time for this.

657
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:13,350
Ussing you're not going anywhere this
car, we are bringing it to forensics.

658
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:17,375
You are insane, this is harassment

659
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,350
is just pure harassment

660
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,576
what the fuck do you think you're doing

661
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,650
you will be brought in for questioning
then you can explain there.

662
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:27,270
Asbjørn: it doesn't matter if you
solve the old case, she never

663
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:30,775
returned to the harbour, we do
not know whether she is alive.

664
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,775
Lund: what are you talking about

665
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,900
we got some pictures from an all camera at
the harbour and Emilie is not in the boat

666
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:40,325
that cannot be true, she
has to have been there.

667
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:46,150
Asbjorn: on looking at the pictures
now, the kidnapper arrives 03:54, alone.

668
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:50,925
Asbjørn: he passes by the card house 20
minutes later and enters the red van.

669
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,076
Lund: he must have dropped all
somewhere on the way there.

670
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:55,819
Asbjorn: there's no reason why
we should stay here, I will go

671
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:58,650
to the place in the North Harbour
where Louise's mother worked.

672
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,301
Lund: what is it?

673
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:01,850
Asbjorn: it a coffee shop
called “Morgen Fruen”

674
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,725
what

675
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,825
are you coming

676
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,850
where we going.

677
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,673
Mogens and a finance
minister on their way up.

678
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:27,795
Eggert confirms that she
was to meet up later.

679
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,349
Mogens: now they are rumours
that Ussing have been

680
00:46:29,374 --> 00:46:31,024
involved in financial wrongdoings
with the prosecutor.

681
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:31,304
Headline: Ussing's car investigated in relation
with homicide case Mogens: now they are

682
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:31,574
rumours that Ussing have been involved in
financial wrongdoings with the prosecutor.

683
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,085
Mogens: now they are rumours
that Ussing have been

684
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,650
involved in financial
wrongdoings with the prosecutor

685
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:38,250
the police have questioned twice and
brought his cast to forensic investigation

686
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,475
I needed to find information requested
by the police please stop without me

687
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
thank you Karen

688
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:54,525
hello

689
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,400
I just want to let you know that
the party leaders are in euphoria

690
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,222
they say that they haven't been
such a great support for the

691
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:05,050
party since since the beginning
of November, and I right Brigit

692
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:10,000
it's just great, I can understand that that
witness was not completely wrong about Ussing

693
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,600
deeply sorry about our collision.

694
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,125
Mogens have been working very
hard to straighten everything out

695
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:22,425
so I hope that you don't bear a grudge,
I've also bought a little gift

696
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,574
it's a vintage port, I had
hoped to open it on election

697
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,450
night but with all the
things we have been through.

698
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,125
Birgit, just keep the Cork in

699
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:40,325
you will need it once I have won the
election and chosen my new government

700
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,800
it's all a mistake, Birgit
knows she was wrong

701
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,775
is not up for debate

702
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
the Prime Minister will no longer
have any confidence in you

703
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,800
and that can't be changed.

704
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:58,701
Kristian

705
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:02,394
I have informed the civil servants
at the Ministry of Finance

706
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:06,050
to make arrangement for you not
returning after the election

707
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,875
that's all, goodbye

708
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:30,900
it's okay Morgens,

709
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,748
I've spoken to the leaders of
my party and they all head

710
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:00,825
over heels even those that
were on the fence before

711
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,350
so that as it I've spoken to the
leaders of my party and they

712
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:01,874
all head over heels even those
that were on the fence before.

713
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:01,967
I've spoken to the leaders of
my party and they all head

714
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:02,075
over heels even those that
were on the fence before

715
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:05,650
we can give our support
for you as Prime Minister

716
00:49:06,325 --> 00:49:10,150
but I thought we could go on and
haven't informal dinner now

717
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:16,000
now we should have a formal dinner, we are
through both politically and personally

718
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,675
not that we can't agree or because of your
ex-husband that leaks classified information

719
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,500
but simply because I didn't have
you support when I needed it

720
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,625
what is happening? I just
met the Minister of Finance

721
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,326
did you provide information to the police

722
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:52,350
yes, but there is something that strange

723
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,350
some files are missing

724
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,800
what happened with Lebech?

725
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:03,800
We are better off alone

726
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:05,825
are you coming with me

727
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,010
we need to get everything
out and once we have

728
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:18,250
done here in would continue
at the other location

729
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,350
they almost done or where the East terminal
but we have some issues with customs

730
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,050
I don't care, I.e. every
single containers searched

731
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,574
that's clear, I was just telling..

732
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,574
What did the police say, did
we get any useful calls

733
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,200
it's bit chaotic, I don't think the police have the..
Get all of them now I need answers

734
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,850
Robert, I know how he got in contact
with her and how he got the information

735
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,875
what

736
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Emilie: hi and thank you so much
for the iPad I like it so much

737
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,925
mum and dad doesn't know that I
have my own profile on the net

738
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:50,946
and is profiled then never
got a find, they don't talk

739
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:53,471
to each other and they have
no clue what I'm doing

740
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,725
and thank you for the pictures
of the kittens they are so cute

741
00:50:57,175 --> 00:50:58,725
I don't know which one I like the most

742
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,850
you can bring them with you once
they get bigger so I can see them

743
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,675
if you want to chat tomorrow
than ride on my wall, bye

744
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:19,225
excuse me, I spoken with the police

745
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,825
Emilie did not return to the harbour

746
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,075
they found some pictures from a camera

747
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,500
they think he might have
taken her somewhere else

748
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,500
or

749
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,075
the mother worked at the
coffee shop there is nothing

750
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,276
the whole area is closed down now

751
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:59,300
the only one here are the homeless

752
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,575
100% sure that you didn't see
this boat here three days ago?

753
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,650
Look, I sleep at night, So go
away and stop disturbing me

754
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,625
here are 200 kr now think again,
didn't you see anybody ever at all

755
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,450
there's only me around
here, and Mr T Jensen

756
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:21,150
oh yeah, then there is the Cat Man,
but you don't do anything about him

757
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:23,150
I think we should drive third
out there is nothing here

758
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,150
what cat men?

759
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,275
It's that psychopath living over there,
he thinks he owns the whole place

760
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,900
he tells us to stay away, but he
doesn't anyone rent than we do

761
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:20,625
he's not here, see if you can find anything

762
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:31,025
that was the clothing that Emilie
was wearing that night on the boat

763
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:36,575
winter boots, survival
gear, what's going on?

764
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,650
Look here

765
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,650
was that?

766
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,525
Container numbers, I think

767
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,900
there must thousands.

768
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:55,550
He can't have shipped her out as cargo

769
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,450
I thought we had an agreement

770
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,026
we do have an agreement, and
we're working on it and

771
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:08,250
if it's about the reward
we had nothing to do with

772
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:11,600
I don't give a shit about the reward, you
promised me that you would solve the case

773
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:14,250
I think we're close

774
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,977
I do follow the news, is not some
unimportant opposition politician,

775
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:20,900
they are screwing you over
again Lund, can't you see it

776
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,925
no they are not, but is
going to take some time

777
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,900
there was not 12 registration numbers
in that notebook, there were 13

778
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,800
somebody tore out a page of the book
before you handed it back to the boy

779
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,175
I think you need to have a
chat with your friend from PIB.

780
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,526
I'm sorry I only found out
about it now, that means

781
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:44,075
that I have to go out and
find out myself who it is

782
00:54:44,475 --> 00:54:48,650
no, what car, give me the registration
number I promise you that...

783
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,925
what car is he talking about?
Did you tear out a page?

784
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,925
Is not true, he's lying

785
00:54:58,725 --> 00:55:00,501
no it's true, look a page is missing

786
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:02,525
you can still see the imprint

787
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,175
that can't be true, it wasn't there

788
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:19,200
which one, what are you talking about

789
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,500
is the Prime Minister's car

790
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,876
but we know about that car,
you already checked it out

791
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:36,900
know there was the campaign car

792
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,075
this is the car assigned
to the Prime Minister
