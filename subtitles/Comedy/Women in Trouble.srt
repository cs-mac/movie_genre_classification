the real robbers

might come forward?

That's a one-in-a-million

I grew up on a ranch

Uh, tell me.

Well, I only sound confused
because I find it confusing.

That's ridiculous.

why insist on her going?

about this for years.

Do I always have to have

I don't think so.

Do you, on the other hand,

always make everything
about yourself?

You're not listening
to a word I'm saying,

are you, Charlotte?

00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,402
- Ten years ago,
it was a privilege to have one.

Now it's a privilege
not to, huh?

[doorbell rings]

175
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,497
- Hi.
- Hi, Travis.

176
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,802
- Hi, Mr. McPherson.

177
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,672
- You know where to go.
She'll be right with you.

178
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,972
- I'll be back in an hour.

179
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,945
- Okeydokey.
- All right.

180
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,470
- I read your story.

181
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,073
- You didn't like it.

182
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,344
- I did.

183
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,113
You're a very promising writer.

184
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,882
Your vocabulary
is very impressive.

185
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,149
- But?

186
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,349
- No but.

187
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,858
- You didn't find it too...
dark?

188
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,327
- [screaming]

189
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,830
- Wasn't that the whole point?

190
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,161
- I guess.

191
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,496
- I mean, you can see why

192
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,297
your mom would be worried
about it, can't you?

193
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,304
- If she read anything other
than self-help books,

194
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,169
she might not have been
that shocked.

195
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,174
- Did she actually use
that word?

196
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,698
- She's worried
about the witch thing.

197
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,210
- Yeah.

198
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,802
So let's talk about that.

199
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,517
You think you're a witch?

200
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,454
- I'm not technically a witch,
but my grandmother was,

201
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,753
so I think
I inherited some of it.

202
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,190
- Like what?
- Like...

203
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,989
I can see ghosts.

204
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,586
- Give me an example.

205
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,461
- You mind if I smoke?

206
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,727
- Go ahead.

207
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,242
- Addy feels really guilty

208
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,215
about sending
Caterpillar Girl away,

209
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,410
because I was at summer camp

210
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,918
when she had
the house exorcised.

211
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,217
- Your mom had the house
exorcised?

212
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,381
- She hired this spiritualist

213
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,186
to come and "cleanse the vibes"
or whatever,

214
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,193
and Caterpillar Girl
freaked out and left.

215
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,218
- And who is
this Caterpillar Girl?

216
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,388
- My friend.

217
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,863
She was a ghost.

218
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,365
Is a ghost.

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,391
Wherever she is.

220
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,369
She died 20 years ago.

221
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,235
This freak accident
at Rockerland.

222
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,638
She fell off this roller coaster
called the Caterpillar.

223
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,472
Her family sued the park,
and they shut it down.

224
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,534
You can look it up.

225
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,340
- And she lived in your house?

226
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,349
- My room was her room.

227
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,682
- And you're sure she's a ghost
and not an imaginary friend?

228
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,316
- Apples and oranges.

229
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,890
I really miss her.

230
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,829
- What's the difference
between a ghost

231
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,729
and an imaginary friend?

232
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,961
- Imaginary friends
you just make up.

233
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,799
You tell them what to do.

234
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,395
You can't do that with a ghost.

235
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,603
They show up, leave,
get bored, annoy you,

236
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,905
make you laugh.

237
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,968
- How do they annoy you?

238
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,343
- They move stuff around.

239
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,904
And they pull on your feet
when you sleep

240
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,643
and put your socks
in the fishbowl.

241
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,520
- What's that chain
you always wear?

242
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,181
- lt--it's Spanish.

243
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,453
It's what I use
to hypnotize people.

244
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,457
Sometimes I see things,

245
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,865
stuff that's not the way
it should be.

246
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,302
But if I tell people about it,
they freak out.

247
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,033
If I use this,

248
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,166
they tell themselves
they're under my spell

249
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,268
so that they can accept
what I say.

250
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,471
- Give me an example.

251
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,106
- You want me to hypnotize you?

252
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,376
- Let's give it a try.

253
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,647
- You're Addy--
my mom's therapist.

254
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,654
- Now I'm your therapist too,
right?

255
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,884
- All right.

256
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,450
Look straight into the amulet

257
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,055
and try not to think
about anything else.

258
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,406
Do you trust me?

259
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,003
- Mm-hmm.
Yep.

260
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,672
- Okay.

261
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,149
I want you to get up

262
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,709
and walk into
your husband's office.

263
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,186
Did you hear me?

264
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,021
But you won't do it.

265
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,492
- Sorry.

266
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,690
This isn't working.

267
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,096
- That's what you think.

268
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,100
- Why do you want me to go
into my husband's office?

269
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,499
- It's not that I want you to.

270
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,833
I just...

271
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,804
I think you're so caught up
in saying

272
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,500
what you think
people need to hear

273
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,977
that you can't see what's
right in front of your face.

274
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,912
- And what would that be?

275
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,144
- Your husband...

276
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,415
and my mom having an affair.

277
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,186
- Now, why would you say
a thing like that?

278
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,454
- This is a big deal for her.

279
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,223
She's never done anything
like this before.

280
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,251
- Stop it.

281
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,594
- She's following
your own advice

282
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,292
of acting irresponsible
and letting loose

283
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,561
for once in her life.

284
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,592
- Your mom tells you
what we discuss in her sessions?

285
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,035
- I read her diary.

286
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,538
Please don't be mad at me.

287
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,700
- Why are you doing this?

288
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,538
- I don't want
to be doing anything,

289
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,477
but it's the truth.

290
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,605
She drops me off
then parks down the block

291
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,377
and spends 50 minutes
with Mr. McPherson.

292
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,750
You're basically the world's
most overqualified babysitter.

293
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,549
- I need to use the restroom.

294
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,617
I'll be right back.

295
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,787
- I'm so sorry, Maxine.

296
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,438
- Hey, honey.

297
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,269
- Hey, what's up?

298
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,798
- Nothing.

299
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,037
You?

300
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,740
- Nothing.

301
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,338
- I was just on my way
to the bathroom

302
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,940
and thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

303
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,973
- Oh, okay.

304
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,246
Well, hi.

305
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,254
- [laughs]

306
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,812
We still on for dinner tonight?

307
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,222
- You bet.

308
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,050
- Okay.

309
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,667
- Jesus fucking Paul and Mary.

310
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,101
- It's okay.
Nothing happened.

311
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,900
- What are you, fucking high?
She knows.

312
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,634
- She doesn't know.
Nothing happened.

313
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,039
- Nothing happened?

314
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,535
- Did you make the reservations,
or was I supposed to?

315
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,740
- Oh, I'll take care of it.

316
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,658
- [laughs]

317
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,887
- You're on the other side
of this door, aren't you, Addy?

318
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,265
Please don't make me ask again.

319
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,401
- Honey, let me explain.

320
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,569
- Who are you supposed to be?

321
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,634
- Bambi, it's me, Holly.

322
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,940
I mean what are you wearing?

323
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,241
- I was at the gym
when you called,

324
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,645
but I brought a change
of clothing.

325
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,240
- Okay, I'll tell him to wait.

326
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,773
There's a bathroom upstairs.

327
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,048
- What does this guy do?

328
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,023
- He's a retired movie producer.

329
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,184
- Wait, how old?

330
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,522
- Not too old.
Don't worry.

331
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,687
He made a bunch of money
selling stocks.

332
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,458
- Jeez, how many stocks
did he sell?

333
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,691
- Never mind that.

334
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,666
Go wash up,
and don't touch anything.

335
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,895
- I won't.

336
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,334
- He wants to mix it up,
so I told him

337
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,031
my little sister
is a real peach.

338
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,403
- Oh, I bet he liked that.

339
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,408
- He loved that.
Men and peaches.

340
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,206
So you get him started,
then I'll come in and join you.

341
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,871
- Okay, I got it.
He wants a sister act.

342
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,643
- Bells, whistles.
- The whole nine yards.

343
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,547
- I told him we've joined
each other in bed before

344
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,519
but never actually dared
to do anything incestuous.

345
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,782
- And what did he say?

346
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,380
- He wondered
if we'd be open to it.

347
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,685
- So he's not a cop?

348
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,749
- How do you mean?

349
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,225
- Mentioning
the whole incest thing

350
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,249
proves he's not a cop.

351
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,421
- Of course he's not a cop.

352
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,760
He's a regular customer of mine.

353
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,731
- Okay, sorry.

354
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,393
Go on.
Then what did he say?

355
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,062
- So I said,
"Under the right circumstances,

356
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,072
with the right guy,"
wink, wink.

357
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,334
- Okay.

358
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,433
Well, if...

359
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,637
- What?
- Well, okay--no, no.

360
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,804
- No what?

361
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,211
- What if he wants details?

362
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,214
- Details?

363
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,579
- About us growing up.

364
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,640
- Give him details.

365
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,708
- Make them up?

366
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,912
- But keep it simple.

367
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,011
He's a regular customer.

368
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,749
- Simple.
Got it.

369
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,086
- Don't bend over backwards.

370
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,591
- Don't bend over
backwards?

371
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,819
- With some tale.

372
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,418
Don't bend over backwards
with some tale

373
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,758
I'll have to remember
every time.

374
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,320
- Got it.
I thought you meant literally.

375
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,831
- You're overthinking this.

376
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,333
- I know.
Sometimes I do that.

377
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,629
My brain just...

378
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,932
- I know.
That's why I'm telling you.

379
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,370
- It only happens
when I get nervous.

380
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,771
- What are you nervous about?

381
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,240
- I don't know,
I'm--

382
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,970
I'm not.
Nothing.

383
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,534
- You're not still
beating yourself up

384
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,567
over the pussy-eating?

385
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,080
- No.
- Good.

386
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,082
'Cause this is me, babe.
Don't sweat it.

387
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,640
- I am good to go.
I swear.

388
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,743
- You are a sexual volcano.

389
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,311
That's why I called you.

390
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,381
- Hmm, I appreciate that,
and I won't let you down.

391
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,687
I'm just a little sore.

392
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,023
- You shot today?

393
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,427
- Yeah, just one scene
but, still, Jimmy Cojones.

394
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,691
- Oh, you poor thing.

395
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,959
- He's not that bad.

396
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,466
- Yeah, if you got all day.

397
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,627
- Oh, and he makes those faces.

398
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,534
- And the coffee breath.
- Oh, there's that.

399
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,669
- And then you went to the gym?

400
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,231
- I still got four more pounds
to go.

401
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,141
- Where?
You look great.

402
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,645
- Thanks.

403
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,113
Well, Lionel's 20 minutes tops.

404
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,309
In and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

405
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,476
- Great.
What's his name?

406
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,610
- Lionel.

407
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,621
- Is he black?
- No.

408
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,781
- It's not a problem if he is.

409
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,552
I just never met
a white Lionel before.

410
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,183
- He's white-ish.

411
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,818
But don't call him Lionel.

412
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,796
I call him Lionel, but he wants
you to call him Patron.

413
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,991
- Like the tequila.

414
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,693
- It means "boss" in Spanish.

415
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,031
- Patron.
Okay.

416
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,593
Anything else I should know?

417
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,831
- He likes it up the butt.

418
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:27,964
- Whose butt?

419
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,338
- Mine.
Whose butt are we talking about?

420
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,740
- I don't know.
I thought maybe his.

421
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,075
- How is he gonna stick his dick
up his own butt?

422
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,411
- Right.

423
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,745
I just thought maybe--

424
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,842
- You know how they say,
"It's not rocket science"?

425
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,012
That would be rocket science.

426
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,351
- He pays you extra for it,
I hope.

427
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,549
- A lot extra.
- Not enough for me.

428
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,354
- My, my.

429
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,486
Aren't you the elegant
dick licker all of a sudden?

430
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,827
- Some things are off-limits
is all.

431
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,197
- Not with George Katz
it wasn't.

432
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,135
- That was a matter
of birth control.

433
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,603
- You were being responsible.

434
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,900
- It always comes back
to George.

435
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,270
- I was just talking.

436
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,332
- You know, a human person
can only apologize so much.

437
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,536
- Is that a fact?

438
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,976
- You know, if he's so crazy
about you,

439
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,536
how come he asked me
to give him a blow job

440
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,706
every time you left the room?

441
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,340
- You could have said no.

442
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,714
- I was in an awkward position.

443
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,584
I mean, the way he looked at me,

444
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,486
it was just different
than other guys.

445
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,013
- Different?

446
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,855
- Yeah, like every time he came
in the room,

447
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,691
I could feel him
mentally undressing me

448
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,889
with his eyes.

449
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,228
- Holly, we were working
in a strip club.

00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,535

If you still love him, call him.

455
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,463
- Then why are we
still discussing this?

456
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,872
- Look, forget I brought it up.

457
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,536
- I mean, do you want
to spend every weekend

Gee, I never heard that before.

00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,006
¶ I discovered
that it had to be you ¶

495
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,817
- Will your wife be wanting
anything else?

496
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,657
- She's not my wife,
and you know it.

497
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,026
- I don't know it.
How would I know that?

498
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,122
- You play innocent
remarkably well.

499
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,393
Are you an actress?

500
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,527
- Does it look like
I'm an actress?

501
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,096
- Oh, yes, it looks like
you're an actress.

502
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,698
I thought maybe
you were doing research

503
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,538
for a part
playing a flight attendant.

504
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,101
Now, I watch mostly old films
on tour,

505
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,081
and you could be
a ridiculously famous movie star

506
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,447
and I just wouldn't--
I wouldn't have the faintest.

507
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,146
- I'm flattered, but I'm not.

508
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,882
- Well, look, look, look.

509
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,048
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

510
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,217
I want to say something.

511
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,453
Now, let me tell you something.

512
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,223
- [clears throat]

513
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,130
- I would very much like
to carry on floating with you

514
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,394
after we land.

515
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,766
And I would like for you
to come along to my hotel

516
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,239
and maybe drop some ecstasy
and just be.

517
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,433
- Is that right?

518
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,739
- Yeah, I'm just so sick
of this army

519
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,211
of blank-eyed zombies
all around me.

520
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,543
Do you know?

521
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,175
And I feel that perhaps
you are as well, am I right?

522
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,617
Well, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

523
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,249
I mean, they're out to steal
our air, our soul, our music.

524
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,589
And they will stop at nothing.

525
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,687
See, the thing is,
they have no substance.

526
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,791
They're made of dust
and numbers.

527
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,600
Their hearts are nothing
but cheap little calculators

528
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,400
that just keep pumping out
receipts.

529
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,202
Do you know what I'm saying?

530
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,972
So what do you say?

531
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,071
- Uh...

532
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,946
uh, l...

533
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,575
I...

534
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,607
[laughs]

535
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,314
I don't know.

536
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,114
I have to get back to work.

537
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,852
- What?
Are you blushing?

538
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,693
That's fucking sexy.

539
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,130
- Ah.
[laughs]

540
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,067
- And how is Prince Charming
doing?

541
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,797
- I'm pretty sure
he's on something.

542
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,929
- Pretty sure?

543
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,371
The band left him behind.

544
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,204
The manager's escorting him
because they don't trust

545
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,266
he'll get to his show
on his own.

546
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,708
- It says all that
in your paperback?

547
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,336
- I looked it up online
during takeoff.

548
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,279
- I think he's very nice.

549
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,805
- Every rattlesnake
has its charms.

550
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,681
- Am I detecting just a whiff
of jealousy here?

551
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,120
Could it be because rock god
Nick Chapel

552
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,522
is paying more attention to me
than he is to you?

553
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,650
- [chuckles]

554
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,216
I'm just looking out
for my girl...

555
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,728
and her fiancé.

556
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,287
- Oh, that is low.
Even for you.

557
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,730
- Low?

558
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,666
Who was sticking her ass
in the drummer boy's face

559
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,225
pretending the movie screen
was stuck?

560
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,601
- And who'd I learn that from?

561
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,696
- Oh, when I do it,

562
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,070
it's a masterpiece of subtlety.

563
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,506
- [laughs]
No.

564
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,442
This is you.

565
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,241
[moaning]

566
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,010
[laughter]

567
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,710
- That's kind of hot,
admit it.

568
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,912
But I have a little more junk
in my trunk.

569
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,080
- Even a little more
than you'd like these days...

570
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,646
- Ah.

571
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,624
- And that's why you're being
all Mother Superior.

572
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,524
- Oh, you're such a whore.

573
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,223
- Besides...

574
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,857
even if something happened,
and that's a mighty big if,

575
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,491
Benjamin would never find out.

576
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,503
And even if he did,
he might understand.

577
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,198
- Right.

578
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,002
- Couples give each other
free passes

579
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,133
for certain celebrities.

580
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,837
- And you guys do that?
- No.

581
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,812
But Nick Chapel would be
on the list.

582
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,042
- So ethically and morally,
you're all set.

583
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,947
I mean, it would almost be
irresponsible of you

584
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,246
not to fuck him.

585
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,718
- The guy wrote
Welcomed by a Kiss.

586
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,618
How many drummers wrote
their band's best song?

587
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,522
- Don Henley, Phil Collins,
Gil Moore.

588
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,957
- Who the hell is Gil Moore?

589
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,791
- He split songwriting duties
with Rik Emmett in Triumph.

590
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,194
- Who the hell is Triumph?

591
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,199
- Who the hell is Tri--

592
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,567
Fight the Good Fight,
When the Lights Go Down.

593
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,469
Magic Power.

594
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,805
¶ I'm young, I'm wild,
and I'm free ¶

595
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,572
¶ I got the magic power
of the-- ¶

596
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,443
- Uh, pardon me, ladies.

597
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,507
I just need to use the lavatory.

598
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,575
[coughs]

599
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,754
[laughter]

600
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,458
- Gosh.

601
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,830
- Nice.

602
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,839
What do you think?

603
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,740
- I think if you're asking me
what I think,

604
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,972
you've already made up
your mind.

605
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,310
- Does it make me a bad person?

606
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,281
- Who am I to judge?

607
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,819
- [exhales]

608
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,530
- You done this before?

609
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,365
- Mm-mm. Never.

610
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,495
- Are you sure?

611
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,005
- I'm sure, are you?
- No, never.

612
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,769
- Oh, look,
you're blushing again.

613
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,708
- Once before.

614
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,903
- What, with a passenger?

615
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,537
- Oh, God, no.
Pilot.

616
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,774
- While he was flying the plane?

617
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,146
- [laughs]
There was a copilot too.

618
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,445
- What, you did both?

619
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,647
- I mean the copilot
was flying the plane

620
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,781
while I was with the pilot.

621
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,188
- All right, look.

622
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,953
Full disclosure here?
- Yeah.

623
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,154
- It's my second time.
- Yeah?

624
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,685
- Yeah, we're flying
commercial here.

625
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,357
I mean, we're not counting
private, are we?

626
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,161
- You're the one counting.

627
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
- Look.

628
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,301
I feel the need to tell you

629
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,669
that I've recently been dating
a porn star, okay?

630
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,173
Her name is Elektra Luxx.

631
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,834
- Oh, you--you don't need
to tell me that.

632
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,969
- No? You may have seen
the sex video that got leaked.

633
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,377
- Um...

634
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,381
- Well, it's a delicate matter
because some women,

635
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,474
they--they get intimidated
because they're trying

636
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,814
to measure up, you know?
- Yeah.

637
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,446
- No, I need for you to know
that with you...

638
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,183
it's not the sex I'm after.

639
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,815
Not that I was into Elektra

640
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,917
for that exclusively either,
you understand?

641
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,984
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,825
But with you, you see,

643
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,331
I'm turned on by talent,

644
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,596
by people who are the best
at what they do.

645
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,570
And I look at you, and I say,
"Oh, she's the best."

646
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,663
And I can tell
in the blink of an eye.

647
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,367
But with her,
look, Elektra, she's--

648
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,138
As much as I applaud the fact
she can pin both ankles

649
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,008
behind her ears
while she orgasms,

650
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,810
it's just always felt like
emotional quicksand, you know?

651
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,285
But with you...

652
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,345
I can feel your organic essence,
you know, your animal core.

653
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,482
I mean, that's what your name
means, right, Cora?

654
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,051
It's like the core,
the center.

655
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,255
The heart of the orchard.
- That's right.

656

ding!

659
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,645
- Sorry, folks, we caught
a sliver of that storm

660
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,714
I mentioned earlier.

661
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,190
It should go back
to smooth sailing

662
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,090
in just a moment or so.

663
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,685
So if you could kindly return
to your seat

664
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,821
and fasten your seat belt.

665
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,194
- Oh!

666
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,732
[knocking]

667
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,000
- Cora?

668
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,404
Guys.

669
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,867
Guys.

670

[door unlatches]

671
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,508
- Oh, my God, Maggie.

672
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,608
- What?

673
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,084
- I think he's dead.

674
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,682
[dull thud]

675
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,589
- He was giving me oral,
and then he bumped his head,

676
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,057
and it sounded
like something broke,

677
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,253
and I can't wake him.

678
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,283
[whimpers]

679
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,757
Is he not breathing?

680
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,199
- I can't tell.

681
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,226
But I can tell you
where all the blood went.

682
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,295
- Oh, Maggie,
you got to help me.

683
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,772
I am so fucked.
- Okay.

684
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,707
I'm gonna go see if there's
a doctor on the plane.

685
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,734
Put his clothes back on
and pull yourself together.

686
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,143
- How am I gonna explain this?

687
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,146
- Listen to me carefully.

688
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,579
He was in the lavatory.

689
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,048
The captain made
his announcement.

690
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,414
We knocked on the door.

691
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,282
He didn't respond, so we were
forced to open the door.

692
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,652
He collapsed on his own,
possibly a drug overdose.

693
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,179
- With a raging hard-on?

694
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,657
- Try to see
if you can bring it down.

695
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,216
- What?
How?

696
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,989
Maggie.

697
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,622
Shit.

698
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,656
[sobbing]

699
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,328
Oh.

700
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:41,002
Down, boy.

701
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,376
Down.

702
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,849
Down.

703
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,876
[sobbing]

704
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,924
What a waste.

705
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,017
[bell ringing]

706
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,496
- Is anybody out there?

707
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,160
Can anybody hear us?

708
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:07,069
We're trapped in the elevator!

709
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,903
Anyone!

710
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,000
Can anyone hear us?

711
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,271
- Someone turned it off.

712
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,108
Maybe the fire department's
finally here.

713
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,273
- Obviously you haven't been
watching the news today.

714
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,680
- I don't watch much TV.

715
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,741
- Well, you couldn't have missed
it in the papers then.

716
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,514
- Listen, lady.
Don't take that tone with me.

717
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,078
- Don't call me lady.
- What's your name?

718
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,953
- None of your business.
- What is your problem?

719
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,423
- My problem is
that we are on day three

720
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,949
of a massive heat wave
with forest fires everywhere

721
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,360
and I really don't think they're
gonna be able to spare anyone

722
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,592
to help a couple of idiots
who are trapped in an elevator.

723
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,532
And if you had read the paper,
you would know that.

724
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,798
- Wow, fit all that
in the paper, huh?

725
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,203
- Well, you got to read
between the lines.

726
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,366
Can anyone hear me?

727
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,876
- Will you stop
just for five minutes.

728
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,241
Please.

729
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,711
- Well, what do you suggest?

730
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,407
Just wait here and die
of smoke inhalation?

731
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,575
We have been here for an hour.

732
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,744
There is no smoke
and no fire.

733
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,619
We are trapped in the elevator,
plain and simple.

734
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,747
- You don't know that.

735
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,553
The first five floors
of this building

736
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,616
could be on fire.

737
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,819
We wouldn't know.

738
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,590
- We would be able to smell it.

739
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,994
- How do you know that?

740
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,497
What do you know about fires?

741
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,194
- My dad was a fireman,
and he told me

742
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,100
the first thing you do
when you are trapped

743
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,434
in an elevator
with a hysterical person

744
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:18,602
is explain to them that they are
wasting precious oxygen.

745
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,146
- I'm not hysterical.
I'm claustrophobic.

746
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,279
- I'm afraid of heights.

747
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,447
- And I'm afraid of falling.

748
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,683
- I'm pregnant.

749
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,288
- Congratulations.

750
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,320
- Don't.
- Is that why you're here?

751
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,423
- I just found out.

752
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,660
[chuckles]

753
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,294
- First one?

754
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,462
- Yes.

755
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,971
Maybe.

756
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,473
- I think you would know.

757
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,408
- Well, if I have it, then, yes,
it will be my first one.

758
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,502
How about you?

759
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,908
- Uh...

760
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,940
I have a niece
that I'm really close to.

761
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,815
That was her mom
I was talking to on the phone

762
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,945
when I came in here.

763
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,477
My sister.

764
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,685
I mean, obviously my sister
is my niece's mom, you know.

765
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,317
And I love her.

766
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,193
It's just she's sort of like
a really stupid version of me.

767
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,630
- Huh.
Close relationship.

768
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,727
- Too close.

769
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,534
Is there anybody out there?

770
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,563
- One, two.

771
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,473
One, two, three, four.

772
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,479

- Something like that.

787
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,605
- Your friend looks about ready
to pass out.

788
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,613
- Yeah.

789
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,705
She's not really my friend.

790
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,943
- What's wrong with her?

791
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,042
- She caught her husband
with one of her patients.

792
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,052
- She's a doctor?

793
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,053
- Shrink.

794
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,952
- [laughs]
Go figure.

795
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,081
- Go figure.

796
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,250
- Women are like flies:

797
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,282
they settle on sugar or shit.

798
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,988
- You married?
- No.

799
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,394
Lucky that way.

800
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,625
- Me neither.

801
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,895
Is business always this slow?

802
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,993
- It picks up in about an hour,
but...

803
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,299
- What?

804
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,272
- It might not be
your ideal clientele.

805
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,637
- [laughs]

806
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,199
What?
You think I look like a pro?

807
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,609
- [laughs]

00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,273
No, I think you look

You ready for another?

810
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,841
- What the hell.

811
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,511
- Some wetback with a broom
just offered me

812
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,678
50 bucks for a hand job.

00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,450
Ah, that's Manuel.

815
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,514
What is he--his shift doesn't
start for another hour.

816
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,355
- Well, he sure is cussing up
a storm in the john.

00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,485
- He's got Tourette's.

818
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,086
He's harmless.
Honest to God.

819
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,120
I'm sorry about that.

820
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,291
- Hey, shit happens.

821
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,822
Can I get a piña colada?

822
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,459
- Sure.

823
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,970
- You didn't, did you?

824
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,302
- What?

825
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,307
- Holly.

826
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,172
- I didn't.

827
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,109
Okay, next round's on me.

828
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,979
- You really are a pig.

829
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,315
- I am vulgar, but I have
potential for class.

830
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,819
- Really deep down.

831
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,287
- Like you're the Virgin Mary.

832
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,290
I just made a buck a second.
What's wrong with that?

833
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,020
- Well, for starters,
your facts on the Virgin Mary.

834
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,392
She wasn't actually a virgin.

835
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,296
- You are sick,
you know that?

836
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,959
Is nothing sacred to you?

837
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,900
- Okay, forget it.

838
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,335
What did he look like?

839
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,167
- Five and change.
Pencil-ish.

840
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,140
- The guy's face.

841
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,641
- Oh.
I don't know.

842
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,167
Soccer player
or serial killer type.

843
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,316
His jeans are tight,
like Starsky and Hutch tight.

844
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,410
So it takes me a second
to get it out.

845
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,217
And right off the bat,
he starts barking off speeds,

846
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,484
steering my hand.

847
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,515
"Pronto, pronto, pronto.

848
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,583
"Motherfucking Christ!

849
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,652
"Suave, muchacha, si, si, si.

850
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,527
Motherfucking maricon."

851
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,588
- [laughter]

852
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:37,835
- How about a beer instead?

853
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,429
- Okay.

854
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,838
- Backseat drivers
are the fucking worst.

855
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,570
- Yeah, they really mess up
my game.

856
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,672
[dull thud]

857
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,249
Yeah, I think I'm gonna stay,

858
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,718
see if I can't turn
this night around.

859
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,846
- Here?
It's a dyke bar.

860
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,516
- How do you know?
There's nobody in there.

861
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,718
- Trust me.
- Well, I'll take my chances.

862
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,249
- Look, don't stay here.

863
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,524
You're gonna get cruised,
but you're not gonna get paid.

864
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,791
These women get it for free.

865
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,230
- And who made you the expert?

866
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,995
I mean, maybe there's
some curious divorcée

867
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,763
who wants somebody
with the touch, you know?

868
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,894
- And you have the touch?

869
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,529
- Excuse me?

870
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,166
- Haven't you been whining
to me all week

871
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,267
about your girl-on-girl scene
fiasco?

872
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,143
- Okay, I ate some bad
Mexican food from catering

873
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,442
that wouldn't stay down.

874
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,971
It doesn't mean
that I can't eat pussy.

875
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,983
I'm not retarded.

876
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,609
- Wait.
You threw up on her?

877
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,619
You didn't tell me that.

878
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,881
- I told you I got sick.

879
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,082
- You told me you felt sick.

880
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,024
You're uncomfortable with women,
you felt sick, you had to stop,

881
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,926
not you were eating her pussy
and puked on camera.

882
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,088
That's a big difference.

883
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,098
- I turned away from the camera.

884
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:45,193
- You know what,
you're lucky I love you so much,

885
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,136
because you're so dumb,
it's freaky.

886
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,604
- I'm dumb?

887
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,607
Who's going straight back
to the lion's den?

888
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,609
Those men probably killed
your stock salesman

889
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,735
and are waiting for us.

890
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,336
- What would you have me do?

891
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,744
Have her drive home?

892
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,839
- I don't know.
Call a cab.

893
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,179
Put her on a bus.

894
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,479
I think you want to help her.

895
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,917
- Yeah, so?

896
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,818
- So you're contracting yourself
all over again.

897
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,412
- I'm what?

898
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,754
Would you listen to yourself
once in a while?

899
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,692
I'm "contradicting" myself.

900
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,457
Is that the term
you're looking for?

901
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,861
How am I doing that?

902
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,763
- Well, you pick on me
all night,

903
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,825
and then you go play
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold.

904
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:18,857
- Whatever.

905
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,131
You want to stay, stay.

906
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,433
I'll call you.
- Don't.

907
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,633
Not if it's gonna be like this.
- Okay, Holly.

908
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,336
- And what the fuck do you mean
the Virgin Mary wasn't a virgin?

909
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,004
I mean, were you there?

910
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,569
Did you do her?

911
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,606
- She's known as the Virgin Mary
because her mother, Anne,

912
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,208
conceived her
free of original sin.

913
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,277
It's called
the immaculate conception.

914
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
Joseph and Mary were probably
getting it on the whole time.

915
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,223
The guy was a carpenter.

916
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,123
- And what exactly does that
have to do with me?

917
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,217
- You asked me.

918
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,785
- Because you
brought it up before.

919
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,989
So we're even Stephen.

920
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,591
[engine turns over]

921
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,414
- You sure she saw you?

922
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,473
- Positive.

923
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,144
She was creeping
down the stairs.

924
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,847
I wouldn't have a prayer
in a lineup.

925
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,379
- Man, look at those legs.

926
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,358
We're gonna be sawing all night.

927
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,725
Come on.
Let's get this over with.

928
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,569
Whatever you do,
don't scream.

929

[gun clicks]

932
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,966

¶ ¶

935
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,469
- Have you ever made
a really bad mistake?

936
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,137
One thing you can never
forgive yourself for?

937
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,578
- I can pick only one?

938
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,808
- I'm serious.

939
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,976
- Who was joking?

940
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,313
- When I was 25,

941
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,620
I got knocked up by this guy,

942
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,218
this angel of death
with beautiful blond curls

943
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,990
and a mean streak.

944
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,361
He was young and...

945
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,230
apocalyptic.

946
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,757
And I loved him so much,

947
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,168
I didn't even realize
I had a meth problem.

948
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,899
- This is that moment, right?

949
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,463
- What moment?

950
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,805
- On the bus,

951
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,176
when the complete stranger
tells you they got cancer.

952
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,840
- I wouldn't know.
I drive a car.

953
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,616
- Sorry.
Uh, go on.

954
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,712
- Go on what?

955
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,723
- With the story
about your boyfriend,

956
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,724
the meth dealer.

957
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,157
- [scoffs]

958
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,854
I'm not sharing anything
with you now.

959
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,226
- Uh, please.

960
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,858
I am a great listener.

961
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,563
Perhaps I've had
one of those days.

962
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,265
Come on.

963
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,505
You were pregnant,
and your boyfriend was a dealer.

964
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,179
- Hmm.

965
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,547
So this one morning,
I'm puking my guts out,

966
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,615
the first trimester.

967
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,990
My boyfriend's trying to sleep.

968
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,460
He comes storming out
of the bedroom

969
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,588
and starts beating me
with a wire hanger

970
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,029
and telling me to shut up,

971
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,828
that he's trying to get
his beauty rest.

972
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,994
And I just started laughing,

973
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,630
'cause in that moment,
I realized that if he ever knew

974
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,608
that I was pregnant
with his kid,

975
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,372
I would never be free of him.

976
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,709
- Hmm.

977
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,374
- I don't think I had ever felt
that much clarity.

978
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:29,045
So I walked out the door
and left forever.

979
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,714
But in my haste,
I left the door open,

980
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,189
and the apartment
across the hall

981
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,920
is being watched by the feds

982
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,428
on a tip that there's
a militia cell

983
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,259
operating out of it.

984
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,356
So these militia goons
dumped a bunch of their trash

985
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,128
in my boyfriend's apartment.

986
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,796
End result: my boyfriend
ended up doing time

987
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,464
on a terrorist conspiracy.

988
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,805
- So where's the big mistake?

989
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,037
- The big mistake is that

990
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,913
I got paranoid that I was gonna
get dragged into it.

991
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,782
I mean, these court hearings
went on forever.

992
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,151
So when my daughter was born,

993
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,625
I left her in the care
of my sister

994
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,752
and went into hiding.

995
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,319
- They were looking for you?

996
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,298
- No.

997
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:18,529
I mean, I thought I was like
this big '60s radical,

998
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,629
you know, going underground
and fighting for my beliefs.

999
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,299
They didn't give a rat's ass
about me.

1000
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,504
- There's a moral, and it's
gonna be a mind-fuck, isn't it?

1001
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,675
- The moral is that

1002
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,808
by the time I got back
from Amsterdam

1003
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,819
to reclaim my daughter,

1004
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,117
she had, for all intents
and purposes,

1005
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,885
become my sister's daughter.

1006
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,018
And I was either
not strong enough

1007
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,464
or not weak enough
to take her back.

1008
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,467
- Does she even know?

1009
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,496
- What she knows is that her mom
and I fight a lot.

1010
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,801
They're both in therapy now.

1011
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,836
- [sighs]

1012
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,020
I went to therapy once.

1013
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,648
It didn't do much for me.

1014
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,714
- No?

1015
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,191
- It was just some creep
getting off

1016
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,127
comparing me to dog shit
stuck to the bottom of a shoe.

1017
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,028
- He said that?

1018
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,432
- He worked in metaphors,
he said,

1019
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,231
but the only thing
he seemed to care about

1020
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,830
was whether I enjoyed anal sex.

1021
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,171
What is it with guys
and anal sex anyway?

1022
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,699
Are they all fags?

1023
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,235
- It sure doesn't sound like
you went to the right therapist.

1024
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,111
- The only reason I went to him
was to talk to him

1025
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,139
about how to deal
with guys just like him.

1026
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,414
Instead, he spent the whole hour
talking to my rack

1027
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,478
and informed me
the reason every guy I meet

1028
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,682
wants to bang me
is 'cause of my job.

1029
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,986
- Where do you work?

1030
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,492
- I'm an actress.

1031
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,153
- Oh, yeah?

1032
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,560
Movies? Television?

1033
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,790
- Porn.

1034
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,294
- Wow.

1035
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,902
Can I ask you, like, how you...

1036
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,600
I mean, you're so pretty.

1037
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,337
You could be in, like,
normal things.

1038
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,901
I mean, not that porn
isn't normal.

1039
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,913
It's just, you know,
I'm just curious, like,

1040
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,814
how you got started in that.

1041
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:19,086
- When I first moved out here,
I had this roommate, Riley,

1042
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,853
this beautiful hippie girl
from Boulder.

1043
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,826
I loved her to death.

1044
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,226
We were way behind on our rent,

1045
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,730
and she made me come with her
to this so-called audition

1046
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,529
as moral support,
no pun intended,

1047
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,899
and, uh, that was that.

1048
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,028
- Weren't you scared?

1049
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,767
- Holy fuck.
I was shitting bricks.

1050
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:42,302
My first video, I did a scene
with the legendary Jimmy Haynes.

1051
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,474
All penis, that man,
may he rest in peace.

1052
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,484
But the second those cameras
started rolling,

1053
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,713
I knew exactly what to do.

1054
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,981
Maybe it's genetic.

1055
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,046
My great-grandmother
was a gypsy sword-swallower,

1056
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,684
but I discovered
I have a very real talent

1057
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,593
for sucking cock on camera.

1058
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,358
Next thing you know,
five years pass

1059
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,989
without even blinking.

1060
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,659
The coke might have helped
with that,

1061
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,636
the non-blinking part.

1062
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,663
And then one day, Riley
locks herself in a motel room

1063
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,938
and blows her brains out.

1064
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,571
- Oh, my God.

1065
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,046
- I found out later
her stepfather

1066
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,949
was blackmailing her,
the same prick

1067
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,112
who had abused her
since she was ten.

1068
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,054
What else is new?

1069
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,285
My childhood wasn't
all that different.

1070
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:32,753
- I'm so sorry.

1071
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,323
- Hey,
what's that saying,

1072
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,300
"One man's trash
is another man's treasure"?

1073
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,360
Someone else might have turned
my childhood

1074
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,372
into a heartbreaking novel.

1075
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,966
Not me.

1076
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,839
Not yet anyway.

1077
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,506
- So are you famous?

1078
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,343
- Yeah.

1079
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,785
- Really famous?

1080
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,914
- Well...okay.

1081
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,482
Tyra Doright and Christy Climax
are probably

1082
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,222
the most popular girls right now
in terms of web traffic.

1083
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,993
But the Tyra Talking Love Doll
is seriously overpriced at $225,

1084
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,296
and the arms don't even move
in all directions,

1085
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,499
whereas the anatomically correct
Elektra Luxx Vagina Deluxe

1086
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,134
retails for 89 bucks and comes
in three different colors.

1087
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:23,135
It is the number one selling
celebrity vagina on the market.

1088
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,377
- Hold on.

1089
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,146
Strangers purchase a replica
of your vagina?

1090
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,654
- It vibrates, and it squirts.

1091
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,485
[chuckles]

1092
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,151
Oh, life is so fucking weird.

1093
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,217
I don't even know
what to think sometimes.

1094
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,058
[crashing noise]

1095
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,859
- This is the Los Angeles
Fire Department.

1096
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,126
Anybody still in here?

1097
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,259
- We're in the elevator!

1098
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,893
Hey!
Can you hear us?

1099
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,631
- Yeah, hold on.
I'll get you right out.

1100
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,907
Hey, you guys okay?

1101
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,604
- I actually brought her
another espresso

1102
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,308
because I did not want her
to say that she was asleep

1103
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,542
when I talked to her.

1104
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,117
- I can't think of any moment
in my life

1105
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,884
that I'd like to relive.

1106
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,724
I find myself not really being
nostalgic about anything.

1107
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,695
But that can't be, can it?

1108
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,220
- I just want to tell her
to just quit caterwauling around

1109
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,790
like a goddamned puma
and get her ass in gear.

1110
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,531
Mom, just get your act together.

1111
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,095
- You're hot.

1112
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,504
I'd bang you.
I think about it.

1113
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,734
But I don't tell you.
Why?

1114
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,766
It's like a seesaw
in my head.

1115
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,540
- Because in my bones,
I know the feeling.

1116
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,605
I mean, I think I know.

1117
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:36,244
- And I see that on the tray
are two little fortune cookies,

1118
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,777
and I start to crack it open,
and I see the slip.

1119
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,017
But l--at this point,
I can't read it

1120
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,585
because my eyes
are so fricking swollen.

1121
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,927
- I turn the lights down low.

1122
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,399
Create a little atmosphere.

1123
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,628
- So I bring the waiter over.

1124
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:52,726
I said, "Can you please--

1125
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,168
"can you please
just read this to me?

1126
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,171
It's my fortune."

1127
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,435
- Yes, no, yes, no,
yes, no.

1128
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,771
- I have nostalgia
for something.

1129
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,436
It just hasn't happened yet.

1130
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,240
But it's gonna happen,
because if it doesn't,

1131
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,303
it's all shit.

1132
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,815
The whole point is...

1133
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,147
like La Migra,
you know what I mean?

1134
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,086
Like, I'm Mexico,

here.

I'm paralyzed by all this guilt.

00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,086
- Open the door.
What is going on?

1297
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,921
- Hold on!

1298
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,085
What happened to her?

1299
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,594
- Come on, Maxine.
Please.

1300
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:06,686
- Shut up!

1301
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,391
No, not you, Officer.

1302
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,160
Is she gonna make it?

1303
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,306
She ran her car into a pole.

1304
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,334
[tires screeching
and glass shattering]

1305
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,438
The officer on site called
the last number she dialed

1306
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,142
and said it's pretty serious.

1307
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,377
You should go.

1308
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,627
- I'm gonna stay.

1309
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,755
- Travis,
she's in the emergency room.

1310
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,163
She shouldn't be alone.

1311
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,064
- Well, I'll call her sister,
and she can go.

1312
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,625
She's her family.

1313
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,696
- Do what you got to do.

1314
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,140
- What I go to do is stay here.

1315
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,510
- It's a little late
for these gestures.

1316
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,449
- You don't have to talk to me.

1317
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,076
You don't have to look at me.

1318
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,883
You don't even have to be
in the same room as me.

1319
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,480
Just go to sleep.

1320
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,287
I'm gonna put on a pot
of coffee,

1321
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,986
and I'm gonna stay right here.

1322
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,521
- Good night.

1323
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,294
- Good night.

1324
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,388
- Oh.
[laughs]

1325
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,913
I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

1326
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,357
- I forgot.
I'm...

1327
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,020
I'm Rita's roommate.

1328
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,460
- Who?

1329
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,487
- The bartender
from Ruby's Caribbean.

1330
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,522
She said you got attacked
in the parking lot tonight

1331
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,966
or something.

1332
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,229
- Oh, yeah.

1333
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,702
- She gave you a couple Valiums,

1334
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,705
so that's probably
what you're feeling right now.

1335
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,400
- Right.

1336
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,011
What's that?

1337
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,879
- Oh, it's for work.

1338
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,212
I'm a masseuse.

1339
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,775
- Oh, hi, Mama.

1340
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,220
- No, a masseuse.

1341
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,883
I do body work.

1342
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,619
My name is Darby.

1343
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,492
- Oh, hi.
I'm--I'm Holly.

1344
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,259
- So, look, if you want
to go back to sleep, I can...

1345
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,390
- No.
No, really.

1346
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:26,095
I'm--I'm good.
I'm good.

1347
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,933
So...

1348
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,736
where are you from?

1349
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,401
- Oh, I'm Canadian.

1350
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,673
- Wow.
Cool.

1351
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:36,701
- Yeah, you ever been?

1352
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,735
- No.

1353
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,577
But I love the food.

1354
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,777
- Um, do you know the guys
that did this to you?

1355
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,617
- No, no.

1356
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,589
- I guess some days
are stranger than others.

1357
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:48,921
- Yeah.

1358
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,290
- Whenever something
really weird happens to me,

1359
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,057
I think it's, like,
a life marker.

1360
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,463
I say to myself, "Darby,

1361
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:59,764
"you are alive,
and the time is now.

1362
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,963
Today is a day
you will not forget."

1363
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,973
- Yeah.

1364
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,066
And it's also my birthday.

1365
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,076
- [gasps]

1366
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,907
Today is your birthday?

1367
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,413
No shit?
Oh, my gosh.

1368
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,937
We should have a drink
to celebrate.

1369
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,711
- No, I really--
I can't hold my liquor.

1370
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,150
But you should.

1371
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,482
- Well, fuck.

1372
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,784
You know what, let me give you
a birthday massage.

1373
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:20,948
- No.

1374
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,958
No, you really--
I couldn't.

1375
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,860
Oh.

1376
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,195
- Your neck is like a rock,
like you smashed it.

1377
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,201
- Oh, yeah,
I got hit by a car today.

1378
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,259
Twice.

1379
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,032
- Jesus, quite the birthday,
huh?

1380
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,005
- Yeah.

1381
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,907
- Do you spend a lot of time
sitting at work?

1382
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,467
- Some positions, I guess.

1383
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,004
- Hmm.

1384
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,514
- Ahh.

1385
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,540
- So before getting attacked
and before getting run over,

1386
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,213
did you do anything special
for your birthday?

1387
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,983
- Oh.

1388
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,717
Not really.

1389
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,952
I mean, l, um...

1390
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,224
I went to work,
and then I went to the gym.

1391
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,164
And then my best friend
called me to go work with her,

1392
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,564
but that didn't really pan out.

1393
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,798
And then we met this woman
who took us to the bar,

1394
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,967
and she got tanked,
and, um...

1395
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:16,707
my friend ended up
taking her home and, um...

1396
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,680
[sobbing]

1397
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:19,704
- It's okay.

1398
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,614
Just let it out.

1399
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,211
Your body's been through
some major, major trauma.

1400
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,245
- It's not that.

1401
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,689
It's just Bambi.

1402
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,886
She didn't--

1403
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:34,021
she didn't even remember
it was my birthday,

1404
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,657
and that's why I thought
she was calling to begin with.

1405
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:40,362
I was sure she had some surprise
planned for me or something,

1406
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,497
and she just wanted me
to tag-team some guy.

1407
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,268
She's so stupid,
she doesn't even realize

1408
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,037
that I have feelings for her.

1409
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,135
[sniffles]

1410
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,806
I-I felt so nervous,

1411
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,408
'cause even though
it was a fake thing,

1412
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,112
just a pony show
for some cheese ball,

1413
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,520
I thought, "You know,
she's finally gonna get it."

1414
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,023
The whole thing got interrupted,

1415
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,185
and she spent the whole night
making fun of me.

1416
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,685
And I'm so bad at my job,

1417
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,595
I'm afraid
nobody's gonna hire me

1418
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,190
'cause I get embarrassed
talking dirty

1419
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,565
and I can't eat pussy.

1420
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,365
It's just a matter of time
before they realize

1421
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,065
that I'm the lamest
porn star ever.

1422
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,233
- Well, I'm sure it's not
as bad as it seems.

1423
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:22,904
- It's pretty awful.

1424
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,038
- Well, have you thought
about a new career?

1425
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,311
- Yeah.

1426
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,443
But I'm so dumb,
I'm not good at anything.

1427
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,282
- You're just being hard
on yourself.

1428
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,686
- No, I'm being honest.

1429
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,556
You know, everybody laughs
at me.

1430
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:37,991
They don't even have
the courtesy

1431
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,392
to do it behind my back.

1432
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,397
When those men came
at me tonight,

1433
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:45,299
I thought, "This is it.
I'm dead.

1434
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,461
"And I haven't even done
anything with my life

1435
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,994
"or had the chance to tell her
about Ringo and the puking

1436
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,301
so she'd understand."

1437
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,534
- Tell who?

1438
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,566
Who's Ringo?

1439
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,671
- He was my dog when I was 12.
Golden retriever.

1440
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,977
- What happened to him?

1441
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,348
- God, he was...

1442
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,048
he was always
humping everything.

1443
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,081
It was like,
"Get off me, you pig."

1444
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,149
[laughter]

1445
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,626
Nonstop.

1446
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,060
And he really was
the horniest dog.

1447
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,654
I mean, something was wrong
with him.

1448
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,991
I've never told anybody
this before.

1449
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,970
Okay.

1450
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:27,067
What happened was, l, um...

1451
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,705
I had all these
magazine articles spread out.

1452
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,046
I was doing this school project,
this collage on rock formations.

1453
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,778
My legs were in a V.

1454
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:39,720
I was only wearing a T-shirt
and panties.

1455
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,684
And Ringo comes running in
to play...

1456
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:55,168
And he starts licking my knee,
which was funny, you know?

1457
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,606
And then...

1458
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,477
all of a sudden, he...

1459
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:08,678
starts moving up my thigh,
sniffing.

1460
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,082
And I got this tingle.

1461
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,060
So out of curiosity,

1462
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:23,998
and because my mother
was asleep,

1463
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:28,834
I moved my panties aside.
Let him investigate.

1464
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,772
So he just stuck his nose
in there

1465
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,073
and started licking
between my lips.

1466
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:41,016
And he was so gentle
and tireless.

1467
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:46,613
I mean, that dog could have
kept licking all night.

1468
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,649
And, you know, it felt so good.

1469
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,786
To this day, I haven't had
better head.

1470
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,195
So I laid down,

1471
01:03:55,231 --> 01:04:00,828
and I took off my underpants,
and I let him go to town

1472
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,569
when--when...

1473
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:09,544
out of nowhere, I hear my mom
yelling hysterically,

1474
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,706
beating the dog
with a wet mop.

1475
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,942
I mean, it was like
she was possessed.

1476
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,008
She wouldn't talk to me
for a week.

1477
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,452
And then one day, I came home,
and Ringo was gone.

1478
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,623
And she said he ran away,
but I knew she was lying.

1479
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,154
And that summer,

1480
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,430
I found his collar and bones
buried in the backyard.

1481
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,994
- Holly, that's horrible.

I can't believe I told you that.

1486
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:49,107
- So now...

1487
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:53,315
every time
I go down on a girl,

1488
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,656
I think of Ringo, and everything
just comes up in me.

1489
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,923
I can't--I can't control it.

1490
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,156
- Of course.

1491
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,256
But now you've acknowledged it.

1492
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,563
It's time to just move on.

1493
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,899
The body doesn't want
to hold on to these things.

1494
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,098
It just wants to let it go.

1495
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:14,132
- You're so understanding.

1496

You don't think I'm disgusting?

1497
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,469
- Of course not.

1498
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,276
- I'm not some immortal whore?

1499

- You mean immoral?

- Sweetie...

1502
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,516
I think when it comes
to pleasure,

1503
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,957
if it feels good
and you're not hurting anyone,

1504

What your mother did--

that was immoral.

- She had my uncle shoot Ringo
in the head.

I needed to tell somebody.

Thank you.

- Oh, sweetie,
don't mention it.

1514
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,219
- No, I need
to pay you back somehow.

1515
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,721
- Do not be silly.

1516
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:01,086
- No, I would feel
so much better

1517

if you'd just lie down
and let me give you head.

I don't even know you.

with Bambi.

the practice.

01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,173
She's so big.

1616
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,307
- You don't have to whisper.

1617
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,941
She sleeps through earthquakes.

1618
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,044
I got a call
from Addy's shrink's husband,

1619
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,647
the shrink
I was telling you about.

1620
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,523
Somehow they contacted
them first,

1621
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,392
and then I had to pick up
Charlotte at a sleepover,

1622
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:34,953
and by the time I got here,

1623
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,830
they were already rushing her
into the operating room.

1624
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,458
She was probably on the phone.

1625
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,470
She gets so distracted.

1626
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,131
And the last conversation
I had with her,

1627
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,640
I was such a bitch.

1628
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,734
Let's talk about something else.

1629
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,176
How are you feeling?

1630
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:52,778
- I'm good.

1631
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,147
- You're eating right?
Taking care of yourself?

1632
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,551
- Since I last saw you,
I took a shower,

1633
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,647
I had a soup and a salad,
and peed twice.

1634
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,624
- And the father?

1635
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,388
- What about him?

1636
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,055
- Does he know?
- No.

1637
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,758
- Are you gonna tell him?

1638
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,790
- I thought I was, but,
uh, he won't call me back.

1639
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,666
- Typical.

1640
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:17,331
- It's too bad,

1641
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,534
'cause under
different circumstances,

1642
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,907
I could almost see us together.

1643
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,309
- Never say never.

1644
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,074
- No, I mean really different
circumstances,

1645
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,810
like an alternate universe.

1646
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,477
He's a sweet guy.

1647
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:30,644
- Handsome?

1648
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,983
- Handsome.

1649
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:32,988
- Married?

1650
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:33,989
- Single.

1651
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,422
- Rich?
- Very.

1652
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,651
- Call him back.

1653
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,886
- It would never work.

1654
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,723
Not with my past.

1655
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,094
- I think you're
shortchanging yourself.

1656
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,759
What you've done before
doesn't count.

1657
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,995
It's what you're going to do
from now on.

1658
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,062
- Sounds nice.

1659
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,438
But that's not the real world.

1660
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,706
Anyway, I'm not even sure
I'm gonna have the baby, so...

1661
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,440
- Are you with Miss Hunter?

1662
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,072
- I'm her sister.

1663
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,446
- The doctor says
you can come in,

1664
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,713
but just one of you.

1665
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,652
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1666
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,261
- Yeah?

1667
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,534
- Where's Doris?

1668
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,803
- Oh, uh, she went to talk
to the doctor.

1669
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,469
She'll be back soon.

1670
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:30,807
- Who are you?

1671
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,643
- I'm Elektra.

1672
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,081
- I'm Charlotte.

1673
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,550
- I know.

1674
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,416
It's good to meet you.

1675
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:43,517
You thirsty or anything?

1676
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,049
- No.

1677
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,724
Cigarette?

1678
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:52,995
- I can't, thanks.

1679
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,730
- You mind if I do?

1680
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,432
- I don't think you're allowed
in here.

1681
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,464
- We'll see.

01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,617

1683
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,625
Okay, I'll have one.

1684
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,297
Thanks.

1685
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,111
- Doris says some stores

1686
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,148
carry a plastic replica
of your vagina.

1687
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,490
- She said that?

1688
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,361
- I didn't believe her.

1689
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,763
- It's true.

1690
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,995
- Really?

1691
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,696
- Yeah.

1692
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,538
- That's weird.

1693
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,565
What do people do with it?

1694
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,036
- Well...

1695
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,709
I guess some people have
strange tastes in decorating.

1696
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:18,276
You know, it's--
it's like a novelty item.

1697
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,255
- What's a novelty?

1698
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,315
- Like a funny thing
that doesn't really--

1699
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:27,590
I mean, it has a use,
but it's also like a...

1700
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,460
boy.

1701
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:32,797
I'll have to think about that.

1702
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,938
- Maybe I could bring one
into school.

1703
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,098
- I don't think that would be--

1704
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,472
I'm not sure
how that would go over.

1705
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,478
- We could use it for sex ed
instead of those lame pictures.

1706
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,343
- Why don't we read a magazine?

1707

Here.

1708

It's not easy

Why do they call them

1746

- What's a euphemism?

Investigators found
drug paraphernalia on Chapel

a possible accidental overdose.

01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,102
- Hey.

1776
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,235
- Hey there.

1777
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,242
- Did I faint?

1778
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,079
- At least you were
in the perfect place.

1779
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,517
- Where's Charlotte?

1780
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,646
- She went to get a snack.

1781
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,021
- I like her.

1782
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,787
- She's a little weird.

1783
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:19,487
- I've never liked
any kid before,

1784
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,257
even as a kid.

1785
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,025
How's your sister?

1786
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,932
- Well...

1787
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:30,063
they are reconstructing her face
as we speak.

1788
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:33,336
Those are their exact words.

1789
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,708
They say that the plastic
surgeon is the best of the best

1790
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:38,610
and she's gonna be just fine.

1791
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,639
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

1792
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,749
- You believe in God?

1793
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,187
- Right now, yes.

1794
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,350
- I'd like to believe.

1795
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,155
But I don't know.

1796
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,287
I look around the world,

1797
01:18:54,329 --> 01:19:00,029
and I'm in a constant state
of disbelief.

1798
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,195
- Charlotte told me about Nick.

1799
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:07,306
Is he the father?

1800
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,301
Did you love him?

1801
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:15,715
- It's starting to dawn on me
that maybe I did.

1802
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,150
But I never told him.

1803
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,353
You know, the last guy
I really liked,

1804
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,878
we dated for a couple months.

1805
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,185
I didn't know
if he knew about me,

1806
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,624
and I didn't want to ask.

1807
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,184
But anyway...

1808
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,720
the day after I finally went
to bed with him,

1809
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,699
he asked me for my autograph.

1810
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:32,859
- Hmph.

1811
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,698
- He was almost sweet about it.

1812
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:38,331
"l can't believe I fucked
Elektra Luxx," he told me.

1813
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,341
He wanted to share it with me,
with his friends,

1814
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,172
with the world.

1815
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,768
With Nick, I just didn't
want him to think

1816
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,838
I was some groupie stalker
after his money.

1817
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:51,410
I just wanted so badly
not to hide anything anymore,

1818
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,444
you know, to tell the truth.

1819
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,422
- So tell me.

1820
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,756
- What?

1821
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,159
- Pretend I'm Nick.

1822
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:03,494
Tell me the truth.

1823
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,965
I mean, you planned your speech.

1824
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,695
You've rehearsed it
in front of the mirror,

1825
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:07,759
or I know I would have.

1826
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,794
- [laughs]

1827
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,670
- Let me hear it.

1828
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,869
- Okay.

1829
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:19,244
Nick,

1830
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:22,717
I've done 62 X-rated movies,

1831
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,050
35 box covers,

1832
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:29,420
a thousand club appearances.

1833
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:33,791
I have 20 fan clubs,
my own website.

1834
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,124
A conservative estimate
would place

1835
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,931
the amount of people I've fucked
in the mid-hundreds.

1836
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:45,429
I've dated movie stars,
politicians,

1837
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,998
and a pair of twin mafioso
restaurant chefs

1838
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:52,377
who nearly got me arrested
by drug enforcement agents.

1839
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:56,475
I've had my amphetamine phase,
my coke phase,

1840
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,454
my three-cigarette-pack-a-day
phase.

1841
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,282
I haven't talked to a single
member of my family--

1842
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,295
drunks and religious
psychopaths,

1843
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:12,562
each and every one of them--
in ten years.

1844
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,593
I've had three abortions,

1845
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,629
been kicked out
of my last four apartments...

1846
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:27,441
And I have never, ever
had anyone

1847
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,781
kiss me like you do.

1848
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:35,885
- That's beautiful.

1849
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,727
- [laughs]

1850
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:44,095
But it's too late.

1851
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:50,134
I mean, if we don't tell people
how we feel,

1852
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,695
what are we doing here?

1853
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,077
You need to tell Charlotte.

1854
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,673
- I know.

1855
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,046
Once Addy's better and--

1856
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,812
- No, she needs to know now.

1857
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:06,184
- Now is not a good time.

1858
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,620
- But there is no good time.

1859
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,749
There is no right time.

1860
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,383
There is only now.

1861
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:17,058
Your entire life can change
in five minutes.

1862
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,089
Less.

1863
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,861
- Charlotte.

1864
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:29,437
- I can't decide
which looks less appealing.

1865
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,105
- I got to talk to you.

1866
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,680
- Did she decide
to keep the baby?

1867
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,657
- I don't know.

1868
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:45,683
It's not about that.

1869
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,224
I think we should sit down.

1870
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:07,879
So...

1871
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,680
a long time ago,

1872
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:16,487
when I was a lot younger,
before you were born,

1873
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,355
I did something,

1874
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:22,386
some things,
that I'm not entirely...

1875
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,690
Let me rephrase that.

1876
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,202
- Drugs?

1877
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:29,498
- No, not drugs.

1878
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,300
It's not that kind of a story.

1879
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:36,174
I mean, I have done drugs,
but that's not what l...

1880
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,108
[sobbing]

1881
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:56,687
You know I love you
above and beyond words.

1882
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:03,069
I would never abandon you.

1883
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:06,471
[sobbing]

1884
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,744
- I know, Mom.

1885
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,010
- What?

1886
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,074
- I said, "l know."

1887
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:18,950
- What did you say after that?

1888
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,321
- I found my birth certificate
a couple weeks ago.

1889
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,689
- [sniffles]

1890
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,286
What?

1891
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:30,126
Why didn't you say so?

1892
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:31,530
- I don't--
I don't know.

1893
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,931
I guess...

1894
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:38,405
I guess I felt bad
for Mo--I mean Addy.

1895
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,865
- She's still your mom too.

1896
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,310
- Yeah?

1897
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,642
- Yeah.

1898
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,114
And as soon as she's better,

1899
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:52,586
we're gonna decide
how to work this.

1900
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,781
But I wanted
to talk to you first,

1901
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:59,988
because, first and foremost,
I wanted so see

1902
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:06,194
if you'll take me back
as your mom.

1903
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:09,032
I'm reapplying for the job.

1904
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:22,515
[sobbing]

1905
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,348
- I'm a lot of work.

1906
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,212
- I know.

1907
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,723
[laughs]

1908
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,854
- Excuse me, Miss Hunter.

1909
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:36,363
Your sister's out of the OR.

1910
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,728
You can both go see her now.

1911
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,790
- Thank you.

1912
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,405
- After Addy gets better,
can we all go on a road trip?

1913
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:49,876
- Great idea.

1914
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,310
- Can Elektra come too?

1915
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,836
- We can ask her.

1916
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,405
- I think she's gonna keep
the baby.

1917
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,713
- You do?
How come?

1918
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,412
- Because I tested her earlier.

1919
01:25:58,453 --> 01:25:59,750
I asked her
if she wanted to smoke,

1920
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:00,913
and she said she couldn't.

1921
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,650
- Very sneaky.

1922
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,056
- Besides, if she has the baby,
then she can quit her job,

1923
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,458
because she'll be a millionaire.

1924
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,462
- Huh.

1925
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,123
When did you get to be
so clever?

1926
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,325
- Genetic, I guess.

1927
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,027
Speaking of which,
when are going to tell me

1928
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:14,830
about my dad?

1929
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,336
- Hmm.
What do you want to know?

1930
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,202
His name is George.

1931
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,900
He's back in prison.

1932
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,067
- His name is George?

1933
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,167
What's his last name?

1934
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:23,268
- Katz.

1935
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:24,744
- Charlotte Katz-Hunter.

1936
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,304
That is the worst name
I have ever heard.

1937
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,407
- Nobody's forcing you
to take his last name.

1938
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,008
- Can I change my middle name?

1939
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,519
- You don't have a middle name.

1940
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:34,021
- I know, but I want
to change my name

1941
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,579
to Charlotte D. Hunter.

1942
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,250
- What does the D stand for?

1943
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,884
- Danger.

1944
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,690
- Danger is your middle name?

1945
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,628
- Danger is my middle name.

1946
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,655
- It's good.
I like that.

- Hi, I'm Bert Rodriguez,
and this is En Pelotas magazine,

1974
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,857
the adult Latin world's
numero uno source

1975
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:55,260
for breaking sexy news.

1976
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,490
I'm here on the set of

1977
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,522
Even Reverse Cowgirls
Get the Blues

1978
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:01,057
with two hotties
who need no introductions.

1979
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,332
Holly, would you like
to do the honors?

1980
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:04,429
- Excuse me?

1981
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,201
- You want to introduce
yourself?

1982
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,332
- Oh, we've totally met.

1983
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,433
We're in the movie together.

1984
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:09,943
- He means to the camera,
sweetie.

1985
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:11,911
- For all our viewers out there.

1986
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,243
- Okay, I'm lost.

1987
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,771
Your name's Bert, right?

1988
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:19,549
- I'm correspondent/blogger
Bert Rodriguez, and you are...

1989
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:21,714
- Holly.
- Exactly.

1990
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:24,350
Uber hot up-and-comer
Holly Rocket

1991
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:28,021
sitting alongside
adult film industry legend

1992
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:30,826
and, if I may,
the foxiest fuck bunny

1993
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,732
ever captured on video,
Elektra Luxx.

1994
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:34,735
- [laughs]

1995
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:35,758
That's very sweet.

1996
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,100
Thank you.

1997
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,571
- So...

1998
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:39,937
Holly.

1999
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,442
What was it like when you heard
you'd be doing scenes

2000
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:43,774
with Elektra?

2001
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:46,075
- Wow.

2002
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:49,413
I mean, I was--
I was really pinching myself.

2003
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,145
I mean, Elektra's the reason

2004
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,346
I got in the business
to begin with, you know.

2005
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,323
God, I am blessed.
It's like one big wet dream.

2006
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:57,585
- Oh.
- It's true.

2007
01:29:57,625 --> 01:30:00,116
- I'm like,
"Wow, she's licking my nipple,"

2008
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,561
or, "That's Elektra Luxx's toe
in my butt."

2009
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,121
I mean, it's--
it's really wild.

2010
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,530
- That's so nice of you.

2011
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,863
- But it's true.

2012
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,801
And I've been learning so much
just watching you.

2013
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,201
I mean, the way
you fill the camera.

2014
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,205
- She's great.
- No, no.

2015
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,365
I'm the biggest klutz, okay?

2016
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,965
I'm always elbowing
the boom guy.

2017
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,806
But she has
this supernatural sense

2018
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,745
of everything around her,
you know?

2019
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,544
Oh, and then
the hipster coin trick

2020
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,174
and--and eye contact.

2021
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:24,844
- Eye con--
that's your trademark.

2022
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:27,047
You--you make eye contact
with the camera in a way

2023
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,682
so the viewer at home,
he feels like, "Wow,"

2024
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:32,158
like it's him
you're getting it on with.

2025
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,285
- Or her.

2026
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,887
- Or her.
Certainly.

2027
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,864
How did you come up with that?

2028
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:41,164
- Well, I've always been
very comfortable

2029
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,397
with my fellow performers.

2030
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,303
But at first, the camera made me
self-conscious.

2031
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:47,239
- [laughs]
That's hard to believe.

2032
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,175
- Well, until I realized
the camera's

2033
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,700
just another character
in the scene,

2034
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:51,905
the main character, really.

2035
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,709
- I wish I was the camera.

2036
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:55,807
- So when I look at the camera,

2037
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,842
it's like I'm letting the viewer
in on my little secret.

2038
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:00,080
It's a playful relationship.

2039
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,146
- "Playful" being
the operative word,

2040
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,055
and that's it.
- Bert.

2041
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:06,321
Hey, you want to just
take that question?

2042
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,657
Let me ask you.

2043
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,720
You're famous for making
eye contact with the camera

2044
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:12,096
in a way that makes the viewer
at home feel like, "Wow,"

2045
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,363
like it's him
you're getting it on with.

2046
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:18,031
How'd you come up with that?

2047
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:21,269
- Wait, is he in the biz, too?

2048
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,901
- I'm sorry.
You're right.

2049
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:24,741
- It's okay.

2050
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:25,973
- I was totally unprofessional.

2051
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:27,344
- No, let's move on.

2052
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:28,678
Forget it.

2053
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,513
- It's just I was really excited
to meet you.

2054
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,018
I mean, you don't know me
from Adam,

2055
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,111
but I grew up watching you.

2056
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,621
I mean, I know every inch
of your body

2057
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:35,883
like the back of my hand.

2058
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,914
- It's okay.
Next question.

2059
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,790
- Adam who?

2060
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:41,886
- I'll tell you later.

2061
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,760
- We have some questions
from our website.

2062
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:46,528
We conduct fan polls
to determine

2063
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,195
the greatest porn stars in
a bunch of different categories

2064
01:31:49,237 --> 01:31:52,104
from the typical
"best ass, mouth, legs,"

2065
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:53,629
to more specialized stuff,

2066
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:56,165
"best undresser,"
"best facial reaction,"

2067
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,041
"sexiest moan during orgasm."

2068
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,046
Um, let's see.

2069
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,240
Elektra.

2070
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,079
Right now, overall,
you are at 94%.

2071
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:04,880
- Wow.
That's--that's historic.

2072
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:07,251
And, Holly,
you're coming up strong,

2073
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:10,485
90%, which is unheard of
for a newcomer.

2074
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,857
You have "best legs" right now
by a landslide.

2075
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,623
- She does.

2076
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:18,154
- So here are some questions
submitted by our fans.

2077
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,723
- Wait.

2078
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:21,029
Do we--do we have to do
this part?

2079
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,194
- Don't worry.
I'll help you.

2080
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:23,498
- Holly,

2081
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,132
"A man gives you a suitcase
with a million dollars.

2082
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:28,733
"The catch is, if you accept it,
a Chinese man will drop

2083
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,243
"in the middle of the street
and die.

2084
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,212
What do you do?"

2085
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:37,279
- I would pay
for the man's funeral

2086
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,617
and then donate money
to improve street conditions

2087
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:42,646
in China so that more people
won't die.

2088
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:45,849
- "Elektra,

2089
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:49,090
"what was the character name
of the professional wrestler

2090
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,860
that Rocky fights
in Rocky III?"

2091
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,366
- What?
- Ooh, ooh.

2092
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,494
- You know this?
- Yeah, Mr. T.

2093
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,197
- That is incorrect.

2094
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,468
The correct answer
is Thunderlips.

2095
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,270
- Huh, I was in a movie
called Thunderlips.

2096
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:02,708
- Back to Holly.

2097
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,768
"Who was the only Beatle
whose first wife

2098
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,007
was not pregnant
when they married?"

2099
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:08,413
- Who came up
with these questions?

2100
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:09,438
- The Japanese lady?

2101
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:11,144
- Sorry.
The correct answer is George.

2102
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:13,016
- Uh, don't feel bad.
This is crazy.

2103
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:15,614
- Number three,
for you, Elektra.

2104
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:17,851
"What is the name
of a whale's penis?"

2105
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,621
- What the fuck?

2106
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,820
- Whale cock!

2107
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:22,328
- It's not your turn, Holly.

2108
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:25,230
- It can't possibly be
whale cock, can it?

2109
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,528
- I'm afraid that is wrong.

2110
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:29,127
The name for a whale's penis
is dork.

2111
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:31,070
- Dork.
- Huh.

2112
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,403
- Yep, the blue whale
has the biggest dork.

2113
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:34,408
Ten feet long.

2114
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,808
- Jesus.
- How state-of-the-art.

2115
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:39,312
- Final question,
extra credit for both of you.

2116
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:42,680
"Two people stand back-to-back
then walk 30 feet,

2117
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:45,083
"turn left, and walk
another 40 feet.

2118
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,451
How far apart are they?"

2119
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,217
- What kind of porn site
is this?

2120
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,553
There--there is no way
you know this.

2121
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:56,085
It's some kind
of triangulation formula.

2122
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,290
- It's simple trig, I think.

2123
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,696
- Simple trig?
Who are you?

2124
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:00,064
- My mom was a math teacher.

2125
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:01,295
It's one thing I'm good at.

2126
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:02,597
Pythagorean theorem:

2127
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,537
A squared plus B squared
equals C squared.

2128
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:07,905
So the two people
are making two, um...

2129
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:10,672
What's the word?
Um...

2130
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:13,271
- Um, interconnected?
- No, conjoined.

2131
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,215
The two people are making
two conjoined triangles.

2132
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,047
You can solve for C
on one triangle

2133
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,211
and then double it.

2134
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:21,414
So if A equals 30
and B equals 40,

2135
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:24,185
then A squared equals 900
and B squared equals 1,600,

2136
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:26,455
which would mean C squared
equals 2,500.

2137
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,223
The square root of that is 50.

2138
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:30,423
Multiply that times 2,
which would be...

2139
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:32,022
- 100.
- 100.

2140
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,863
The people are 100 feet away
from each other,

2141
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,801
which would mean
that one person's in the kitchen

2142
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:37,565
and the other person's
watching TV.

2143
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:40,574
- That is 1,000% correct.

2144
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,735
- What just happened?

2145
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,540
- Will the jerk-off
blocking the loading dock

2146
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,547
with a '79 Toyota Corolla
move it immediately, please?

2147
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:49,208
- Fuck.

2148
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,376
- Oh, is that you?

2149
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:52,943
- What--did he say?
Did he say Corolla?

2150
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,716
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, yeah.

2151
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:56,620
- Do you think--
I don't really--

2152
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:57,715
- They do tow.
- Yeah.

2153
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:58,725
- You should check it out.

2154
01:34:58,759 --> 01:34:59,851
- Shit.
I'm so sorry.

2155
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,885
I will--I'll be right back.

2156
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,090
- Wow.

2157
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,393
You could get a PhD, you know?

2158
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:06,525
- I know.

2159
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:08,899
That's why I get tested
twice a year.

2160
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:12,230
Nobody thinks
it can happen to them,

2161
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:14,741
but anyone can get a PhD.

2162
01:35:14,775 --> 01:35:16,936
Make sure you get tested.

2163
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:18,467
Thank you.
