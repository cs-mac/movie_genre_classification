1
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:45,552
 We're outside New York's 
 Plaza Hotel... 

2
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,885
 for the 32nd Annual 
 Daytime Television Awards. 

3
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:51,687
 And a glorious, 
 glamorous night it is. 

4
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,251
 A night of a thousand stars. 

5
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:16,014
From  The Sun Also Sets,  it's
Montana Moorehead and Ariel Maloney!

6
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:39,063
Such approval from this crowd
must make you feel good.

7
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,667
We have the greatest,
most loyal fans in the world.

8
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:49,708
With these stars is the show's
producer David Seton Barnes.

9
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:52,252
David, a big night for you.

10
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,948
Yes, when I originally hatched
the Caribbean theme...

11
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,350
Celeste Talbert!

12
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:10,898
Celeste! You know her as Maggie
from  The Sun Also Sets. 

13
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:15,341
She's here with Blair Brennan,
who plays her gorgeous husband Bolt.

14
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,437
Celeste, your 12th nomination
as best daytime actress.

15
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,573
It must get to be old hat
for you.

16
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,086
Never, Leeza.
It's always such a genuine thrill.

17
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,816
I know you're anxious to get inside
and share the excitement.

18
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,794
Best of luck to you tonight.

19
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,660
Thanks so much, Leeza.

20
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,360
Now the oil refineries
belong to me.

21
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,962
Only me!

22
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,964
And another thing.

23
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,561
You're all fired.

24
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:19,477
Now our fifth nominee,
Celeste Talbert...

25
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,112
from  The Sun Also Sets. 

26
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:34,959
I never said I was the best mother.
Give me a little credit, will you?

27
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:38,128
Credit for being someone
who tried...

28
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:41,173
to love you the only way
she knew how.

29
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:45,009
Darling!

30
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,602
Oh, my darling!

31
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,340
Yes!

32
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,042
Yes, yes, yes!

33
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,415
I am guilty!

34
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:00,056
Guilty of love
in the first degree.

35
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,331
Bolt...

36
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:14,000
if this operation
isn't a success...

37
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,563
if...

38
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,709
I should die...

39
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:23,272
 please, please... 

40
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,852
 please, don't be sad. 

41
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,785
 I want you to be happy. 

42
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:40,160
 You are the great love 
 of my life. 

43
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,515
And the award...

44
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,574
for best actress...

45
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,643
in a daytime drama...

46
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:03,916
Tell me you don't love this.

47
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,049
goes to...

48
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,258
Celeste Talbert!

49
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:22,533
Five minutes, Mr. Loman.

50
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:26,977
Don't call me Mr. Loman!

51
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:30,379
My name is Anderson!
Anderson! Anderson!

52
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,562
You're not Uncle Charlie...

53
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,570
'cause Uncle Charlie is not liked.

54
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,572
He's liked,
but not well liked.

55
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,848
There are so many people
to thank.

56
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:09,217
First of all,
my fabulous supporting cast...

57
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:12,314
who gives a new meaning
to the word support.

58
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,450
- Bitch.
- Hag.

59
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,121
I hate her so much.

60
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:21,530
And a great big special thanks
to my best pal, my rock...

61
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:25,435
the head writer on
 The Sun Also Sets,  Rose Schwartz.

62
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,837
Rosie, stand up, take a bow.

63
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:34,340
Thank you, everyone,
and have a terrific evening.

64
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,574
See you on the television!

65
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,686
I'm home!

66
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,116
Adam?

67
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,458
Did you watch?

68
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:49,188
I won!

69
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,695
Yeah, well.

70
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,256
It's just as well you didn't come.
You'd have been bored senseless.

71
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,735
And the reception!
There were so many people.

72
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,068
I tried to get home
as soon as I could.

73
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,337
But you know me, I didn't want
to be rude to anybody.

74
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,641
First you have to say hi
to all the executives.

75
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,146
Adam?

76
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,982
Then you have to say hi
to all the executives' wives.

77
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:16,487
 Celeste, it's Adam. 

78
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:19,650
 I'm at the airport. 
 Good-bye, my darling. 

79
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,354
 It was beyond great, but I have 
 to go back to Sarah and the kids. 

80
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:25,727
 It's like a chemical thing. 

81
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,732
 Hey, putz, I'll be off 
 in a second! 

82
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,734
 I've left you the plants. 

83
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:33,568
 Please water them, and treat them 
 as lovingly as you treated me. 

84
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,332
- You do want me, don't you, David?
- You know I do.

85
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,562
- Then get rid of her!
- You think that's easy?

86
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,299
- Give her Alzheimer's.
- Right. Rose is in the way.

87
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:10,001
- Fire Rose.
- Not with Celeste protecting her.

88
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:13,671
- God! Celeste, Celeste! Look...
- Grab those revisions.

89
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:17,409
I am 28 years old.
I need this to happen now!

90
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,043
I am not a new face anymore.

91
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:24,579
She won her eighth Schmenky.
Edmund's crazy about her.

92
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,784
You dump people
when they're on top...

93
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,851
before they lose their popularity
and drag the show down with them.

94
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,457
Excuse me?

95
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,492
Look, I have a public.
They write me letters.

96
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,858
"More Montana," they write.
Look at these!

97
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:40,862
"Celeste Talbert
is a menopausal hag.

98
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,094
Let's see more
of Montana Moorehead."

99
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,364
What are you looking at?

100
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:48,964
Maria Randosie,
Fort Lee, New Jersey.

101
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,443
Fort Lee! That's your audience.
That's the heartland.

102
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,709
I'm aware of my demographics.

103
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,579
Are you?

104
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,294
I want her off the show
worse than you.

105
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,302
You know why?
Then it's my show.

106
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,100
- Our show. A young show.
- A happening show.

107
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:22,368
Like  Laguna Beach. 
Better than  Laguna Beach. 

108
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:25,741
- Hotter. Sandier.
- Wetter. Saltier.

109
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,871
Why aren't we having sex yet?

110
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,881
You know the rules.

111
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:34,979
Get rid of her,
Mr. Fuzzy is yours.

112
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,824
Gosh, she's cheap.

113
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,797
Ready, three! Go to three!

114
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:52,598
Ready, two... I mean one!

115
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,833
What is this, what is it?

116
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:58,138
I was so afraid you were gone.

117
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,644
Gone?

118
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,044
Darling, I could never leave you.

119
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:06,551
Ever.

120
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,589
That's a cut!

121
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,893
Next time wear a swimsuit
underneath the towel.

122
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,193
It's a little early
in the day for me.

123
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:21,199
I can't act in a swimsuit.

124
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,430
Celeste, pumpkin!
Were you celebrating last night?

125
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:26,529
Your eyes look reddish.

126
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:29,131
We heard about Adam.
It's so sad.

127
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,335
Breaking families apart
is such a tragedy.

128
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,902
Anything you need, just call
any time, day or night.

129
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:39,008
I don't deserve friends like you.
I'm just too lucky!

130
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,584
David!

131
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,989
Hey, great scene with Bolt.

132
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,389
I realize I'm not a young woman...

133
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,485
however, could you please...

134
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:52,759
point out to our new costume
designer, whose name I don't...

135
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,766
- Tawny Miller.
- How do you do?

136
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,234
That I don't feel right
in a turban!

137
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:59,237
What I feel like...

138
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:02,502
is Gloria "Fucking" Swanson!

139
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:05,066
What am l, 70, David? Am I 70?

140
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:10,081
Why don't you put me in a walker?
Buy a walker and put me in it!

141
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,317
You're fired. I'm just kidding.

142
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,153
Attention.
No turbans for Miss Talbert.

143
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,163
Tawny.

144
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,040
Gloria Swanson is dead.

145
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,770
I don't mean dead in a sense,
I mean actually dead!

146
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:42,803
I'm 42. I don't wanna be dressed
like a dead woman. Understand?

147
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:46,716
- Then maybe we'll be pals.
- Not good ones!

148
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:51,521
What is this, PBS?

149
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:59,357
Very good, very true.
I love what you're doing.

150
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:03,664
I think we could try it one
more time, and this time...

151
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,328
I don't know.

152
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:07,463
Maybe try one without your shirt.

153
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,235
Sure.

154
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,214
Will you be having wine
with dinner?

155
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,623
We found our waiter.

156
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,461
Will you be having wine
with dinner?

157
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,328
Will you be having wine
with your dinner?

158
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:45,741
...from the South of France. No,
I don't think I've seen you before.

159
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:49,178
That's why
I slept so poorly last night.

160
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:52,274
For if I tell you, you'll say...

161
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,444
I'm making a big deal
out of nothing.

162
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,483
Delivery.

163
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,989
I'll take it.

164
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,493
You can't go in there!

165
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:09,090
I'm Lori Craven,
and I'm an actress.

166
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:11,466
An actress? Really!
How nice for you.

167
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,665
I'm Betsy Faye Sharon,
and I'm a bitch. Now get out.

168
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,437
Miss Sharon,
I've got to get on this show.

169
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:22,470
I'm not asking for special
treatment, just for a chance.

170
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,505
Yes?

171
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,609
Hi, Betsy.
We need a new homeless now.

172
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:30,952
But good-looking homeless.
This bunch is disgusting.

173
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:34,356
You could pick him up
off the street. Come on!

174
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:36,156
Okay! All right!

175
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:40,263
- When can you start?
- Open up!

176
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,530
Miss Talbert, for your approval...

177
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:45,695
we have this for the beach scene.

178
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,705
What do you think of this?

179
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,641
Okay. Or I could line it. Or I
have a black one. That's not good.

180
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:56,546
Okay, then for tomorrow's fight
with Bolt, you'll wear this.

181
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,947
Okay. All right.

182
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,920
And then for when Blade
accidentally shoots the  contessa. 

183
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,218
What do you think of this?
Is this beautiful?

184
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:09,022
With your hair and eyes,
this will look beautiful.

185
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:11,655
Okay. We can accessorize
in the morning.

186
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:13,722
I had this idea.

187
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,359
How do you feel about
a Tammy Faye Baker...

188
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:19,165
kind of a thing, you know?

189
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:22,867
Not like the boots or crucifix
or anything...

190
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,172
but some eyelashes
to bring your eyes out.

191
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,370
What?

192
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,379
Nothing.

193
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,242
All right...

194
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,583
Rose, don't hover.
Come in or get out.

195
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,422
What are you doing?

196
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:54,261
Have you gone insane? Do you know
the word is you're crazed today?

197
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,930
- What's in your mouth?
- A cigarette.

198
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,629
I know. Why is it in your mouth?
You don't smoke.

199
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,331
I do now!

200
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:06,239
Okay. Are you okay? You're fine?

201
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,242
- Fine!
- Fine.

202
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:16,274
Adam went home to his wife.

203
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,411
Really? Oh!

204
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:25,484
When I got home last night,
there was a message on the machine.

205
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,155
On the machine, Rose!

206
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,720
He's a dog.

207
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,599
He went home to Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh!

208
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,866
Does that tell you anything
about my appeal?

209
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:39,840
Why were you going with somebody
from Pittsburgh?

210
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,639
It was inevitable because I'm...

211
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,112
- A home wrecker.
- A home wrecker and I'm old.

212
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,150
They put me in a turban, Rose.

213
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,878
They put me in a turban.

214
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,386
- It's a plot.
- It is a plot. A plot!

215
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,913
David and Montana are plotting
against me every day.

216
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,357
- Those bastards.
- I can't do this.

217
00:16:58,427 --> 00:16:59,758
You are right.

218
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:02,263
Why don't you please tell me
to get off the show?

219
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,169
You're not going to eat that.

220
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,399
- Then why did you order it?
- I don't know.

221
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,944
- Then cover it up.
- I like them.

222
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,911
Cover the crawdad butts.

223
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,279
 Stephen, please call wardrobe. 

224
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,979
I was up half the night thinking
of all these men, these losers.

225
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,818
All the way back
to Jeffrey Anderson.

226
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,417
You went with him when you were
a kid. You gotta get over this.

227
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:34,725
I'm gonna start eating with Montana.
You driving me crazy.

228
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,822
I have to get off this show
while I'm still alive.

229
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:41,199
Fine. I could write you out for six
months. You could take a sabbatical.

230
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,204
Six months you'll be gone.

231
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:48,437
We'll say Maggie went to visit
the Dalai Lama. Spiritual thing.

232
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,536
I thought the Dalai Lama
moved to L.A.

233
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,707
Some other Lama then. It doesn't
matter. Fernando Lama. Come on!

234
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,013
No! What would I do
on a sabbatical?

235
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:59,577
This is all I know, this show.

236
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:03,056
It's so pathetic.

237
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,860
It's time...

238
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,330
to take a big trip across
the George Washington Bridge.

239
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:12,264
No.

240
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,461
It's a good idea.

241
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,129
It's a crutch.

242
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:18,366
It's a crutch!

243
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
We'll do it
this one last time, okay?

244
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:25,646
All right, this once.

245
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,118
- I'm ready. Are you?
- Yes.

246
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,967
Oh! Oh, look! Look, look!

247
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:58,412
Aren't you on that TV show?
Oh, look!

248
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,506
- You look so small.
- Is that her?

249
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,575
You're from  The Sun Also Sets. 

250
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:05,176
I want an autograph.

251
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:09,384
You look so pretty.
Wait a minute!

252
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,392
I see you on TV every day.

253
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,724
Oh, what's her name?

254
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:18,699
Oh, tell me your name.
Shut up. What's your name?

255
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,860
Celeste! Oh, that's you!

256
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:24,531
Give me that. Sign this for me.
You have to wait for me.

257
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,438
Yes, to whom?

258
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,568
Latice. L-A-T-l-C-E.
I can't believe it!

259
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:32,205
- Your hair looks nice.
- You can leave now.

260
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:35,114
I can't believe it.
Get in there.

261
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,950
 Absolutely. 

262
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:16,389
Renting cars to people?
That's acting.

263
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,825
That's how I feel.
That I'm performing.

264
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,829
The motivation's built in.

265
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:25,333
You could tell I had talent
just by watching me lease a car?

266
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,596
It's that obvious.

267
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,468
My God, you have beautiful hands.

268
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,700
Hands say so much about a person.

269
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,445
As an actor,
I'm very conscious of my hands.

270
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:40,949
When I play Willy, I feel
as if I have salesmen's hands.

271
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:44,213
You are something up there.

272
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,550
I couldn't keep my eyes
off of you.

273
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:51,616
I noticed you too.
The girl in the brown uniform.

274
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:59,797
I think we're avoiding intimacy.
My therapist says...

275
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:03,326
I've racked my brains for ideas
to drive that bitch off the show!

276
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:05,737
I got it!
We give her Bell's palsy.

277
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,969
Right! On the... On the...

278
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,011
What kind of moron are you?

279
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,240
It's a serious disfiguring disease.

280
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,010
David, do you remember what happened
on  Bold and the Brash... 

281
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,075
when they made Tiffany
become incontinent?

282
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,280
Do you? Thousands
of sympathy letters.

283
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,881
She became the bed wetters'
celebrity spokesperson.

284
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,324
She hosted her own telethon.

285
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:27,419
Is that what we want, David?

286
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,431
We have got to get off the dime
sexually because I'm losing it.

287
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,433
I would kill to have you
on all fours.

288
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,402
Would you?
Then you know what you have to do.

289
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,065
- Make Maggie a murderess.
- Oh, a death!

290
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,108
Yes. It will turn the country
against her.

291
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,109
- It can't be one of the regulars.
- Not even Bolt?

292
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,578
No, Bolt's gold, especially with
the impotency thing coming up.

293
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,810
- One of the extras?
- One of the extras.

294
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,943
One of the homeless, David.

295
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,886
- That's cruel.
- It's very cruel.

296
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:56,948
- You do want me, don't you, David?
- In the weirdest way.

297
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,617
You're this close.

298
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,643
I've got to seriously review
this relationship.

299
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,678
Ariel should
be raped by Father Cory.

300
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:17,953
The  contessa  should be kidnapped
by some colored guys.

301
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:19,614
Colored guys?

302
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,251
Can you bring us up to date
before Edmund gets here?

303
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:24,227
Feel free to follow along.

304
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:27,093
Claude is determined to attend
Steve's funeral...

305
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:30,760
in a motorized wheelchair which
he operates by blowing into a tube.

306
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,029
Meanwhile...

307
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,936
That's cute, but when are we
gonna put someone in a coma?

308
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:38,737
Actors don't like to play coma.
They feel it limits their range.

309
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,277
Very good, Rose.

310
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:42,973
Morning, Mr. Edwards.

311
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:57,623
We were going over
some story lines and...

312
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:01,062
I would like to voice
my strong concern...

313
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,431
about this show's spiraling
decline in ratings.

314
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:08,637
David, ever since you took us
to the Caribbean...

315
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:12,005
it's been Jamaica homeless people
sucking soup...

316
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:16,604
and the big wave outside
that cost $100,000.

317
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,912
That's depressing and expensive.
Two words I hate.

318
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:25,786
You know the words I like?
I like "peppy" and "cheap."

319
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:29,418
I agree a thousand percent.
Rose and I were just exploring...

320
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:32,122
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were.

321
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:34,790
I also wanted to keep to
the socially-relevant story lines...

322
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:39,030
such as the homeless or oil spills
or breast implants.

323
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:53,977
The point I'm trying to make
is that quiz shows are beating us.

324
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:57,647
There's a lady cooking sausages
almost tied us last week.

325
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:01,158
A guy at my tennis club said it
should be called  The Sun Also Sucks. 

326
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:03,693
I don't like this gentleman.

327
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:09,324
I have been the head of daytime
programming for a long, long time.

328
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:13,368
Maybe too long.

329
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:16,032
Don't be silly.
You are daytime programming.

330
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:18,905
But I do know one thing.

331
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:23,276
When the ratings go down,
you have to do something drastic.

332
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:26,215
The "D" word, David.
Drastic.

333
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,611
Might I suggest...

334
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,455
a murder.

335
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:34,517
A murder?

336
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:37,686
An accidental murder
of one of the homeless.

337
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,856
Who would murder a homeless person?

338
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:41,921
Celeste?

339
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,194
Ultimately it's great for her.

340
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:48,671
She has a trial, gets let off.
It's up. We want something up.

341
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,540
You're telling me you want her
to murder some homeless person.

342
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,875
Relax. It's topical,
and it has resonance.

343
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:58,108
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

344
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,778
Rose, how much
are your condo payments?

345
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:09,350
I have worked with her for 15 years
and written every word she uttered.

346
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:12,885
And I ain't writing nothing
"garbagy" like that. Understand me?

347
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:16,465
What did Rose say?
What did she say?

348
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:20,402
She loves it, but she's really tired
so we'll flesh it out...

349
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,496
and she'll polish it
in the morning.

350
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:26,703
David, I don't think
we have established Maggie...

351
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:29,474
in the soup kitchen milieu.

352
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:33,880
Burton, she's in the milieu now.
Give her a ladle. Case closed.

353
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:38,115
I shouldn't have said that. I'm
sorry. I was wrong, you were right.

354
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,321
Who dies?

355
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:48,557
- Look at the hooters.
- We should kill that blonde one.

356
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:51,761
You can't kill a blonde woman.
You'll drive half the men...

357
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:52,928
That's her.

358
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:56,539
- She dies.
- Gimme a break.

359
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,906
She's got an angel's face. Celeste
should kill her with that face?

360
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,242
You know why?
Because it's powerful.

361
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:06,283
The young girl. She's beautiful,
but she's deranged.

362
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,750
She's a powder keg. She's got
a chemical imbalance. What is it?

363
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,812
- Bipolar.
- The Bill Styron thing.

364
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,858
She's in the soup kitchen. Celeste
is there. "You want some soup?"

365
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:18,157
But it clicks something off.
She snaps. She pulls a knife out.

366
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:20,060
Excuse me, David.

367
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:22,190
- Where does she get this knife?
- On her. Burton.

368
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,097
It can work.

369
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:33,637
She came in. I don't know who
she is. Her name's Mavin, Slavin...

370
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,645
- There's no agent.
- Find her!

371
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:39,205
- What if she can't act?
- That never stopped us before.

372
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,984
What?

373
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,185
We make her mute. She doesn't speak,
we don't have to pay her as much.

374
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,957
A homeless deaf-mute.
What could be more pathetic?

375
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,032
God, I'm good.

376
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:12,973
Lori Craven?

377
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:17,849
- This is your lucky...
- Day.

378
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,217
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're starving.

379
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:29,062
You haven't eaten in years, so
you smell the soup and get in line.

380
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:32,694
Your knees are shaking.
Shake your knees.

381
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,670
A little less.

382
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,229
Perfect! Beautiful!

383
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:41,574
When the soup lady arrives,
something inside of you snaps.

384
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:43,671
- A crack-up.
- Exactly, exactly.

385
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:45,682
It's all gotten to you...

386
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,447
the poverty, deprivation,
peeing in the streets.

387
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,421
So you reach into your bag...

388
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,118
and you grab the knife!

389
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:59,390
- It's really big!
- It looks smaller on the screen.

390
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:03,456
You take the knife,
and you lunge at the soup lady.

391
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:09,268
As you are mute, you cannot speak,
so you grunt a little.

392
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,365
Okay? Try it.

393
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,776
Good.

394
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:15,869
Who do I lunge for?

395
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,881
You lunge for Maggie.

396
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:22,446
Miss Celeste Talbert.
Going big time, kid.

397
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,956
Okay, boys and girls,
we're going to tape this rehearsal.

398
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:29,789
And remember, poverty, depression...

399
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,589
society's ills.

400
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:37,066
We are making a statement.
Don't underline it, just make it.

401
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,864
- Burton?
- I'm sorry.

402
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:44,533
- Rose, can I talk to you outside?
- About what?

403
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,942
This Uncle Hugo thing and the will.
I find it confusing.

404
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:49,445
You're confused?

405
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:53,449
The man was your uncle. He died.
He didn't leave you shit.

406
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:56,077
You're upset. Period.

407
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,953
What about their history together?
Was there always animosity?

408
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,739
Yes! Ever since you ran over
the man's schnauzer.

409
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:06,240
I have my script outside.

410
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,938
I just wanna make some notes.
Okay? Please.

411
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:14,277
I would think you were acting,
but you've never been this good.

412
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,783
- What?
- Here it comes.

413
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,760
David! David!

414
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,064
I'm so sorry.

415
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:33,125
I murder some homeless girl?
Are you nuts?

416
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,636
Rose!

417
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:39,967
She was just here. Sweetie, it was
an accident. She falls on the knife.

418
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:42,170
- Then what?
- There's a great trial.

419
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,974
David, another trial?

420
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:47,016
There hasn't been a trial since '87.
They wanted a death upstairs.

421
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:50,679
- I'm not doing it!
- Well, okay.

422
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,222
Oh, my God.

423
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,226
It's nothing, just my...

424
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,625
Oh, my God!

425
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,756
Rub right here. Please, please!

426
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:03,265
I've got it!

427
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,301
Will you call Edmund and talk?

428
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:08,429
- They're hot for a killing.
- They said that?

429
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,666
You have no idea the flak
I'm getting from management.

430
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,141
I'm trying to shield you from it
because I love you and it's my job.

431
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,304
But this time
he laid down the law.

432
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,281
- But we're not gonna do it.
- We're not?

433
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,442
I said "Celeste won't be
a happy camper.

434
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:24,578
You can't make me do this to her!
I love her!"

435
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:28,681
- Maybe we should do it.
- No. It hurts me to hurt you.

436
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,820
- I won't do it!
- This is not your decision to make.

437
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,955
This comes from upstairs.

438
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:39,991
We've gotta get up right now,
get over there and do it!

439
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,673
Let's do it!

440
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:46,572
Places, everybody.

441
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:49,441
Tawny! Where the hell
is that woman?

442
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:55,178
Places, everyone.

443
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,221
And three...

444
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,119
two...

445
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,919
one.

446
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:12,027
- A little soup, it's so warming.
- You're so kind, miss.

447
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:14,161
Call me Maggie.

448
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:19,936
There we are. Please go in,
and get out of the sun.

449
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,944
It's coming.

450
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:23,639
Here's yours.

451
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,475
And yours, my dear.

452
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,348
Some for you.

453
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,954
The one after this.

454
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,895
Lori?

455
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:52,133
Aunt Celeste.

456
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,074
 That's a cut. 

457
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:04,315
- Did the mute speak?
- Lori, you're a mute. Don't speak.

458
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,218
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,361
Hi, Edward. I am so livid.
I think Rose Schwartz should be...

460
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:20,334
We thought you'd feel that way.
We love it too.

461
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:24,807
It's so good to see you!

462
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:29,441
Look at you!
What are you doing here?

463
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,673
Well, I left college.

464
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:34,774
You left college.

465
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:37,081
You mean you left?
You don't mean you left college?

466
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:41,385
You left it? No! No, that's
not possible. No. Come on.

467
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,019
I'm so grateful for everything
you've done.

468
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:48,064
Tuition. All the checks.
How could I live without you?

469
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:50,065
Where are you staying?

470
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,666
- At the Hotel Marmaduke.
- There's no such place.

471
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,102
Yes, there is.

472
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:58,698
We'll go there, get your stuff
and then go to the airport.

473
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:01,642
- Where are we going?
- You're going home.

474
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:04,509
I can't go home.
I just got a job.

475
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,105
Taxi!

476
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:07,774
I want to act!

477
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:12,619
Don't say, "I want to act." Ever.
Please!

478
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,317
- May I have autograph?
- Yes! To whom?

479
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,656
I'm sorry, sir. Thanks anyway.

480
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:21,720
I can't shake it.
It's all I ever think about.

481
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,393
- Does Grandma know you're here?
- Yes. I told her yesterday.

482
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:27,698
You're too young
to be in the city by yourself.

483
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,705
You were 16
when you came to New York.

484
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,241
You see me as a role model?
You want to end up like me?

485
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,072
I need a cab!

486
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:36,510
I can't have it.
I just can't have it!

487
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,414
Why does it have to be about you?
What about me?

488
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:41,848
Please!

489
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:47,686
I didn't see you in the senior play,
missing three days' work? Please!

490
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:50,351
- I'm having a life here.
- But I love you.

491
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:51,655
I love you.

492
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:56,062
Who sent chocolates when you were
sick and phoned you day and night?

493
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:58,794
- I'm staying, Celeste.
- You're going.

494
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,961
Read my lips.

495
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,135
Don't say, "Read my lips."
Really.

496
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,270
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

497
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,872
All right, if you're staying,
you're staying with me.

498
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,517
 It didn't work! 

499
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:19,179
I'm not gonna let this work to
her advantage. We need to be smart!

500
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:22,486
You know, you and I never exchanged
our views about religion...

501
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,618
never shared
our childhood memories...

502
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:26,924
You wanna know about my childhood?

503
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:29,430
I had no friends.
I wore too much makeup.

504
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,696
All the kids thought I was evil!
Now look at me. Nurse Nan.

505
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:35,260
David, I cannot be
the villain forever.

506
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:39,098
I'm sweet. I'm tender.
I'm a victim!

507
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:41,541
Can you just... with the hair.

508
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:43,545
I need a cigarette.

509
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:53,149
- I want Celeste to burn.
- So do I.

510
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:56,556
Especially if it will help
bring us closer. I'm an optimist.

511
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,890
Do you want to hear about
my childhood?

512
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,159
The actor that wrote you...

513
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:05,258
the one Celeste had the affair with,
the one she hated.

514
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:08,327
Jeffrey Anderson.
She had him thrown off the show.

515
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:10,463
Bring him back!

516
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,168
- Do you mind?
- Okay.Just checking.

517
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:16,576
He's probably selling something.
Who knows where the hell he is?

518
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:18,409
He's in Florida.

519
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:20,449
Do you mind?

520
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,919
What is it about you?
I can't put my finger on it.

521
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:29,925
You're not my type. I'm used
to dating petite, waifish girls.

522
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,927
But I'm so drawn to you!

523
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:35,089
It's not just chemical.
I believe it's spiritual.

524
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:39,761
I believe it too. Now, if you want
to get to know the real me...

525
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,362
Find Jeffrey Anderson.

526
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,804
Hmm. Can I touch your breasts?

527
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,307
Find him!

528
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:55,945
 Where'd you go? 

529
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:59,849
I got on the road and went north
to Providence.

530
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:02,323
- Met the mayor.
- The mayor of Providence?

531
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,189
- What did he say?
- The mayor.

532
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,251
- The mayor of Providence.
- Who?

533
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,230
The mayor of Providence, Pop?

534
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:12,393
Yeah! The mayor of Providence.

535
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:15,463
Rhode Island!

536
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,028
Oh, waiter!

537
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:18,698
Waiter!

538
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:20,743
He was sitting
in the hotel lobby.

539
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,870
- Waiter? Waiter?
- What did he say?

540
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:30,418
"Good morning." I said,
"You got a fine city here, Mayor."

541
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:34,820
- Then...
- You're doing so well up there.

542
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,587
Then I had a cup of coffee...

543
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,522
Then I went to Boston.

544
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,094
Fine city, Boston. Then a couple
of other towns in Mass.

545
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:52,198
Portland, Bangor and straight home!

546
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,833
What is he yelling?

547
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:05,518
You have a visitor, Mr. Loman.

548
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:08,284
Stop calling me Mr. Loman!

549
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:11,418
Hi, Jeffrey. David Barnes.
Producer,  Sun Also Sets. 

550
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:16,022
- I saw the show.
- Ah, no, no!

551
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,498
What?

552
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,762
No! Not tonight!

553
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,304
Jesus, God, they were awful!

554
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:26,035
I've seen dinner theater before.
I know real talent when I see it.

555
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:28,634
- What?
- I think you're one of a kind.

556
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,077
Can I buy you a drink?
You look a little parched.

557
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,581
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Sure. The bar...

558
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,345
Change first.

559
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,088
I'll be right there.

560
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:47,689
What exactly would I be doing
on the show?

561
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:51,222
We thought you'd return
as the original character.

562
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,235
Rod Randall?

563
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:58,536
Here it is. Rod Randall returns
as a world-famous doctor.

564
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:00,633
He's been studying in Europe.

565
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:05,305
I like it. Life and death issues.
He's been abroad.

566
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:08,009
- Vienna.
- Perfect.

567
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:11,747
It's kind of a continental,
world weary kind of thing.

568
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,789
That's it.

569
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,687
I like it.

570
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:18,124
He's seen things in Europe.

571
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,788
European things.
Sophisticated things.

572
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:24,196
- Things of the world.
- Maybe an accent.

573
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,497
I'd stay away from accents.

574
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:32,030
The thing is, though, I got
this idea for a one-man  Hamlet. 

575
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,042
I need time to develop that.

576
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:38,137
Come to New York. We'll set you up
with a producer, do it off-Broadway.

577
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:41,809
My theory is that
all the characters are Hamlet.

578
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:44,444
It's all happening
in Hamlet's head.

579
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,353
So you only need one actor.
Am I crazy?

580
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:50,324
No. That actually clears up
a lot of stuff for me.

581
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:54,591
Back to  The Sun Also Sets, 
which is the topic at hand.

582
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,495
Shortly after returning...

583
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:01,636
Dr. Rod Randall starts
a torrid love affair...

584
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,569
with Celeste Talbert.

585
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,640
Celeste Talbert?

586
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,213
She's the one who had me axed
off the show 20 years ago.

587
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,482
I mean...

588
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:25,618
Celeste and l,
we were just kids.

589
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:28,960
But... Excuse me.
Still, we had something.

590
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:30,828
There was a...

591
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,868
fire, passion.

592
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:36,837
No! She wanted to be
a big star!

593
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:39,568
Nothing else mattered.
Love. Nothing!

594
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,941
Look at this.

595
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:48,541
Talk about fame's fleeting chariot.

596
00:39:52,488 --> 00:39:53,512
Gee whiz.

597
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:56,849
Jesus.

598
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:01,463
Boy, did that get screwed up!

599
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:04,932
But now, here you are
out of the blue offering me...

600
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,798
another chance.

601
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,803
A chance to be something.

602
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:11,772
Be somebody.

603
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,173
Get reacquainted with Celeste.

604
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:19,815
And wreck her life
the way she wrecked mine!

605
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,073
New boy in town?

606
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:56,346
Just stepped off the choo-choo.

607
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:58,353
You have beautiful eyes.

608
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,821
They're nothing compared
to my tits.

609
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:04,556
Come up and see me sometime.

610
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,241
Good morning.

611
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:17,679
- Tawny.
- Hello, Miss Talbert.

612
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:21,444
- Have you met my niece Lori?
- Yes, several times.

613
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:24,281
- She's my new roommate.
- Good for you.

614
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:26,686
Why do you have to make
such a production about it?

615
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:30,817
So I'm happy for one brief,
flickering moment. Sue me.

616
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:32,986
- Where are you going?
- Extras' room.

617
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:35,496
I have to get
into my homeless rags.

618
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,105
Rod Randall is back from the dead?
How dumb is this?

619
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:50,270
The man was killed in 1973
in an auto accident.

620
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:53,975
So he wasn't killed. He was maimed.
We give him reconstructive surgery.

621
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,316
What are you talking about? The guy
was decapitated. I looked it up.

622
00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:01,255
He was on his way to the Yukon
in a pink convertible...

623
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:03,690
to see his brother who was
an ex-con named Francis...

624
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,093
when a tractor-trailer came along
and decapitated him.

625
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,825
You know what that means.
He doesn't have a head!

626
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:12,163
How am I supposed to write for a guy
that doesn't have a head?

627
00:42:12,235 --> 00:42:14,499
He's got no lips, no vocal cords.
What do you want me to do?

628
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,802
They froze the head, put it back on
in a two-day operation.

629
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,502
Use your imagination.

630
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,510
He doesn't have a head!

631
00:42:22,578 --> 00:42:25,240
Never mind, never mind.
I will work this out myself.

632
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:30,013
I want you to help me understand
making Celeste Montana's mother.

633
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:32,987
Did Celeste have her when
she was five, six, seven? When?

634
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:35,957
Guess what. You'll work it out.
You're a writer.

635
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:39,119
What is this horseshit?
I'm Montana's mother?

636
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:41,459
Never! And you!

637
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:44,364
Oh, no, no, no.

638
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:48,234
- I can't believe you'd write this.
- I didn't. He did it!

639
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:51,364
- And you! And you!
- I was under orders.

640
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:53,068
So was Hitler!

641
00:42:53,142 --> 00:42:56,202
I don't mean Hitler.
I mean the other guy.

642
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,837
- Hess.
- Eichmann.

643
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:02,178
Eichmann! Thank you.
Eichmann. That's you.

644
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:06,415
Rod Randall comes back from Vienna?
I fall in love with him?

645
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:09,947
And Montana turns out
to be my daughter?

646
00:43:10,026 --> 00:43:12,995
How in the name of God
is that possible?

647
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:17,658
We haven't figured that out, but the
dark secret's been torturing you.

648
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:22,398
David, you can't turn me into a
grandmother. I still have my looks.

649
00:43:22,472 --> 00:43:25,373
I think the romance with Rod
balances that.

650
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:28,069
- Who plays him?
- He's an actor's actor.

651
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:29,975
Oh, no, no.

652
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:32,446
You're not gonna stick me
with that John Farbstein again...

653
00:43:32,515 --> 00:43:34,847
with the yellow teeth
and the long nose hair.

654
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:38,148
I'm not getting in bed with him.
Some people I don't get in bed with.

655
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:41,722
Sorry. I thought
this was my dressing room.

656
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:47,254
Hello, Celeste.

657
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:57,697
Maybe I should've sent a memo.

658
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:22,563
No, Rod, this is not the time.

659
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:26,159
We must think of the poor
deaf girl upstairs.

660
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:30,262
Good evening.

661
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:38,536
I'm Dr. Monica Demonico, the
neurosurgeon assigned to this case.

662
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,946
You must be Dr. Rod Randall.

663
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:44,145
So good of you to come
on such short notice.

664
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,917
The girl is going to be fine.
I trained in Europe.

665
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,787
Really?

666
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,623
Maggie, I know we've had
our differences in the past, but...

667
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:56,831
Maggie, I came as soon as I heard.
I was at the gym.

668
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,697
Father Cory told me about
your experience at the soup kitchen.

669
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,670
- Are you all right?
- Bolt?

670
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,831
I didn't realize you'd be here.

671
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:07,773
Well, I am.

672
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:13,146
Rod, I'd like you to meet
my husband Bolt.

673
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:15,548
Dr. Rad Rondall. Rod Randall.

674
00:45:15,618 --> 00:45:17,552
He's an old friend of the family.

675
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,056
He's been studying on the Continent.

676
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:40,837
Hello, Mother.

677
00:45:42,912 --> 00:45:45,005
I need a moment alone.

678
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:17,169
Maggie, I've thought
about nothing except...

679
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,043
what we once...

680
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,943
I'm sorry. I forgot the lines.

681
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:25,613
 - Can I do that again? 
- Are we still rolling?

682
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:28,248
 - Ready when you are. 
- I'm sorry. One more time.

683
00:46:28,324 --> 00:46:30,622
 We'll pick it up from the kiss. 

684
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,126
Right.

685
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,974
I've thought about nothing,
except what we once were.

686
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:51,070
How we...

687
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:54,913
Sorry. I just didn't
feel anything. One more time?

688
00:47:08,364 --> 00:47:11,891
I've thought about nothing except
what we once were. We made magic.

689
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:13,629
 That's a cut. 

690
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:15,898
That one was good for me.

691
00:47:20,076 --> 00:47:22,010
Special scene, sweetheart.

692
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:27,740
Don't you dare run away from me.
That was unprofessional.

693
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:31,810
That was? What was that crock
you were trying to pull on me?

694
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,913
I was trying to get the scene right.
You know I'm a perfectionist.

695
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:38,449
Things are hard for me right now
in life and on the show. Okay?

696
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:42,327
Things were hard for me 20 years ago
when you left me for dead!

697
00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:45,492
And you're back to return the favor?
This is some kind of revenge thing?

698
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:47,763
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm here for me!

699
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:51,000
I got a chance at a career,
and I'm not gonna blow it!

700
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:53,507
David's going to help me produce
my one-man  Hamlet  off-Broadway.

701
00:47:53,576 --> 00:47:55,771
The world is going
to rediscover a major talent.

702
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:57,142
You believe David?

703
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:02,949
Trying to get rid of me won't work.
I won't go back to Florida.

704
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:06,580
You try playing Willy Loman in front
of old farts eating meat loaf!

705
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,624
Chewing and slurping
and spitting out their pits.

706
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:12,820
Every night listening to them
coughing and hocking!

707
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:15,523
I was in hell!
Consigned there by you!

708
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:18,123
What happened to your career
was not my fault!

709
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,033
- That's not how I see it.
- If I hurt you, I'm really sorry.

710
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:24,163
- I was very young.
- Not anymore, babe.

711
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:28,675
What's your hurry anyway?
Gotta get to the mall?

712
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:48,887
Give them my best in Paramus.

713
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:54,125
Oh, yummy!

714
00:48:54,203 --> 00:48:55,636
With a spoon.

715
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:57,968
He's mine.
You touch, you die.

716
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,201
I wouldn't dream of it.
He's perfect for you.

717
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:08,830
Excuse me.
Can I join you?

718
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,703
I'm Lori Craven,
the homeless mute.

719
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:15,233
Of course. You speak beautifully
for a mute.

720
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:17,245
- Please.
- Thank you.

721
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,510
That was quite a scene
with you and Celeste.

722
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:24,678
Thank you.

723
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:27,518
No, I meant after, after.

724
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,356
Oh, that. Well, there's a bit
of history there, I'm afraid.

725
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:34,886
Yeah, she said you were
on the show in the old days.

726
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:37,398
"The old days." Yes.

727
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:40,903
So long ago that we had cigarette
commercials done by doctors.

728
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,665
Really?

729
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:47,339
- Could I ask you a small favor?
- Anything.

730
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,503
Give my aunt a break.

731
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,877
Gladly.
Who's your aunt?

732
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,848
Celeste is my aunt.

733
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,442
- Celeste is your aunt?
- Yeah.

734
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,819
I know this is none of my business,
but she feels threatened right now.

735
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,825
This place is crawling
with subplots.

736
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:06,760
So you're her niece.
The beautiful little mute.

737
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,298
I see the resemblance.
Of course.

738
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:10,957
Determined little chin.

739
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:14,026
Exactly! And the hands.

740
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:18,302
More expressive than Celeste's.
May I?

741
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,110
Hands say so much about a person.
Don't you think?

742
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:31,278
Tell me about your family again,
what they're like.

743
00:50:31,354 --> 00:50:34,983
You know. I've told you. You trying
to give me gas? Forget it.

744
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:37,356
Have you ever done anything
really horrible to them?

745
00:50:37,427 --> 00:50:40,225
Aside from naming my twins
Venus and Saturn...

746
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:43,163
which was grist for the mill
for ten years?

747
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,862
Ten years! And my mother
finally forgave me a year ago.

748
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:49,598
But she keeps bringing it up
at public holidays.

749
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:53,164
I should be taken out and shot
for what I've done to mine.

750
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:55,803
What are you talking about?
You've been great to Lori.

751
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:58,370
You've written her,
sent her presents.

752
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,011
What?

753
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:02,210
I don't know.

754
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:04,378
- Why are you crying?
- I don't know!

755
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:05,978
Then quit it!

756
00:51:06,055 --> 00:51:10,515
It's so great to have her here
living with me for these two weeks.

757
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:13,619
To have her to talk to.
We talk about anything.

758
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,927
Nothing. About the weather.
What we're going to wear.

759
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,035
She's grown up so nice,
don't you think?

760
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:22,503
- She's gorgeous.
- She's such a lady.

761
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:24,699
I'm so lucky!

762
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:27,402
Oh, Jesus.

763
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:29,502
- I'm going to get some flowers.
- Don't go.

764
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:32,275
What do you mean? Let me go.
You're standing in the street.

765
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,976
All right.
Don't worry about me.

766
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:52,496
What?

767
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:54,503
Tell the twins I love them.

768
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:57,631
Will you stop already?

769
00:51:57,707 --> 00:52:00,767
You want roses or carnations?

770
00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:02,812
Should give you poison ivy.

771
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:19,023
-It's Maggie from  The Sun Also Sets! 
-Would you sign this?

772
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:24,693
You think I should take
movement classes?

773
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,200
Absolutely important.

774
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:29,568
When I was in  Death of a Salesman, 
for instance...

775
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:31,971
You did  Death of a Salesman? 

776
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,669
God! Playing...

777
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:37,474
Willy. What can I say?

778
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:39,037
I'm very impressed.

779
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:43,108
- That sounds adolescent...
- It was in a nothing theater.

780
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:46,485
But all the time
I was obsessed with my hands.

781
00:52:46,556 --> 00:52:50,458
I made them feel
like salesmen's hands.

782
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:51,618
Really?

783
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:54,720
You mean manicured or clumsy?

784
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,355
Exactly.

785
00:52:56,432 --> 00:53:00,596
Hands that had written out
all those invoices.

786
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:03,565
Hands that reach out for Howard...

787
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,733
pleading for his job.

788
00:53:10,613 --> 00:53:12,877
Am I going too fast?
Just say so.

789
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:14,917
Jeffrey, I really like you.

790
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,679
You do?

791
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:18,186
Yes!

792
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:20,814
But the hand thing...

793
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,256
it started to sound rehearsed.

794
00:53:27,563 --> 00:53:28,996
Rehearsed?

795
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,334
Maybe I need new material.

796
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:35,963
I mean, talk.
Like ourselves.

797
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:43,811
- Would you like to have dinner?
- Yes.

798
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,475
- With me? Just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

799
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,077
 Why is Jeffrey back? 
 Rose, why is he back? 

800
00:53:51,154 --> 00:53:53,782
You've got to kill him off. Get him
out of town. Give him a disease.

801
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,518
I can't. The boys upstairs
are very happy about this.

802
00:53:56,592 --> 00:53:58,526
- Then I'll quit.
- Good idea.

803
00:53:58,594 --> 00:54:01,256
Oh, you know I won't quit.
Why do you say, "Good idea"?

804
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:04,323
I'm home! Hello!
Hi, Rose.

805
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,494
Hi, honey.
Did you have a nice evening?

806
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,504
He was very charming!

807
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:11,096
- Who?
-Jeffrey Anderson.

808
00:54:11,174 --> 00:54:13,734
Didn't I tell you
I was going out with him?

809
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,368
Oh, my God!

810
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:24,714
What is the matter?
What's the matter?

811
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,846
What do you mean, what's the matter?

812
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:30,757
- They went to dinner. So?
- He's not entitled to.

813
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:33,318
- Oh, God! God!
- She's a big girl.

814
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,591
She can defend herself.

815
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:38,691
You know, to the outside eye,
to the person...

816
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:41,669
who doesn't know what a forgiving,
wonderful person you can be...

817
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:44,070
this could look
like you're jealous.

818
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:48,200
How do your parents feel
about you living in this cesspool?

819
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:50,006
They're dead.

820
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,309
Oh, it's okay.

821
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:55,840
My grandma raised me,
and I've always had Aunt Celeste.

822
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:00,188
Aunt Celeste.

823
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:02,121
What?

824
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:06,685
I just have trouble imagining her
related to anyone...

825
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:08,424
you know, human.

826
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:21,266
-Celeste said to stay away from you.
-Really? Why?

827
00:55:21,344 --> 00:55:23,938
She said you were dangerous.

828
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:25,480
Really?

829
00:55:25,548 --> 00:55:27,482
Are you, Dr. Randall?

830
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:30,076
Only when I operate.

831
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:50,094
Good evening. I have an appointment
with Mr. Anderson.

832
00:55:50,173 --> 00:55:52,107
- Now?
- No, not now.

833
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:55,235
Tomorrow, actually.
I was just in the neighborhood.

834
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,245
Thought I would double-check.
He's in 11 -A?

835
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,473
2-D.

836
00:55:58,548 --> 00:56:00,709
2-D. Of course.

837
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:06,787
I was confusing it with my shrink.
He's in 11 -A.

838
00:56:06,856 --> 00:56:08,339
Another building, of course.

839
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:10,304
So, thanks a lot.

840
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,570
And see you tomorrow.

841
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:16,273
Probably in the morning.
Elevenish. You'll be here?

842
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:18,440
No, the day man will be on.

843
00:56:18,516 --> 00:56:22,043
Of course. They can't work you
24 hours a day.

844
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:32,018
Thank you very much.
I'll take good care of it.

845
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,802
Listen, I have something
I have to say.

846
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:42,897
What?

847
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:45,943
When I first asked you out...

848
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:49,173
I did it to make Celeste jealous.

849
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:50,680
I knew that.

850
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:53,308
You did?
But that's not the case anymore.

851
00:56:53,384 --> 00:56:56,114
- I genuinely like you.
- Good.

852
00:56:56,187 --> 00:56:59,122
- I really had fun hanging out.
- I like you a lot.

853
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,748
It was fun.

854
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:03,259
Good.

855
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,835
See you in surgery.

856
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:17,025
Jeffrey! Jeff!

857
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:19,194
Help me! Help!

858
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:27,234
You're kidding!

859
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:29,677
Jeffrey, please?

860
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,873
Knock it off!

861
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,254
I'm gonna call the police!
Be quiet!

862
00:58:40,491 --> 00:58:42,891
Oh, dear,
now look what you've done.

863
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,928
I hope you're wearing underwear.

864
00:58:45,997 --> 00:58:47,828
Dare I ask?

865
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,495
I'm lost? I'm not familiar
with the neighborhood?

866
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,504
You've got a nice view of it
from up here.

867
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,597
Here we go. I got you.

868
00:58:56,674 --> 00:58:58,642
Here we are.

869
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:02,304
I got you, I got you. Okay.

870
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,043
- My back!
- I got you. It's okay.

871
00:59:13,624 --> 00:59:15,717
You sure that's why you're here?

872
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:18,557
Get your hands off my...

873
00:59:18,629 --> 00:59:20,995
God, you're so disgusting!

874
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:28,963
Lori? Lori?

875
00:59:30,908 --> 00:59:34,036
Lori, get your clothes on!
Your aunt's here.

876
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,672
You lowlife, lecherous...

877
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,180
Lori!

878
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,584
She left ten minutes ago.

879
00:59:41,652 --> 00:59:43,916
Don't insult my intelligence.

880
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,061
Shit!

881
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:56,795
Why are you here?

882
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:59,098
This is my apartment.
I live here.

883
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,104
Why are you here?

884
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:05,575
I'll tell you why I'm here.
Oh, I'll tell you why I'm here!

885
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,271
I'm here because...

886
01:00:08,346 --> 01:00:10,507
Go on, say it.

887
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:12,811
- l...
- Go on, say it!

888
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:15,045
I want you, Jeffrey.

889
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,055
I'm consumed with jealousy for my
niece because I want you for myself.

890
01:00:19,123 --> 01:00:22,115
- Oh, please!
- Admit you have feelings for me.

891
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:25,356
I have feelings about you, not
for you. There's a big difference.

892
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:28,193
You're ashamed of them,
but you still have the feelings.

893
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:32,066
You realize what a mistake it was
throwing me out 110 years ago.

894
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:35,401
You're exactly the same. Even
for an actor, you're an egomaniac!

895
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:40,240
Of course. I've got America's
sweetheart climbing up my drainpipe!

896
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,973
I didn't know it was your drainpipe.
I thought it was someone else's.

897
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:45,106
No, you knew it was mine.
Your eyes, they're burning.

898
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,378
- I've got the flu!
- No, they're burning with passion.

899
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:50,011
- You're full of shit.
- Of course, but not about that!

900
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,057
There.
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

901
01:01:00,131 --> 01:01:01,564
Fine.

902
01:01:04,302 --> 01:01:06,236
Stay away from my niece.

903
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:20,248
- You'll be back!
- Like hell I will.

904
01:01:29,607 --> 01:01:32,599
So, she's jealous of the mute?
This'll kill her.

905
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:35,201
- Yeah. This is great.
- Next line.

906
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:39,306
Got it.
"Then Angelique says..."

907
01:01:39,383 --> 01:01:41,874
Angelique's a mute, okay?
Angelique grunts.

908
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,352
Yeah? Grunts?
I don't know about...

909
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:46,787
Then stage direction.

910
01:01:46,857 --> 01:01:50,224
Later. "Too weak to take another
step, Angelique collapses.

911
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:52,626
Dr. Randall..." later...
"Randall sweeps her into his arms...

912
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,425
and kisses her passionately."

913
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:57,365
Close-up. Fade to commercial.

914
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:59,493
- Go. Go!
- You know, this actually works.

915
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:03,702
 Let me just 
 get something straight. 

916
01:02:03,774 --> 01:02:07,266
 Isn't Celeste Talbert 
 Jeffrey Anderson's love interest? 

917
01:02:07,344 --> 01:02:11,713
Yes, but with the introduction
of the youthful Angelique...

918
01:02:11,782 --> 01:02:14,580
Lori Craven,
we have created a triangle.

919
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,984
And that allows us to explore
a contemporary theme...

920
01:02:17,054 --> 01:02:19,318
which is very close
to Miss Talbert's heart...

921
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,554
today's woman as she gets dried-up,
old and sexually undesirable.

922
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:25,686
It works.

923
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:29,363
Aren't you supposed
to be down there taping?

924
01:02:29,433 --> 01:02:32,766
- I'm not in the scene.
- Of course you're in the scene.

925
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,566
Maggie's gotta be there when they
discover Angelique's brain tumor.

926
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:39,439
- You paid for it.
- Rose, they told me I'm not in it.

927
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,002
- It's a new scene. I'm not in it.
- A new scene?

928
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,844
I didn't write any new scene.

929
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:55,689
The only way she'll find
her strength is if she tries.

930
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:58,694
- And if she falls, we're here.
- What is this?

931
01:02:58,762 --> 01:03:01,026
What are you doing?
I didn't write this.

932
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:05,462
Dr. Randall, it's no secret
what's going on here.

933
01:03:06,937 --> 01:03:09,201
What is this?
What are you doin' to me?

934
01:03:09,273 --> 01:03:11,673
Where's the goddamn script?

935
01:03:12,776 --> 01:03:16,405
Anyone can see it. You're falling
in love with Angelique...

936
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,278
deeply, wildly in love.

937
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,511
What about your Hippocratic oath?

938
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:25,112
I cannot stand by
and let this happen.

939
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:28,522
l, too, have an oath...
a nurse's oath.

940
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:31,459
A nurse's...
Oh, please. A nurse's oath?

941
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:35,123
You're out of line, Nurse Nan!
Besides, Angelique can read lips.

942
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:39,791
Yes.

943
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,511
Don't!

944
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,255
- Somebody help!
- Get off!

945
01:04:01,325 --> 01:04:04,260
- Celeste, will you...
- You're crazy. Get off me.

946
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:06,888
You can't kiss her!
Don't you dare kiss that girl!

947
01:04:06,964 --> 01:04:09,899
- You're on television!
- Are you out of your mind?

948
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:12,629
- Don't you dare!
- Get her off me! You're crazy!

949
01:04:12,703 --> 01:04:15,501
- You're nuts!
- Don't you dare kiss her.

950
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:18,507
- You can never kiss her!
- Of course I can kiss her!

951
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:22,238
Oh, this is ridiculous!
I can kiss who I want!

952
01:04:22,312 --> 01:04:25,611
No, you can't!
You can't kiss her!

953
01:04:25,682 --> 01:04:29,482
- Why? Because she's your niece?
- No, you nitwit!

954
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:34,855
Because she's my daughter
and your daughter.

955
01:04:34,925 --> 01:04:37,359
- What?
- What are you talking about?

956
01:04:37,428 --> 01:04:40,693
We're her parents... you and I.

957
01:04:40,764 --> 01:04:43,130
We're her mommy and her daddy.

958
01:04:50,874 --> 01:04:53,809
It was our fourth date.
Summer, 1970?

959
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:57,040
Shakespeare in the Park?
The bottle of Chardonnay?

960
01:04:57,114 --> 01:04:59,480
All's well that ends well.

961
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:11,093
- We're still rolling?
- Yeah. Fabulous.

962
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:15,427
I got pregnant,
and I was so young.

963
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:20,436
And the show made me sign a paper
saying I'd never mention the baby.

964
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:26,269
So I went home to Iowa,
and I had you.

965
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:29,244
And I gave you to Grandma
to raise.

966
01:05:29,313 --> 01:05:33,079
And I made up a twin sister, Simone,
who died in a car wreck...

967
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,914
said she was your actual mom.

968
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:38,682
And then the show
told everyone I had T.B...

969
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:42,851
and sent my character to
a sanitarium in Tierra del Fuego.

970
01:05:42,926 --> 01:05:45,087
Why can't I write shit
like this?

971
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:50,725
After I came back from having Lori,
I was terrible to you.

972
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:54,259
I know that. I know that.
All right?

973
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,272
I blamed you
for messing up my whole life...

974
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,605
so I had you written off the show
so you'd disappear.

975
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:02,440
And you did!

976
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:09,278
Now you're all back,
and I've ruined three lives!

977
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:11,981
Three lives!

978
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:15,582
Me, America's sweetheart!

979
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,495
Oh, God!

980
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:22,726
This is fuckin' great.

981
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:29,136
Pumpkin.

982
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:32,002
Oh, God.

983
01:06:34,778 --> 01:06:36,905
-Jeffrey.
- Stay away from me.

984
01:07:15,018 --> 01:07:16,485
That worked nicely.

985
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:19,647
Thanks for the scoop.
That was incredible.

986
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:25,770
Celeste was never more moving.
She was brilliant. She stays.

987
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:29,933
I do know
she's not gonna work with us.

988
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,050
Got a minute?

989
01:07:38,153 --> 01:07:40,815
- Mr. Barnes?
- Mr. Edwards...

990
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:43,983
Someone forget to tell me
about the meeting? I guess so.

991
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:47,892
Mr. Edwards,
what happened to Celeste was...

992
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:50,192
Brought on by a flagrant abuse
of prescription drugs.

993
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:53,530
Exactly. Thank you. We've had this
in the dark long enough, haven't we?

994
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:56,934
- What?
- She'll be fired by the end of day.

995
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:58,700
- Who said fired?
- He said.

996
01:07:58,773 --> 01:08:02,470
- We can't tolerate this behavior.
- Tolerate!

997
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:05,911
Could you tolerate the
one billion dollars of free press...

998
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,744
we're gonna get because
of what happened down there today?

999
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:13,277
The phone's been ringing off the
hook. We'll be on the evening news.

1000
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:16,949
The tabloids are going
to say "real-life soap opera."

1001
01:08:17,025 --> 01:08:20,017
Celeste is a bad-news buffet.

1002
01:08:20,094 --> 01:08:24,929
The people love her because she is
and always will be queen of misery.

1003
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:30,302
She's turned unstable,
and we can't...

1004
01:08:30,371 --> 01:08:32,896
Unstable? I'm stable.
Who wants to watch me on television?

1005
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:37,911
Unstable is her talent. She's been
through hell, and we're her family.

1006
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:41,506
- In a crisis, we must support her.
- Yeah.

1007
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,141
We have to love her.

1008
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:44,947
We have to care about her.

1009
01:08:45,019 --> 01:08:49,012
And we have to milk it for every
drop of publicity we can get.

1010
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,753
- I think it's a damn miracle.
- I'd say "amen."

1011
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:02,260
 - T.D.K. 
 - World Entertainment Network. 

1012
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:04,828
 Now, an amazing day in the life 
 of  The Sun Also Sets.

1013
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:09,275
 Celeste Talbert, America's 
 sweetheart, tells she's not sweet. 

1014
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:12,313
-  Don't you dare! 
-  Pin her wrists. 

1015
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:15,679
 You can't kiss her! 
 You can't ever kiss her! 

1016
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,308
God.

1017
01:09:18,386 --> 01:09:21,412
-  You can't ever kiss her! 
-  Of course I can kiss her! 

1018
01:09:21,489 --> 01:09:23,548
 I can kiss who I want! 

1019
01:09:27,462 --> 01:09:29,896
Lori, give us a smile.

1020
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:32,728
- Lori, over here.
- Look over here.

1021
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,530
Do it, Lori.

1022
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:42,568
Come on back.
Come on, Miss Craven.

1023
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:45,878
Come on.

1024
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:55,284
- Pose.
- Yeah.

1025
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:56,846
Lori, come on.

1026
01:10:00,562 --> 01:10:01,927
Do something. Come on.

1027
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:03,827
- Good.
- Yeah.

1028
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:09,495
Could I have your autograph,
Miss Talbert?

1029
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,205
Thank you.

1030
01:10:18,846 --> 01:10:20,677
 I was as shocked as you were. 

1031
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:24,844
I mean, I hope you don't think
that I really would've...

1032
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,648
I would've.

1033
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:29,952
Yes, well.
I mean, who wouldn't?

1034
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:33,357
- Luckily something held us back.
- Can you imagine?

1035
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:35,555
Yes, I can. I did.

1036
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,861
One more date, we would've
had a Greek tragedy on our hands.

1037
01:10:40,068 --> 01:10:42,127
Lori, l...

1038
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:46,604
My daughter, Lori. God!

1039
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:53,240
I just wanna say that...

1040
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:58,843
I know you must be feeling
incredibly strong emotions now...

1041
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,720
but I would like it very much
if the friendship we had...

1042
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:06,055
could phase...

1043
01:11:06,127 --> 01:11:09,927
into a father /daughter arrangement.

1044
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:12,865
- Yeah.
- Not right away. You must hate me.

1045
01:11:12,934 --> 01:11:15,960
- I don't hate you. I blame her.
- Good!

1046
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:19,097
- You had no idea.
- None!

1047
01:11:19,173 --> 01:11:21,141
Come in! It's open!

1048
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:27,512
Great. Family reunion.

1049
01:11:27,582 --> 01:11:30,346
We should take out some pictures.

1050
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,055
We can speak later, Lori.

1051
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,193
Sweetie.

1052
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:47,627
Nothing has happened
that can't be made better.

1053
01:11:48,703 --> 01:11:52,161
Nothing has happened? You've
been deceiving me for 20 years...

1054
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,937
in the most unbelievably calculated
fashion, and nothing has happened?

1055
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,205
God. You don't know
how sorry I am.

1056
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:00,645
- I haven't slept a wink.
- Try sleeping pills.

1057
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:03,183
Yeah. Well, that's a good idea.

1058
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:06,584
I know I've been deceitful,
but I had my reasons.

1059
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:09,885
Maybe they were dumb reasons,
but they were reasons.

1060
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:12,892
Hell. I'm not a genius;
I'm just a working actress.

1061
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:20,357
I never said I was the best mother
in the world.

1062
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:23,199
Give me a little credit, will you,
credit for being someone...

1063
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:27,867
who tried to love you
the only way she knew how.

1064
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,475
I know that speech.

1065
01:12:32,246 --> 01:12:35,010
- You do?
- It was the Thanksgiving show...

1066
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:37,813
when Maggie
meets Bolt's blind nephew.

1067
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:40,217
Oh, God.

1068
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:44,252
- Get out.
- Please try to understand.

1069
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:48,056
- I don't give a shit.
- No need to use that language.

1070
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:49,892
Get out!

1071
01:12:54,268 --> 01:12:55,701
Now!

1072
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:11,214
They love her. It's a phenomenon.
This is a nightmare.

1073
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:14,379
You promised me you would
get rid of Celeste!

1074
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:16,946
We were both naked,
and you promised!

1075
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:19,618
- Naked!
- Hey, we were never naked.

1076
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:21,491
We could've been!

1077
01:13:21,562 --> 01:13:24,929
Not only didn't you get rid
of Celeste, you created Lori...

1078
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:26,694
this ingenue from hell!

1079
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:30,363
She has more lines than I do,
and she's a goddamn mute!

1080
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:33,874
- Whoa, whoa! Not anymore.
- Not anymore what?

1081
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:37,143
- Not any more lines?
- Not any more mute.

1082
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,207
Word from upstairs. Next week, she
recovers her voice and speaks again.

1083
01:13:42,316 --> 01:13:45,217
You're shitting me, right?
She'll take over the show.

1084
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:48,813
- What can I say?
- You're enjoying this.

1085
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:51,256
I'm not enjoying this. It's great
for me. The ratings are flying.

1086
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:53,486
Well, it ain't good for me!

1087
01:13:56,464 --> 01:13:59,900
We need to talk. Look, I don't care
what Tawny Miller says...

1088
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:03,027
this hat makes me look
like that goddamn Tweety Bird.

1089
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,697
Do you mind?

1090
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:09,800
You, you're asking me to leave?

1091
01:14:09,877 --> 01:14:13,244
That's right.
I'm asking you to leave.

1092
01:14:15,016 --> 01:14:17,750
Miss Moorehead, may Miss Craven
and I have a moment alone, please?

1093
01:14:24,957 --> 01:14:27,323
No problem.

1094
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:29,327
I'm a professional.

1095
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:32,897
I do things professionally.

1096
01:14:38,071 --> 01:14:40,631
I hate you!
I hate you, you pig!

1097
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:51,947
- She's got a lot of spirit.
- She's a deranged bitch.

1098
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:55,681
I couldn't agree more.
About the hat...

1099
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:08,827
I have been very patient, God.

1100
01:15:10,002 --> 01:15:13,130
This is my moment.
I have to seize it.

1101
01:15:15,174 --> 01:15:17,699
I know you'll understand.

1102
01:15:23,616 --> 01:15:26,278
- Can I talk to you?
- No. I'm going to work.

1103
01:15:26,352 --> 01:15:29,412
It's about Lori. I don't
expect you to be nice to me.

1104
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:32,219
I don't expect you to forgive me.
What I did was horrible.

1105
01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:38,023
Dinner theater is horrible. Doing
hemorrhoid commercials is horrible.

1106
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:41,430
-There are not words for your deeds.
-But this isn't about me.

1107
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:44,264
- What's it about?
- It's about Lori.

1108
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:47,931
You have to talk to her.
She won't talk to me.

1109
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:50,567
She'll talk to you.
She needs you, Jeffrey.

1110
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:52,873
- You're her father.
- I can't be in the same room.

1111
01:15:52,945 --> 01:15:55,243
I don't know how to be a father.
I don't know how to behave!

1112
01:15:55,314 --> 01:15:57,646
- Sure you do.
- What would I do? What would I say?

1113
01:15:57,717 --> 01:16:00,015
You go to her door
and knock on it.

1114
01:16:00,086 --> 01:16:04,045
- And say what?
- Say, "Hi, Lori. It's your dad."

1115
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:09,492
- I can't do that!
- Do it! Try it!

1116
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:12,030
Lori, open up. It's your dad.

1117
01:16:12,098 --> 01:16:15,397
Don't do it like that.
Use your real voice.

1118
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:24,008
- Hi, Lori. It's your dad.
- Yes.

1119
01:16:24,076 --> 01:16:25,771
- Felt good. Now what?
- Yes.

1120
01:16:25,845 --> 01:16:28,905
You step in the room, and you say...

1121
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:31,609
"I know I haven't been here
for you before...

1122
01:16:31,684 --> 01:16:35,051
but I am your father,
and I'm here for you now."

1123
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,191
I know I haven't
been here for you before...

1124
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,058
but I am your father,
and I'm here for you now.

1125
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:48,327
- Yes. Yes.
- Now what?

1126
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:52,667
And then cross to her,
put your arm around her...

1127
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:55,605
hold her... yes.

1128
01:17:02,315 --> 01:17:06,547
The rocking is great.
Keep the rocking.

1129
01:17:06,619 --> 01:17:11,022
And then say,
"Everything will be okay."

1130
01:17:13,659 --> 01:17:15,320
Everything will be okay.

1131
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:19,559
Really?

1132
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:24,091
- Did you believe it?
- Yes.

1133
01:17:25,705 --> 01:17:27,639
Then it will.

1134
01:17:30,977 --> 01:17:32,638
Hi, guys.

1135
01:17:35,381 --> 01:17:38,839
Excuse me for a second.
This is kind of important.

1136
01:17:38,918 --> 01:17:43,821
I am such a ninny. I left my scarf
at your place the other night.

1137
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:46,358
Could you bring it in tomorrow?

1138
01:17:50,596 --> 01:17:53,292
- What?
- I was right.

1139
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,491
- You'll be a superb father.
- Wait a minute.

1140
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:58,833
You don't actually believe
that I slept with her?

1141
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:01,703
I think you'd sleep with anybody,
but, God, Montana?

1142
01:18:01,774 --> 01:18:04,072
- I feel nauseous.
- You wanna believe it, believe it.

1143
01:18:04,143 --> 01:18:06,668
It's none of your business anyhow.
Just get out of my life!

1144
01:18:06,746 --> 01:18:09,214
Wait one minute. This is my life.
You get out.

1145
01:18:09,282 --> 01:18:11,512
I'm going nowhere, babe.
Get used to it.

1146
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:22,488
Ready on two. Take three.

1147
01:18:22,562 --> 01:18:23,824
I mean two.

1148
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:26,925
Dear Angelique.

1149
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:29,024
 Dear Angelique. 

1150
01:18:30,136 --> 01:18:32,604
-  Dear Angelique. 
- I produce a soap opera.

1151
01:18:32,672 --> 01:18:34,071
David, look.

1152
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:39,237
- She's shitting all over Celeste.
- I know. It's very exciting.

1153
01:18:40,346 --> 01:18:42,280
...inspires us all.

1154
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:46,881
-  That's a cut. 
- For Christ's sake!

1155
01:18:46,953 --> 01:18:49,387
I can't believe I'm having
to put up with this.

1156
01:18:49,455 --> 01:18:52,618
- Goddamn it. Don't think of it.
- Excuse me, Miss Talbert.

1157
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:57,152
- You and Jeffrey Anderson?
- It's something I couldn't hide.

1158
01:18:57,229 --> 01:19:00,027
It was important for me
to come forward.

1159
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,762
Important as an actress...

1160
01:19:03,836 --> 01:19:06,964
as a woman and as a personality.

1161
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:10,875
- Have you got a light?
- I don't.

1162
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:13,207
I need a light.
Why won't anyone give me a light?

1163
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:16,271
- There you are.
- Rose! Rose, are you talking to me?

1164
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:18,544
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, yeah.

1165
01:19:18,618 --> 01:19:21,416
- Have you got a light?
- Yeah.

1166
01:19:21,487 --> 01:19:23,284
- I guess I deserve this pain.
- What am I doing?

1167
01:19:23,356 --> 01:19:25,824
I guess it's God's will.
I don't know how long I can take it.

1168
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:28,416
Show after show after show, and...

1169
01:19:33,332 --> 01:19:35,960
- That pig.
- Which one?

1170
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:42,070
- Bitch.
- It's horseshit!

1171
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:44,302
- What else are you gonna say?
- Listen to me.

1172
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:47,346
- Please, will you just hear me out?
- No! You're disgusting.

1173
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:51,076
You run around
with your fly open like a...

1174
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:54,415
Eww! You are my father! For
God's sake, will you act like it?

1175
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:57,854
I'm not surprised.
Montana is desperate for publicity.

1176
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,289
You're not surprised.
I'm surprised.

1177
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:02,293
I feel that
I should be a part of this.

1178
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:05,196
- Oh, God.
- Great.

1179
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:07,755
You people have the morals
of guinea pigs.

1180
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:10,768
How could you?

1181
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:13,430
You? Moralizing? Please!

1182
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:17,499
- Hasn't she been through enough?
- Don't you dare take my side.

1183
01:20:22,348 --> 01:20:27,376
- How could you do that to her?
- I never touched Montana Moorehead.

1184
01:20:27,453 --> 01:20:30,422
But if you don't believe me, don't.
I don't care.

1185
01:20:30,489 --> 01:20:32,980
My career has suffered other slings
and arrows, and you know what?

1186
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:35,459
I survived them.
I'll survive this too.

1187
01:20:35,528 --> 01:20:38,361
You know what I'll do?
I'll take my  Hamlet  up to Canada.

1188
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:42,800
They always loved me in Canada.
What an awful picture! Jesus!

1189
01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:45,063
I've never worked in an atmosphere
like this before.

1190
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:48,368
This pregnancy thing is a scam.
I resent being treated like a leper.

1191
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:51,308
Having to work with those two
is a personal nightmare for me.

1192
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:54,813
- I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
- I'm on the verge of a breakdown.

1193
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,840
- I could have a breakdown.
- Imagine facing them every day.

1194
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:05,050
It seems to get harder and harder,
and I devoted my life to this show.

1195
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:11,256
Mr. Edwards, it's them or me.

1196
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,356
That is the bottom line here.
They go, or I go.

1197
01:21:14,433 --> 01:21:17,061
This is the toughest decision
I've ever had to make...

1198
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:21,903
but I get paid 1 .2 million dollars
to make these kind of decisions...

1199
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:23,908
so here it is.

1200
01:21:27,913 --> 01:21:29,346
Yeah?

1201
01:21:32,952 --> 01:21:35,682
- Dr. Demonico?
- Can we talk?

1202
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:44,660
...and airs this weekend,
so check your local listings.

1203
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:48,131
Now, the real-life soap opera
that has been  The Sun Also Sets... 

1204
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,761
will come to a unique climax
as today's live broadcast...

1205
01:21:51,837 --> 01:21:55,671
reveals whether Celeste Talbert,
Lori Craven or Jeffrey Anderson...

1206
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,038
will remain on the show.

1207
01:21:57,109 --> 01:22:00,738
 You mean to say that even the actors 
 themselves don't know the outcome? 

1208
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:04,408
That's correct. As they read
their lines off the TelePrompter...

1209
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,974
You've worked with these...
they will learn their fate.

1210
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:09,953
Given the incredible interest
in the outcome of this broadcast...

1211
01:22:10,022 --> 01:22:15,050
This will be the highest-rated show
in daytime history...

1212
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:17,357
we figure that our viewers
deserve the utmost spontaneity.

1213
01:22:58,568 --> 01:23:00,832
Hello, David. Sit down.

1214
01:23:00,903 --> 01:23:04,339
We'll play tennis this weekend.
You'll come to my country club.

1215
01:23:04,407 --> 01:23:06,602
You never been there, right?
It's a nice place.

1216
01:23:06,676 --> 01:23:08,405
Great, great.

1217
01:23:21,023 --> 01:23:25,483
And in three, two, one...

1218
01:23:25,561 --> 01:23:27,358
And in.

1219
01:23:32,468 --> 01:23:34,800
Would you be having wine
with your dinner?

1220
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:39,331
She'll have a Diet Pepsi.

1221
01:23:39,408 --> 01:23:41,535
I'll have a dry sherry.

1222
01:23:44,547 --> 01:23:47,107
- Hold those. I can't wear 'em.
- I think you'll need them.

1223
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:48,912
- They're ugly!
- You're on.

1224
01:23:48,985 --> 01:23:51,818
Go, go, go!

1225
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:54,550
Oh, my God.
This guy's as blind as a bat.

1226
01:23:56,859 --> 01:24:00,886
Dr. Randall, what a surprise.
Are you having lunch here?

1227
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:03,625
Well, I will if it's that simple.

1228
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,904
I wish it was that simple.

1229
01:24:09,972 --> 01:24:12,202
This guy never heard
of contact lenses?

1230
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:15,506
-  The test results have come back. 
-  And? 

1231
01:24:15,578 --> 01:24:19,639
And I'm afraid
the results are very disturbing.

1232
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:25,410
It seems that Angelique
has a rare case...

1233
01:24:26,088 --> 01:24:28,022
of brake fluid.

1234
01:24:30,693 --> 01:24:33,355
- Bran fluid. Bran flavor.
- Brain fever.

1235
01:24:33,429 --> 01:24:34,987
- Brain fever.
- Say it!

1236
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:36,998
- Brain fever.
- Yes.

1237
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:43,171
Brain fever.
Or what we call in Austria...

1238
01:24:55,618 --> 01:24:59,611
At the current rate of inflation...

1239
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:03,352
her brain will
laterally explore the...

1240
01:25:03,426 --> 01:25:05,690
- Literally explode.
- Exactly.

1241
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:08,457
- Within the next three houses.
- Hours.

1242
01:25:09,398 --> 01:25:13,198
Yes. It will literally explode
within the next three hours.

1243
01:25:13,269 --> 01:25:15,635
I would suggest
leaving the restraint.

1244
01:25:15,705 --> 01:25:18,299
- The restaurant.
- Restaurant.

1245
01:25:18,374 --> 01:25:19,773
Yes.

1246
01:25:20,843 --> 01:25:23,403
Her brain will actually explode?

1247
01:25:25,581 --> 01:25:29,039
Yes. I've seen it happen.

1248
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:32,781
It's a dreadful...
It's a dreadful, dreadful thug.

1249
01:25:33,789 --> 01:25:35,723
Thing.

1250
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,089
And afterwards...

1251
01:25:39,829 --> 01:25:42,821
I'm sorry, Angelique. I really am.

1252
01:25:42,898 --> 01:25:44,832
I hope it's not too painful.

1253
01:25:46,369 --> 01:25:47,961
She's trying to say something.

1254
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:51,729
- She is?
- Yes, she is.

1255
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:54,503
- What's she saying?
- "Can't anything be done?"

1256
01:25:54,577 --> 01:25:57,068
- Can't anything be done?
- Yes. Cold compresses?

1257
01:25:57,146 --> 01:25:59,512
No, I'm sorry.
They don't work with  Kopfgeschlagen. 

1258
01:25:59,582 --> 01:26:00,776
Miracle drugs?

1259
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:06,688
- Nurse Nan!
- I came as soon as I heard the news.

1260
01:26:06,756 --> 01:26:09,657
There's a nurse in the restaurant.
Did I miss a meeting?

1261
01:26:09,725 --> 01:26:12,353
I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

1262
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:15,625
What about a brain transplant?

1263
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:18,929
A brain transplant?

1264
01:26:20,336 --> 01:26:22,861
Yes! A brain transplant!

1265
01:26:23,706 --> 01:26:28,302
But it's far too late
to find a suitable donor.

1266
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:30,470
I'm the donor. Take my brain.

1267
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:32,673
I want to do it. She can't die.

1268
01:26:32,748 --> 01:26:36,616
- You both could die.
- That won't happen while I'm here.

1269
01:26:36,686 --> 01:26:38,813
It's impossible.
I haven't any tools.

1270
01:26:38,888 --> 01:26:41,220
- Voila.
- Well done.

1271
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:44,522
- Dr. Rod?
- Yes?

1272
01:26:44,593 --> 01:26:47,653
I insist that
we proceed immediately.

1273
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:50,494
- But you need to sign a release.
- I did.

1274
01:26:50,566 --> 01:26:52,534
- You did not! When?
- I did too! Weeks ago.

1275
01:26:52,601 --> 01:26:54,068
- I never saw it.
- On your desk.

1276
01:26:54,136 --> 01:26:56,764
I don't think you realize
how serious this operation is.

1277
01:26:56,839 --> 01:27:01,242
It's very serious. You will not
have a brain when it is complete.

1278
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:04,143
I don't want my brain. I don't
need it. Take the goddamn thing.

1279
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:05,703
It's gone.

1280
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:07,749
All right, everyone!
Clear the restaurant!

1281
01:27:07,817 --> 01:27:10,217
They're ad-libbing, David.
I never heard these words.

1282
01:27:10,286 --> 01:27:11,810
This is not in the script.
Get David.

1283
01:27:11,887 --> 01:27:13,149
- It's busy.
- Try it again.

1284
01:27:13,222 --> 01:27:16,714
Wait, wait. It's not bad.
Let me look.

1285
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:19,556
This is for the best.

1286
01:27:19,628 --> 01:27:20,822
Follow them.

1287
01:27:20,963 --> 01:27:22,692
Clear the way right away!

1288
01:27:22,765 --> 01:27:27,361
Nurse Nan, up here.
Sterilize the area.

1289
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:31,572
Where do you want me?

1290
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,767
Trust me.
I've performed this before...

1291
01:27:33,843 --> 01:27:36,573
in worse circumstances than this.

1292
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:39,580
- Prepare the brain saw.
- At last! Drama!

1293
01:27:43,486 --> 01:27:46,387
There was a time when I would've
performed this with my bare hands.

1294
01:27:46,455 --> 01:27:48,946
- I know it.
- But now...

1295
01:27:49,024 --> 01:27:50,423
What?

1296
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:54,657
You're really positive about this?

1297
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,927
- It's a lot to give up.
- I want to.

1298
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,661
It's a relief.

1299
01:28:00,736 --> 01:28:02,727
Very well.

1300
01:28:02,805 --> 01:28:04,739
Prepare the ether.

1301
01:28:06,275 --> 01:28:11,212
Good night, sweet princess.

1302
01:28:36,472 --> 01:28:37,404
Saw.

1303
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,849
Mother! No!
I can't let you do this!

1304
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:50,783
- She spoke.
- She spoke!

1305
01:28:50,853 --> 01:28:52,844
Sudden speech...
the last stages of brain fever.

1306
01:28:52,922 --> 01:28:55,857
- She could blow at any moment.
- I could always speak.

1307
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:57,222
- Mother...
- She's my mother.

1308
01:28:57,293 --> 01:29:00,194
- Montana, shut up!
- Now this is a show.

1309
01:29:00,262 --> 01:29:03,060
We gotta stop this right now.

1310
01:29:03,132 --> 01:29:06,416
It's hypnotic.
It's like a truth serum.

1311
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,849
 Celeste, don't leave the show. 
 I can't live with that. 

1312
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,820
You either, Dad.

1313
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,253
- Dad?
- Dad.

1314
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:15,188
- Dad.
- Yes.

1315
01:29:15,258 --> 01:29:19,854
- Shortly before I left Vienna, l...
-Jeffrey, give it a rest.

1316
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:29,565
What are you saying? That you
might want us for real in life?

1317
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,368
- I think so.
- You do?

1318
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:32,806
Yeah.

1319
01:29:33,877 --> 01:29:36,175
But here's what I don't want.

1320
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,737
I don't want any more lying.

1321
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,113
I don't want any pretending...

1322
01:29:41,184 --> 01:29:44,119
or deception of any kind.

1323
01:29:44,187 --> 01:29:46,781
And I need some time.

1324
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,626
- Can you understand?
- Completely.

1325
01:30:08,545 --> 01:30:10,672
Wait! Wait!

1326
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:13,307
But I'm carrying his child.

1327
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:15,783
I didn't sleep with her!

1328
01:30:15,852 --> 01:30:18,548
Will somebody please believe me!

1329
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:20,715
This is what I meant.

1330
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,488
This is what I told them to do.
This is soap opera.

1331
01:30:25,095 --> 01:30:28,360
- Doctor!
- A second opinion.

1332
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:35,265
This is Dr. Franz Blau of the sex
change clinic in Bethesda, Maryland.

1333
01:30:35,338 --> 01:30:39,399
Thank you. Dr. Randall,
after extensive investigation...

1334
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:42,639
I've come to the conclusion
that it's virtually impossible...

1335
01:30:42,712 --> 01:30:47,206
for you to have impregnated
your nurse, Montana Moorehead...

1336
01:30:47,284 --> 01:30:50,253
because before
she came to our little clinic...

1337
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,413
she was...

1338
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:56,687
Milton Moorehead
of Syosset, Long Island.

1339
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,227
Hello.

1340
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,111
She's a boy.

1341
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:21,079
Yeah, well, we knew that.

1342
01:31:22,152 --> 01:31:23,642
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1343
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,881
I'm just gonna go
congratulate the others.

1344
01:31:25,956 --> 01:31:27,947
I'll see ya.

1345
01:31:29,059 --> 01:31:30,549
She's a boy.

1346
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:36,556
I think I've said it all, don't you?
Bye-bye.

1347
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:50,045
- Dr. Randall.
- Yes?

1348
01:31:52,082 --> 01:31:55,745
I wish to apologize for
any insinuation I might've made...

1349
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:58,287
about you and Nurse Nan.

1350
01:31:58,355 --> 01:32:00,516
- I told you.
- Well, I'm apologizing.

1351
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,353
Thank you.

1352
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:27,612
The best supporting actress in
a daytime drama award goes to...

1353
01:32:30,387 --> 01:32:31,445
Lori Craven.

1354
01:34:08,942 --> 01:34:12,036
If I could just get you right here.
A few words for your fans at home.

1355
01:34:12,112 --> 01:34:14,808
Another big night for you,
David Seton Barnes...

1356
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:18,215
winner of this year's
Johnny Hockard's Humanitarian Award.

1357
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:20,480
I know.
I mean, what a magical year.

1358
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:23,785
It's hard for me to take credit.
The whole thing just snowballed.

1359
01:34:23,857 --> 01:34:26,849
Well, you're certainly the man
of the hour. Congratulations to you.

1360
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:29,452
It all makes for a storybook ending
to a rather tumultuous year...

1361
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,862
for the cast here
at  The Sun Also Sets... 

1362
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:35,891
a show in which life not only
imitated art, it topped it.
