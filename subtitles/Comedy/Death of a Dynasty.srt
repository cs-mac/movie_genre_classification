1
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,690
1922. Colonial Vietnam.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,126
The long-standing French
occupation of the country

3
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:56,562
has inflamed
anti-French sentiments.

4
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,591
At the height of the conflict,

5
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,636
resistance forces
emerge in many towns

6
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:03,864
to drive out the foreign invaders.

7
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:09,201
In response, the French employed
elite units of Vietnamese agents

8
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,939
to track and destroy these rebels.

9
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,217
Return Indochina back to its people!

10
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,845
We, the Vo Trong Canh rebellion,

11
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,755
hereby convict the French Indochina
Secretary of Security

12
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:26,293
for the crime of invasion,

13
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,989
and call for his execution.

14
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,450
"The Frightfulness."

15
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:07,722
So what?

16
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,354
You have to see for yourself.

17
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,568
It can spit out a firestorm

18
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:17,104
and level this city
in the blink of an eye.

19
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:20,505
It's a piece of junk against the rebels.

20
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,635
With the secretary soft-handling
these rebels,

21
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:26,374
full-scale war is inevitable.

22
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,780
It shows what people want,

23
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,909
but the sky is out of reach

24
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:32,851
if you're trapped at the bottom of a well.

25
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,617
That's why they need men
like you and I.

26
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,558
Do you really think the French
can kill all the rebels with this?

27
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:41,323
The way you talk,

28
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:43,421
we may as well join them.

29
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:46,160
Among us, you resemble them most.

30
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,334
Cuong,
you're a smooth talker.

31
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,805
Why don't you go ask the rebels

32
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:56,037
to join forces with us?

33
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,908
The simplest solution is

34
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,776
to cut off all their heads,

35
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,873
gather them up,

36
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,077
and set an example for once.

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,437
Vo Trong Canh's band of rebels

38
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,694
Excuse me.
Where's the train station?

39
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:51,688
I don't know.

40
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,758
A man like you doesn't know?

41
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,167
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,296
Sorry to have bothered you.

43
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,521
Drive straight through!

44
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,274
Freeze!

45
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,709
Put the gun down.

46
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:51,610
Put it down!

47
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,924
What a surprise.

48
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,678
What are you
standing over there for?

49
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,009
What the hell is wrong with you?

50
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:05,215
Where is your father's hideout?

51
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:06,988
Fess up.

52
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,232
Where's the hideout?

53
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:19,672
Be a good girl.

54
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,072
Tell me.

55
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,845
Only cowards torture women.

56
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:31,110
I've had enough of her.

57
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,245
She has no manners.

58
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,528
Secret Police Headquarters

59
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,398
<i>This is the third recent assassination.</i>

60
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,364
De Canh...

61
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,198
has no respect for the French.

62
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,766
He's a coward.

63
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,008
He is nothing.

64
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,545
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

65
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,055
And this?
Also nothing?

66
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,463
I imagine if my father was a drunk,

67
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,366
completely stripped of all his rank,

68
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,463
I'd feel like
a complete failure as well.

69
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,201
What a pity

70
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,937
that children are incapable
of killing their fathers.

71
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,073
I've been here for 10 years.

72
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,346
I'm waiting for the day

73
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,478
I can go home.

74
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,393
But once I'm gone,

75
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,192
they'll need someone
to take my post.

76
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,098
Bring me De Canh's head.

77
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:01,608
Prove to me you're not
the imbecile your father was.

78
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,969
Tell me, child.

79
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:09,244
Tell me, and the pain
will go away.

80
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,308
Where is he?

81
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,383
Where's daddy's hideout?

82
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,960
No?

83
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,290
Mute?

84
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:22,351
Stubborn?

85
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,658
What are you doing?

86
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,168
Who's in command here?

87
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,361
Who?

88
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,707
Do you need smelling salts
to wake her up?

89
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,020
That's enough.

90
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,124
Stay still.

91
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,683
Put the gun down.

92
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,661
Put it down!

93
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,935
You knew in advance.

94
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,138
About what?

95
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:19,804
The assassination.

96
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:27,979
Where's your proof?

97
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:32,254
I saw you shoot the assassin
before he made a move.

98
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,419
Good.

99
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,527
I'm impressed.

100
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,593
- So what?
- Hey, we're all brothers here.

101
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,899
I don't have to
tell you everything.

102
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:50,142
Derue will see right through you.

103
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,974
You threatening me?

104
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,445
You let them kill
the secretary for what?

105
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:04,013
- To catch a few rebels?
- That's it.

106
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,390
Good question.

107
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,928
Sit down.

108
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,396
Sit down!

109
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,843
None have made it out alive.

110
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,923
Your father and his men
will live in peace and prosperity

111
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:15,224
if he surrenders.

112
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,195
And become traitors like you?

113
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,117
Where have you been?

114
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,157
When blood is spilled,

115
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:21,423
it makes heroes out of men.

116
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,557
How can a killer find peace?

117
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,498
You're not a killer.

118
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,934
You're an officer of the law.

119
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:38,107
What do you know
about De Canh?

120
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,875
That roach is still alive?

121
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:45,112
Kill a man like him and
a hundred more would rise.

122
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,586
The Emperor

123
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,921
was once worshipped like a god,

124
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:56,362
but now he's just
a puppet of the French.

125
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,560
You must see their power
and their knowledge

126
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:03,103
and aspire to it yourself.

127
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,968
It was the French
that took your power.

128
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,669
Now they steal your soul
with this opium.

129
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,871
They gave me a noble son.

130
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,937
You're wrong!

131
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,813
Mother was the one
who gave you a son.

132
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,812
If you see it that way,

133
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,719
then do as I say

134
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,724
for your mother's sake

135
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,817
and not for mine.

136
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,092
All this time

137
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:33,065
did you ever love Mom?

138
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,902
The most precious thing
in this world

139
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,004
<i>is a woman's love.</i>

140
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,805
<i>Never disappoint her</i>

141
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,249
<i>like I have disappointed
your mother.</i>

142
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,074
Scared?

143
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,423
...must accept capital punishment...

144
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,519
There are worse things
than death.

145
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,324
Of course.

146
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:11,331
But I need you alive.

147
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,902
This is a trap.

148
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,995
And I'm the bait
to catch my father.

149
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:21,903
You're smart,
but that's a turnoff.

150
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,804
My father will kill
every last one of you!

151
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,898
<i>Before your mother
passed away,</i>

152
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,697
<i>she made me promise her...</i>

153
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,671
<i>not to let you fight this war.</i>

154
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,104
<i>I failed her.</i>

155
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,400
There are worse things than death.

156
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,442
Like losing a daughter.

157
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,679
Your sacrifice
won't save your father.

158
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,114
There is a mole
in your organization.

159
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:12,618
Remember the death
of the rickshaw coolie?

160
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,857
Six guards,
two French officers,

161
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,516
and a sharpshooter.

162
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,150
Why are you doing this?

163
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:21,785
Does it matter?

164
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,955
You have nothing to lose.

165
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,882
Open the door.

166
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,396
Hold it.

167
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,237
Put yourself over there.
Turn around.

168
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,128
Open it!

169
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,227
Do as she says.
Open the door.

170
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,368
Next.

171
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,643
Stop!

172
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,268
Cover the perimeter!

173
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,173
What's this?

174
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:25,438
She escaped, sir.

175
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:26,740
Find her!

176
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:29,715
Yes, sir.
Get the dogs.

177
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,841
Come with me.

178
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:54,131
Where are we?

179
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:56,337
Safest place in the city.

180
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:19,823
I'll get you another outfit.

181
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,026
Who is the mole?
Tell me!

182
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,129
If I'd known, the assassination
wouldn't have happened.

183
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,506
And they wouldn't have
had you to bait your father.

184
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:34,035
So what's the trick?

185
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,810
If you think this is a trick,
then why did you escape?

186
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:39,148
What choices do I have?

187
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,055
We don't always
have that luxury.

188
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,916
Except you.

189
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,831
Why are you helping me?

190
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,629
There is still a chance for you,
your father and his men.

191
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,431
Why do you care about us?

192
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:01,340
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

193
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,134
Let's hear it.

194
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:10,976
I'm tired of all the bloodshed.

195
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,186
Haven't you had enough?

196
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:17,712
And now you want redemption?

197
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:26,395
I just want to live
in peace and order.

198
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,499
By killing your own people?

199
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:37,099
Murderers must be punished.

200
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,407
"Murderers"?

201
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:42,505
These "murderers" are only
fighting for their homeland.

202
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,517
In my eyes you're the murderer!

203
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,055
If you feel this way,

204
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:02,226
you can take retribution
for your friends now.

205
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,980
This is too easy for you.

206
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,713
You have to live
and face your own guilt.

207
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,025
There is a manhunt out there.

208
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,963
I have to inform my father
about the mole.

209
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,298
You'll need me
to get out of the city.

210
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,264
Long night?

211
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:07,345
Where is your loyal servant?

212
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,890
Looking for this?

213
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,387
Of all the beautiful women
you could have,

214
00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:25,720
you betrayed me
for this bitch.

215
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,921
Sy!

216
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,780
We have to lose this car.

217
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:09,626
I need a tax I D card.

218
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:22,169
You're putting everyone at risk.

219
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:24,574
Just help me.
Finish those IDs.

220
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:27,204
You think it's that simple?

221
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,747
That's why I need you.

222
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,015
Tell me the truth.
Why are you doing this?

223
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,181
Do you know what it feels like

224
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:39,088
to shoot somebody?

225
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:42,959
I know I can't change your mind,

226
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:45,088
but remember this-

227
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,424
if you do this,

228
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,026
there's no turning back.

229
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:56,005
Also, you and the girl

230
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,704
were never here today.

231
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,642
I need to do one more thing.

232
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:06,709
But I don't have time.

233
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:09,016
Give me 10 minutes.
It's about my father.

234
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:11,713
Give me my papers.

235
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:17,053
I have become a wanted man.

236
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:21,166
This could be the last time
I see my father.

237
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,215
I have to leave the city.

238
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,220
I don't know when I'll be back.

239
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:49,625
Make me proud, son.

240
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:55,092
No matter what I do,

241
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:57,693
it will never make up
for what you did to Mother.

242
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:23,861
That way!

243
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:29,064
Did you see the girl?

244
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,602
Has anyone seen the girl?

245
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,533
Stop right there!

246
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,336
Hands in the air!

247
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:04,655
Take that!

248
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:06,817
Bastard..

249
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:12,221
Bastard!

250
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,340
Quickly, quickly,
come on!

251
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:39,750
Faster!

252
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:06,939
Stop!

253
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:21,516
Come down out of there.

254
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:37,305
- Go.
- Get in the truck.

255
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,154
Don't.

256
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,226
- They have nothing to do with this.
- Why do you care so much about them?

257
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:39,066
Our people are on this truck.

258
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:58,713
Time to use your head..
or what's left of it.

259
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,855
Think really hard;

260
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,090
Cuong must have
told you something.

261
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,198
All I remember
is the smell of opium.

262
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:19,176
Allow me to refresh your memory.

263
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,974
Hold it.

264
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:22,708
Please have some tea.

265
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,552
Enough of this.
Let me cut out his tongue.

266
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,288
Then how is he going to talk?

267
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,708
Now what else
do you remember?

268
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,302
He said... go to hell.

269
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,210
A tiger would never eat his cub.

270
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:37,951
Yes, Colonel.

271
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:39,457
It's me...Danh.

272
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:41,425
Give me what you've got.

273
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:44,929
<i>They killed the informant.</i>

274
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:24,933
Thank you.

275
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:27,199
You're a freedom fighter?

276
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,335
- Where are they taking us?
- To the iron mines.

277
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:35,239
Come down.
You'll die of thirst up there.

278
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,683
<i>We have to divide them</i>

279
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:44,848
<i>and we have to send
the prisoners to Hanoi.</i>

280
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:46,983
<i>With the complicity
of the prisoners...</i>

281
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,680
My mother was Indo-Chinese.

282
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:53,088
I share half your blood,

283
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:55,593
but France is my country.

284
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,089
I'm proud of who I am.

285
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:00,962
And your mother?

286
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:02,864
Wasn't she a whore?

287
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:07,330
What a pity!

288
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:09,101
I have work to do.

289
00:46:11,577 --> 00:46:15,274
Perhaps I am mistaken
about you.

290
00:46:15,347 --> 00:46:16,871
Tessier is dead.

291
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:18,439
You got that?
He's dead!

292
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:21,213
You are not the right man
for this situation.

293
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:25,053
Cuong...he's the one
with the talent.

294
00:46:25,124 --> 00:46:27,285
I have talent, sir.

295
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,487
You have talent?
You have talent?

296
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,629
Then act like you have it!

297
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,759
<i>Give me De Canh!</i>

298
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,157
You have to stay calm.

299
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,190
Oh, Mom! Oh, Mom!

300
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:15,873
Stay calm.

301
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,331
You, come here!

302
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:54,176
- What's your name?
- Hung.

303
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,214
- Hung what?
- Pham The Hung.

304
00:47:56,282 --> 00:47:57,544
Wrong, moron.

305
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:01,382
There's nobody here
by that name.

306
00:48:01,453 --> 00:48:03,011
Now that you're here,

307
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,580
that name no longer exists.

308
00:48:07,193 --> 00:48:08,683
From now on

309
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,956
your new name is 3709.

310
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,895
You got it?

311
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:16,128
Now, I ask you again.

312
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,533
What's your name?

313
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,195
My father called me Hung.

314
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:24,469
We just assume
that you never had a father.

315
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,712
Men to the right,
women to the left.

316
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:29,805
Move!

317
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,377
What are you looking at?

318
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:09,573
The woods.

319
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,715
I can see that.

320
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:16,016
But this place is a goddamn prison.

321
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,647
How did you end up here?

322
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,658
Couldn't afford their "self-tax."

323
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,557
I'm just a servant.

324
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:29,128
Everyone is subject to the law.

325
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:31,396
What about laws
that sanction slavery?

326
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,267
No such law.

327
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:35,534
You think people volunteered
to come here?

328
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:47,015
One way or the other,

329
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,021
we will all end up on that truck.

330
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:24,121
Move away!
Stand up!

331
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:25,918
Lazy scum.

332
00:51:28,994 --> 00:51:31,554
- Ow!
- Don't play games with me.

333
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,029
I said stand up!

334
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:37,131
Please don't hurt
my husband!

335
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:38,794
Get up!

336
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:41,567
No food or water
for these two today!

337
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,336
Sir, I beg you.
Please forgive him.

338
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,605
Sir, I beg you.

339
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,780
No food or water
for these two today!

340
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:51,941
Understood?

341
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,029
I see a way out of here.

342
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,291
Be quiet!

343
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,671
Is that all you can see?

344
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,503
They left the key
in the ignition.

345
00:52:56,815 --> 00:52:58,077
Look at them.

346
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,914
Have you ever seen a bunch
of lazier bastards?

347
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:05,150
We do the work while they sit there
filling their bellies.

348
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:09,086
Our white man's burden.

349
00:53:18,971 --> 00:53:21,997
Take it. You don't want
to have a miscarriage.

350
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,918
Who gave food to these two?

351
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:36,181
Who gave food
to these two?

352
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:42,751
Nobody?

353
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:56,272
No one?

354
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,977
I am going to beat
these two to death!

355
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,253
I did.

356
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,050
Come here.

357
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,063
Turn around.

358
00:55:25,464 --> 00:55:26,954
Put your guns down!

359
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,506
- Drop them!
- Put the guns down.
