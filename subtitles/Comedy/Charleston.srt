A LIFE OF 80 YEARS
IS NOT A DREAM

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,700
- Bye.
- Yes.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,900
- I'll work all night.
- Yes.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
- Remember to lock up.
- Yes.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
You always forgot!

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,100
Bye.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,500
When will you get
your retirement pay?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,700
August 15.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,200
- What?
- What do you want to buy?

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Bought them yesterday.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,700
- What did you buy?
- A 26-inch TV,

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,300
air-con, scooter, double bed.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,400
- Double bed?
- Yes!

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,500
It'll be here these few days.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,300
- What is it?
- You live too long!

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
Really?

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,400
Don't jiggle your feet!
Go to work now!

1965: 67.74 (M), 72.92 (F)

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Good evening.

24
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,070
It's so hot!

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
It's so hot, and you
want to do something?

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,800
Not me.

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,800
It's so hot I got mad!

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,500
Hey you!

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,400
Who are you?

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
Me?

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
Independent delinquent.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,100
What?

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,600
It's so hot but you're so gloomy!

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
You want to...

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,300
"do something to me?"

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,900
You're not running, so...

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,500
you want to do something?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
1980: 73.32 (M), 78.83 (F)

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
What? It isn't just now that
women live longer?

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's ever since the war!

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
They live 5 years more!

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,300
What? Look!

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
Oh, I see.

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
That's perfect.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
- Why?
- My lover is...

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,400
5 years older than me.
She's a bar madam.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We'll die together!

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
Idiot! You look cool, but...

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,500
there's a rumour that
you'll go back to Traffic.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
"Beep beep.
10 km over, license please!"

51
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,600
People also say someone
here will leave soon.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Who is leaving?

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,400
You, sir!

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
You!

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
- Nakamachi, how old are you?
- Twenty-seven.

56
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
- What?
- 27.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
27?

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
Look.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,300
It's now 73.32 years.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,500
It was 46.9 years in 1945.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Look!

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
27 years more!

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,800
You were just a sperm
during the war.

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,600
That's why a parasite, tapeworm,
braided rope, bar madam.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But what do you want to say?

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,000
I mean,

67
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,800
being a cop is footwork!
Run all your life!

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
<i>That's what I mean.</i>

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
Why are you running?

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
How about here?

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,100
Yumi!

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,500
Yumi!

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,600
Let's...

74
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,100
do it!

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
Let's do it!

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Let's do it!

77
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,500
Let's do it!

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,900
Yumi!

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,500
Yumi!

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Help!

81
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,170
Help!

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,100
Fool.

83
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,400
With you pants down,

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,300
you chased a woman
whose dress was rolled up.

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
Right?

86
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
- Right.
- You did.

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
It's OK the other way around.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,700
I see.

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I, with dress rolled up, chased
a girl with her jeans down.

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,700
- Yes.
- What's your motive?

91
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,600
Why did you do that?

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,000
Because the sun was too bright.

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,600
No jokes!

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,600
It was night!

95
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
It's <i>The Stranger</i> of Camus, sir.

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,800
Camus?

97
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Brandy?

98
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
About time.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
What time?

100
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
About time to go home.

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,100
You fool!

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,100
We arrested you for attempted rape!

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
By my mom and brother,

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,100
Tamiko and Maru were waiting.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
Maru is...

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
a cat?

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,700
A dog.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Female Maltese.

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
Tamiko is a female cat?

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,400
She's a female, no,

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,500
she's a maid.
5 years older than me.

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Enough!
You'll spend the night here!

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,400
Like an elderly home.

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,800
Shut up and go inside. Punk!

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Young man, what did you do?

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Assault... on a woman.

134
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
Succeeded, or not?

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
No.

136
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
Tight foreskin?

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,200
Tight foreskin?

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,700
And,

139
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,900
she's a virgin?

140
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,500
Not that close...

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So you didn't meet the enemy,

142
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,300
that is, the hymen?

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,300
You didn't get to the hymen?

144
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,200
- I didn't.
- So...

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,500
To dispel the heat,
I'll teach you that.

146
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
In histology,

147
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,200
that membrane is just
a group of cells.

148
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,900
In chemistry,
it's a kind of protein,

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,600
a combination of the atoms of...

150
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen and sulphur.

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
In biology,
it has no raison d'etre,

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
no reason to exist.

153
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Usually, it just takes
10 grams of force...

154
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,500
to pierce through it.

155
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,500
But it could be difficult
for a beginner like you.

156
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,700
Prime Minister.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,900
You're a law grad from Tokyo U.,
but you're not a dandy.

158
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,300
Education Minister,
don't praise me like that.

159
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,200
I just remember what I learned...

160
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,900
in my forensics lessons.
I'm ashamed to admit that.

161
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,900
You're...

162
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,700
still a virgin?

163
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,700
Well...

164
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,500
I feel ashamed to say this...

165
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
What minister are you?

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Cabinet Secretary.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
I envy you.

168
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,500
- Teiso? (Virginity)
- Virginity?

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
Mail Minister.

170
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
I envy you too.

171
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,500
A virgin.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,500
You still have your cherry.

173
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,200
- Keep it well.
- Really?

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Yes.

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,500
I don't want to keep it!
I wanted to lose it tonight!

176
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,500
That's not right,
Foreign Minister?

177
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,300
It's very wrong.

178
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,400
We did that
in the brothel back then.

179
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,900
At 20, boys took a body exam for
military service. After that,

180
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,200
we all went to the brothel,

181
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,900
and lost our cherries
as if they're trash.

182
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
It wasn't gratifying.

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Only a feeling of emptiness...

184
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,900
remained.

185
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,800
The student price
in Shinjuku 1-cho was...

186
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,000
1.5 yen.

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,900
Too much!

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,200
It's just 1.2 yen in Tamanoi.

189
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Whatever...

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,100
losing it like that,

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,800
you'll also throw away
that sense of gratitude.

192
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,500
Really?

193
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
Really!

194
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Foreign Minister.

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,100
How's your morning glory lately?

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,100
Morning glory?

197
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Will it get up?

198
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,700
No.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
I see.

200
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,300
So, Education Minister...

201
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
you still have it?

202
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
No...

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Oh.

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,200
I want to try it some other time.

205
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,600
Eels, or potions?

206
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,900
No!

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,400
I'll eat something good
before sleeping.

208
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
That's bad for your stomach.

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
But good for a boner.

210
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,900
At least I'll have...

211
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
a boner while sleeping.

212
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,900
I'll have a dazzling dream.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Dazzle...

214
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
you mean... a wet dream?

215
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Yes.

216
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,100
But,

217
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,100
the semen...

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,500
is just some gas...

219
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,800
like this.

220
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,800
That's it.

221
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,400
But it's not liquid?

222
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,100
Air.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Empty.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Empty?

225
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
What's so funny?

226
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Nothing.

227
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Laugh at yourself.

228
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,800
- You are?
- Army Minister.

229
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Sir! I hate this place!

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,700
Put me somewhere else!

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
So noisy!

232
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,700
Shut up or I'll knock...

233
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,700
your uvula out.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
This...

235
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,000
is a detention cell, right?

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,500
Yes. The so-called pigsty.

237
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,700
You think this is the madhouse?

238
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
- Right?
- Yes.

239
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,700
You guys...

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
Listen. I'm serious...

241
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,800
really serious.

242
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,600
We're all ministers...

243
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
of a tiny and
independent country,

244
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,800
seriously.

245
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,800
That's a bit...

246
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,700
no, very...

247
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
funny, right?

248
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
The Japanese government isn't?

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
It's reliable?

250
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,000
- It...
- ...isn't!

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,300
Lots of lies, lots of deception.

252
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,800
- Internal quarrels.
- Also towards foreign countries.

253
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Not handsome.

254
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,400
But easy to draw.

255
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
Shut up.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
Or you'll smell gunpowder.

257
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,800
Aren't you the Army Minister?

258
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
So what?

259
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,800
That's also a question of looks.

260
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
A matter of physiognomy.

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
What?

262
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,900
Now...

263
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,400
it's become obvious.

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The problem began when the Three
Anti-Nuclear Principles were changed.

265
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,600
They've lied to us...

266
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
for 26 years.

267
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,700
We're bored,

268
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,300
so we set up this independent state.

269
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,400
It's half serious, half for fun.

270
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,000
An "Independence Game".

271
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Then a "Cabinet Game".

272
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>That's how it started.</i>

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm the eldest,

274
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,000
so I'm the Prime Minister.

275
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Foreign Minister...

276
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,300
should be you, Hota.
You were an insurance salesman.

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Asaya, you sold stationery.

278
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,800
Education Minister.

279
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,000
Takikawa, you were a postman.

280
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Mail Minister.

281
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,700
Cabinet Secretary.

282
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,300
You're the youngest.
You were a kimono store head.

283
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,300
Mochida, it's you.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,600
With that,

285
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,500
things went smoothly, but...

286
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
What's wrong, Prime Minister?

287
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
Kodaira.

288
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,800
During the war,
you were on a suicide squad.

289
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Before your mission,

290
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
the war ended.

291
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,000
Now you go in and out of prison.

292
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,800
Up to now, 7 times.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
No.

294
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
8.

295
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,900
Sorry.

296
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
After 8 times,

297
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,600
you're now a good citizen.

298
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,200
How about the Health Minister?

299
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
You like that?

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
No.

301
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,300
I want to be Chief of Police.

302
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
That's sarcastic.

303
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Cynical and funny!

304
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,600
Thinking in the same direction,

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Army Minister is more interesting!

306
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,600
Prime Minister!
That doesn't work!

307
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,900
Our country is...

308
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,700
without war and anti-war.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,400
And we hoist the flags
of real peace!

310
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,000
To hoist those flags,

311
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,000
an Army Minister is necessary,
Foreign Minister.

312
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,600
When I hear the words
of "Army Minister",

313
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,800
Whenever I remember
some professors saying,

314
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,700
"A country without military
power is not a country!"

315
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
I feel a chill.

316
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,100
Goose pimples! Look!

317
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Where?

318
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,000
What I want...

319
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,000
isn't military power,

320
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,300
but deterrence power.

321
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Because our country...

322
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,200
will be surrounded by Japan and others.

323
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
When that time comes,

324
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,100
we have no allies.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
What to do?

326
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,700
So deterrence power...

327
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,200
means defending
against foreign invasion?

328
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,800
Oh.

329
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Deterrence power.

330
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
What country is it?

331
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,500
Yamatai.

332
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,000
Where is it?

333
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,200
Is it... here?

334
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
Also here.

335
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,800
We were drifters.

336
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,700
Drifting here and there.

337
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,700
To where there is work.

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
We've been to many places.

339
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,800
Underpasses of
Sanya, Ueno, Shinjuku.

340
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,000
So you're vagabonds.

341
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,400
Hey!

342
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Now we have our territory.

343
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,600
And our border.

344
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,600
Why are you here?

345
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,100
Today,

346
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,800
we paid a state visit...

347
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,700
to the Diet of Japan.

348
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,400
Before we left,

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,200
we ate at the senators' canteen.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
It was a state visit,
so we thought...

351
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Japan would pay for our meals.

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,600
But they didn't.
What misers!

353
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,200
Finance Minister
was at the bicycle races.

354
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,400
So we got into trouble.

355
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,100
What?

356
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,000
You jumped your bills.

357
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Good.

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No... violence.

359
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
You tried to rape someone!

360
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,000
Finance Minister!

361
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,800
Finance?

362
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
Sorry!

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I won three races,

364
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,800
so I stayed until the last race.

365
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,700
To continue my luck
I went to play pachinko.

366
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,100
I won all these!

367
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,300
Did you pay our bills?
It's 10,625 yen.

368
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,900
I did. So,

369
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,800
you can leave now.

370
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,200
It's very late, may I...

371
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
stay the night here?

372
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,200
Please open up and let me in.

373
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Let me have breakfast too.

374
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,100
It's free, right?

375
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,100
Excuse me.

376
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh.

377
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Hey kid, what did you do?

378
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,600
Doctor Game?

379
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm so sorry for my brother.

380
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,300
Their treatments,

381
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,300
may I pay for that?

382
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,200
How much?

383
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,000
I've prepared... this.

384
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,800
- 10 million!
- Stupid!

385
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,600
1 million.

386
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,800
I see.

387
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,500
May we two talk about it?

388
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes.

389
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
Come.

390
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Are you blind?

391
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
- What?
- Tamiko!

392
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,100
What?

393
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,500
Toilet!

394
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
I didn't expect that!

395
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,400
I thought it's just 100,000!

396
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,800
Me too, Yumi!

397
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,200
- We can go to Hawaii!
- Am I dreaming?

398
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,700
<i>It's vacant!</i>

399
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,000
What?

400
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,600
What, punk?

401
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,600
So the Yamatai statesmen
are leaving us?

402
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,000
Do you think this is funny?
This is not funny!

403
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,700
Any toothpicks?

404
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,200
You're really crazy.

405
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Go see a doctor.
You have your insurance cards?

406
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,900
We don't.

407
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
- We tore them up.
- Tore them up?

408
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,400
"Yen" is our currency,
so we didn't tear them up.

409
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,300
All things issued by Japan,

410
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
we tore them up yesterday.

411
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Tax reminders, bus passes,

412
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,600
pension cards,

413
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,100
- policewomen's...
- Policewomen?

414
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,800
Recruitment posters.

415
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,400
Stop kidding!

416
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,300
If they sent us draft notices,

417
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,200
those too.

418
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,300
Will they draft you old men?

419
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,500
You'll never know,
Japan these days...

420
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Jiro.

421
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,300
What is this music?

422
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,300
The Charleston.

423
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,700
What is it?

424
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Lately,

425
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
I don't know why,

426
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,600
this is funny to me.

427
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,900

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,300
My tears, I can't...

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,200
see the road.

438
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,000
Never mind that.

439
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
Very funny.

440
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Jiro!

441
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
This is my first time.

442
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,000
Know the taste of your tears?
Spicy? Sweet?

443
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,700
Mild spicy.

444
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,600
Sweet.

445
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
What's up?

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,800
You've been circling
around the police station!

447
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,500
Angry with us?

448
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,400
Very nice morning.

449
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,200
What's happening in world politics?

450
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
No littering.

451
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Put them properly in the litter bin.

452
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Yamatai people! Yamatai people!

453
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,900
Hey you!

454
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,700
Stop the car.

455
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,000
Yes.

456
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,500
- Thief!
- Thief!

457
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Newspaper thief! Milk thief!

458
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
Now we got you!

459
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,600
Somebody help!

460
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
You!

461
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,100
Jiro!

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,300
Bastards!

463
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
- Those old delinquents!
- Right!

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
You're a juvenile delinquent.

465
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
You did quite a lot.

466
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,500
Truancy, scribbling the walls
of headmaster's office.

467
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Destroying lab specimens,
beating up teachers.

468
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,900
Extortion, shoplifting, rape.

469
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
Attempted!

470
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Attempted.

471
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,000
Stealing milk and newspaper
is a misunderstanding!

472
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
Misunderstanding.

473
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
Go.

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Not until you tell me about
the Yamatai people.

475
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,700
Those crazy old men?

476
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
They live there!

477
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,300
- Above a bomb.
- What?

478
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,300
Exactly above it.

479
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,900
"Near the war's end, there was
an anti-aircraft artillery there."

480
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,200
"During the bombardment
on March 10, 1945,"

481
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,000
"it was hit by several
250-ton bombs."

482
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,000
"The artillery was destroyed,"

483
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,900
"but there were at least
2 unexploded bombs."

484
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,300
"The captain at that time,"

485
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,700
"made a telephone report
on Apr 1, 1958."

486
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Sounds convincing.

487
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,900
"The owner of the land
and house of that spot,"

488
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
"Munechika Okonogi made
a similar report that day."

489
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
- Munechika?
- Dad.

490
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
He has such a house?

491
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,900
Dad?

492
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,700
- Yours?
- Yes.

493
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,500
He's reported as missing.

494
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,800
Don't mind that.

495
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,900
This is some kind of sickness.

496
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,800
- Sickness?
- He's been missing since...

497
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,100
December 8.
It's his 3rd time.

498
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,700
No, 4th.

499
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,700
He'll come home.

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,900
- Is that true?
- No.

501
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,500
5th.

502
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,500
He probably won't
come home this time.

503
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,600
He's been missing since December 8,

504
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
they've been living there
since December 8,

505
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,700
they may have done
something crazy,

506
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,300
they may have chopped
him up and buried him!

507
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Stupid! Stupid!

508
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,500
Shut up!

509
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,400
The deceased...no..
his family is here!

510
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,800
- He's not his real son!
- Stupid!

511
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,900
Watch your mouth, idiot!

512
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Never mind.

513
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,800
I'm adopted, Mr. Idiot.

514
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,800
Mr. Idiot?

515
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,600
But they're still
father and son, Mr. Idiot?

516
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,000
- Watch your mouth!
- The unexploded bombs.

517
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Will they explode after 36 years?
That ever happened?

518
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,900
Yes.

519
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,600
I was in the naval air force.

520
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,000
If the fuse is working,
it can explode.

521
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,300
How? By impact?

522
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,600
Say, a huge earthquake.

523
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,600
Yes.

524
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,200
It's calm today.

525
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,500
Even after yesterday morning.

526
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,800
An earthquake of that magnitude.

527
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,000
What a relief.

528
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,000
The earthquake yesterday...

529
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,300
was 3 on seismic scale.
The paper says.

530
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,000
While we're relieved...

531
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,200
that our country is safe,

532
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,700
remember...

533
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
today is August 6.

534
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,600
The day of the Hiroshima A-bomb.

535
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,700
The family of Mail Minister...

536
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,100
all died on that day.

537
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,100
This is a sad day.

538
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,700
Everybody.

539
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,900
A minute...

540
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,900
of silence.

541
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Jiro, let's go home.

542
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,100
Can't leave a patient alone.

543
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,800
Sir.

544
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
You look painful, what's wrong?

545
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If you have stomach ache, take a pill.
Or go to the toilet.

546
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Toilet.

547
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,400
Shut up!

548
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
Toilet, no...

549
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,700
for going to the latrine,

550
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
these 36 years...

551
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,400
I live in pain!

552
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,800
- Hemorrhoids?
- Shut up!

553
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
At noon, around this day
36 years ago,

554
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
when I was squatting in the latrine,

555
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
a B29 bomber out of power,

556
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,800
dropped a 250-ton bomb,

557
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,800
the only one it had,
on our air field.

558
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,700
I rushed there,

559
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
my 13 men were all
blown into pieces.

560
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,600
I picked up...

561
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,600
pieces of this size,

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,700
and put them in a bucket.

563
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
This is the 8th time!

564
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,500
Listen.

565
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,500
Yes?

566
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,700
They were all kids of your age.

567
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
Your age?

568
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
18.

569
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,100
Then you can't smoke!

570
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
At what age did you start smoking?

571
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
17.

572
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,100
You too.

573
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,600
Mr. Osaku.
Please see the chief.

574
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,300
Jiro!

575
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,900
Damn!

576
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,200
Bourgeois punk!

577
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm a proletarian.

578
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Someday I'll catch you
with this hand.

579
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
What's so bourgeois about me?

580
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,800
Where? Loan companies,

581
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,000
supermarkets, restaurants, grills,
pachinkos, car rentals.

582
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
What?

583
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
Your family!

584
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
- You don't know?
- I don't.

585
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,400
Do you?

586
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,000
That girl last night,
she was paid...

587
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,400
1 million to drop the charges.
Do you know?

588
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,000
1 million? So little money?

589
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
You know?

590
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,700
But I haggled it to 50,000.

591
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,700
Good girl.

592
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,900
But that 50,000 is still
a waste of money.

593
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,800
Well then, I have scores to settle!

594
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
Go home first.

595
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,700
- Jiro!
- Stop your resistance!

596
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,400
What?

597
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,600
Do you know what car you have?

598
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,300
Tamiko drives a small car,

599
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,500
- my brother a Benz!
- Oh that one!

600
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,000
That that that...
that one!

601
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,200
Let me rephrase what you said.

602
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,500
You want us to leave...

603
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,500
this house that is built on our territory...

604
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,000
and also this territory of ours,

605
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,700
before August 15.

606
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
Unconditionally.

607
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,900
Right?

608
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
Yes!

609
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Of course not.

610
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,700
This is like...

611
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,500
on July 26, 1945, 6 AM,
the declaration...

612
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,500
demanding the
unconditional surrender of Japan,

613
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,400
that is, the Potsdam Declaration!

614
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,900
You won't offer us a new place.

615
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
No compensation.

616
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,000
Right, madam?

617
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,500
Hey! You have never paid
a dime of rent!

618
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,900
We never allowed you to
live here in the first place!

619
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
You're wrong.

620
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,600
Last year...

621
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,600
on December 8,

622
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,900
your husband
Munechika Okonogi said...

623
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,800
may I?

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,100
"You may live here for free,
and forever."

625
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,100
He made a promise.

626
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,400
But that's not a written statement!

627
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,200
The law doesn't recognize
verbal agreements.

628
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,900
The law of Japan...

629
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,500
doesn't apply to our country.

630
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,400
You need the international law.

631
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,300
And my husband has been
missing since December 8!

632
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,800
I don't know if he's dead or alive!

633
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,100
Well...

634
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,800
Pardon me...

635
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,000
do you know why
your husband ran away?

636
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
No.

637
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,800
That day, your husband
said this to us,

638
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,300
"I saw the face of
my sleeping wife."

639
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,900
"I got scared and jumped
out of the window!"

640
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
Get it?

641
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,900
What?

642
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,700
This line is the border.

643
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,800
Your passport please.

644
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,300
- Passport?
- Yes.

645
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
But you don't need a visa.

646
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,700
I'm hungry!

647
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh yes!

648
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,000
We haven't had lunch yet.

649
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,200
How about chilled soba?

650
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Something light?

651
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,600
I haven't had eels for so long.

652
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,500
Thank you.

653
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,900
City Councillor,
the thing you want to discuss...

654
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,300
Your chief told me...

655
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,700
you'll soon retire.

656
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,500
Yes.

657
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
August 15.

658
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,600
Mr. Terao has lots of businesses.

659
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,900
He wants your help
after you retired.

660
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
Thank you.

661
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,900
I've been worrying about
my retirement.

662
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,300
I'm counting on you.

663
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,200
Less than 10 days before that.

664
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,600
He has a favour to ask.

665
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,600
And you'll work for him.

666
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,300
So I arranged this meeting
for you two.

667
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,000
What about?

668
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm looking for someone.

669
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,000
But murder is my thing.

670
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,600
If so,

671
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,000
consider it as a murder case.

672
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,600
Since December 8,

673
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,900
no one knows
if he's dead or alive.

674
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
December 8?

675
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,200
Is he...

676
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
Munechika Okonogi,

677
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
age 57?

678
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,400
- You know!
- Yes.

679
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,000
His younger son Jiro
was here last night.

680
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,000
Something...

681
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,700
What's your relation
with the Okonogis?

682
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Relation...

683
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,100
we have the same hometown.

684
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,500
The Okonogis...

685
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
are the descendants
of a noble family.

686
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,600
That's the reason his family
is so tired from crying.

687
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,300
We'll kick them in an elderly home!

688
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,500
No.

689
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,800
A madhouse is better.

690
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,200
Even better...
the bomb blows them up!

691
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,400
You saved 950,000 yen last night?

692
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Hey you!

693
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,600
- Lend me that money.
- Where are you going?

694
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,800
- Revenge.
- Jiro!

695
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,300
Is the sauce too spicy?

696
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,800
No. Spicy or sweet,

697
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,500
it's good as ever.

698
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Hey hey hey!

699
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,800
The coming August 15,

700
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
let's get on a coach,

701
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,800
and go to a hot spring?

702
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,900
August 15? It's the Bon Festival!

703
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You're Education Minister
and you don't know?

704
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,600
- It's not the Bon!
- Easy, easy.

705
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
- End of WW2.
- No.

706
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,900
- The day we lost the war.
- What's the difference!

707
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
Great!

708
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,400
Men and women in the
same pool, preferably.

709
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
Hot spring, great!

710
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,700
I forget there is such thing.

711
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,500
Yes, Prime Minister?

712
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,700
It sounds great...

713
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,300
Oh...

714
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
these 36 years,

715
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
many things happened.

716
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,500
I did many things.

717
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
Me too.

718
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,900
Many.

719
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,000
I know, Finance Minister.

720
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,200
Bastards!

721
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,200
Excuse me.

722
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,300
Nobody home?

723
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,300
It's you!

724
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Attempted rape?

725
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
You call that a greeting?

726
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,400
- Why are you here?
- A courtesy call.

727
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,500
To pay my respects.

728
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,200
Respects or revenge?

729
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,000
I took the blame for
the things you did.

730
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,200
And I got it bad.

731
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Coming!

732
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,400
Hello. Yamatai here.

733
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Yamatai?

734
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,700
Is Jiro Okonogi at your place?

735
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,200
- Jiro?
- It's me.

736
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,500
Jiro?

737
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,900
- I'm Tamiko.
- Tamiko.

738
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm busy. Don't call me.

739
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,400
Hang up.

740
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,300
Yes, I know.

741
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,600
Jiro Okonogi?

742
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,200
You're one of them!

743
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,800
Hello? Hello?

744
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,600
Hello?

745
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,600
We'll shoot the spy?

746
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,900
Poor boy.

747
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,200
Yes, but we must shoot him.

748
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,600
I don't know about Japan,

749
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
but 36 years ago,

750
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,700
our country destroyed all...

751
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,300
Type 38 rifles.

752
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,800
Then use this.

753
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,300
Hey! Don't!

754
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,000
Don't?

755
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,400
The night I became Army Minister,

756
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,000
I fixed a gangster in Kabukicho
with one thrust.

757
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,300
Army Minister,

758
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,200
please destroy this weapon.

759
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,600
The weapons of our country
are just stationery,

760
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,900
or DIY carpentry tools,
such as...

761
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,400
wooden pestle,

762
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,600
hammer, radish grinder,
pencil sharpener,

763
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,400
or braided rope.

764
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,600
We only have that
kind of weapons.

765
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
Braided rope?

766
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,500
We can hang him.

767
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,400
We'll tie the rope at...

768
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,500
What's wrong, Tamiko?

769
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,500
Jiro...

770
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
will be hanged in Yamatai!

771
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,200
In Yamatai?

772
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,000
Come on!

773
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,800
But they're crazy, Ichiro!

774
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,200
They may do anything!

775
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,500
Are you joking?

776
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I'll go and see.

777
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,100
Yes, bye.

778
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,100
You're going there?

779
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,800
Yes. What's wrong?

780
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,400
If it explodes,

781
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,400
all things will turn to dust
within 500 metres!

782
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,900
You don't want to go,
then don't go!

783
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,800
Go back to Traffic!

784
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,000
"Beep beep!
10 km over! License please!"

785
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,600
I'll go! May I?

786
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,600
We'll go with pistols?

787
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,500
Pistols? They're old people!

788
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,400
Old people too.
Like the FBI...

789
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,600
"Reach!" Just like that.

790
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,000
I want to try that.

791
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You play mahjong too much?

792
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,300
No.
"Reach for the sky your hands!"

793
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,500
Telling them to raise their hands.

794
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,000
Shut up! Go get the car,

795
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,400
- The patrol car!
- No, idiot!

796
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,400
You'll agitate them.

797
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,400
Then my own car!

798
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,800
Too slow! Can you go faster?

799
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Must be careful when riding together.

800
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,600
- But this is illegal.
- Illegal?

801
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,500
Let's take out this amount...

802
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,500
of insurance for Jiro?

803
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,900
Oh. With his father's insurance...

804
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,900
- this.
- Yes.

805
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,400
I've asked Iimuro...

806
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,600
- to come here from Kansai.
- Good.

807
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400
<i>Dear friends,</i>

808
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,800
<i>it's gymnastics time.</i>

809
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,200
<i>As usual,</i>

810
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,500
He's still playing cool!

811
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,800
<i>after the gymnastics, put your...</i>

812
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,500
<i>old newspaper, magazines
and rags at your front porch.</i>

813
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,800
Brings back the memories.

814
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,000
- Attempted rape.
- What?

815
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
What? The cop!

816
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,300
- What are you up to?
- Up to?

817
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,200
Death by shooting,
death by hanging.

818
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,400
They nearly hanged me.

819
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,400
- Really?
- Yes.

820
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,400
Then?

821
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,000
I defected and became their citizen.

822
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,800
Defected? Citizen?

823
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,800
Yes. Labour Minister too.

824
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,800
You're Labour Minister?

825
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,200
Yes.

826
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,800
Labouring is good.

827
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,300
Weeding, shopping.

828
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,300
Cleaning the toilet.

829
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,400
I've never done all that.

830
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,700
Good.

831
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
And changing...

832
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,300
their diapers.

833
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,900
Why are you here?

834
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,900
By the way,

835
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,000
- Foreign Minister said
something strange.  - What?

836
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,300
When he was an insurance salesman,

837
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,200
he came to our house.

838
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,400
And?

839
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
- Damn! A waste of time!
- Sorry.

840
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,000
- Not you. Hurry!
- Yes!

841
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Bastard! That's low!

842
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,900
10 km over. License please.

843
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,700
Yes.

844
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,700
What?

845
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,300
Life insurance?

846
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,800
About a year ago?

847
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,300
Yes. An insurance salesman
came to your house,

848
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,200
your mother said,

849
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,200
"My husband already has
a 300 million yen policy."

850
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,200
Is that true?

851
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,200
Even if it is,

852
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,500
this amount is just
an excuse to say no.

853
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,100
That's not important. How's Jiro?

854
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,700
Jiro?

855
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Oh. Labour Minister.

856
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,500
He's fine.

857
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,500
That's true.

858
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,200
Let's go back to the insurance.

859
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,900
Even if it's just half, 150 million...

860
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,000
- "OK"
- Shut up!

861
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,200
Hello.

862
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,500
Hello?

863
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,100
Stupid.

864
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,800
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

865
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,800
Thanks to you, he hanged up!

866
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,400
But something is wrong.

867
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,700
You!

868
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Check all the insurance
companies in Japan.

869
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,500
No way! I have a date tonight.

870
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,300
Going back?
"Beep beep! 10 km over!"

871
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,300
No! I'll go!

872
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,000
- Where to?
- Yamatai.

873
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,800
Just kidding.

874
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,300
The place closest to Yamatai.
Shinjuku, please.

875
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,300
- Cheers.
- For a hard day.

876
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,300
I didn't know there's
such insurance company.

877
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,600
Yes.

878
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,000
It's very bourgeois, sir.

879
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,700
200 million for such a punk!

880
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,600
200 million? Punk?

881
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,800
The bomb may explode anytime.

882
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,300
No, it isn't certain if it will explode.

883
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Still, they took out a 200 million...

884
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,600
for him. Stupid!

885
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,500
For Jiro?

886
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,500
Yes.

887
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,200
I found it out today.

888
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,600
Stupid!

889
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,600
- Give him some black coffee.
- Yes.

890
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,300
Right now.

891
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,000
I expected this.

892
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,300
You've prepared it!

893
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,700
My wife will never do such a thing.

894
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,900
Forget it.

895
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,500
About what?

896
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Idiot!

897
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,600
For the whole day, I've been
looking for the father, not Jiro!

898
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
OK. Drink your coffee.

899
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,300
We'll start a surveillance
on Yamatai!

900
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,200
But this is Saturday night!

901
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,000
I don't mind.

902
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,700
35 years. Never got late.
Never missed a day.

903
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,800
My record is impeccable.

904
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,900
I won't let Jiro...

905
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,200
He's just an adopted son!

906
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,500
His mom and brother are suspicious.

907
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
I don't care.

908
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,700
If this goes badly,
my retirement is ruined.

909
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,300
And you...

910
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
"Beep beep!
10 km over! License please!"

911
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,000
You want that?

912
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,000
Right?

913
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,400
I don't mind.

914
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,000
You're so good!

915
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,300
Welcome!

916
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,200
<i>The next day. August 7.</i>

917
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,400
<i>Checking the catfish
in the morning...</i>

918
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,100
<i>is one of my duties.</i>

919
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,800
<i>It's quiet, but...</i>

920
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,600
<i>the piano string-border is broken,</i>

921
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,900
<i>intruders may come in.</i>

922
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,000
<i>I noticed...</i>

923
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,600
What are you writing,
Labour Minister?

924
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,700
The chronicles of Yamatai.

925
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,000
<i>Country of the Blooming 1980s.</i>

926
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,400
That would be the book title.

927
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,200
My bestseller.

928
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,200
Great!

929
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The blooming 1980s.

930
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,600
It's a micro country.

931
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,000
It's a sunny country!

932
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,300
No matter what,

933
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,600
please leave a record
for posterity.

934
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,400
Newspaper and milk.

935
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,100
Yes!

936
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,900
<i>Stealing newspaper and milk...</i>

937
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
<i>is also the Labour Minister's work.</i>

938
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,200
<i>A person here.</i>

939
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,800
<i>A person there.</i>

940
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,700
<i>I had a feeling
that it's a stakeout.</i>

941
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,900
<i>At midday,
I went out and buy lunch.</i>

942
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,800
<i>I went to a nearby supermarket
with Finance Minister.</i>

943
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,800
<i>I felt that we're followed
by 2 or 3 men.</i>

944
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,400
<i>I felt that strongly.</i>

945
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,900
<i>Luckily, the Yamatai old men...</i>

946
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,700
<i>didn't notice it.</i>

947
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,800
<i>But who are these men?</i>

948
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,300
<i>I think my brother is behind this.</i>

949
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,500
<i>A plan to evict the Yamatai old men.</i>

950
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,200
<i>But what about...</i>

951
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,300
<i>that idiot cop?</i>

952
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,800
I knew the police are working.

953
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,900
I asked them to.

954
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,100
You?

955
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,000
Let's call it...

956
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,800
diversion tactics. It's necessary.

957
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,200
- Right, Ichiro?
- Yes.

958
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
They're working, but...

959
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,800
they're just a retiring cop
and a rubbish cop.

960
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,200
Sir! Nothing unusual!

961
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,300
Really?

962
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,500
Somebody must be
about to take action.

963
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,900
Who?

964
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,900
Who?

965
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,500
It's your job to find out!

966
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,000
Like...

967
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,000
someone aimless,
looking at the wrong way.

968
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
There are 3 men with
the gaze of cops.

969
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,000
What? And then?

970
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,100
Nothing.

971
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,800
You should follow them!

972
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,100
Stop one of them.

973
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,400
Make him talk!
You should know that, idiot!

974
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,400
But my role is...

975
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,700
find out who's going to kill Jiro.

976
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,400
I'll get there, "Reach!"

977
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,200
With my pistol, "Reach!"

978
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,200
Go back to "Beep beep!".

979
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,600
<i>The next day, August 8.</i>

980
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,500
<i>Around 6 AM.</i>

981
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,800
<i>The phone rang.</i>

982
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,300
<i>Labour Minister is also the operator.</i>

983
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,400
This is Yamatai.

984
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,700
- Jiro?
- Yes.

985
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,700
Labour Minister.

986
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,700
Get me the Foreign Minister.

987
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
Foreign Minister!

988
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,000
Telephone!

989
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,600
Foreign Minister!

990
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,700
This is the Foreign Ministry.

991
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,200
Compensation?

992
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,200
1 million each?

993
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,000
1 million?

994
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,800
I'll call a cabinet meeting.

995
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,200
Then...

996
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,900
then...

997
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,700
give you a reply...

998
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,700
before 9 AM.

999
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,000
<i>Labour Minister is also
the alarm clock.</i>

1000
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,800
<i>Calling them in...</i>

1001
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,300
<i>no, I'm calling them up.</i>

1002
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,300
<i>But the Yamatai old men...</i>

1003
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,800
<i>are sleepyheads.</i>

1004
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,600
<i>If I leave them alone,
they'll sleep forever.</i>

1005
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,300
Wake up!

1006
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,000
Shut up!

1007
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,000
<i>Waking them up is not enough.</i>

1008
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,000
<i>They may sleep in the toilet.</i>

1009
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,000
<i>7 AM.</i>

1010
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,000
<i>Cabinet meeting began.</i>

1011
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,300
<i>To start, Cabinet Secretary
told us his view.</i>

1012
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,000
Since our independence,

1013
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,400
we refuse to take Japan's...

1014
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,000
pension or welfare.

1015
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,800
So our financial situation is...

1016
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,000
deteriorating day by day.

1017
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,500
Regarding this situation,

1018
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,600
I think we should discuss it.

1019
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,500
Yes.

1020
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,000
We've been living
on the bank savings...

1021
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,000
and race winnings of
Finance Minister.

1022
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,800
I'm really sorry.

1023
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,200
Don't feel bad about it.

1024
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,800
If it's for all of you,
I'd do anything.

1025
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,800
Ever since the war, I've been...

1026
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,700
We all know that,
Finance Minister.

1027
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,000
Yes.

1028
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,000
There are very few jobs lately.

1029
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,800
They all want young people.

1030
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,000
Jobs for the old...

1031
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,200
cleaning public toilets,

1032
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,100
signal giver at construction.

1033
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,700
Processing corpses
for anatomy classes.

1034
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,700
I can't do that.

1035
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,700
I tried it once, and
I felt like a corpse myself.

1036
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,500
If so,

1037
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,100
any work other than killing?

1038
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,400
I can work for you.

1039
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,800
You want to run away?

1040
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,000
I can run away anytime!

1041
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,700
You got me angry!

1042
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,200
What the...

1043
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,900
- What's wrong with you?
- Easy, easy.

1044
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,900
Our country is in trouble,

1045
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,500
no infighting please.

1046
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,300
Right.

1047
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,700
Please don't do the things...

1048
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,700
they do in the Japanese Diet.

1049
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,500
Whatever. Remember
I can run away anytime.

1050
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,000
I need some fresh air.

1051
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,100
Please continue, Cabinet Secretary.

1052
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
I...

1053
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,400
So,

1054
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,700
there's no other choice other
than taking the 1 million?

1055
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,800
Right.

1056
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,000
If we take it,
it's the end of our country.

1057
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,900
We'll be vagabonds again.

1058
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,600
Don't forget this.

1059
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,300
Also,

1060
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,200
30 million yen is the
minimum for retirement.

1061
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,000
It's common sense.

1062
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,600
1 million? Is that right?

1063
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,600
Forget it!

1064
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,400
Yes.

1065
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,300
Ignore it.

1066
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,800
By the way, it's hot last night.

1067
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,000
We need an air-con.

1068
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,000
But,

1069
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,200
I have the position of
Foreign Minister.

1070
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,700
If we don't give them a reply,

1071
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,600
it's a breach of international trust.

1072
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,900
OK.

1073
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,600
The reply is no.

1074
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Do you agree?
Please raise your hands.

1075
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,300
Well...

1076
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,000
When I woke up,

1077
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,900
I had "50 shoulder".
I can't raise...

1078
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,800
You're 69. Why 50 shoulder?

1079
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,800
Young man.

1080
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,600
Just show us your palm.

1081
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,900
<i>Oh yes.</i>

1082
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,300
<i>I can run away if I want to.</i>

1083
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,600
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

1084
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,300
How about you, Labour Minister?

1085
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,100
For? Against?

1086
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,600
Raise your hand. No?

1087
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,400
<i>Foreign Minister replied "No".</i>

1088
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,000
<i>My brother...</i>

1089
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,500
<i>no, the Okonogis responded
with "Ignore".</i>

1090
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,600
<i>That is, hanging up.</i>

1091
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
<i>This also means "Warning".</i>

1092
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,100
<i>August 10.</i>

1093
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,100
<i>Our phone line was cut.</i>

1094
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,000
<i>That noon, Finance Minister
wanted to tell us...</i>

1095
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,000
<i>that her bus ticket was nicked,</i>

1096
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,200
<i>so she'd come home late.</i>

1097
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,800
<i>She couldn't get through.
So we knew.</i>

1098
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,500
<i>The scary part...</i>

1099
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,500
<i>was that she...</i>

1100
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,400
<i>stole someone's wallet
and came home in triumph.</i>

1101
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,100
<i>Gymnastics time.
Today is no exception.</i>

1102
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'll sneak in your home tonight.

1103
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,200
To kill my brother?

1104
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,600
No more killing.

1105
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,900
To steal something?

1106
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,200
Fool.

1107
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,300
- Reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance?

1108
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,000
Show me around.

1109
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,600
If I say...

1110
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,600
- What?
- no...

1111
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,200
Kill you!

1112
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,600
Damn!

1113
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,000
Useless!

1114
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,000
Please! Let me try again!

1115
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,500
You may.

1116
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,500
- But before August 15.
- I understand!

1117
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,400
Can I have some prepayment?

1118
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,900
I've asked someone else.

1119
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,100
Only 5 days left.

1120
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,700
Why?

1121
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,800
You asked me first!

1122
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,000
Competition.

1123
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,600
Who did it first, wins.

1124
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,400
<i>That night,</i>

1125
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,200
<i>I went home with
Army Minister.</i>

1126
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,400
<i>Perfect timing.
I want to change my clothes.</i>

1127
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,600
<i>Sneaking in my own home,</i>

1128
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,200
<i>and in my own room.
That's unheard of.</i>

1129
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,800
<i>While I was packing some clothes,</i>

1130
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,600
<i>Army Minister went
around the house.</i>

1131
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,000
<i>He said he was a yakuza,</i>

1132
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,000
<i>but from his walking,</i>

1133
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,000
<i>his movements,</i>

1134
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,300
<i>he's more like a burglar.</i>

1135
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,500
<i>Mom...</i>

1136
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,000
<i>slept well and snored
as if the world...</i>

1137
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,000
<i>had nothing to do with her.</i>

1138
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,700
<i>My brother was still up.</i>

1139
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,900
<i>While drinking brandy,</i>

1140
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,900
<i>he's reading porn with
a magnifying glass.</i>

1141
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
<i>Descendant of a noble family,</i>

1142
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,300
<i>a posy man at daytime,</i>

1143
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,400
<i>that's his true self?</i>

1144
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,100
<i>Army Minister grabbed...</i>

1145
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,300
<i>2 bottles of "Camus"
Napoleon brandy.</i>

1146
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,700
<i>On my way out,
I peeped into the maid's room.</i>

1147
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,000
<i>I swear I've never done this before.</i>

1148
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,200
<i>But,</i>

1149
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,200
<i>I was glad I did.</i>

1150
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,400
<i>Tamiko slept with
her legs spread.</i>

1151
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,300
<i>That looked a bit sexy,
but it really wasn't.</i>

1152
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,300
<i>While I was at it,</i>

1153
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,000
<i>Someone opened the door,
and went in.</i>

1154
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,800
<i>It's my brother.</i>

1155
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,800
<i>On tiptoes, he's approaching her.</i>

1156
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,900
<i>"No!"</i>

1157
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,300
<i>I was trying to jump in,</i>

1158
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,300
<i>but Army Minister stopped me.</i>

1159
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,500
<i>I guessed he must have checked.</i>

1160
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,600
<i>Now he's a real pro.</i>

1161
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,000
<i>He jumped and grabbed
the alarm wire.</i>

1162
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,800
<i>And pulled it down.</i>

1163
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,300
<i>The siren went off.</i>

1164
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,800
<i>Tamiko grabbed Maru
and woke up.</i>

1165
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,900
<i>She tried to jump out
of the window.</i>

1166
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,600
<i>Many times.</i>

1167
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,200
<i>And failed.</i>

1168
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,300
<i>We gave her a hand,
she finally made it.</i>

1169
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,200
<i>In his underwear, Ichiro...</i>

1170
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,200
<i>kept going round in circles.</i>

1171
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,500
<i>The siren,</i>

1172
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,500
<i>with its wire cut,</i>

1173
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,700
<i>would keep on blasting.</i>

1174
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,100
<i>It's said that...</i>

1175
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,900
<i>neighbours nowadays are uncaring.</i>

1176
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,300
<i>They won't wake up and help.</i>

1177
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,700
<i>Here's the proof.</i>

1178
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,200
<i>Therefore, Ichiro would...</i>

1179
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,000
<i>probably run in circles
for the whole night.</i>

1180
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,700
Where to? Want a ride?

1181
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,200
Please!

1182
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,000
Run!

1183
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Now! Reach him and him!

1184
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,900
Yes!

1185
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,600
Enough.

1186
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,900
Useless!

1187
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,200
Take this car to the station.
Fingerprints, plate numbers, etc.

1188
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,100
- Thoroughly.
- And you?

1189
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,000
I'll take them to Yamatai.

1190
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,100
- Yes!
- Can you do it?  - Yes!

1191
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,300
That side! From the right!

1192
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,300
Oh my!

1193
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,900
Why do you take us?

1194
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,600
I don't want my witnesses killed.

1195
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,200
Killed?

1196
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Is someone hunting you down?

1197
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,800
No.

1198
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,100
Why?

1199
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,400
Well...

1200
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,400
Army Minister.

1201
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,000
What?

1202
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,300
Tell me what happened
on December 8.

1203
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,900
That day...

1204
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,800
was very cold.

1205
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,000
<i>We went in a house,
we thought it was empty.</i>

1206
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,300
<i>But...</i>

1207
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
<i>he's there.</i>

1208
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,900
Jiro's father.
What was he doing?

1209
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,600
<i>He hanged himself.</i>

1210
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,600
I see.

1211
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,200
And the corpse?

1212
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,800
The corpse?

1213
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
- Whose corpse?
- You know who!

1214
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,900
Munechika Okonogi.

1215
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,000
Did you...

1216
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,300
bury it in secret?

1217
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,700
Who said he's dead?

1218
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,600
What?

1219
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,300
He hanged himself,
but we took him down.

1220
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
<i>Finance Minister was an army nurse.
She gave him artificial breathing.</i>

1221
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,000
<i>He's saved.</i>

1222
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,000
Oh my goodness!

1223
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,600
But why?

1224
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,600
<i>We had a drink.</i>

1225
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,600
But...

1226
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,700
why do you want
to kill yourself?

1227
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,600
Do you mind telling us?

1228
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,900
I'm tired of running away.

1229
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,900
Running away?

1230
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,600
My only memory...

1231
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,500
I have of my life,

1232
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
is running away and hiding.

1233
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,600
You mean, ever since the war?

1234
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,200
Yes. First the body check
for military service.

1235
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,700
Then the draft notice.

1236
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,100
From civilian and military police.

1237
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,600
It'd be 56 years on August 15.

1238
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,600
This running and hiding.

1239
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,400
I'm just a coward.

1240
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,300
You're not a coward!

1241
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,800
You have real courage!

1242
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,500
Yes! That's true!

1243
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,400
But,

1244
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,200
everybody went to the war.

1245
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,200
I did, but...

1246
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,500
it was so scary.

1247
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,900
When the bullets came,

1248
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,700
I pissed in my pants.

1249
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,500
Rather than being glad
that none of these hit me,

1250
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,500
I was glad I killed no one
during that war.

1251
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,400
Sometimes I think to myself,

1252
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,100
how lucky I was.

1253
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,000
When I think I might
have killed someone,

1254
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,200
- I got scared.
- And after...

1255
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,400
the war?

1256
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,200
I told you it's something
I can't get rid of.

1257
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,800
So sometimes I feel
like running away.

1258
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,200
I feel sorry for you.

1259
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,900
And then?

1260
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,800
Before dawn, he said,

1261
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,700
"After talking to you,
I have my courage back."

1262
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,000
"I'll try running away again."

1263
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,200
I don't understand.

1264
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,800
He's just paranoid.

1265
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,700
As a punk,

1266
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,600
aren't you scared?

1267
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,100
I'm adopted.

1268
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Yes, but he's Jiro's real father.

1269
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,700
You didn't know?

1270
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,300
During one of his disappearances,

1271
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,200
he met a woman...

1272
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,800
and had you.

1273
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,700
If it's true, then who's my mom?

1274
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,500
She died after giving birth to you.

1275
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,800
So,

1276
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,000
your father asked me...

1277
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,800
to look after you.

1278
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,300
- He said so?
- Yes.

1279
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,300
When?

1280
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,400
It's...

1281
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,300
December 8, last year.

1282
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,100
Now...

1283
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,500
congratulations.

1284
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,400
Good job!

1285
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,400
You always deliver.

1286
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,100
It's the drink...

1287
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,300
of a lifetime. Napoleon!

1288
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,500
Yeah!

1289
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,500
I could die now.

1290
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,900
It's great!

1291
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,800
But Prime Minister,

1292
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,700
how about our
Three Anti-Nuclear Principles?

1293
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,000
Yes?

1294
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,800
Finance Minister is old.
So we'll count her out.

1295
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,600
"We won't make women."

1296
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,800
"We won't own women.
We won't handle women."

1297
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,000
Labour Minister is handling one.

1298
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,400
Do you mean Tamiko?

1299
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,200
Yes?

1300
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,700
He had to.

1301
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,500
If he didn't, she'd be in trouble.

1302
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,400
There's no woman to make...

1303
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,200
because there's no woman.

1304
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,200
At least, the handling...

1305
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,400
Oh yes.

1306
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,100
We can talk about that
at our next cabinet meeting.

1307
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,200
The clothes on her...

1308
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,800
how to say this...

1309
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,800
she's in a nightgown.

1310
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,800
It's... a little bit arousing.

1311
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,200
What do you mean?

1312
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,200
About "it"?

1313
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,100
It's a good thing.

1314
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,300
For a boner,

1315
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,000
the wet dreams...

1316
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,000
it's necessary.

1317
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,900
The pre-war Education Ministry
was wrong about it.

1318
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,700
If you say so...

1319
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,000
Go in.

1320
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,900
Tamiko.

1321
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,700
Yes?

1322
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,800
Maybe... you need to
change your clothes.

1323
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,700
Change?

1324
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,900
I have some.

1325
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,300
Here.

1326
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Jiro, turn around.

1327
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
How about us?

1328
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,100
No.

1329
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,400
Why?

1330
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,400
No no... really?

1331
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,000
- Come on.
- But there's etiquette...

1332
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,800
Please,

1333
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,500
turn around.
That's the right thing.

1334
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,000
I see.

1335
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,600
Pity... let's turn around.

1336
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,400
<i>The next day, August 11.</i>

1337
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,900
<i>No more gas.</i>

1338
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,900
<i>Was this Ichiro's revenge?</i>

1339
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,200
<i>But no one in Yamatai
made a fuss of it.</i>

1340
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,000
<i>But,</i>

1341
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,500
<i>more work for Labour Minister.</i>

1342
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
<i>Me and Tamiko,
now Interior Minister,</i>

1343
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,500
<i>went to the nearby timber yard...</i>

1344
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,300
<i>to buy wood on their order.</i>

1345
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,500
Jiro, there's smoke from your logs.

1346
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,600
Is something burning?

1347
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,400
What?

1348
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,400
<i>August 13.</i>

1349
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,100
<i>No more electricity.</i>

1350
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,800
<i>Army Minister suggested
stealing it from the street lamp.</i>

1351
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,500
<i>The one to climb the lamp pole
was of course...</i>

1352
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,500
<i>Labour Minister.</i>

1353
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Only you today?

1354
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,100
He went somewhere.

1355
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,700
It's so busy now!

1356
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
What are you doing, young sir?

1357
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,100
Me?

1358
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,800
Catching cicadas.

1359
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,700
Oh.

1360
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,100
Get down.

1361
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,600
I found out who owned this car.

1362
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,600
Who?

1363
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,900
It's been repainted
but it's your dad's.

1364
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,300
From the plates?

1365
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,500
Sorry.

1366
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,000
He's probably...

1367
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,800
- Why?
- Luminol test is positive?

1368
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,600
No trace of blood,
but someone's fingerprints.

1369
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,000
Who?

1370
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,400
Iimuro, a Kansai hitman.

1371
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,400
Iimuro?

1372
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,800
Know him?

1373
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,600
Yes.

1374
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,200
Down!

1375
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,300
That's him?

1376
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,500
No, he doesn't use guns.

1377
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,900
Icepick.

1378
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,700
You know what your dad's doing?

1379
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,600
Tomorrow, I'll kill him for you.

1380
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
5 million.
The rest, tomorrow.

1381
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,500
Jiro?

1382
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,500
Also tomorrow.

1383
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,000
I'll kill him.

1384
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,500
- A long trip?
- Yes.

1385
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,300
1 year in Sri Lanka.

1386
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,500
See you.

1387
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,000
<i>August 14.</i>

1388
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,000
<i>A lavish breakfast.</i>

1389
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,200
<i>Actually, Finance Minister's
funds have run out.</i>

1390
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,600
<i>One dried plum each
to go with the rice.</i>

1391
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
Telephone, gas, electricity.

1392
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,000
Water is next.

1393
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,600
But you've all lived
through the war.

1394
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,200
You're all survivors.

1395
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,500
Now's the time
to repeat the experience.

1396
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,600
You can do it again.

1397
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,500
To us, this is just camping.

1398
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,100
- Right?
- Yes.

1399
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,100
The thing...

1400
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,800
is what will come next, for sure.

1401
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,400
Air raids.

1402
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,800
Well I...

1403
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,200
had a freaky experience
in the first raid.

1404
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,400
The Doolittle Raid
was the first on Japan.

1405
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,200
The Hornet bombers came...

1406
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,200
and dropped the bombs.

1407
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,500
B-25 bombers flew
all the way from China.

1408
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,800
At that time,

1409
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,000
I was eating noodles
at an eatery in Sendagaya.

1410
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,900
And then,

1411
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,900
the bicycle shop the next door
from the next...

1412
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
You're lucky.

1413
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,000
I think the life line
on my palm saved me.

1414
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,900
Look. Look.

1415
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,300
Very long, to here.

1416
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,200
Let me...

1417
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,400
Lots of memories.

1418
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,900
What I meant by air raids...

1419
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,600
is that an army, no.

1420
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,400
Thugs or gangsters...

1421
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,800
will attack us for sure.

1422
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,300
How would our army
deal with that?

1423
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,500
If we have to fight,

1424
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,300
fight bravely.

1425
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,900
Bravely?

1426
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,400
Yes! We shouldn't...

1427
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,900
forget the meaning of life!

1428
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,700
At that time,

1429
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,600
all we thought about,

1430
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,000
was how to die in dignity
if it's inevitable.

1431
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,200
Oh yes!

1432
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,600
Humans die!

1433
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,300
Yes.

1434
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:57,300
You never thought about it,
Interior Minister?

1435
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,300
Prime Minister...

1436
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,600
not just "at that time",

1437
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,200
lately,

1438
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,900
I feel that way.
I don't know why.

1439
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,900
You too?

1440
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,600
It's the fate of our
Charleston generation.

1441
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,800
The Charleston is popular
these days.

1442
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,800
Yes, Labour Minister.

1443
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,600
We were all born and raised...

1444
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,900
when the Charleston was popular.

1445
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,200
But, Labour Minister,

1446
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,300
what's a little bit disturbing...

1447
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,600
is that its lively rhythm,

1448
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,500
without people noticing,

1449
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,900
was replaced by militarism.

1450
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,900
I don't think so.

1451
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,800
You all have some
sort of war allergy.

1452
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,300
Really?

1453
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,000
Personally,

1454
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,300
before my body aches
here and there,

1455
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,500
when I hear
<i>When The Saints Go Marching In</i>,

1456
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,200
I feel I could just die happily.

1457
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,100
That's great. I'll go there too.

1458
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,700
Really?

1459
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
If you say,
"do it for your country",

1460
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,800
I can understand the
nature of this country.

1461
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,900
But not that one.

1462
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,900
You don't understand?

1463
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,600
Listen.

1464
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,000
"For your country" but why?
I didn't understand then.

1465
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,600
And I don't understand now either.

1466
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,300
"There are too many citizens,"

1467
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,700
"we can't take care of everyone."

1468
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,000
"Our territory..."

1469
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,300
"that is..."

1470
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,000
"becoming the Fujiyama..."

1471
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,400
Politics is...

1472
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,700
just a political party,

1473
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,800
and the black veil it creates.

1474
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,500
I don't want to die...

1475
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,500
for these things.

1476
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,200
I hate it!

1477
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,000
I hate to hear you
talk about dying!

1478
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,500
And you too!

1479
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,400
It's OK, Interior Minister.

1480
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,100
Even if they kill us,

1481
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,800
we won't die!

1482
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,500
Actually, it's for you
young people...

1483
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,500
let's forget it. I'm too pushy.

1484
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,500
By the way, radio gymnastics...

1485
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,700
didn't come for a couple of days.

1486
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,200
Instead,

1487
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,600
let's dance the Charleston!

1488
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,600
We'll teach you how,
Labour and Interior Ministers.

1489
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,400
<i>Announcement for
the neighbourhood.</i>

1490
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,900
<i>Air raid alarm that
you used to know,</i>

1491
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,600
<i>an air raid alarm was just issued.</i>

1492
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,600
<i>Several enemy targets...</i>

1493
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,000
<i>have turned around the corner
and invading our skies.</i>

1494
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,100
<i>Keep the highest alert.</i>

1495
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,100
It's here!

1496
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,000
The old newspaper collector
is helping us!

1497
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,500
Dad! It's Dad's voice!

1498
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,200
Why haven't I noticed?

1499
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,600
They're here!

1500
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,400
Bastards!

1501
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,500
An old man's advice.

1502
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,200
Here's my last words.

1503
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,800
Our country...

1504
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,800
wants to remain the
eastern Switzerland.

1505
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,500
Foreign Minister,

1506
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,600
you'll settle this...

1507
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,600
diplomatically and peacefully.

1508
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,700
If that fails,

1509
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,900
and we must go into war,

1510
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,000
Labour Minister,

1511
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,300
you'll call the police.

1512
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,500
We're asking the Japanese
police to help us?

1513
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,600
I've paid the first half
of my citizen tax.

1514
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,200
Excuse me,

1515
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,900
I have some little things to do.

1516
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,000
Me too!

1517
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,800
Us too!

1518
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,400
Finance Minister, you first.

1519
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,400
The others,

1520
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,900
line up according to age.

1521
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,300
Open up!

1522
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,300
It's open.

1523
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,300
But don't touch the door knob.

1524
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,900
If you do,
you're invading our territory.

1525
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,600
Electric chair is your punishment.

1526
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,900
Shut up, old hat!

1527
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,300
Are they dead?

1528
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
They asked for it.

1529
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,400
But you just said...

1530
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,300
The enemy said "old hat".

1531
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,000
This is a taboo term.
So it's a different story.

1532
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,300
This?

1533
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,900
I was once...

1534
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,200
an anti-aircraft artillery captain.

1535
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:39,000
I'll shoot down a plane!

1536
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,400
Idiot, reach!

1537
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,000
OK! Reach!

1538
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,500
- Reach!  - Come on!
- Who's he?

1539
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,700
Iimuro the hitman. Chase him!

1540
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,300
When did you come?

1541
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,000
They don't understand what I said.

1542
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,400
Never mind.

1543
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,300
How's your countrymen?
Are they OK?

1544
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,500
<i>A lot of them got hurt.</i>

1545
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,100
<i>But not serious.</i>

1546
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,000
<i>Because of the activity,</i>

1547
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,200
<i>they're in high spirits.</i>

1548
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,400
<i>But...</i>

1549
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,500
<i>the primal scream of Tamiko...</i>

1550
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,300
<i>revealed that
Education Minister was down.</i>

1551
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,000
<i>The wounds weren't serious,</i>

1552
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,500
<i>maybe his heart has gone out...</i>

1553
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,900
<i>because of the vigorous activity?</i>

1554
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,900
<i>We all agreed that he's dying.</i>

1555
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,900
Hey.

1556
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,300
Hey?

1557
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,600
What's wrong with you all?

1558
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,000
I'm...

1559
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,000
OK.

1560
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,400
Yes!

1561
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
Your life line is long!

1562
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,600
But...

1563
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,100
I'm...

1564
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,400
so sleepy.

1565
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,900
No! Don't sleep!

1566
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,600
Don't sleep! Education Minister.

1567
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:11,200
We're all going to the
hot spring tomorrow!

1568
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,000
No!

1569
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,000
Don't sleep!

1570
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,600
Do something, Labour Minister!

1571
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,500
Put on some music!

1572
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,200
Don't let him sleep!

1573
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,900
Damn you!

1574
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,800
Prime Minister.

1575
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,900
Is there anything I can do?

1576
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,200
I hate the establishment,

1577
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,900
but I like you.

1578
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,200
I have only one favour to ask.

1579
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,500
OK.

1580
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,400
If his death is unnatural,

1581
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,900
there will be a
compulsory autopsy?

1582
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,600
Yes.

1583
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,500
Please give us one night.

1584
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,000
That's all.

1585
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,400
For him, we want...

1586
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,300
a wake at a proper place.

1587
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,000
OK.

1588
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,300
But just one night.

1589
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,200
Oh my!

1590
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,100
The quake disturbed me,

1591
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,300
I'll start counting again.

1592
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,700
1... 2... 3...

1593
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,500
- I was scared!
- It's OK now.

1594
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,500
The cop called you and
said he's coming here.

1595
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,200
What for?

1596
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,200
He found Dad's body?

1597
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,700
And?

1598
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,900
He and the pickup were
thrown into Tokyo Bay.

1599
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,900
The earthquake just then
was in Tokyo and Kanagawa.

1600
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,700
5 on the seismic scale.

1601
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,600
At the same time,

1602
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,000
in the residential area
of Higashi-Tama,

1603
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:43,600
a big explosion occurred
in Yamatai House.

1604
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:47,300
No information on casualties
or any other things.

1605
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,200
Jiro too?

1606
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,700
It's like I played a trick,

1607
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,100
or cutting corners. Sorry.

1608
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,300
The cop?

1609
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,000
Good evening.

1610
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
Good evening.

1611
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,200
Hey you!

1612
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,700
Because of the thugs you hired,

1613
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,500
Education Minister is dead.

1614
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,600
We're having a wake here.

1615
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,000
What?

1616
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,500
- Labour Minister.
- Yes?

1617
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,100
Let him lie on a bed.

1618
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,400
Go upstairs.

1619
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,200
- Jiro!  - What?
- Not upstairs.

1620
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,100
It's not ready upstairs?

1621
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
It's OK with me.

1622
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,300
Now,

1623
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,000
to prevent the ashes
from dropping,

1624
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,000
please offer your incense
one by one.

1625
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,000
A wake...

1626
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:40,100
is to drink, eat, make merry...

1627
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,600
as a tribute to the deceased.

1628
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,800
In such a nice house,

1629
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,000
there must be something...

1630
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,900
to eat and drink.

1631
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,800
Yes, madam?

1632
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,700
Thank you very much.

1633
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,200
And this gentleman,

1634
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,600
have I seen you before?

1635
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,100
His poster!

1636
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,200
City Councillor...

1637
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,000
Terao something.

1638
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,100
Why are you here?

1639
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,300
No, Labour Minister.

1640
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,400
He must have a reason
to be here.

1641
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,900
To have the City Councillor
at this wake,

1642
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,800
it must be...

1643
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,000
fate?

1644
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,700
Now,

1645
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,900
let us offer incense
to the deceased.

1646
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,600
Please line up by age.

1647
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,000
The youngest first.

1648
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,700
<i>About the explosion just then,</i>

1649
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,400
<i>luckily, there's no casualties.</i>

1650
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,400
<i>End of bulletin.</i>

1651
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
You prepared this too!

1652
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,900
Thank you! Thank you!

1653
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,800
Prime Minister,

1654
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,700
it should be kept by
Finance Minister?

1655
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,600
Yes.

1656
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,600
Thank you.

1657
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,600
Let's do this.

1658
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,600
Let's do this.

1659
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,500
This way to the bath and toilet.
Hot water is ready.

1660
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
Beer, the fridge.
Whisky, over there.

1661
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,200
Brandy, the study.

1662
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,900
Bring them up! Thanks.

1663
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,200
Food...

1664
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,600
please cook for us, madam.

1665
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,300
Mahjong room is there.

1666
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,600
Karaoke, there.

1667
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,600
This... is home invasion!

1668
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,400
Gang robbery!

1669
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:06,200
- I'll call the police!
- Go ahead.

1670
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,600
Is it OK to let them know
why you are here?

1671
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:13,300
But if you don't mind,
go ahead.

1672
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Instead, let's play some mahjong.

1673
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,900
Don't cry.

1674
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,000
Hey.

1675
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,300
He died happily.

1676
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,600
We're with him.

1677
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,600
Dancing the Charleston.

1678
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,800
He's not in pain.

1679
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,800
He died smiling.

1680
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,800
You're wrong, Jiro!

1681
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,800
Why?

1682
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,400
Why...

1683
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,200
did you do such
a thing that night?

1684
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,600
That night?

1685
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,900
Attempted rape?

1686
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,300
Don't. Not before the dead.

1687
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,000
I'm...

1688
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,000
sad to see that!

1689
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,500
Don't cry like that
before the dead.

1690
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,900
Always the dead!

1691
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,600
It's bad for the dead.

1692
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,900
No... I say no...

1693
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,400
Was it him?

1694
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,500
Probably.

1695
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,000
Just a discharge of gas?

1696
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,200
Oh come on!

1697
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,200
Nagging and mumbling!

1698
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,500
I've been listening.

1699
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,100
You knew it?

1700
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,500
Only I didn't know it...

1701
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,100
But,

1702
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,900
when that cop held my hand,

1703
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,700
I was scared!

1704
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,900
Will you...

1705
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:23,000
"Beep beep!
10 km over! License please!"

1706
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,600
We got you!

1707
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,100
1 Fan, 2 Fan, 3...

1708
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,500
8 Fans!

1709
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,700
Me, only 3 Fans.

1710
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,500
Only 10 Fans for me.

1711
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,900
Prime Minister.

1712
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,300
This has been bugging me.

1713
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:04,200
I really want to say this.

1714
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,200
What is it?

1715
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,900
I wasn't...

1716
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,000
an...

1717
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:16,000
army nurse.

1718
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,000
I know.

1719
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:23,600
You know I was an army prostitute?

1720
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,900
Yes. I know that.

1721
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,100
But,

1722
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,000
you're now Finance Minister.

1723
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,200
Your workload was others' double.

1724
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,800
I think,

1725
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,900
from now on,
your joys should be...

1726
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,900
others' double.

1727
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,600
I'm back.

1728
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,800
My turn! Everybody's doing fine.

1729
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,800
We now have 5 million.

1730
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,500
You should get more.

1731
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,900
- You don't have any compensation.
- Oh yes.

1732
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,900
Then we'll...

1733
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,900
have 20 million.

1734
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,800
We're going for a walk.

1735
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,800
No. Labour Minister is busy.

1736
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,200
Don't just sit here.

1737
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,700
We'll run away before dawn.

1738
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,900
Then take the coach to a hot spring.

1739
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,700
Get the coach ready,

1740
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,100
Hot spring?

1741
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:48,200
Great!
Men and women together!

1742
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,500
I know a rental car park.

1743
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:54,000
Oh yes! Loan companies,
supermarkets, restaurants

1744
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,000
grills, pachinkos, car rentals.

1745
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,700
- Ours?
- Let's go!

1746
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,200
Let's go!

1747
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,200
Education Minister.

1748
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,300
I have something to do.

1749
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,700
Don't disturb...

1750
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,700
the young people!

1751
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,600
Army Minister!

1752
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,400
I won't!

1753
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,600
I know it's a wake.
Sorry to disturb you,

1754
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,500
but may we come in?

1755
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,800
Idiot!

1756
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,600
You take over.
I'm old. And I'm tired.

1757
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:05,700
Do it good.

1758
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Sorry to get in your fun.

1759
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,000
Please listen to me.

1760
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,800
Thanks.

1761
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,500
Thanks. Thanks.

1762
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:23,800
You're Ichiro, the family head.

1763
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,000
And Masako the widow.

1764
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,700
- Widow?
- Yes, widow.

1765
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,700
And also...

1766
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,700
City Councillor Terao.

1767
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,600
Good you're here.
It saves me time.

1768
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,900
I told him to come! Hurry up!

1769
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,400
Yes!

1770
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,400
I was about to win!

1771
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,200
OK then.

1772
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,500
I'll skip to the conclusion.

1773
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,300
Those 3 people...

1774
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,800
are important witnesses...

1775
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,500
for the murder of
Munechika Okonogi.

1776
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,300
I've got a car.

1777
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,700
Let's go.

1778
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,900
- Too quick!
- You're kidding!

1779
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,500
I'm his son,
why would I kill him?

1780
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,800
Is this saying popular?

1781
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,800
This is the modern times,
up until now...

1782
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,100
I don't understand.

1783
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:12,700
And I'm his wife.

1784
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,500
This wife simply...

1785
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:20,300
abandoned her husband like
an old shoe. I don't understand.

1786
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,200
This is Camus?

1787
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,000
The easiest part...

1788
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,700
is the one who's trying...

1789
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,700
to share the pie. Mr. Terao.

1790
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,800
What? How dare you!

1791
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,500
How dare I? Then show me the pie.

1792
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,800
I win!

1793
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,900
10 Fans!

1794
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,900
Loan companies, supermarkets,

1795
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,900
grills, pachinkos, car rentals...

1796
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,600
Not only those.

1797
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,500
You make grenade parts...

1798
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,800
in your factory in Gamagori
and sell them to Southeast Asia.

1799
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,700
Is that true?

1800
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,400
So you're a merchant of death?

1801
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,800
Wait. The round is not over.

1802
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,200
So you guys...

1803
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,400
need millions of operation funds?

1804
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:19,500
I made a lot of investigations.

1805
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,700
I did them!

1806
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,300
Also,

1807
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,000
widow Masako,

1808
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,800
you've been involved...

1809
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:33,200
with Terao since you
were a schoolgirl.

1810
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,500
What does that have
to do with murder?

1811
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,900
What does...
You stole my lines!

1812
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,200
You, and your world...

1813
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,600
are in a peculiar condition.

1814
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:52,000
This Camus is fabulous!

1815
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,000
But what's bugging me...

1816
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:57,700
is something
I don't understand.

1817
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,800
I'm now asking you about that.

1818
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,100
The important witness,

1819
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,900
Munechika Okonogi, his corpse
was found in Tokyo Bay.

1820
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,600
The assailant is Iimuro the hitman.

1821
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:14,800
The world-renowned Japanese
police are going to risk anything...

1822
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,800
to arrest this man!

1823
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,900
Good.

1824
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,700
Nice job, idiot!

1825
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,700
By the way, where's Jiro?

1826
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,700
He's...

1827
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,200
probably...

1828
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,400
raping someone?

1829
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:29,800
Time to go now.

1830
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,200
Wait...

1831
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:32,800
Wait a second!

1832
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:37,600
The Yamatai folks.
How about their crimes?

1833
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,200
Home invasion.
Robbing 5 million.

1834
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,200
Playing mahjong, what is...

1835
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:47,700
A cheque of 25.62 million,
30.62 million in total!

1836
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,700
What date is it?

1837
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,400
- August 14.
- No, August 15.

1838
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,400
I'm now retired.

1839
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:58,800
Thanks for...

1840
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,700
everything, idiot.

1841
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:05,300
Take over.

1842
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,200
Think carefully,
and finish the job. OK?

1843
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,000
Get my retirement pay,

1844
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,800
give it to my wife.

1845
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,000
And you, sir?

1846
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,500
I'll go missing and join Yamatai.

1847
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,800
Prime Minister.

1848
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,900
How about Chief of Police?

1849
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:32,900
It's vacant.

1850
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:34,800
But,

1851
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,100
Navy Minister...

1852
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,300
is more fun!

1853
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,400
Yes!

1854
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,000
But I can't swim!

1855
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,900
By the way,
where's Army Minister?

1856
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,600
He went out.

1857
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,900
Here! This way!

1858
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,300
Here it is!

1859
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,200
Excuse me! Coming in!

1860
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,900
The front?

1861
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,300
Or the back?

1862
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,300
Army Minister is sleeping.

1863
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,000
He's tired.

1864
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
He worked a lot.

1865
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:25,200
- Let him sleep.
- This way.

1866
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,800
Prime Minister.

1867
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,300
There's no driver.

1868
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,000
Oh yes!

1869
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,600
I forgot that!

1870
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,300
What to do?

1871
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
You... are...

1872
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,700
Why are you safe?

1873
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,400
When he stabbed me,

1874
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:13,000
there were old newspaper,
magazines and rags wrapped...

1875
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,700
on my belly.

1876
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,900
And I swim better than fish.

1877
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:22,500
He's our Navy Minister,
Prime Minister!

1878
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,500
Yes, the right choice.

1879
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,500
Now we have both army and navy.

1880
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,200
Now,

1881
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,900
let's go!

1882
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,700
Yes.

1883
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,900
Let's sing "Red Shoes"!

1884
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,800
Now, Chief of Police
of Yamatai...

1885
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,300
will lead this song!

1886
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:16,400
1, 2...

1887
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:22,500
<i>The girl with the...</i>

1888
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:27,600
<i>red shoes...</i>

1889
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:33,800
<i>was taken away...</i>

1890
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,100
<i>by a foreigner.</i>

1891
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:44,600
<i>She got on a boat...</i>

1892
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:49,200
<i>in Yokohama.</i>

1893
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:55,000
<i>She was taken away...</i>

1894
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:00,300
<i>by a foreigner.</i>

1895
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:05,400
<i>Now she has...</i>

1896
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:10,400
<i>blue eyes.</i>

1897
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:16,000
<i>She's now in the country...</i>

1898
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:21,400
<i>of the foreigner.</i>

1899
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:26,300
<i>When I see red shoes,</i>

1900
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:31,500
<i>I think of this.</i>

1901
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,300
<i>When I see foreigners,</i>

1902
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:41,500
<i>I think of this.</i>

1903
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:35,000
THE END
