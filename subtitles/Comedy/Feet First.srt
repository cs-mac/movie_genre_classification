1
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,546
Tanner Shoes.
We must live up to our slogan.

2
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,780
"The World Walks
on Tanner Shoes."

3
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,980
Now, you're my manager
down here...

4
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,613
and you've got
to put this store over.

5
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,817
And furthermore,
don't talk back to me.

6
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,294
But I didn't say anything.
I was only thinking...

7
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,194
Don't even think back to me!
I won't have it!

8
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,857
You're here to sell shoes,
not to think.

9
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,264
And if I don't see
some results...

10
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,461
when I get back here
on my next trip, you're fired.

11
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,698
Now, do you understand me?
You're fired!

12
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,898
Give me a match.

13
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,004
Never mind,
I'll light it myself.

14
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,752
Thank you, come again soon.

15
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,827
There you are.

16
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,458
Sets your foot off beautifully.

17
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,525
Now, that's the, uh, 4A...

18
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,800
or what we call
"the perfect model."

19
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,363
What is it?

20
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,703
Oh, why, Madam!

21
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,937
The leather, uh... uh...

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,445
The leather
in the Tanner Shoe...

23
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,506
is made from the hides
of contented cows.

24
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,211
Now, I think
they're very becoming.

25
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,582
What do you think?

26
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,144
I think you'd better cut out
this tomfoolery.

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,248
Go up front
and help trim that window.

28
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,417
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,926
I... I was just practicing
to be a salesman, Mr. Endicott.

30
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,622
You'll never make a salesman.

31
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,325
Salesmanship
is 98% personality...

32
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,594
and that's something
you haven't got.

33
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,568
Oh, yes I have. Look.

34
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,399
Ah! That's not personality,
that's stupidity.

35
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,534
Get up front and help Williams
trim that window.

36
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,737
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,241
It looks very nice.

38
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,979
Yes, it looks smart, too.

39
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,419
You know, it's a 4A...

40
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,320
for what we call
"the perfect foot."

41
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,588
Notice how snug it fits?

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,494
And I have a new sport model
I'd like to show you.

43
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,059
I'd like very much to see it.

44
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,399
Will you pardon me a minute?

45
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,583
I'd like you
to show me something...

46
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,677
in a white Deauville, please.

47
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,016
- Yes, will you be seated?
- Thank you.

48
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,646
I'll have a man wait on you
right away.

49
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,319
Where's the other leg?

50
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,659
I'm gonna get it.
I'll be right back.

51
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,335
- Pardon me.
- Why, of course.

52
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,048
Why...

53
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,591
Now, what in the world
is the matter, Madam?

54
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,287
I never was so insulted
in my life!

55
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,920
I think that left foot's
a little tight.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,363
- Haven't you a larger size?
- Uh, no, I haven't.

57
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,798
But I can have it stretched
for you...

58
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,334
and make it very comfortable.

59
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,869
All right, and while
that's being done...

60
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,302
will you show me
that sport shoe there?

61
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,737
Surely. Boy!

62
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,933
Stretch this shoe.

63
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,610
Does that feel all right?

64
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,621
- Yes.
- Hey.

65
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,384
Just let me lace it up for you.

66
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,361
Well, I think
it's a little tight.

67
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,399
A little tight?

68
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,197
Just let me take it off
and stretch it for you.

69
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,702
There, how's that?

70
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,242
That's all right.

71
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,251
I like that shoe very much.

72
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,913
That shoe he's stretching
looked very serviceable.

73
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,957
I doubt, Madam, if you'll ever
be able to wear it out.

74
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,124
Here, you may leave
fifteen minutes early...

75
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,926
and deliver these
on your way home.

76
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,229
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,462
- How does that feel?
- That feels fine.

78
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,834
I thought it would.

79
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,339
You know, Madam, your instep
is much too beautiful...

80
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,569
to be spoiled
by a short-vamped shoe.

81
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,975
- Oh, do you really think so?
- I certainly do.

82
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,535
Now, that feels very well
in there, doesn't it?

83
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,548
- Yes, it does.
- And it's comfortable?

84
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,642
Madam, your instep
is much too beautiful...

85
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,879
to be spoiled by a sh...

86
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,351
Yes, ma'am. Always, yes, ma'am.

87
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,655
Never!

88
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,093
Would you get me
a glass of water?

89
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,289
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,735
Oh! Oh! You... you idiot!

91
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,743
Oh, of all the dumb tricks!

92
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,836
Look at me! You... you...

93
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,677
Henry, did you put
my music in the car?

94
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,549
Yes, Miss.
It's right on the back seat.

95
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,177
Oh, I have it. Here it is.

96
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,558
Say, pansy.

97
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,869
Yeah? He ain't got no right
bustin' into my car...

98
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,033
that way, either.

99
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,668
Anyway, I think he did it
on purpose.

100
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,075
Get back in the car, Henry.

101
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,013
Don't pay any attention
to this big brute.

102
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,882
Say, lady,
this is a private scrap.

103
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,580
I'll pull that guy
out of the car and...

104
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,316
Here, here. What do you mean
by using that tone of voice...

105
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,652
to this young lady?

106
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,693
Why, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,920
Besides, you have no right...

108
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,122
leaving your car parked here
in other people's way.

109
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,323
Now, listen,
if this happens again...

110
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,263
I'm going to see to it
personally.

111
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,302
Why don't you get a shave?

112
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,769
It's too bad
that this had to happen, Miss.

113
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,331
If he annoys you again,
you just let me know.

114
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,933
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,411
Oh, oh, the pleasure's
really all mine.

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,415
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

117
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,711
- Oh.
- Oh.

118
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,083
Oh, I-I'll get it.

119
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,436
I don't know how I can ever
thank you, Mister...

120
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,811
- Harold.
- Mr. Harold.

121
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,543
Good-bye.

122
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,050
Good-bye.

123
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,155
Oh.

124
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,373
Uh, now,
let that be a lesson to you.

125
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,590
Listen, Kramer,
you're an incompetent idiot.

126
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,357
You haven't got any more
backbone than a steamed clam.

127
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,296
Now, you get busy
and get some results...

128
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,061
or you're discharged,
understand me?

129
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,500
D-i-s... you're fired!

130
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,372
Get me that number back again.

131
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,567
I know, I know.

132
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,236
Hello? Hello.

133
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,279
Is this you, Kramer?

134
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,838
Did I call you an idiot?

135
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,885
I did. OK.

136
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,749
Mr. Tanner,
is there something wrong?

137
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,879
Something? Everything.

138
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,719
If the rest of the people
I have working for me...

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,088
were half as efficient
as you are...

140
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,820
I'd be happy as a schoolboy.

141
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,795
There's no such thing
as a perfect man.

142
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,992
Oh, Mr. Tanner,
I think you're mistaken.

143
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,557
There is.

144
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,003
- There is what?
- A perfect man.

145
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,872
Have you been
holding out on me, young lady?

146
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,844
I met him this afternoon.

147
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,574
She is beautiful.

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,048
You know, Mr. Carson...

149
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,520
l... I've always dreamed
of meeting the one girl.

150
00:10:55,588 --> 00:11:00,321
Today l... I went around
the corner, and there she was.

151
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,324
You've got it bad,
haven't you, my son?

152
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,389
Say, are you gonna talk
about that girl all night...

153
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,866
or are you going
to thread my needle for me?

154
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,268
Huh? Oh, I almost forgot.

155
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,966
I'll get it right away,
Mr. Carson.

156
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,599
When are you gonna
see her again?

157
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,809
Never, I guess.

158
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,781
She's rich, got a big car.

159
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,307
Besides, what chance have I
with eighteen a week?

160
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,581
You'll soon be making
more money than that.

161
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,318
You're going to be a salesman
in a very little while.

162
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,950
Yeah.

163
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,394
A salesman.
A lot of good that'll do.

164
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,954
You know, Mr. Carson...

165
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,196
up till today, I thought being
a salesman was something great.

166
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,706
Gee, a girl that comes
from a family like that, why...

167
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,674
she wouldn't give a salesman
a second look.

168
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,041
Oh, but you are not
always going to be a salesman.

169
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,875
Keep driving on,
and then perhaps...

170
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,142
you will come to be
manager of the store.

171
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,309
Who knows?
In a very little while...

172
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,114
you may be
president of the company.

173
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,248
Gee.

174
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,758
Oh, but that's liable
to take two or three months.

175
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,126
There's got to be
a shortcut somewhere.

176
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,995
Now, then, if I could only
meet her on her own level.

177
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,091
Hmm.

178
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,466
And I'm going to do it, too.

179
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,635
Stick to it, my son.

180
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,442
That's it... sticking.

181
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,176
That's the only way.

182
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,046
I wish only I had stuck.

183
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,468
Sticking to it, huh?

184
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:15,385
And now, gentlemen, we come
to the subject of leather.

185
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,981
Very few people realize
what leather really is...

186
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,891
and what it means to mankind.

187
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,690
Where would we be
without leather?

188
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,161
I ask you.

189
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,563
It's leather that turns
the wheels of our industries!

190
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,571
It's leather
in the time of war...

191
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,735
furnishes our horses with
harness to pull the cannons...

192
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,803
to conquer our enemies!

193
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,975
And then, where would
Napoleon have been...

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,984
without leather
to make a saddle?

195
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,316
He'd have been riding bareback!

196
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,195
And then think!

197
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,165
Think of shoes!

198
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,795
Without them,
we would be uncivilized.

199
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,840
Barefoot like tea garoni.

200
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,314
Could we walk through
snow and slush barefoot?

201
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,946
Could we walk
through the desert barefoot?

202
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,118
No! A thousand times no!

203
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,191
Fine.

204
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,429
That's the way
you should've talked...

205
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,598
at the American Club
two months ago.

206
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,005
Huh.

207
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,872
That was splendid.

208
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,879
Yes, l... I know, Mr. Carson,
it's... it's all right.

209
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,346
I can do it here in the room...

210
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,179
but, I don't know, when I get
out with important people...

211
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,913
gee, l... l... I get
all goose pimples.

212
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,512
Gee, I open my mouth,
and nothing comes out.

213
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,490
Oh, well, I guess
you didn't want the girl...

214
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,652
as much as you thought you did.

215
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,196
Oh, yes, but I do!

216
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,289
Now you listen to me!

217
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,802
You go to the Embassy Club
tonight and speak right up!

218
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,337
When you meet
those big businessmen...

219
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,999
use your correspondence courses!

220
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,565
Lmpress them!

221
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,510
You look the part. Act it!

222
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,137
Sell yourself!

223
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,705
I'll do it! I will!

224
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,751
Now, nothing's gonna stop me
this time!

225
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,420
I hope that's a mistake.

226
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,091
That's a very unfriendly knock.

227
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,236
Shh.

228
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,809
It's Ferguson,
the dress suit man.

229
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,640
I think he's after payment
on his suit.

230
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,804
Oh.

231
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,441
Gee, if I pay him now, I won't
have any money for tonight.

232
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,476
Shh!

233
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,816
Now what am I gonna do?

234
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,759
Out the window,
down the fire escape.

235
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,296
Great! Great!

236
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,490
Your hat!

237
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,930
- Say, son...
- Hmm?

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,025
Have you got that guest card
that I found?

239
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,194
Yes, I got it.

240
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,431
Don't forget. Stick to it!

241
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,871
Yeah, I will.

242
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,112
- Good evening, Mr. Fleming.
- Good evening.

243
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,413
Good evening, sir.
Are you a member?

244
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,646
Oh, uh, son,
have you seen Charlie?

245
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,620
- Charlie?
- Yes.

246
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,123
- Who is Charlie?
- What? You don't know Charlie?

247
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,626
- No, sir.
- Well, he walks like this.

248
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,038
I beg your pardon.
What's the name?

249
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,937
Uh, Jones.

250
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,575
Which Mr. Jones?

251
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,412
Why, the Mr. Jones.

252
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,008
Uh, have you a telegram
for Mr. Jones?

253
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,450
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,215
Charge is 75 cents.

255
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,188
Wrong Jones.

256
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,153
Uh, keep this handy.
I may be leaving suddenly.

257
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,399
Oh, I beg your pardon.

258
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,936
Your Honor,
I have been drinking.

259
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,972
But only a little one, l...

260
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,007
Oh, pardon me.

261
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,138
- You forgot something.
- Something?

262
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,875
Everything.

263
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,282
Oh... you saved my life.

264
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,444
Yeah.

265
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,613
I'm going to do something
for you.

266
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,918
Anything you want,
you just tell me.

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,686
That's all right.

268
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,889
Oh, whoa, so you wanna rassle?

269
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,488
Oh, no, no, no! Please, now.

270
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,761
This is hardly the place
for that.

271
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,362
Well, listen, I know a nice
little place out here, come on.

272
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,996
A great little...

273
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,503
I really, I've got
someplace else I've got...

274
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,239
Oh, come on, now,
and I'll buy you a little drink.

275
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,803
No, really, I never drink.

276
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,042
Well, what do you do,
dip your bread in it?

277
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,414
Come on.

278
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,851
What business are you in?

279
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,325
Oh, uh, uh, I'm in the, uh,
the leather business.

280
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,486
Leather!

281
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:00,191
Oh, that's what they make cows
out of, ain't it?

282
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,096
Heh. Why, certainly not.

283
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,691
That's where
the leather comes from.

284
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,498
They make a lot of things
out of it.

285
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,334
They make shoes and...

286
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,634
Shoes.

287
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,904
That reminds me,
I know a chap you must meet.

288
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,811
Wait a minute. He's a big shoe
and slipper man from the States.

289
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,508
Do you a lot of good.

290
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,313
I have his card here
someplace, now...

291
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,082
Will you look at that?

292
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,056
Lady Pillsbury.

293
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh! Lady Pillsbury?

294
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,089
That big bum.

295
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,463
She was way out in front,
and Mexican Pete nosed her out.

296
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:40,028
Oh, I see.
Lady Pillsbury's a racehorse.

297
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,268
What did you think she was,
a mockingbird?

298
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,309
No, no, uh...

299
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,538
Yes, I met her last night.

300
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,707
Really?

301
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,750
To me, Lady Pillsbury...

302
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,753
is one of the most charming
women I have ever met.

303
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,948
Oh, do tell me more about her.

304
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,149
Yes, do tell us.

305
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,490
Just a minute, just a minute.

306
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,497
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

307
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:12,834
This is Mr. Edgar Cowhide,
a big leather fellow.

308
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,997
- Why, pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

309
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,667
Say, you guys should sort of
get together.

310
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,677
Oh, Charlie, you wait here.

311
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,680
I'm going out and get
a glass of bromo suss...

312
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,875
bromo suss...

313
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,009
A cup of tea. I'll be back.

314
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,757
Yes, uh...

315
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,952
Yes, quite
a droll fellow, huh?

316
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,496
We were just speaking
of Lady Pillsbury.

317
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,326
Oh, really? Hmm.

318
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,266
Yes, she is really
very remarkable.

319
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,133
Well, she was, but not anymore.

320
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,331
Do you know her?

321
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,274
Yes, yes,
oh, I know her well, heh.

322
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,404
Slim legs, brown body,
and a white spot on the head.

323
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,108
Oh, my!

324
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,208
You know, she shouldn't be
allowed in public.

325
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,150
All out of condition.

326
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,452
Fat, flabby...
the old oat burner.

327
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,695
Are you speaking
of the Lady Pillsbury?

328
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,561
Yes, positively.

329
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,193
And listen, take a tip from me
and lay off of this baby.

330
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,136
Heh, why, she should be
pulling a milk wagon.

331
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,745
Well, I shall report that
to the...

332
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,651
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm sure it's been overlooked.

333
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,655
I'll ask him about it
in the morning...

334
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,849
and let you know immediately.

335
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,416
Yes, thank you very much.
Good-bye.

336
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,525
Oh!

337
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,500
Why, hello!

338
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,900
Hello.

339
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,370
L... l... I didn't think
you'd remember me.

340
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,533
And I thought you had
forgotten all about me.

341
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,101
Oh, no, my gracious,
I couldn't...

342
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,841
Gee, every time I see
a truck driver, I think of you.

343
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,246
What?

344
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,377
Oh, well, uh, you see,
what I mean is, heh...

345
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,251
if it hadn't been for that
particular truck driver...

346
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,154
well, I might not
have ever met you.

347
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,420
Oh, that's different.

348
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,086
Yes.

349
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,634
That seems a long time ago, too.
Must be all of six months.

350
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,263
Six months, three weeks,
and two days.

351
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,569
- Well!
- Oh...

352
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,666
Well, I'm glad
you did remember, anyway.

353
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,643
Uh, yes.

354
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,409
Gee, but you don't know
what glad really means.

355
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,279
I never thought
a boy like you...

356
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,819
would give a girl like me
a second thought.

357
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,614
A... A boy like me?

358
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,956
Yes. You have so many things
to think about...

359
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,259
golf, bridge, tennis,
so many things.

360
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,494
Oh, yes, well, I, uh...

361
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,128
I do think of them
from time to time.

362
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,365
Of course, I suppose you go in
for golf and tennis a lot.

363
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,908
Oh, no, I haven't the time.

364
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,842
Oh. Oh, well, I understand.

365
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,743
I love an athlete.

366
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,441
You do?

367
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,812
Uh-huh.

368
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,851
Oh. What's his name?

369
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,753
Oh, no! I mean I admire
the athletic type.

370
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,848
Like yourself.

371
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,552
Like me?

372
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,992
- Yes.
- Oh.

373
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,927
I bet you're a corker at polo.

374
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,192
Oh, well...

375
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,166
I, uh... I never bet.

376
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,033
Oh! What was that?

377
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,271
I guess it was an earthquake.

378
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,544
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,911
Oh.

380
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,540
Oh, we're all tangled up.

381
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,845
Hmm? Oh.

382
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,785
Oh, what do you think of that?
I'll get it.

383
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,948
These beads
are such a nuisance.

384
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,422
I shouldn't have worn them.

385
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:59,920
Oh, I think these are the nicest
beads that I've ever seen.

386
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,397
There.

387
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,491
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

388
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,763
- You're welcome.
- Am I?

389
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,133
- Isn't it lovely...
- I think that...

390
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,911
Everyone seems
to be having a glorious time.

391
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,315
Yes, don't they?

392
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,185
Well, well, I'm having
a fine time, great time.

393
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,989
Oh!
We're all tangled up again.

394
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,459
Hmm?

395
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,053
Well, what do you think of that?

396
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,690
- I'll get it.
- Oh, no, no. I'll get it.

397
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,564
Are you getting along all right?

398
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,106
Well, I don't know.

399
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,835
I've never been tangled
with a pretty girl before.

400
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,946
It's so lovely here.
I hate to think of leaving.

401
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,951
Leaving!

402
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,509
Soon?

403
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,748
Yes, we're going to the mainland
at the end of the week.

404
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,551
Oh.

405
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:03,151
Are you thinking
of going to the States soon?

406
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,287
Well, I don't know.

407
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,524
The way things
have been going, well...

408
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,432
anything might happen.

409
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,231
Wouldn't it be a coincidence...

410
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,602
if we both sailed
on the same boat?

411
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,904
Coincidence?

412
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,443
Lt'd be a miracle.

413
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,939
Ooh, old Kid Leather himself.

414
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,110
He knows more about leather than
a husband knows about trouble.

415
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,244
Mr. Tanner, meet Mister, uh...

416
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,583
- Mister, uh...
- Harold.

417
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:35,183
Harold. Mr. Harold,
Mr. Tanner is a shoemaker.

418
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,693
- Tanner?
- Yes.

419
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,958
I'm very pleased to meet you,
I'm sure.

420
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,933
I'm in the shoe manufacturing
business.

421
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,402
No doubt you've heard
of Tanner Shoe stores.

422
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,871
Oh, yes, sir.

423
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,636
Yes, I've been in them
quite a bit.

424
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,735
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

425
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,372
The one that helped me
with the truck driver.

426
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,814
Oh, yes, you did say
something about that.

427
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,180
Well, this is indeed
a pleasure...

428
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,445
to meet someone
whose interests...

429
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,350
are practically
the same as mine.

430
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,979
Oh, yes, yes, that's right.

431
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:10,050
Ooh. I gotta get
a bromo switch... a little...

432
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,829
- A peculiar boy.
- Yes.

433
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,268
So, uh, you're
in the leather business, huh?

434
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,865
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You see, Mr. Tanner...

435
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,309
very few people realize
what leather really is...

436
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,643
and what it means to mankind.

437
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,773
It's leather
in the time of war...

438
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,044
furnishes our horses
with harness...

439
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,417
to pull the cannons,
to conquer our enemies.

440
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,184
Where would Napoleon
have been...

441
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,485
without leather
to make a saddle?

442
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,550
Heh. Why, he would've been
riding bareback.

443
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,495
And then think of shoes.

444
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,691
Could we walk through
snow and slush barefoot?

445
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,860
- No!
- No!

446
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,334
Could we walk
through the desert barefoot?

447
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:56,135
- No!
- No! A thousand times no!

448
00:27:56,207 --> 00:28:00,803
Why, shoes are the greatest
things in the world.

449
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,042
Heh, we should thank heaven
for shoes, Mr. Tanner.

450
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,447
Quite so, quite so.

451
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,419
Say, you seem
to have made a study of it.

452
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,615
Oh, well, heh, I am studying
one thing or another...

453
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,420
most of the time, heh.

454
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,789
Where do you make
your headquarters?

455
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,296
Hmm? Oh, uh,
oh, practically anywhere.

456
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,491
Oh, quite a globe trotter.

457
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,796
We're leaving ourselves
by the end of the week.

458
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,495
I don't suppose,
by any chance...

459
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,198
that you'll be going back
to America on the same boat?

460
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,674
Uh, well, yes, and no.

461
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,074
You see, the fact is...

462
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,181
I thought I heard a bell.

463
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,341
So did I.

464
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,408
Oh, well, you hear
a lot of funny things...

465
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,953
down here in the tropics.

466
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,014
Mosquitoes and dragons
and bananas and...

467
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,160
Oh, pardon me.

468
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,060
Uh, yes? Yes.

469
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,464
Yes, ye... no! No.

470
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,128
Yes, now,
as I was about to say...

471
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,734
No, no, I don't want to hear
anything further about it.

472
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,933
No...

473
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,467
Well, uh, now, uh...

474
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,571
there is, uh...
yes, uh, there's just a chance.

475
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,808
That's a way out.

476
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,751
But $50,000 is tough.
Good-bye.

477
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,950
Those interruptions are, uh,
very annoying, aren't they?

478
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,924
I'm terribly sorry.

479
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,984
Uh, what was it I was, um...

480
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,498
Oh, Mr. Harold, I realize
what it means to be busy.

481
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,793
Oh, yeah.

482
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,298
What? It's a lie!

483
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,575
Hello, hello, hello.

484
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,670
L... oh, look.

485
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,376
There's a big shoot-and-boo man
in there you must meet.

486
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,475
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

487
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,917
Well, how's everything
with you now?

488
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,955
Oh, no, no, I, uh...

489
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:54,219
- Oh, don't be blashful.
- I'll be right back.

490
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,193
Now, now, please, now, wait.

491
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,163
He seems like
a very bright young fellow.

492
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,997
He must be, to be
in the position he is today.

493
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,558
No, no, no, no, no.

494
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,502
I don't think
I'll go over there.

495
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,767
Well, I'll bring him over here.

496
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,708
Oh, Mr. Endicott...

497
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,210
Mr. Endicott.

498
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,683
I want you to meet Mister...

499
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,059
Mister... s'gone!

500
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,995
Somebody stole my pal!

501
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,965
Somebody stole my pal.

502
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,160
My pal.

503
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,265
- Why, here he is now.
- Eh?

504
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,206
I beg your pardon, sir.

505
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,870
- Here's Charlie.
- Huh?

506
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,107
- Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

507
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,206
Charlie who?

508
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,683
Why, the Charlie
you were asking for.

509
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,220
Oh.

510
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,653
Oh, well,
that's not the Charlie I mean.

511
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,021
The Charlie I mean,
he walks like this.

512
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,095
Say, what sort of a game
are you playing on me here?

513
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,634
Madam, your instep
is much too beautiful...

514
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,675
to be spoiled
by a short vamp shoe.

515
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,209
Do you really think so?

516
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,077
Think so? Why, Madam, if it
were not for the disloyalty...

517
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,581
to my firm, I assure you
I would not allow it...

518
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,844
to be covered by a shoe.

519
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,388
That foot belongs to the statue
of a Greek goddess.

520
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:36,291
Really? Well, I'll wear these,
and you can send me three pair.

521
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,295
Oh, certainly. Three?

522
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,263
- Four.
- I'll wrap up five pair.

523
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,266
Oh, all right.
And here is the address.

524
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,461
Are you sure
they'll be delivered today?

525
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,800
Madam, the shoes
will be home ahead of you.

526
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,203
Thank you.

527
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,935
Good work. Keep it up.

528
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,308
That's what I mean.
That's personality.

529
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,774
There, that's just
what I'm looking for.

530
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,785
A low cut model with a strap.

531
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,117
Why, that shoe has no strap,
Mrs. Tanner.

532
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,281
Hmm?

533
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:10,350
Well, that was
most absurd of me.

534
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,554
While you're selecting
your shoes...

535
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,563
I'm going over here
to look for some stockings.

536
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,394
Very well.

537
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,234
Good morning, Monsieur... uh,
Madam.

538
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,863
Good morning.

539
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,465
- Uh, be seated, please.
- Thank you.

540
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,145
Are you looking for something
in the way of shoes?

541
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,079
Yes, I'm interested
in that Queen's model...

542
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,879
you have in the window.

543
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,683
I'll take three or four pair
if you have them in my size.

544
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,279
Well...

545
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,587
Now, that's too bad.

546
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,355
Well, what's too bad,
young man?

547
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,920
Why, Madam, your instep
is much too beautiful...

548
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,967
to be spoiled
by a short vamp shoe.

549
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,524
Thank you.

550
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,796
Why, that foot
would do justice...

551
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,031
to the statue
of a Greek goddess.

552
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,270
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

553
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,314
Pardon me just a moment.

554
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,550
These are the stockings
I was telling you about.

555
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,225
Why, they're really an excellent
quality, aren't they?

556
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,022
Would you like me
to order some for you?

557
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,497
Order me three pair,
will you?

558
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,090
All right.

559
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,010
This, uh...

560
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,947
This is, uh...

561
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,282
one of our latest models
in sportswear.

562
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,344
- Pretty.
- Yes. I hope you like it.

563
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,253
Ouch!

564
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,621
What are you doing?

565
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,228
I beg your pardon. My mistake.

566
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,330
Madame, your instep
is much too beautiful...

567
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,062
to be spoiled
by a short vamp shoe.

568
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:02,004
- You said that before.
- I repeat it!

569
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,304
Well, it does look rather nice.

570
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,444
On your feet,
any shoe would look lovely.

571
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,142
Even a horseshoe.

572
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,446
I beg your pardon.

573
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,646
I beg your pardon.

574
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,848
I mean that if anyone
deliberately set out to...

575
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,723
they couldn't spoil
the beauty and symmetry...

576
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,352
of a foot like that.

577
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,863
Well, now, that is charming
of you to say that.

578
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,728
Oh, not at all.

579
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,132
It's the truth,
and the truth never hurts.

580
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,999
I'll think I'll have
four pair of those.

581
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,265
Yes, surely.

582
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,671
Oh, never mind the check.
I'll explain to my husband.

583
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,643
I am Mrs. Tanner.

584
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,646
- Mrs. Tanner?
- Yes.

585
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:50,085
Mrs. John Quincy Tanner?

586
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,122
The same.

587
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,819
Oh, well,
now does that feel comfortable?

588
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,061
Young man, you are insolent.

589
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,569
- Beg your pardon.
- Well, you should.

590
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,400
I am very sorry.

591
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,565
- I didn't mean it.
- No.

592
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,732
I was just a little fussed,
Madam.

593
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,299
- Yes.
- And, you see...

594
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,402
it's a great honor
to be waiting on Mrs. John...

595
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,972
Quincy...

596
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,244
Tanner.

597
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,651
Well, of course, if you're going
to put it like that.

598
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,120
Now, if you'd stand up,
please, and try those.

599
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,986
Yes, certainly.
I always like to try...

600
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,792
Oh!

601
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,989
Oh, my goodness.

602
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,326
- Unhand me!
- I'm sorry!

603
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,195
Oh!

604
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,791
Oh!

605
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,199
Well, it's a good thing
that you're so light...

606
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,797
or you might have hurt yourself.

607
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,639
Well, I have been dieting
recently.

608
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,372
Yes, you can really tell that.

609
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,573
I tried rowing for a while.

610
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,275
Well, dieting
is a very nice habit.

611
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,818
- Yes, it is.
- Personally, I prefer fish.

612
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,353
Huh? Oh.

613
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,049
Now then, uh, these are a model
that we're very proud of.

614
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,357
Well, sir, I never had such
a comfortable shoe on my foot.

615
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,863
- Really?
- How do you like these, Madam?

616
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,230
- How much are they?
- Just $15.

617
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,269
$15? Ridiculous!

618
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,271
- Put the old ones back on.
- Yes, Ma'am.

619
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,034
Why, they're gone!

620
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,973
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

621
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,271
I had them on when I came in.

622
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,971
Yes, Ma'am.

623
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,606
Why, there they are!
Lady, you've got on my shoes.

624
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,014
Take them off immediately.

625
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,052
Why, what...

626
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,644
Young man,
you're to blame for this.

627
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,983
You take those horrible shoes
off my feet.

628
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,387
Horrible shoes?

629
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,186
Well, my shoes are no more
horrible than yours.

630
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,521
I've got a very dainty foot.

631
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,027
- Are you ready?
- Yes, just about.

632
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,357
I want to buy some lace
next door.

633
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,658
I'll meet you in the car.

634
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,426
Well, I'll be with you
right away.

635
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,899
Say no more about it.
Say no more about it.

636
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,300
Well, I can't imagine
how such a thing could happen.

637
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,634
No, of course you couldn't.

638
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,004
Well, Mrs. Tanner,
it's never happen again.

639
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,407
I know very well it won't,
because you won't be here.

640
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,104
Oh, please.

641
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,544
- What is it?
- Pardon me.

642
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,972
Now what are you doing?

643
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,576
That's a bright move.

644
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,985
Are you deliberately trying
to make a fool out of me?

645
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,717
Yes, Ma'am... no, Ma'am!

646
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,658
You get my shoe and get it on
my foot. Let me get out of here.

647
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,793
You'll hear from this,
young man.

648
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,387
You'll find out that you can't
insult Mrs. Tanner...

649
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,228
with impunity
and get away with it.

650
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,632
You'll hear from me later
regarding this...

651
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,365
Oh, oh, oh!

652
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,798
Oh, I'm on fire!

653
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,709
Hurry, police! Water!

654
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,269
Something has got to help me!

655
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,610
Don't stand there
like a wooden Indian!

656
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,985
Officer, is it all right
to take these shoes aboard?

657
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,495
No, son, you can't go on.

658
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,156
But I gave the lady
my personal assurance...

659
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,700
that I would take them aboard!

660
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,928
Well, all right,
but make it snappy.

661
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,300
- We're sailing in five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

662
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,565
All right, I will.

663
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,032
All ashore that's going ashore!

664
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,536
- Oh, Mr. Harold!
- Huh?

665
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,768
- Oh!
- Oh, hello!

666
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,834
- Hello!
- Well, hello.

667
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,710
I'm so glad
you're going to be onboard.

668
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,908
Huh?

669
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,081
Oh, yes.

670
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,054
We'll have a glorious time
on the trip to the mainland...

671
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,646
won't we?

672
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,158
Uh, that's right.

673
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,862
Oh, there are the folks.

674
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,368
They'll be glad to see you.
Come on!

675
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,733
Oh, but now...

676
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,602
There's that woman that we met
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

677
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,039
- Huh? Let's see.
- There.

678
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,044
Aw, you're crazy.
That's not that woman at all.

679
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,272
Now, just what do you mean?

680
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,042
Say, you've got
the funniest complex.

681
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,640
You think you've met
everybody that you see.

682
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,844
Yes? Really?

683
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,649
Look who's here!

684
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,950
- Well!
- Hello.

685
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,287
And what do you think?
He's going with us!

686
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,328
Well, Mr. Harold, now,
it's a pleasure to have you...

687
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,488
with us on the trip.

688
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,226
Oh, this is my wife,
Mrs. Tanner.

689
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,597
This is Mr. Harold.

690
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,330
- Harold. Harold?
- How do you do?

691
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,739
Why, haven't we met
someplace before?

692
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,709
Well, uh, that's
quite possible Mrs. Tanner.

693
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,338
You see, I, uh,
I might have been there.

694
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,383
There you go with that
funny complex of yours again.

695
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,476
She's always mistaking
somebody for somebody else.

696
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,317
- She's funny that way.
- Thank you, darling!

697
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,085
Well, they'll be leaving
any moment now.

698
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,921
Let's go up front
and see the excitement.

699
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,927
Uh, well, uh,
you know, I'll be right back.

700
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,519
I've got to get some cigars.

701
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,930
Oh, here now, don't bother.
Why, try one of mine.

702
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,366
Hey.

703
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,739
Someday they'll make
one way cigars.

704
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,245
- Barbara.
- Yes?

705
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,213
Is that or is that not
the woman that we met...

706
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,773
at The Royal Hawaiian?

707
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,716
And I'm sure I've seen this
Mr. Harold someplace before.

708
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,258
Why, you haven't bitten off
the end.

709
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,225
Oh, that's right.

710
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,560
Well, how is the leather
business this morning?

711
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,702
Things look pretty tough.

712
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,535
Hmm. They don't to me.

713
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,541
Well, perhaps you don't know
what I know.

714
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,577
What do you know?

715
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,113
Oh, by the way,
you know, I just remembered.

716
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,445
I must send a wireless.
I'll be right back.

717
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,006
Oh now, here, don't bother!

718
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,712
Why, that boy over there'll
take it for you.

719
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,223
Oh, uh... oh, yeah.

720
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,349
Oh, uh, Sergeant!

721
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,518
Come here!

722
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,097
There.
Barbara says I am right.

723
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,328
That is the woman we met
at the Royal Hawaiian.

724
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,961
Just a moment.

725
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,540
Here.

726
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,306
Come back and repeat what's
written on that card right away.

727
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,910
Uh, marvelous thing,
the wireless.

728
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,979
No wires to break
or get out of order.

729
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,933
We ought to have
a marvelous trip.

730
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,479
Yes, that's right.

731
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,572
Madam, your instep
is much too beautiful...

732
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,378
to be spoiled
by a short vamp shoe.

733
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,976
Huh? What?

734
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,179
Did you say something?

735
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,622
Oh, nothing at all, Mrs. Tanner.
Nothing at all.

736
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,353
You see, we always
send our messages in code.

737
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,520
We find it much safer.

738
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,195
That'll be all, Elmer.

739
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,865
Oh, say, speaking
of the leather business...

740
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,670
Oh, uh, by the way, you know...

741
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,405
I just remembered,
I've got to see the purser.

742
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,003
- I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.

743
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,638
I want to see him, too.

744
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,513
Oh, well, that's just dandy.

745
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,677
Uh...

746
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,449
His office is down this way.

747
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,183
Oh, well, when did he move?

748
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,518
Do you know,
his face bothers me.

749
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,156
Oh, you were born bothered.

750
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,597
Oh, really?

751
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,125
I was so surprised
to run into you.

752
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,932
Your being here
is so unexpected.

753
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,233
Yes, it was.

754
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,572
- Here's the purser's office.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

755
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,614
Now, where's my hat?

756
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,582
Oh, I've lost my...
you go right on in.

757
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,618
I'll get my hat,
and I'll be right back.

758
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,847
Go right ahead.
I'll be right back.

759
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,753
I beg your pardon,
but have you a ticket?

760
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,485
Uh, well, why... why certainly.

761
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,117
- You don't think that...
- Oh, no offense.

762
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,287
I found one, and I'm merely
trying to locate the owner.

763
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,965
Oh, say...

764
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,702
was that a blue ticket?

765
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,605
No, it was a pink one.

766
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,303
Oh, it would be.

767
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,525
Hey, put a little water
over here.

768
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,926
OK.

769
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,304
I love you.

770
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,344
- Who do you love next?
- You.

771
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,073
Who do you love next and next?

772
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,580
You, you.

773
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,345
Who do you love
next and next and next?

774
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,749
You, you, you, you, you.

775
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,947
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

776
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,114
- You don't.
- I do.

777
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,282
- You don't.
- I do.

778
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,756
- You don't.
- I do.

779
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:32,125
- No, you don't.
- Oh, yes, I do.

780
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,824
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

781
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,197
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, yes, I do.

782
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,293
- No, you don't.
- I do.

783
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,598
No...

784
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,608
Uh, steward.

785
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,237
Uh, serve my breakfast
up on deck, also.

786
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,009
What's your table number, sir?

787
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,352
Oh, now,
I must have forgotten it.

788
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,388
- Well, never mind, let it go.
- Yes, sir.

789
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,260
Well, good morning, Sergeant.

790
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:50,398
You know, I'll bet
that's a roast beef sandwich.

791
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,941
Uh-huh.

792
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:56,343
Yes, sir. Well, sir, you know,
I think that instead...

793
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:00,816
of going below, I'll just
eat a bite up here on deck.

794
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,010
Oh, by the way...

795
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,954
I'm surprised at you!

796
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,654
Why, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

797
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,958
Eating a sandwich here
when you should be working.

798
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:18,491
Huh, disgusting.
Where's your ambition?

799
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,831
Let me tell you something.

800
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:23,464
It's men like you
that give sailors a bad name.

801
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,440
You know, to be a success...

802
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,977
you've got to work
twenty-four hours a day.

803
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,910
Longer, if necessary.

804
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,540
Remember, a rolling stone
gathers no moss.

805
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,106
That's the idea, young man.

806
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,481
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Tanner?

807
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,248
How do you do?
That's the spirit I like to see.

808
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,482
Young fella,
you follow his advice...

809
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,716
and you'll amount to something.

810
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,883
How about a stroll
along the deck...

811
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,483
to work up an appetite, huh?

812
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,552
Oh, well, uh... remember,
think more and eat less.

813
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,722
Huh?

814
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,562
No, I was just giving him
a little more advice.

815
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,229
Oh, by the way, have a cigar.

816
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,169
- Oh, no, now...
- Now, don't apologize.

817
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,868
I should apologize,
but it's the best I've got.

818
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,439
Uh...

819
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,978
Beat you that time.

820
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,754
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

821
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,623
Good morning. We were just
taking a constitutional.

822
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,959
Oh, well,
we were just taking a walk.

823
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,931
I don't believe
I'll do very much walking.

824
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,230
My feet are just killing me.

825
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:29,500
Come on over here and sit down.
No use torturing your feet.

826
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,542
You ought to have sense enough
to get shoes that fit you.

827
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,474
Well, did you sleep well
last night, Miss Tanner?

828
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,141
What did you say?

829
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,914
Well, I said did you sleep well
last night, Miss Tanner?

830
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,820
Not so good. It was a little
stuffy in my stateroom.

831
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,152
Did it bother you?

832
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:53,490
Uh, no, no, I had
all the air I could stand.

833
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,258
Let's go down for breakfast.

834
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,258
Oh. No, you see, uh,
I don't think so.

835
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,634
I never eat breakfast.

836
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,570
No, you see,
my father never ate breakfast.

837
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,801
In fact, it runs in the family.

838
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,471
Oh, I hate to eat alone.

839
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,007
I'll have my breakfast
up on deck...

840
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,573
and you can sit with me.

841
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,551
Well, all right. Surely.

842
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,850
- All right. Steward.
- Yes, Ma'am?

843
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,253
I'll have my breakfast
on the upper deck.

844
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,416
Yes, Ma'am.

845
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,788
Come on.

846
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,834
It's funny
you don't eat breakfast.

847
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,601
It's my favorite meal.

848
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,074
Have you been
going without breakfast long?

849
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,611
Well, long enough.

850
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,375
Don't you ever feel tempted
to eat breakfast?

851
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,747
Oh, yes, I do.

852
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,218
But it's willpower.
Oh, indeed, yes.

853
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,313
Say, isn't it nice
eating up here on deck?

854
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,857
Much nicer than the dining room.

855
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,187
Yes.

856
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,595
You know, last night
I sat opposite to a man...

857
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,325
that had the manners of a zoo.

858
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,094
- He did?
- Yeah, he dunked.

859
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,725
Think of that, he dunked!

860
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:06,894
- Dunked?
- Yes.

861
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,837
He dunked like this.
He took a piece of toast...

862
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,103
jammed it down
into his coffee, so.

863
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,768
Got lots of coffee on it,
and then...

864
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,248
Think of that.
Wasn't that terrible?

865
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,545
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, wasn't it?

866
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,744
But he kept right on.

867
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,753
I was sitting right there.
He kept right on.

868
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,288
- Stuck it down in there.
- Oh!

869
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,880
Yeah, like that and took it...

870
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,520
- Wasn't that disgusting?
- Horrible.

871
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:36,157
I never saw anybody
that would do such a thing.

872
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,758
I could hardly stand...
and then on top of it, look.

873
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,894
He poured his coffee
into his saucer.

874
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,098
Used the backstroke like that.

875
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,040
Then he took the saucer
and went...

876
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,641
He made that noise?

877
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,547
A terrible noise. Oh, well,
I could hardly stand it.

878
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,448
- Disgusting.
- Mm-hmm.

879
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,613
Oh, now, look at that.
I drank most of your coffee.

880
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,350
Oh, that's all right.
There's plenty more.

881
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,824
I only want a little.

882
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,588
Oh, well...

883
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,040
Well...

884
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,208
Oh, look at
those cute little things.

885
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,583
You know, I haven't played
with these since I was a boy.

886
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,383
Look, it's a cute trick.

887
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,519
Easy, huh? You try it.

888
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,220
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Oh, it's easy.

889
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,594
Nothing to it.
Here, you throw one up for me.

890
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:43,992
There you are.

891
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,369
You're just like a seal.

892
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,530
Yeah, that's what I was told.

893
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,471
When I was a boy I used to go...

894
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,819
You're lots of fun.
Do you know any more tricks?

895
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,264
Uh, me-me-me-me.

896
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,462
"If a body meets a body
coming through the rye"

897
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,096
"Dum de dam dam"

898
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,038
"Doop e doop e"

899
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,939
Look, isn't he cute?

900
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,103
Here, give him a piece
of my meat.

901
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,049
Well, my goodness sakes.

902
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,611
That nice ham.

903
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,283
Here you are.

904
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,553
There you are. Nice.

905
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,589
He certainly does like ham.

906
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,159
Mmm, oh, yes,
that's a fine piece.

907
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,336
That's just fine.

908
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,772
Here you are.

909
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,972
Oh, it's a nice dog.

910
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,944
Let's see. Would you like
one of these? Hmm?

911
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,578
Would ya?

912
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,179
Yes, he liked that.
Now, let's see.

913
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,850
Now, look at him. Look at him.

914
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,560
Here you are.

915
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,534
Tried to eat my finger, too.

916
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:59,595
My magazine's gone, and I was
reading a continued story.

917
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,570
All right, don't cry about it!

918
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,698
Sit down
and I'll get you another.

919
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,571
There's a hundred more
at the newsstand.

920
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,907
- Then go get me one.
- All right.

921
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,672
Uh, excuse me, I've, uh...

922
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,410
I've got about a hundred things
I have to take care of.

923
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,749
Oh. Don't be long.

924
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,583
Looking for something
in particular?

925
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,559
Yes. Have you got
an Everywhere magazine?

926
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:25,720
Yes, right here.

927
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,956
Oh, well, how much are they?

928
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,966
- Five cents.
- Oh, fair enough.

929
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,592
Thank you.

930
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,871
Miss, have you
an Everywhere magazine?

931
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,066
Yes, we have a...

932
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,574
Well, that's funny,
they were here a minute ago.

933
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,965
Stick 'em up.

934
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,739
Here, read the nice magazine
while mother gets her hat.

935
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,349
Hello. Hello, there.

936
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,359
Can the nice man
have the nice magazine? Huh?

937
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,917
Good...

938
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,463
Shh. Oh, shh shh shh.

939
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,227
Shh, there, there,
there, there, there.

940
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,133
Shh.

941
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,969
Shh. Here, here, here, here.

942
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,605
Ooh, look at that.

943
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,308
Take the nice little...

944
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,518
Why, precious,
where did you get that?

945
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,318
Here, get the little hands
all sticky.

946
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,360
Yes. Fix it up with this.

947
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,623
Yes. All right?

948
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,894
All right, here you are.
Take it. Here.

949
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,798
What, you don't want
nasty old paper?

950
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:49,100
All right, there we are.
Here. Here, darling.

951
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:10,450
Oh, Mack, that's grand.
Play some more. Isn't he good?

952
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,291
- He's marvelous.
- I'll say he is.

953
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,275
Hello, Charlotte,
where have you been all morning?

954
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,872
Oh, just hanging around. Have
you seen anyone interesting?

955
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,513
Just this lunatic
who's been following me...

956
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,713
all over deck this morning.

957
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,052
Honestly, if there's anything
funny around, I get it.

958
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,523
What have you been doing?

959
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:50,718
I've been talking...

960
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,522
to that ducky-looking officer
over there.

961
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,460
We've been down to
the engine room and everywhere.

962
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,260
Oh, how thrilling.

963
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,197
How do you do?

964
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,031
Oh, well, I beg your pardon.

965
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,195
Why, you fresh thing.

966
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,239
I have a good notion
to slap your face.

967
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,773
Pardon me.

968
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,368
Come on, Charlotte. Let's go.
I've never met anyone like that.

969
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,895
By the way, Captain.
I certainly want to thank you.

970
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,124
Thank you for the wonderful
courtesy that you did.

971
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,564
Why, hello there,
young fella.

972
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,535
Hey, you're not smoking.
Here, have a cigar.

973
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,231
Oh, thank you.

974
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,967
Oh, I have a match. Thanks.

975
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,135
Well, I told you
it would be a marvelous trip.

976
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,044
Nice and cool, too.

977
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,912
It looks like
it, uh, might warm up a bit.

978
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,544
Well, uh, are you going
for a walk?

979
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,248
Uh, yes.
Which way are you going?

980
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,813
Why, I'm going this way.

981
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,449
Oh, well, I'm going this way.
Sorry.

982
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,494
Good-bye.

983
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,969
Say, young man,
what are you doing?

984
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,871
That magazine cost me a nickel.

985
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,842
And you've gone
and knocked it overboard.

986
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,475
Uh, read less and think more.

987
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,816
Well, you two
shouldn't be sitting there.

988
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:34,192
Walk around. They say it's great
for the appetite.

989
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:38,495
Well, sir, all food and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

990
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,196
You see, there's nothing wrong
with my appetite.

991
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,898
No? Well, I'm from Missouri.

992
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,702
You've got to show me.

993
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,572
How about joining us
at dinner tonight?

994
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,134
Oh, do.

995
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,147
Oh, gee, well, surely.

996
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,013
You've got no idea
how delighted I'd be.

997
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,483
All right.

998
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:59,077
You know, Mr. Harold,
I'm still trying to place you.

999
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,352
And I'm going to do it
sooner or later.

1000
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,757
She's funny that way.

1001
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,227
- Forward march.
- Don't you hurry me.

1002
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,805
First call to dinner.

1003
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,580
- Uh, Steward?
- Yes, sir?

1004
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,245
What's everybody
all dressed up about?

1005
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,152
What's the matter?
Is there a wedding or something?

1006
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,690
No, just the usual thing, sir.

1007
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,249
Everyone dresses for dinner
aboard ship.

1008
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,488
Oh. Well, is it the law?

1009
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,157
No, sir, it's just a custom.

1010
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,961
- Custom?
- Yes, sir.

1011
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,899
But, of course, no one would
think of going to dinner...

1012
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,800
unless properly dressed, sir.

1013
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,567
Oh.

1014
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,610
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,280
Hello, Harry.

1016
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,478
What's the matter?
Feel a little shaky?

1017
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,454
Yes. I had to come up
and get some air.

1018
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,820
I don't want to miss
that ship's concert today.

1019
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,121
Say, have you got
an extra white vest?

1020
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,253
Well, sure, there's a couple
in my trunk.

1021
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,762
What size do you wear?

1022
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:15,991
36.

1023
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,498
Now, that's a little too small.

1024
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,728
I'll have to get one from Bill.
Thanks just the same.

1025
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,431
Uh, good evening.

1026
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,372
What's good about it?

1027
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,842
What's the matter?
Feeling upset?

1028
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,776
Yes, I'm not a good sailor.

1029
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,281
I must've eaten something
that disagreed with me.

1030
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,839
Oh, well, that's too bad.

1031
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,350
You, uh, get sick easily?

1032
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,716
Oh, very easily.

1033
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,846
So do I. Yes, sir.

1034
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,584
Say, that's a nice suit
you have on there.

1035
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,853
What size is it? About 36?

1036
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,451
Yeah, I wear 36.

1037
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,394
You know,
speaking of getting sick...

1038
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:52,059
they fed me this morning
some greasy salt pork.

1039
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,261
For breakfast.

1040
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,031
Oh, yeah, didn't do me
a bit of good.

1041
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,766
Oh, please,
must you talk about salt pork?

1042
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,205
Oh, now I beg your pardon.

1043
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,140
Now, I'm sorry
I mentioned salt pork.

1044
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,874
You see, I don't like
salt pork a bit. No, sir.

1045
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,575
But, you know, when
you're on a ship like this...

1046
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,177
and it's rocking,
and it smells of oil... ooh...

1047
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,484
salt pork
certainly is upsetting.

1048
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,421
I could've gotten away
with that pork...

1049
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,324
but they gave me
a lot of codfish and cream.

1050
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,919
- Ohhh.
- Oh, yeah, very bad.

1051
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,828
Say, you know what, man?
I tell you what you need.

1052
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,298
A walk.

1053
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,631
I'm telling you that's the only
thing that saved my life...

1054
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,671
when they gave me
that salt pork for breakfast.

1055
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,299
Yes, sir. I'm telling you.
Here's another thing.

1056
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,002
When they gave me
the salt pork...

1057
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,375
on the same plate
they put a big mess of spinach.

1058
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,744
And it was all soft and gooey.

1059
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,114
It's all right, old man.
I'll tell you now, come on.

1060
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,119
Let's take a walk.
It'll do you good.

1061
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,587
Liable to do me good, too.

1062
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,023
Say, uh, how about
steamed clams? You like them?

1063
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,833
Come on now. Let's get moving.

1064
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,605
No, never give in. No, sir.
Keep a stiff upper lip.

1065
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,239
Now, look at here. This fella's
worse off than you are.

1066
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,313
Oh, boy,
he must've had salt pork.

1067
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,519
Wait a minute now.

1068
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,523
Wouldn't you like to have me
take you to your room?

1069
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,582
Yean, take me up to my room
and let me die.

1070
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,456
Sure. I'll take you
and put you to bed.

1071
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,088
And then I'll dress for dinner.
Come on.

1072
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,947
It's all right.
We're the best of friends.

1073
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,355
But remember, don't hand me
any more of those loaded cigars.

1074
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,687
Oh, don't get sore over that.

1075
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,558
Oh, that's all... oh, I see
Adler won the ship's pool!

1076
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,029
Yeah, he's a lucky hound.

1077
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:05,090
I'll say he is. Who do you like
in that fourth race?

1078
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,863
Let's see, the fourth race...

1079
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,075
Oh, I don't know.
I think I like...

1080
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:23,312
Say! If that's your idea
of a joke, laugh that off!

1081
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,690
Oh, you think it's a joke,
do ya?

1082
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,419
Now that's going too far!

1083
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,290
Well, let me see.

1084
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,727
Oh, all right,
I can stand for a lot.

1085
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,321
Well, take it off.

1086
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,560
Now, listen, if you want
to start something with me...

1087
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,397
why don't you start it?

1088
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:43,029
- Well, why don't you start?
- Why don't you start, huh?

1089
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,504
Don't shove me like that!

1090
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:45,801
Well, I will shove you
like that.

1091
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,173
Uh, pardon me, gentlemen.
Pardon me.

1092
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,474
Well...

1093
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,776
Hey, wait a minute.
You got my coat there.

1094
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,181
I have not got your coat.

1095
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,311
- Why, this is my coat.
- This is not my coat.

1096
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,720
That's my coat,
and I say it's my coat!

1097
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,487
Well, that certainly was
a grand dinner.

1098
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,721
Whoo. Yes, sir, you know...

1099
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,889
I can't remember when
I've enjoyed eating so much.

1100
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,298
Sorry, I can't offer you
a cigar. I'm all out.

1101
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,801
You haven't one, have you?

1102
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,598
No, no. I, uh, l...

1103
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,738
Hey, well,
I didn't know I had it.

1104
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,276
Thanks.

1105
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,868
Oh, I've just got to sit down.

1106
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:26,176
Oh, my. Oh, my word.

1107
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,681
Oh, these shoes
are just killing me.

1108
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,445
Oh, I'm awfully sorry,
Mrs. Tanner.

1109
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,816
Maybe if I ease them up a bit?

1110
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,184
Oh, don't trouble...

1111
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,722
- Oh, no trouble.
- Well, that's nice of you.

1112
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,485
- I'll just soften the heel.
- Thank you.

1113
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,254
It might help a little.

1114
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,851
There you are.

1115
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,090
Be careful.

1116
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,792
Madam, your instep is much...

1117
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,961
Now I know
where I saw you before.

1118
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:51,438
You're the young man that
waited on me in the shoe store.

1119
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,634
Aren't you? Aren't you?

1120
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:57,167
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Isn't it, Mr. Harold?

1121
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,147
There you go with that
funny complex of yours again.

1122
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,275
Well, of course,
I might be mistaken.

1123
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,909
But his face bothers me.

1124
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,045
And you know
that I never forget a face.

1125
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,147
Yes, and when we were
traveling in Egypt...

1126
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,816
you thought you knew the Spheex.

1127
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,860
Sphinx, if you please.

1128
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,828
S-p-i-x... I oughta...

1129
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,125
I might be mistaken...

1130
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,098
but I could swear
this is the young man...

1131
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,259
that ruined my feet.

1132
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,599
Oh, I feel sure you're mistaken.

1133
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,921
Unroll it and cover that hatch.

1134
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,117
Yes, sir.

1135
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,671
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

1136
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,737
Looks like a stowaway to me.

1137
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,574
Hey, you! Come here!

1138
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,251
Hey, stop that fella.

1139
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,672
Miss Barbara?

1140
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:40,180
Oh, good morning, Mr. Harold.

1141
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:43,218
Well, good morning.

1142
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:45,877
Miss Tanner, there...

1143
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,549
there's something
that I want to tell you.

1144
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,455
Well, I'm listening.

1145
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,393
So, there you are.
Now look at this. Look at this.

1146
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,861
Why, Mr. Tanner,
what do you mean?

1147
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,488
I'll tell you what I mean.

1148
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,930
There's the bid
for that Army contract.

1149
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,627
That meant
thousands of dollars to me.

1150
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,863
Those bids were supposed
to be in Los Angeles...

1151
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,167
by noon on the 16th,
not the 18th.

1152
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,037
Now, why didn't you tell me
it was the 16th?

1153
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,269
That's tomorrow,
and we don't land for two days.

1154
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:11,507
And now I lose that contract all
on account of your stupidity.

1155
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,276
But, Mr. Tanner,
I'm sure I told you the 16th.

1156
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,612
You did not.
Now that thing is useless.

1157
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,049
Oh!

1158
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,179
And, young lady, as soon as
we get back to the mainland...

1159
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,054
I'm getting myself
a new secretary.

1160
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,362
Secretary.

1161
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,125
And furthermore,
let me tell you some...

1162
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,360
Just a moment, Mr. Tanner.

1163
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,198
Now remember, where
there's life, there's hope. Ha!

1164
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,432
Every cloud has a silver lining.

1165
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,168
It's always darkest
just before the dawn.

1166
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,506
- An apple a day...
- Shut up, you.

1167
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,409
I'm sick and tired of you
and your copybook sayings.

1168
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,072
You can't joke your way
through a thing like this.

1169
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,673
Ha, yes, but actions speak
louder than words.

1170
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,116
That's what you say?
Then let's see some action...

1171
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,414
if you're so smart.

1172
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,251
Say, you've been feeding me with
a lot of blub for three days.

1173
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,018
Now let's see you do something,
you fathead.

1174
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:59,288
Let's see you get that to
Los Angeles by tomorrow, noon.

1175
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,125
All right. I will.

1176
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,688
I will get it to Los Angeles.

1177
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,097
And you'll find out...

1178
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,964
that where there's a will
there's a way.

1179
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,368
- Bah!
- Bah bah!

1180
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,497
There's no use. It's impossible.

1181
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,269
No, it isn't. No, it isn't.

1182
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:18,541
And you'll see that he who
laughs last, laughs laughs.

1183
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,892
There he is.

1184
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,653
I'm positive he came in here.

1185
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,916
Let's take a look
in the mail room.

1186
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,116
OK.

1187
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,895
Hey, did you see a fella
come in here?

1188
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,090
No, sir. Nobody came in here.

1189
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,190
All right. Let's go, Bill.

1190
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,430
Now, let's get these mail sacks
up on deck.

1191
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:22,739
That mail plane
is due in at any minute now.

1192
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,795
Hey.

1193
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:41,480
What... what's the matter?

1194
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,295
Whew!

1195
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,773
Hey!

1196
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,857
Help! Help!

1197
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,334
Jack Dempsey's the greatest
fighter that ever lived.

1198
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,268
Ah, baloney.

1199
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:39,205
John L. Sullivan could
lick him with his hands tied.

1200
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,707
Oh, is that so?

1201
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,336
Hey, listen, you don't know
anything about it.

1202
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,753
Oh!

1203
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,790
Hey! No!

1204
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,795
Mmph!

1205
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,627
Help!

1206
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,864
Hey, man,
what you doing out there?

1207
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,464
You ain't no eagle.

1208
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,669
Hey! Help me!

1209
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,803
Come on around here
and open this window!

1210
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,177
My hands are caught.

1211
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,308
Oh, wait there.
I'll be back there.

1212
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,215
Don't go away now.

1213
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,744
How can I go away?
Hurry up, get around here!

1214
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:42,900
Hey!
Oh, look out!

1215
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,838
Uh!

1216
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,572
Help! Help!

1217
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,886
I thought I told you
not to go away.

1218
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,080
Help me down!

1219
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,923
Uh! Hey! Look out, there!

1220
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:07,860
Look out, there!
Look out, there!

1221
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,557
I can't hang here much longer.

1222
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,929
Hey! Hey! Look out!

1223
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,434
Look out, there!

1224
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:19,266
You're crazy.
Ha! Don't talk nonsense.

1225
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,918
Ooh!

1226
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,879
Help me!

1227
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,180
Hey!

1228
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,721
Hey! Hey!

1229
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,822
Hey!

1230
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,132
- Tea at 5:00?
- Oh, that'll be splendid!

1231
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,470
- Now don't be late.
- I won't.

1232
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,770
- And don't forget.
- Good-bye.

1233
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,072
Good-bye.

1234
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,179
Help, somebody. Help!

1235
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:40,017
Help! Help, somebody! Help!

1236
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,953
What's all this shouting
going on around here?

1237
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,457
There's a man flying around...

1238
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:45,652
on the outside
of that building needs help.

1239
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,092
Where?

1240
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,424
Right this way.

1241
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,022
If this is a joke,
I'll wring your neck.

1242
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,589
Show me where he is.

1243
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,102
Right this way. Yeah,
there he is. Right this way.

1244
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,872
Better not be lying to me.

1245
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,602
- No, I ain't lying.
- Where is he?

1246
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,373
There he is. Right up there.

1247
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,530
Ooh!

1248
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,949
Hey!
What's the matter with you?

1249
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,417
You trying to break my neck?

1250
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:30,991
Hey! Charcoal, where are you?

1251
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,023
Hey!

1252
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,881
Hey! Charcoal!

1253
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,887
Hey, Charcoal!

1254
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,515
Help! Charcoal!

1255
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,024
- Here I is!
- Huh?

1256
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,551
Oh, listen,
get me out of here some way.

1257
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,292
Will you? Hurry up, go on!
Get me!

1258
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,197
What are you doing there?

1259
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:49,294
Look out, there! Wait a minute!

1260
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:53,535
Don't do that! Let go! Let go!

1261
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,166
Come on, get me in here
some other way.

1262
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,505
I gotta get in there somehow.

1263
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,011
I'll tell you what you do.

1264
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,377
You go up to the other window,
and I'm gonna come up there...

1265
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,473
and let you in.

1266
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,815
Oh, hey, wait a minute!
I can't climb up there!

1267
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,856
Hey!

1268
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,386
Well, all right, Charcoal.
I'm going up.

1269
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,724
Hurry, now!

1270
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,672
I don't know about this.

1271
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,633
Come on,
quit pulling up on that.

1272
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:53,827
I ain't.

1273
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:59,264
- Help!
- Let's go see. Come on.

1274
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,573
Hey! Hey!

1275
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,115
Help!

1276
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:16,683
Help!

1277
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:41,510
There's supposed to be
a man hanging.

1278
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,881
I don't get your drift.

1279
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,870
You know where the side of
the building is supposed to be?

1280
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:04,336
Yes.

1281
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,704
Well, there's supposed
to be a man hanging.

1282
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:10,006
Hey! Hey!

1283
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,384
Hey!

1284
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,787
Hey! Look out!

1285
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:31,354
Hold it! Stop it!

1286
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:12,796
Help!

1287
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,246
Ow! Don't do that!

1288
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,808
Hey! Hey!

1289
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,282
Help!

1290
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,259
What are you doing down there?

1291
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:36,627
Hey! Help me! Help me!

1292
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,166
What am I gonna do?

1293
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,429
Cut it off! Cut it off!

1294
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,733
- Cut it off?
- Yes!

1295
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,899
I dunno...

1296
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:10,698
There! No, no, wait.

1297
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:17,301
Help! Help!

1298
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,921
I had a brother who was
one of Dempsey's trainers...

1299
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,086
and what he told me
about that fight...

1300
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,460
Why, listen.
Dooley didn't have a ch...

1301
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:18,499
Hey, there's a man down...

1302
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,932
We want you
to settle an argument now.

1303
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:30,342
Whew!

1304
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,176
What's the matter with me?

1305
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:46,847
Oof!

1306
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,518
When Dempsey swings his left,
he comes around like this.

1307
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,065
Help! Hey!

1308
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,864
You've got him!
Hold on, boy! Hold on!

1309
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:08,602
We'll run and get him some help.

1310
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:11,543
Hey, wait a minute.
Who's gonna hold me?

1311
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,876
Never mind, just hold on!
We'll be back in a minute!

1312
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,781
Hey! Help!

1313
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,751
Help me! Hey!

1314
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:23,247
Hurry, somebody!

1315
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:24,552
Help!

1316
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,717
What's the matter, buddy?
Are you in trouble?

1317
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,784
- Huh?
- Are you in trouble?

1318
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:16,440
I think it was wonderful...

1319
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:19,446
the way you figured how to get
that bid here by plane.

1320
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:23,143
Oh. Oh, well.
That was mostly luck.

1321
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:24,377
No, it wasn't.

1322
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:27,717
It was because
you stuck to it and made good.

1323
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,054
Stuck to it.
Sticking to it, huh?

1324
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,855
That's it. Sticking.

1325
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:35,452
Wait a minute.

1326
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,658
Huh, sticking, huh?

1327
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,497
Oh!
