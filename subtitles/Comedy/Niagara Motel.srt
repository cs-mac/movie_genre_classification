I was about to tell you

491
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:29,201
we're not open
for business yet, but...

492
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:32,697
it doesn't look like
you're looking for a room.

493
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:36,034
I'm Norma Bates.
We moved in a few days ago.

No, ma'am.
No, not looking for a room.

- This is Sheriff Alex Romero.
- We just wanted to make sure

497
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,142
everything was all right here.

498

had moved in yet.

Oh, that's kind of you.
Yeah, we're all fine.

00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,081
Yeah, my son and I are just

pulling up some carpeting
we're replacing.

this is a good idea to--

I was cutting carpet,
and it just--

517
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:29,387
It's nothing.
It's a nick.

- Yes, sheriff?

a look inside, would you?

They--they saw the lights on
and were kind enough

00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:15,066
to check on us.

- Except for this carpeting.
- Sheriff Romero wanted to...

533
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,448
Well, you wanted
to see what we're doing.

534

I guess you're
a little interested in design?

- This bathroom?
- Yeah.

- This bathroom is broken.
- What's wrong with it?

- It's not flushing.
- All these toilets do that.

to replace them ten years ago.

it was unlike anything else
I'd ever experienced.

is nice too.

tell you that?

You deserve so much better.

615
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,333
You know, when you were born,
it was like

616
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,269
God gave me a second chance.
And all I ever wanted

617
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:50,397
was for life to be beautiful
for you, and look at it.

618

Look at what your life
has been.

619

I mean,
what good am I doing you?

620
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,249
Mom, you're everything...

everything to me.

622
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,823

in a world without you.

643
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:06,696
Okay, look, look, look,
look, look!

644
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,441
I turned it on.

645
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,104
I made it blue.
It's your favorite color.

646
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,249
- It's cool, mom.
- Yeah.

647
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,623
It's ours, Norman.
It's our very own.

648
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,046
And you know what?
You know that new bypass?

649
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,083
- They're not gonna build it.
- When did that happen?

650
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,719
It didn't, yet.

651
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,821
I'll think of something.

652
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,824
[Chuckles] I'm sure you will.

653
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,065
What's important
is that we're together.

654
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:39,034
And as long as we're together,

655
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:41,170
then nothing bad
can really happen.

656
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:44,707
- Right, Norman?
- Right, mother.

657
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:47,610
Yeah.

658
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:59,566
