1
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,291
Hey there, Georgy girl

2
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:36,473
Swingin' down the street
so fancy-free

3
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:39,192
Nobody you meet could ever see 

4
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:42,894
the loneliness there - inside you

5
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,724
Hey there, Georgy girl

6
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:48,895
Look at all the boyfriends
you don’t kiss. 

7
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,175
Never had a real one yet,

8
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:55,053
Just look at the clothes you wear.

9
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:01,362
You're always window shopping
but never stopping to buy

10
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,667
Just shed those dowdy feathers and fly
- a little bit

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,612
Hey there, Georgy girl

12
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,760
Give yourself a treat
like most girls do.

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,900
Get another hairstyle to

14
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:19,568
and, oh, what a change there'd be

15
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:25,300
The world would see
a new Georgy girl.

16
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,612
Hey there, Georgy girl

17
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:56,815
Dreamin' of the someone
you could be

18
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,884
Life is a reality, 

19
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,910
you can't always run away.

20
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:09,485
Don't be so scared of changing
and rearranging yourself.

21
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:15,488
It's time for jumping down
from the shelf - a little bit

22
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,411
Hey there, Georgy girl

23
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:21,635
Give yourself a chance
and you’ll succeed.

24
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,961
Confidence is all you need 

25
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,487
Then, oh, what a change there'd be

26
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:31,944
The world would see
a new Georgy girl

27
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:43,730
a new Georgy girl, a new Georgy girl
a new Georgy girl, a new Georgy girl

28
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,293
One and two, and one and two.

29
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,861
Everybody go around.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,032
Very good. Faster.

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,407
One and two.

32
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,811
Very good. Everybody around me. Come on.

33
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,752
Quick. Come on. One more quickie to finish.

34
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,550
You're things in space.

35
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,391
Right. Spin into space.

36
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,158
And one, two, three, on the floor! Quick!

37
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,537
She's looking better.
She ought to be under the doctor.

38
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,737
Let's hope that's the end of the cat's chorus.

39
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,076
'Course she don't believe in doctors.

40
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,640
You can't call it anything else.
Certainly not music.

41
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,482
Bye.

42
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,119
I'll catch her
before she goes back to the slums.

43
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,624
- I've got a bone to pick with you.
- Working, Father, dear.

44
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,759
What do you think this is?

45
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,994
It's a dress. For you. A present.

46
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,940
From my other daddy? The rich one?

47
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,476
That's gorgeous. That's the height of chic.

48
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,415
Have you tried it on?

49
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:54,817
You'll feel the back of my hand in a minute.

50
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,826
It's to wear to his birthday party
on Thursday.

51
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,594
The one to which you were invited.
I posted the card myself.

52
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,071
Now, I had no education of which to speak.

53
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,768
I didn't get sent to a finishing school
in Switzerland by my father's employer.

54
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,368
I went to an elementary school.

55
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:22,107
But what education I got, I got from him!

56
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,076
Like knowing what "RSV" and "P" means.

57
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,619
- I'm not coming.
- You'll be there.

58
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,688
- I shan't.
- Lf I have anything to do with it.

59
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,155
You haven't.

60
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,848
Please yourself!

61
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:36,724
It's up to you.
Go and live in that slum instead of here.

62
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,820
Thanks.

63
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,798
For his sake, you ought to try
and do something about yourself.

64
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:44,030
You walk about looking like a bloody tramp.

65
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,069
Why don't you get your hair done?

66
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,074
I have just had it done.

67
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,743
Run, then.

68
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,010
I've got the tickets.

69
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,878
Tickets?

70
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,344
The Cup Final tickets.

71
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,687
Who said anything about tickets
to the Cup Final?

72
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,624
You did, Mr. James.

73
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,257
You did, really.
You said I should go with you.

74
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,393
Is that so? Well, well.

75
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:53,132
- It cost me two £5 notes.
- Two £5 notes.

76
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,940
Georgy's not gone yet.
I wanted to catch her.

77
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,654
The bedroom.

78
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,531
Georgy?

79
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,612
Well. She's nipped off.

80
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:39,845
By the look of it. If I were you, Ted,
I'd take her across my knee...

81
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,945
pull down her knickers
and give her a good tanning.

82
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:47,083
- She's too big for that.
- Yes. She always was.

83
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,856
She's like some enormous lorry driver.

84
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,264
She ought to be made to feel
what she owes me.

85
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:58,826
I rub that in, don't you worry, sir.
I hold the whip hand.

86
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,635
- I've got a bone to pick with you:
- Working, Father, dear:

87
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:05,506
What do you think this is?

88
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,876
It's a dress: For you: A present:

89
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:10,346
From my other daddy? The rich one?

90
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:13,817
That's gorgeous: That's the height of chic:

91
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,683
Have you tried it on?

92
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,856
- James, you got the things?
- Aye.

93
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,896
How are you feeling?

94
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,940
You know, Ellen,
when you're not feeling well...

95
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,377
you ought to see a proper doctor.

96
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,311
Doctors! You got the yeast compound?

97
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,217
- Yeast compound.
- The wintergreen?

98
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,182
- Wintergreen.
- Cider vinegar?

99
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,723
They hadn't got the brand that you wanted.

100
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,173
Hello.

101
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,946
- Georgy, come and play with us.
- Come on.

102
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,215
Come on, Georgy.

103
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,883
Everybody up.

104
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,589
Bye.

105
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,777
Hi.

106
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,183
Has it been raining?

107
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,814
No, the baths.
I'm training to be an Olympic swimmer.

108
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,450
This man came up to me in the street.
He was a Scotsman...

109
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,461
- Shut up, Georgy. Am I all right?
- Sensational.

110
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:06,156
- Am I all right?
- Sensational.

111
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,059
- Where are you going?
- Out.

112
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,298
- But Jos... Isn't Jos coming?
- Of course.

113
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,598
- You can't go out.
- Can't I? Bye.

114
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,115
- Meredith! Take your fiddle.
- For God's sake, what for?

115
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:29,950
- You can tell Jos you're rehearsing.
- Why?

116
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,613
Well, you know. What'll I tell him?

117
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:35,354
That I'm out. That's all. I'll be back at 8:00.

118
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:39,364
- But what'll I say? What'll I do?
- Keep him happy.

119
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,077
- You naked underneath that coat?
- Stark.

120
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,508
- Let's have a look then.
- It's threepence.

121
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,676
Too dear, dear.

122
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,157
Where's that rude girl?
Lying lasciviously in bed?

123
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,284
Contemplating in the loo?

124
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,629
Lounging in the bath.

125
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,460
You'll look a little lovelier each day

126
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,195
She's gone out, Jos.

127
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,001
She had to.

128
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,506
Suddenly.

129
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,310
I brought some supper for the two of us.

130
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,913
- Soggy.
- I meant Meredith and me.

131
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,019
- Obviously.
- And now she's out.

132
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,953
- Did she say any time?
- 7:30.

133
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,626
Get out the Scrabble, then.

134
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,899
Hungry?

135
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,770
Starving.

136
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,923
It ain't no good, you bawling.

137
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,562
- He was a good man, mister.
- I made mincemeat out of him.

138
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:01,071
He always loved his mince.

139
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,335
Quit stalling.
I'm gonna pump you full of lead.

140
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:05,604
- You're a two-timing broad.
- No, not broad.

141
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,875
Yes. Very long. But you are broad, too. Hey!

142
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,611
Are you longer than you are broader,
or is your broad broader than your long?

143
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,710
How is your broader anyway,
and your sister?

144
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,326
A look at our programs later this evening:
At 7:30, You're a Brick...

145
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,431
a brand new radio panel game
with the accent on the building trade:

146
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,065
Then at 8:00:: : :

147
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,787
O-C-H-R-E. "Ochre." I win!

148
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,231
I had "Zho." Z-H-O.

149
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:04,895
- Hey, what's that when it's at home?
- A Himalayan ox.

150
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,460
- Truly?
- Truly.

151
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,205
Had some good words.
"Catagmatic." "Sostenuto."

152
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:13,211
One of the few advantages
of a musical education, my dear.

153
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,478
You ought to leave that bank, Jos.
Go back to your proper work.

154
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:22,179
I wish I could, George. But second-rate
flautists are fourteen for tuppence.

155
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,951
She won't be long.

156
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,556
She make you jealous?

157
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,888
Not much. We've got so little in common.

158
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,866
She's so pretty. Cool and detached.

159
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,401
There's nothing messy about her.

160
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,872
I feel like a brontosaurus when she's about,
a freak survival.

161
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:44,466
Come off it.

162
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:48,138
Look, the truth is,
you just missed being beautiful, George.

163
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,510
Georgina.

164
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,970
Kept the chips warm?

165
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,303
- What?
- Kept the chips warm?

166
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:18,536
Georgy threw them away.

167
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:21,101
Well, if you've got something else.

168
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,575
George, what have we...

169
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,412
Thanks, George, you're a dear.

170
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,579
You must be drunk.

171
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,624
I've had a few vodkas. Does it show?

172
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,453
Got you.

173
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,291
It's like an oven in here. Too much on.

174
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,499
I'm off now.

175
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,902
What? Don't leave your own flat
because of us, mate.

176
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:22,304
God, no.

177
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,205
Jos, come on.

178
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,269
Well, if it isn't Georgy Porgy
visiting the old homestead.

179
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,007
How's life in the kitchen sink,
Georgy Porgy?

180
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,210
Fine, Jimsy Whimsy.

181
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,879
- Come in and have a drink.
- No, thanks.

182
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:46,152
Good God, girl, what have you got on?
A suit of armor, is it?

183
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,557
That's right. Protects my honor.

184
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,827
- Take it off, for God's sake.
- No, I'd rather keep it on, thank you.

185
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,731
You've got a decent figure.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

186
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:57,701
- You want to show it off.
- No, I don't.

187
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,796
Give the boys a treat. Just look at that thing.

188
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,109
You ought to get a jersey
a couple of sizes smaller.

189
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,237
See?

190
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,722
Right.

191
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,033
£5, £10.

192
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,269
You don't have to pay me. It's on the house.

193
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,135
It's for a new jumper.

194
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:36,697
- I like this one.
- Come on.

195
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,203
Say thank you to Mr. James.

196
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,878
- Thank you, James.
- Good girl.

197
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,133
- I don't know.
- Dust! Now this.

198
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,849
- Praying mantis.
- Elephant.

199
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:29,181
Bloody marvelous. Well, thank you, Miss...

200
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:30,585
- Parkin.
- Parkin, yes.

201
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:34,558
However, just at the moment, our books
seem to be full of animal imitators.

202
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,493
But would you be prepared to strip,
my dear?

203
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,723
Got one or two operation scars.

204
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:43,097
So much the better. The customers like that.
Within reason, of course.

205
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:44,260
I'll have to ask Mommy.

206
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,304
Leave your name and number.
We'll be in touch.

207
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:49,033
I'll bet you will, you dirty old slob.

208
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,906
We going out?

209
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:02,078
- Why? Aren't you going with Jos or anyone?
- No.

210
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,747
Let's go and eat, then.

211
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:07,223
But at the first flicker of dust
and all that nonsense, I'm leaving you.

212
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,293
Parkin's residence.

213
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,167
Hello? Oh, hi.

214
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,239
I might be.

215
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,041
Okay, I'm not doing anything.

216
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,378
Where?

217
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,444
Then you'll have to pick me up.

218
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,021
At the tube in about five minutes.

219
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,353
See you.

220
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,207
- Where are you going now?
- Party. Nick's.

221
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,378
For God's sake, you don't expect me
to have a meal with you...

222
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,677
if I can go to a party, do you?

223
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,883
Look, I didn't mean it like that.

224
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:09,750
- Lf you'd been the one invited, I'd naturally...
- I never am.

225
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,517
Don't let's go into that again, Georgy.

226
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,761
Okay, if you're going to be suicidal, I'll stay!

227
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,319
No. Go.

228
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,889
- Sure?
- Sure. Have a lovely time.

229
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,095
I'll think about you when I drink my cocoa.

230
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,967
- Hello.
- Bye.

231
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,102
Many happy returns of the day, old boy.

232
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,767
Glad to see you.

233
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,504
Good evening.

234
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,184
- What's this, then?
- I decided to come.

235
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,114
In this rig-out? You look like a tramp.

236
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,991
Why can't you behave like a lady
just for once?

237
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:25,552
A lady? Okay.

238
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,885
Come on, boys.

239
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,464
It's madly gay, darling.

240
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:46,266
Now, Georgy, I want you to sit quiet
and listen for a moment.

241
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,492
I'm 49 today.

242
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,095
For he's a jolly good fellow

243
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:17,760
Shut up! I'm 49.

244
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
Notice that, not 50 yet.

245
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,069
When I first met your dad,
I was 27 and just got married.

246
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:31,377
Your dad was unemployed,
and he couldn't afford to marry your mother.

247
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:35,510
I took him on. She came along
as housekeeper and they got married.

248
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,188
Ellen and I
have never been blessed with children.

249
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:42,818
As a result, I've tended to look upon you
as my daughter.

250
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:48,231
I've always been sorry that you weren't.
But now I'm glad.

251
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,024
Because of what I did out there?

252
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:53,229
No. I brought you in here
to make you an offer.

253
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,430
- You want to adopt me.
- Georgy, please!

254
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,935
No, something quite different.

255
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,206
I want you to be my mistress.

256
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,987
I've had it all drawn up properly.

257
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,293
I propose an agreement whereby either
one of the contracting parties can opt out...

258
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:19,330
at any time in six months' initial period.

259
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,864
I bear all the expenses...

260
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,925
and undertake the formal adoption
of any children.

261
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,703
Here's a copy of the draft contract
for your approval.

262
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,574
I know it all looks pretty formal.

263
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,482
Will we have to have
any shareholders and things?

264
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,558
No, I don't think that should be necessary.

265
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,961
I should hate to be voted off the board.

266
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,562
Those annual general meetings.

267
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,038
I hope they'll be more frequent than that.

268
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,334
I turned up with the Maserati
and there was this...

269
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,940
Sorry.

270
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,013
- What is it?
- Nothing, dear.

271
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,176
One of those vintage Bentleys all wound up.

272
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:15,617
Do you mind?

273
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,525
- Are you going to say yes or no?
- Yes or no.

274
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,190
- Don't act the goat, Georgy.
- Quite.

275
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:32,628
Well, I'm just getting to the small print here.
About the alleged condition of the property.

276
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,164
Does it have to be intact?

277
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:40,700
- Well, it is, isn't it?
- Yes. Queen of all the fairies.

278
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,007
Well, then...

279
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,776
Are there any special conditions
about my duties?

280
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:47,079
- They're understood.
- Are they?

281
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,719
I haven't got to wear gymslips
or suck lollipops?

282
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,758
Look, if you're not prepared
to discuss this thing seriously...

283
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,417
And what about your wife?

284
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:59,759
We keep it secret, naturally.
Ellen knows I've done this before.

285
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,400
I see.
Well, it all seems quite straightforward.

286
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,163
If there's no other business,
I think we can wind up the meeting.

287
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,852
Crash. Powdered glass all over the carpet.

288
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,195
My God!

289
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,763
What?

290
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,831
I must be mad.

291
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,972
You're old enough
to be my managing director.

292
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,315
Come in.

293
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,852
Pardon me, sir.

294
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:40,694
Madam said three guests have arrived
and she doesn't know them very well.

295
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:42,264
Yes, right.

296
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:48,137
You'll let me know about that offer
as soon as you can, will you?

297
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,609
Do you want to see what James offered me?

298
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,240
I never pry into anything
Mr. James does for you.

299
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,717
I only hope that you know
how to show your gratitude.

300
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,846
See you domani? What about tonight?

301
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,443
Thought you Eyeties
are supposed to be fast workers.

302
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,285
The coliseum! But I want to be
alone with you. Get on with it.

303
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,566
- Meredith's out.
- Hell!

304
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,297
- But you knew she had a concert.
- I forgot.

305
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:56,271
- You got company?
- Yeah, come and meet him.

306
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,546
My date. My amore:

307
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,246
You must be hard up.

308
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:09,719
Why, I am. Hadn't you noticed?
22, never been kissed. Pathetic, isn't it?

309
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,461
Let's go.

310
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,528
Come on!

311
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:30,130
If you're just asking me
because you're sorry for me...

312
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,472
then you don't have to bother. Good night.

313
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,373
I know I don't have to bother,
and I'm not sorry for you...

314
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:37,311
and I am asking you. So, come on!

315
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:38,440
Wait for us.

316
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,849
Hey, come on, Georgy.
Now this is your big chance. Don't miss it!

317
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:43,181
Beg your pardon.

318
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,955
- That's enough of that, Georgy.
- Why?

319
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:15,726
I like it! Why are you stopping?

320
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,725
I know I'm not pretty like Meredith.

321
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,236
God, no.

322
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,965
You're not like Meredith.

323
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:27,306
I couldn't go to bed with you
like I do with her...

324
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:31,439
then grab a tomato sandwich
and rush out and catch the 72 bus.

325
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,614
With you, it would be just one
long drawn-out bloody drama.

326
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:40,188
All this whining and carrying on.

327
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:45,859
You know, the trouble with you is,
you could say that you're a good girl.

328
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,131
So I'm sorry, lass.

329
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,211
Bye, love.

330
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,918
See you.

331
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,981
Have a good time?

332
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,649
So-so.

333
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,161
Didn't lead to bed,
so he can't have been up to much.

334
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,186
I want to talk.

335
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,122
Enough of that.

336
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,168
I'm bored.

337
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,469
Bored living with Georgy.
I think we ought to get married.

338
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,876
We don't fight, we love it in bed, and...
Well, that's about it, really.

339
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,808
- You must be pregnant.
- Yes.

340
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,090
There is absolutely no point at all
in us getting married...

341
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,653
when I know nothing about you,
except... Well, things I don't like.

342
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:29,529
- You take me as me.
- Who is you?

343
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:32,228
Don't give me that rubbish.
I don't ask you what you are.

344
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,430
You should if we're going to marry,
have a kid.

345
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,973
If you're going to make this
a great big number...

346
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,406
let's pretend I never spoke.

347
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,376
- Is it the baby?
- What?

348
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,603
That makes you want to marry me?

349
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:45,376
Just feel like a change.
I can easily get rid of it.

350
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:48,384
- Just like that?
- Why not? I have no tender feelings about it.

351
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,977
If that's what you wanted,
you shouldn't have told me.

352
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:54,582
Don't be so stupid.
I've destroyed two of yours already.

353
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,924
What? When? Why didn't you tell me?
Didn't I have a right to know?

354
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:02,295
Weren't they my sons and my daughters?

355
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,161
You're not getting rid of this one anyway.

356
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,570
- Lf I want to?
- I won't let you.

357
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,870
- You can't stop me.
- You'll marry me and have it.

358
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,240
Fine. That's what I said at the start.

359
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,784
You're not. Not again.

360
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:13,368
It's no use you asking me to lend you
the money this time, because I won't.

361
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,897
I don't care if it's old hat.
I know it's just a middle-class taboo...

362
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:21,001
and the law needs changing
and the population of these islands...

363
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,569
will be double by the year 2000,
but I won't do it!

364
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,512
I'm saving up, anyway, to go to Majorca.

365
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:29,610
Shut up, Georgy. Nobody asked you to.
I'm having this one.

366
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,279
Do you mean really? Having?

367
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:34,153
Jos and I are getting married.

368
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:36,056
No! Darling!

369
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,852
Georgy, please, you're drooling.

370
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:41,830
A baby. That's marvelous!

371
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,801
Don't shout. If I feel like this every morning,
I'll probably change my mind.

372
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,601
You must eat, little and often.
You'll start with a biscuit before you get up.

373
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,231
Don't get out of bed in a hurry.

374
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,644
Don't worry, Meredith. I'll look after you.

375
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,712
I'm going to be the bridesmaid.

376
00:41:59,712 --> 00:42:03,082
And don't you throw that bouquet at me.
You give it to me carefully...

377
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:05,587
'cause I won't have my glasses on
and I might drop it.

378
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:07,088
No bridesmaids, darling.

379
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:09,990
No confetti, organs, vicars,
Mendelssohn or Moss Bros.

380
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,120
Up the registry, quick in and out,
ta very much. Next, please.

381
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,256
Meredith, you must do something.

382
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:17,027
- I'll tell you what, Georgy.
- What?

383
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:18,591
You can be best man.

384
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,003
- What about when you're married?
- What about it?

385
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:25,268
You and Jos will be there. What about me?

386
00:42:25,268 --> 00:42:27,833
- You thinking of leaving?
- Not if you don't want me to.

387
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,005
- I'm easy if you are.
- You don't want me to go?

388
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,049
- Who'd do the cooking?
- Meredith, I love you.

389
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,021
Meredith's getting married. She's pregnant.

390
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,327
That's nice, isn't it?
Typical of the way we're going.

391
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,191
I sometimes wonder to what
the country's coming to.

392
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,957
Don't you go getting yourself into trouble,
that's all.

393
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,231
Doris, don't speak like that.

394
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,571
He'd never forgive me.

395
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,343
You've got to drink your orange juice,
hasn't she, Jos?

396
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:04,404
Yes, indeed. Otherwise, this baby of mine
won't have any teeth...

397
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:06,506
and infant false teeth can be very expensive.

398
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:10,748
If your dialogue is this corny now,
Jos Jones, God help us when we're married.

399
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,991
At least you take your iron pills.

400
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:18,688
You see, Mommy dear,
the baby lives on your blood supply...

401
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:23,165
Look. I wish you'd both belt up
about this bloody baby. I'm off to work.

402
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,702
Don't worry. The kid will survive.

403
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:29,238
My mother, she ate nothing but chips
before I was born.

404
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:33,800
- Yeah, look at you now, you wreck.
- Help. I'm a wreck. I'm dying.

405
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,938
Yes, my knees are getting weaker
and there's a flutter in my chest, there is.

406
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:41,348
Come here. Yes. Feel.

407
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,047
Cold. You ain't half got
nice cold hands, miss.

408
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:47,852
And you'll feel a wrong side of it
in a minute, my lad.

409
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:49,825
You wouldn't hit me, miss.

410
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,392
You and Meredith, you're hopeless.

411
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:57,992
If it's the last thing I do,
I'm going to get you lot organized.

412
00:43:57,992 --> 00:43:59,399
Organized?

413
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,248
And, Miss Perry,
I don't want to be disturbed.

414
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,011
Very good, Mr. Leamington.

415
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,760
Come over here
and make yourself comfortable.

416
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,261
Sit down. Go on.

417
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,702
- Have you come to give me your answer?
- Answer?

418
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,707
No, this is serious.

419
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,444
You know you're always saying
you'll do anything for me and all that.

420
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:49,816
- Yes.
- Well, I need a pram.

421
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,289
And a cot.

422
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,254
And some nappies.

423
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,256
And some blankets and a high chair and...

424
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:04,766
Who is it, Georgy?

425
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,769
- Meredith, actually.
- Meredith?

426
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,600
But she's a girl.

427
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,838
Yeah, I noticed that, too. That's the sort
that usually has babies, isn't it?

428
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,736
I could wring your neck!

429
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,809
I won't, though.

430
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:26,947
None of that. Watch the old blood pressure.

431
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:37,431
Can you give me one reason
why I should buy all that stuff for Meredith?

432
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:41,096
Meredith will never bother. I don't know.

433
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,467
You've got a nerve, you have.

434
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,633
- It's all that keeps me going, mister.
- All right.

435
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,572
You're a lovely old thing, really.

436
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:55,277
We'll go along together, shall we?
How about tomorrow?

437
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:58,844
- No, we can't go tomorrow.
- They're getting married tomorrow.

438
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,531
You look beautiful.

439
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,967
- It's ridiculous, Georgy.
- It's not. It's lovely.

440
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,477
Don't cry now or I'll bash you.

441
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,143
On your marks, get set, go.

442
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,740
...the solemn and binding character of the...

443
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,752
- Got a cigarette?
- You can't smoke now.

444
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,485
- For God's sake.
- Please.

445
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:53,655
- Shut up. You can have one when it's over.
- I'm not going in till I get a cigarette.

446
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:55,994
If you don't behave,
I'll take your knickers down...

447
00:48:55,994 --> 00:48:58,227
give you such a belting,
you won't sit for a week.

448
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,270
- You just try.
- Don't argue now.

449
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,676
Good morning.

450
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,810
- Jones.
- Miss Montgomery and Mr. Jones.

451
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,420
Jones. I never thought of that. Mrs. Jones.

452
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,618
- I beg your pardon.
- Nothing.

453
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,613
Give it.

454
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,748
Give it to me.

455
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,906
It's raining.

456
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,669
Yes. Well, now.

457
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,939
What next? Oh, yes. Legally.

458
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:49,036
Mrs. Scarlet Meredith Jones.

459
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:50,612
I'd forgotten about that.

460
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,580
Leave some cake, George.

461
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,988
Now, at this stage is the heaviest strain:

462
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,859
You can see the value
of giving the mother: : :

463
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:39,020
The injection of the drug called Erzontine:

464
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,657
Incidentally, it may help
to contract the uterus:

465
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,167
Here it comes: It's a boy!

466
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,069
Good lusty yells: A new life has begun:

467
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:08,515
: : : the mother, by being awake, has had
the joy of sharing her child's first moments:

468
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:10,421
We were watching that.

469
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:14,123
- Do anything to get on telly, some people.
- Meredith, it was marvelous.

470
00:52:14,123 --> 00:52:17,394
Funny thing is, they wouldn't have
themselves taken on the lavatory.

471
00:52:17,394 --> 00:52:21,130
It's all part of this trend to make out
it's not an animal function at all...

472
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,196
- but something frightfully spiritual.
- It's a miracle, Meredith.

473
00:52:24,196 --> 00:52:26,936
Rot. I can have this baby quite efficiently,
thank you...

474
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:30,537
without going into some enormous trance
as if I was at Lourdes.

475
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,408
- How was the concert, my dear?
- Beethoven night. They're like animals.

476
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,253
You ought to stop work.

477
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:40,949
And live on what he gets at the bank?
You must be joking.

478
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,618
There's what I get from my classes.
Spock says here:

479
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,389
- "After the third month"...
- For God's sake!

480
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:01,068
I say, do you have the feeling
that Meredith's a sort of irritating lodger?

481
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,244
Look at us, missus. Here we are,
sitting by the light of the silvery telly.

482
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:09,751
We're like the old married couple.

483
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,687
What do you say, Fish-face?

484
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,786
I'm talking to you.

485
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,494
Hey, Fish-face.

486
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:15,076
- What?
- There are things here.

487
00:54:15,076 --> 00:54:17,346
- Things?
- Yes, things.

488
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,287
Look at it all. It ruins everything.

489
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:23,553
Surprise!

490
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,922
What's the matter?

491
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,895
- Meredith, it's for the baby.
- I didn't think it was for the prime minister.

492
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,008
- Where'd you get the money, George?
- James. I went to him and...

493
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:41,976
You went to another man?
That dirty old man?

494
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:44,513
What do you mean, another man?
I'm not your wife.

495
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,030
How do you do? Come on.

496
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,780
Bye-bye.

497
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,614
There you are. Off you go.

498
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,253
I've got you.

499
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,651
Can't stop. In a hurry.

500
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:34,458
- You always are these days.
- Yes. Sorry.

501
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,229
Don't mess about, mister.

502
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:42,703
I haven't seen you for months.
Can't you spare me two minutes?

503
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:48,608
- How's the pregnancy going?
- Lumping along.

504
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,669
- Still at the flat?
- That's right.

505
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:52,647
- The three of you?
- Four, soon.

506
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,644
That's not very fair on you.
The wife, the husband, too.

507
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,050
We share.

508
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,521
- You share? Share what? Him?
- The flat.

509
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:05,619
- It all seems very offbeat, if you ask me.
- It is. It's dead kinky.

510
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:09,358
We all dress up as Boy Scouts
and beat each other with our woggles.

511
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,299
- Get them out of the flat. I'll pay your rent.
- Can't be done.

512
00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:19,103
- Why not?
- The baby.

513
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,208
Look, I haven't had my answer yet.

514
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,379
- Forgot my hat.
- Come on. Bye-bye.

515
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:26,574
Here.

516
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,718
You know, I won 15 and 6 myself
on that race, sir.

517
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:39,057
- What a winner that horse was.
- And it won't be the last time, either.

518
00:56:39,057 --> 00:56:41,529
I bet it won't.
The wife's laid out a buffet supper.

519
00:56:41,529 --> 00:56:43,930
- Get us a bottle of something.
- Right you are, sir.

520
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,697
- The Nuits-Saint-Georges, perhaps.
- That sounds good enough for me.

521
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:50,467
Doris, Mrs. Leamington isn't joining me
for supper, is she?

522
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,167
- No, sir.
- Right.

523
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,870
Then you'll sit down with me,
won't you, Ted?

524
00:56:55,879 --> 00:57:00,111
Thank you very much, sir.
Now that is the end of a perfect day.

525
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,247
Mr. James' horse won.

526
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:04,319
Mrs. Leamington's gone.

527
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,479
- Gone?
- Gone.

528
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,488
Gone where?

529
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,091
She's dead.

530
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,926
Doris, what a thing to say.

531
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,500
What am I expected to say then?

532
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,696
Wait a minute.

533
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,240
Leave it to me, sir.

534
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:42,248
Doris, what a way in which to speak.
What happened?

535
00:57:42,248 --> 00:57:45,486
I heard this thundering
great crash upstairs...

536
00:57:45,486 --> 00:57:47,792
and thinking it was that damned cat,
up I went.

537
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:51,197
If I've shooed that cat out of
that bedroom once, I've shooed him out...

538
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:52,928
Get on with it.

539
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,705
There she was, lying beside the bed,
Mrs. Leamington, this is...

540
00:57:56,705 --> 00:58:00,231
with one of her medical books on the floor
where she'd dropped it.

541
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:04,007
- All blue her face was...
- Doris, don't go into it.

542
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:07,277
- Did you fetch the doctor?
- Yes. He said she was dead straight away.

543
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:11,252
I helped him lift her onto the bed.
She does look awful.

544
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,451
Come in.

545
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,951
My apologies for that, sir.
Doris is not herself.

546
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,991
Your wife is at peace, Mr. James.
It was a quick and merciful release.

547
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,533
- I don't suppose she knew what hit her.
- Something hit her?

548
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:30,868
Pardon?

549
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,273
I see.

550
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,706
- What do we do?
- I'll take care of everything, Mr. James.

551
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,776
- You're too overcome with grief and shock.
- Yes, that's right.

552
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,252
No doubt you'd like to pay
your last respects?

553
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,317
It was nice of you to come, Georgy.

554
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,861
I don't mind funerals.

555
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,902
That's lovely, Georgy. Yes.

556
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,371
Look, feet.

557
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:53,608
What's this? The chamber of horrors?

558
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,844
- Hi.
- They're the most marvelous pictures.

559
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,352
Look, will you two leave me alone?

560
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,552
They'll help you understand
the fetal development.

561
01:01:02,552 --> 01:01:05,253
I don't want to understand
or know anything about it.

562
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:07,853
You know, she won't even recognize labor
when it starts.

563
01:01:07,853 --> 01:01:09,397
Won't I just.

564
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,790
- Now, come on, Mommy.
- Shut up!

565
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,106
I'll tell you what this little episode's
taught me.

566
01:01:23,106 --> 01:01:26,410
It's taught me what it feels like
to look like the back end of a bus.

567
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,110
And sit around every night
with nothing to do.

568
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,051
You bitch!

569
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,291
We're not crying, are we?

570
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,122
Here we go again. Just like my mother.

571
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:42,653
She always used to cry when the announcer
on the radio said goodnight.

572
01:01:42,653 --> 01:01:45,792
Lucky for you you're pregnant.
Otherwise, I might smack your face.

573
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:47,802
You think
you're one of the world's beauties.

574
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:50,031
At least I'm not one of its freaks.

575
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,104
- I think I'll smack it anyway.
- Let me go.

576
01:01:52,104 --> 01:01:55,770
No, she's right, Jos.
I'm like the back of a bus. My face is too fat.

577
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,678
- My hair's like grass. I'm just a mess.
- Shut up. You're not.

578
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:00,613
- Look, she's just jealous of you.
- Jealous!

579
01:02:00,613 --> 01:02:02,548
- Will you look at the size of me?
- Jealous!

580
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:04,108
- Never!
- Stop it!

581
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,682
- You're bloody jealous.
- Stop it!

582
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,624
- Why the hell did I marry you?
- Jos, please, go away.

583
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:12,524
Why did you marry me?

584
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,200
Thunderous chords on the piano.
Scream of train going into tunnel.

585
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,772
Don't pass out, dear.

586
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,633
I love you!

587
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,980
I love you, damn you!

588
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,930
I love you.

589
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,341
- I love you.
- Shut up!

590
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:42,941
Come back to the flat
because I want to talk to you.

591
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:46,318
- I don't want to listen.
- Sorry, love, but I love you.

592
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,494
She was a beautiful woman.

593
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,194
Beautiful.

594
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,596
Tolerant.

595
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,299
Civilized.

596
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,005
And about as exciting as a half brick.

597
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:11,079
I'd always hoped, when Georgy
was a little girl, that you'd have a son.

598
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,280
I don't know. Maybe they'd get married.

599
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,751
I suppose that sounds silly to you,
the idea of anyone wanting Georgy.

600
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,221
No.

601
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,898
I never see her these days.

602
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,992
Doesn't it worry you sometimes,
the danger she runs?

603
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,770
- Danger?
- The people she mixes with.

604
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,898
- She's not much more than a child.
- She's as tough as old boots.

605
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:42,411
Do you know when she was eight,
she could crack a walnut in her fist?

606
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,969
She's a girl, she's immature.

607
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:48,477
Who'd want to try it on with old Georgy?

608
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,244
I mean, look at her.

609
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,568
I love you!

610
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,700
I love her. I do. What can I do?

611
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,713
I love her. I do. What can I do, scuddlydoo.

612
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:21,807
Listen, missus, I'm not kidding. I love you!

613
01:05:21,807 --> 01:05:24,409
Listen, I'm not kidding.
I'm a desperate man, missus!

614
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:26,284
I'll stop at nothing!

615
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,792
I'm going to strip stark naked
if you don't come home with me right now.

616
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:34,955
You don't believe me, do you?
She doesn't believe me.

617
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,136
Hey, watch this.
The fastest untying of a tie...

618
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:45,833
since the first Roman tied a bit of cloth
around his neck. What did you say?

619
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:48,843
Romans didn't invent ties?
Well, I'm weak on history.

620
01:05:48,843 --> 01:05:50,879
You're not scared yet, are you, darling?

621
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:54,110
Watch this then. Lovely pair of shoes here.
Socks as well.

622
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,650
How about that?

623
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,125
Only the pants left, honey,
and here they go now.

624
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,753
Wait for the countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one...

625
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,261
- Jos, please!
- Do you give in?

626
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:10,356
Or do you want the Chinese water torture?

627
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:13,266
- Put your clothes on.
- Then you'll come home?

628
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,137
Hurry up, my nipples are freezing.

629
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,296
I love you.

630
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:46,160
I never said that to her or to anyone.

631
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:52,163
I've grown to love you in the right way.
So that's all right.

632
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,904
Isn't it?

633
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,267
- Jos, I love you.
- I know.

634
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,411
It's because I do, it's because...

635
01:07:30,411 --> 01:07:32,947
Look, don't go on, missus. It'll be all right.

636
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:34,448
Will it?

637
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,447
We'll live happily ever after.

638
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,631
- Who is it?
- It's Peg.

639
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,758
Peg? That's short for Margaret, isn't it?

640
01:07:52,758 --> 01:07:56,396
Yes. I can't invite you in, dear,
you see, I've just got out of bed.

641
01:07:56,396 --> 01:08:00,135
- Don't you want to know about Meredith?
- What? She's asleep.

642
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:04,142
Is she?
I've just come back from the hospital.

643
01:08:04,142 --> 01:08:06,181
She's started her pains.

644
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:14,117
- What's going on? Why weren't you here?
- Look, I'll write you a letter, dear.

645
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,356
- Are you alone?
- Look, belt up, Peg. Is there anything else?

646
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:22,329
No. The nurses said I couldn't be
much help, and you've to ring at 8:00.

647
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:24,662
There we are, then.
Ring at 8:00. Good night, dear.

648
01:08:24,662 --> 01:08:26,257
We're going to the hospital.

649
01:08:26,257 --> 01:08:28,462
But Peg says we don't have to go
till tomorrow.

650
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:30,971
She's having your baby! Yours!

651
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:46,116
Naughty. We don't need the gas and air
till we get much stronger contractions.

652
01:08:46,116 --> 01:08:47,815
Have you ever had a baby?

653
01:08:47,815 --> 01:08:49,824
No. But I've brought
hundreds into the world.

654
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:52,053
Then belt up
and leave me alone with this thing.

655
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,120
You speak to me like that,
I'll take it away altogether.

656
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,223
There's a visitor for you.

657
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,930
All right, dear.

658
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,316
That's right. Try to get some bye-byes.

659
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,477
I'll bring you a couple of aspirin.

660
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:23,024
It's like burning and she says aspirin.

661
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,358
Spiritual experience.

662
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,433
Help.

663
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,744
Thank you, my dear.

664
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:49,181
What is your name
and your telephone number?

665
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,413
Thank you. Goodbye.

666
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,439
- What time is it?
- 8:30.

667
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,073
I'd better ring.

668
01:10:56,385 --> 01:11:00,947
It's a girl. 7 pounds, 2 ounces.
Born at 6:30. Both doing well.

669
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,384
You rang. That's what they said?

670
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,663
7 pounds, 2 ounces.

671
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:14,396
That's not bad for someone her size. A girl.

672
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:19,398
That's better in a way.
A boy needs more from a father.

673
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,702
What name did we choose for it if it's a girl?

674
01:11:22,702 --> 01:11:24,643
Sara. Without an "H."

675
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,354
Sounds like some international combine
or club or something.

676
01:11:35,354 --> 01:11:38,757
Society for the Admiration
of Risky Anecdotes.

677
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,932
Shall we drink to the baby's health?

678
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:48,026
Throw me in a piece of fried bread,
would you?

679
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,399
Long life and happiness.

680
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:57,741
Yes. Good luck, mate.
You'll need it with her for a mother.

681
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,744
Amazing things happen to women
when they have children.

682
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:03,649
The most unexpected people
suddenly turn out natural mothers.

683
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:06,347
I don't know why she didn't
get rid of it like the others.

684
01:12:06,347 --> 01:12:08,982
- She went through hell to have it.
- And she deserved to.

685
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:12,255
No one deserves to.
She was in agony, and she needed us.

686
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:16,128
- We were in there, rolling about on the floor.
- We didn't know.

687
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,591
Give me another.

688
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,527
Bad luck, your first time.

689
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:26,301
It's the absolute story of my life.
No matter what I try...

690
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,310
God's always got a custard pie
up his sleeve.

691
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:34,315
Very good. I'm afraid most of
the pathetic clowns are cast this season.

692
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:35,816
Give it a rest, Jos.

693
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,553
Are you interested in small parts?

694
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:41,521
I know most girls aren't these days...

695
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:44,991
but you know, you seem to have
such bad luck in this direction.

696
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,227
I love you.

697
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,863
I love you.

698
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,439
God, isn't it marvelous without her?

699
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:07,448
- Don't say that.
- Sorry.

700
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,807
Say the first thing
that comes into your head.

701
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,250
Yes, it is.

702
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,213
Time I got dressed.

703
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,593
Blimey.

704
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,724
- Do you think you could make the bedroom?
- No.

705
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,789
Well, I'll try.

706
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,002
Put me down.

707
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:42,974
Jos, please put me down.

708
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,686
- How long?
- Doctor said eight weeks.

709
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,235
- Hi.
- Where the hell have you been?

710
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,813
- How are you feeling?
- Lousy.

711
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,064
Well? Aren't you going to look at it?

712
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:09,331
This is your marvelous child you
couldn't bear being destroyed, remember?

713
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,636
It's hideous. I hate it.

714
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,502
It gave me hell.

715
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,385
All new babies look like that.
You'll like it when it's a bit older.

716
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:28,446
No. I want it adopted. Now.

717
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,465
I've got a rotten headache.
Have you got any aspirin or dope?

718
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:48,874
Not that I couldn't use it myself.

719
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,778
How do you set about adoption, anyway?

720
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:55,044
If I ask the nurses here,
they'll plague me with sermons.

721
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,451
- You're a bitch.
- You're a bastard.

722
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,736
- How is she?
- Fine.

723
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:22,171
- Want to go up and see her?
- No. Can't.

724
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,501
Come on then.

725
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:30,107
- Is she proud of the baby?
- Yes. Drooling over it all the time.

726
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,550
There, I told you so.

727
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,180
It's a bit strange, really,
because she's dead ugly.

728
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,382
Sara?

729
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,027
- Cauliflower ear, a terrible squint.
- That poor baby.

730
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:43,720
Part of a wig join that you can see
from one end of the ward to the other.

731
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,097
- Hey, look!
- That's not funny.

732
01:16:46,097 --> 01:16:47,258
Catch me.

733
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,676
That's why adoption is so tricky to arrange.

734
01:17:32,676 --> 01:17:35,546
You can't be sure
the mother knows her own mind.

735
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:39,849
Don't worry. You can be sure in this case.
In fact, I think it's probably the only way.

736
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:41,980
You see, the home situation is a bit offbeat.

737
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,322
Offbeat? How do you mean? Excuse me.

738
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:49,822
- Sister, shall I take her to the nursery?
- No. Just hold on a minute.

739
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:52,958
- I was just discussing her with...
- Hey, George.

740
01:17:56,538 --> 01:18:00,406
Jos! How are you? Congratulations.

741
01:18:00,406 --> 01:18:02,238
I thought you said you weren't coming.

742
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:05,711
I changed my mind.
I'm so thrilled about the baby.

743
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:07,874
Are you visiting Mrs. Jones?

744
01:18:07,874 --> 01:18:11,077
Yes. I'm her sister, Georgina Jones.
I've been out of the country.

745
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:12,211
I couldn't get in sooner.

746
01:18:12,211 --> 01:18:14,551
But surely Jones is her married name.

747
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:20,123
Yes. Well, I mean her sister-in-law.
I'm Jos' sister.

748
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,220
That's my baby.

749
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,656
Can I hold her?

750
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:27,498
Sure. Have a hold. Be my guest.

751
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,788
Meredith, you're looking marvelous.

752
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,253
Where have you been?

753
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,054
- I've just seen her.
- Who?

754
01:18:53,054 --> 01:18:54,789
- Sara.
- Oh, that.

755
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,491
Honestly, she's going to be
a real knockout, just like her mother.

756
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:01,502
Georgy, please. None of the
hearts and flowers mother-love bit.

757
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:03,765
Honestly, she's beautiful.
She's just like you.

758
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:05,101
Shut up, Georgy, will you?

759
01:19:05,101 --> 01:19:08,301
Come on, Meredith,
you're just feeling down in the dumps.

760
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,008
Don't you tell me what I'm feeling.

761
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:14,676
As far as I'm concerned,
when I leave this hospital, I leave alone.

762
01:19:14,676 --> 01:19:17,617
- All very sad, but...
- Don't talk like that, Meredith.

763
01:19:17,617 --> 01:19:20,849
I'm not having my life cluttered up
with some screeching baby.

764
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:22,685
The flat's all ready, and I'm leaving.

765
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:25,852
It won't be fair to have me hanging around
the three of you.

766
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,056
- What have you been telling her?
- What?

767
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,629
Whatever it is, just get this straight, Georgy.

768
01:19:32,629 --> 01:19:35,693
I'm having this baby adopted,
and that's that!

769
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,810
You're not going to give Sara away.

770
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,613
Not now you've seen her and touched her.

771
01:19:47,613 --> 01:19:49,707
I don't touch her. I leave it to this crew.

772
01:19:49,707 --> 01:19:53,050
- Now, just a minute, young lady.
- You stay out of it, you old bag.

773
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:57,285
You can't. How can you not
want to hold her and take care of her?

774
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:59,691
God. The embarrassment. Okay.

775
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,355
If you're so keen on this bloody thing,
then you have it.

776
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:03,795
Free. Gratis and for nothing.

777
01:20:03,795 --> 01:20:07,858
With none of the attendant pain
or discomfort. Instant families!

778
01:20:07,858 --> 01:20:11,133
Yes, all right. I will. Of course I will.

779
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:15,636
I wouldn't wish a mother like you
on her. You're a cow, Meredith.

780
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:21,475
It's all right, everybody. Keep calm.
It's nothing whatever to do with you.

781
01:20:21,475 --> 01:20:24,542
Yes. Well...

782
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,863
- Get rid of all this junk, Ted.
- Yes. Dispose of all the sad reminders, sir?

783
01:20:41,863 --> 01:20:43,666
Of course.

784
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,075
- Come on, Jos.
- I'm coming.

785
01:20:49,075 --> 01:20:50,668
Come on, quick.

786
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,445
I'm not used to this.

787
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:56,313
- You're holding her all wrong.
- What do you mean?

788
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,654
Come on, that's better.
Now you make the tea.

789
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:04,347
Poor baby. There's a baby.

790
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,769
Darling!

791
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:43,555
They can start reading at 18 months
if the letters are big enough.

792
01:21:43,555 --> 01:21:44,963
She'll start before that.

793
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:47,194
- Bank sensation!
- You're late!

794
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,170
The books were out five pence.
It was every man for himself.

795
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:53,401
You two trying to get your weight down?
It's like a pressure cooker.

796
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:56,808
The nappies have got to be done somewhere
and we don't want nappy rash.

797
01:21:56,808 --> 01:21:57,970
No, we don't.

798
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,604
- How's the basket?
- Getting on.

799
01:21:59,604 --> 01:22:01,342
I meant this one.

800
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,320
So much for fatherhood.

801
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,853
What's this one for? Catching heads?

802
01:22:09,853 --> 01:22:11,790
- Jos!
- Did you get paid?

803
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,761
Wealth, beyond the dreams of avarice.

804
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:18,230
- Let's go to pictures, Georgy.
- We can't, 'cause we can't leave Sara.

805
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,495
Peg will look after her, won't you,
my old beauty?

806
01:22:20,495 --> 01:22:23,332
- She can't, Jos.
- Sorry, my pottery class.

807
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,566
Damn!

808
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,943
- You go by yourself.
- That's fun.

809
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:33,413
Well, I've got masses to do.
I don't mind, honestly.

810
01:22:33,413 --> 01:22:36,041
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

811
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:38,574
Whoopee.

812
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,515
I'll have to get me skates on.

813
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,901
- Do you get it?
- Yes, I see.

814
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:58,338
- Do you really?
- What I mean is lace, soft and white...

815
01:22:58,338 --> 01:23:02,604
like lace. You know, lots of...

816
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,541
- Lace.
- Right. All over.

817
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:11,419
All over. Yes, well, if you're quite sure...

818
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:13,647
Tony, the flock material.

819
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,421
What do you think?

820
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,656
- That's the stuff.
- You see how it drapes?

821
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,427
It's going to be like
some Bessarabian brothel up there.

822
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:31,437
Her room?

823
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:34,964
And that bed. It's all lace and cupids.

824
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,403
Is he gonna get some fancy woman in?

825
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:40,004
A couple of nancy boys
dancing about there.

826
01:23:40,004 --> 01:23:41,207
God!

827
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,285
He is going to get a fancy woman in.

828
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,318
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- So long.

829
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:04,401
- Come to make an honest woman of me?
- Something like that.

830
01:24:04,401 --> 01:24:08,670
That's not good enough.
I told you those pills wouldn't work, mister.

831
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,005
Well!

832
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:20,282
Good God, you're not going to
take that thing up all those stairs?

833
01:24:20,282 --> 01:24:23,620
Aye, can't afford to lose it.
It's Sara's status symbol.

834
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:28,855
- You're mad, Georgy.
- Think so? Never been better.

835
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:41,233
- Your dad told me about all this.
- Left holding the baby as usual.

836
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,639
Can we talk?

837
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,943
Haven't got time, old love.
She's due for her bath.

838
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,375
Well?

839
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,945
You can't go on like this, Georgy.

840
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,985
Poor old James. Bye-bye.

841
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,696
Peg says we ought to think
more about Sara.

842
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,057
- More?
- Yes, her future.

843
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,394
Look.

844
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:47,129
For one moment, just let us think...

845
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,037
of nothing but the present.

846
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,662
She thinks Sara's going to suffer
if we're not married.

847
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:14,460
Nuts. Look, it'll be years
before that becomes a problem.

848
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,105
We can't go on like this for years.

849
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,339
Don't you want to marry me?

850
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,313
You used to.

851
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:31,910
What?

852
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:34,248
Want to marry me.

853
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:37,981
You've changed.

854
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:44,994
I've changed? No, ma'am. I don't change.

855
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,199
- You've changed.
- I'm making a home for you.

856
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:49,861
A home? A clinic!

857
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:52,563
- Look, do you honestly like all this?
- Yes!

858
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,968
George, I...

859
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:06,044
No, Jos. I'm going to sleep.
I've got to feed Sara in a couple of hours.

860
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:14,683
Mrs. Jones?

861
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:18,487
Yes. Well, no. Actually, my name is Parkin.

862
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,860
Mrs. Jones does live here, though?

863
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,865
Not exactly, no. Mr. Jones does.

864
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:27,894
And the baby?

865
01:28:27,894 --> 01:28:30,233
Yes, the baby's here, yes.
I was just changing her.

866
01:28:30,233 --> 01:28:31,499
I see.

867
01:28:31,499 --> 01:28:34,370
Well, perhaps you could
spare me a moment.

868
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,842
I'm your health visitor.

869
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:43,048
- Yes, well, come in. It's awfully wet.
- Thank you.

870
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,988
- Isn't she sweet?
- Gorgeous.

871
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,959
But the husband has custody of the child?

872
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,567
Yes, it's a bit vague, really.

873
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:04,605
- But he lives here?
- Yes.

874
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,168
And you. Do you live here?

875
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,848
Well, I sort of live in.

876
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:20,013
I'm employed to look after the baby
while Mr. Jones is at work.

877
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,052
I sleep on the divan in the sitting room.

878
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:29,124
So he has a steady job.

879
01:29:29,124 --> 01:29:32,098
There's no problem about providing
for the child or anything?

880
01:29:32,098 --> 01:29:34,600
No. He has this terribly good job
at the bank.

881
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,628
He's very responsible.
Aware of his responsibilities.

882
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:45,539
George, where are you?
You great sexy beast! I'm free!

883
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:50,479
I've chucked in that God-awful job
at the bank and I'm free.

884
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:53,645
Now we can spend all day in bed together.
Where are you?

885
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:57,714
Where are you hiding that great
seraphic body of yours? Come out!

886
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,260
Mr. Jones?

887
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:15,468
You don't sound as if
you've got much heartache.

888
01:30:15,468 --> 01:30:18,170
I have. It really hurts.

889
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,840
As we run by the end of the jetty,
on our right-hand side: : :

890
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,943
If you look on the shore: : :

891
01:30:25,943 --> 01:30:29,956
You will see a small gray-colored house
with a red street door:

892
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,983
In that house, Sir Christopher Wren lived...

893
01:30:32,983 --> 01:30:36,257
while Saint Paul's Cathedral
was being constructed.

894
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,356
And as you can see: : : :

895
01:30:38,356 --> 01:30:40,594
"In that house, Sir Christopher Wren lived...

896
01:30:40,594 --> 01:30:43,933
"while Saint Paul's Cathedral
was being constructed."

897
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,515
He could see it from his bedroom window.

898
01:30:55,515 --> 01:30:58,552
One morning, he woke up and he saw
that they were nearly done...

899
01:30:58,552 --> 01:31:02,146
and he said, "My God, it's there.
I'm famous. I've built Saint Paul's."

900
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,257
It's true.

901
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,669
Shall I tell you a little story?

902
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,703
One wintry afternoon, not unlike this,
nip in the air...

903
01:31:26,703 --> 01:31:29,249
- I watched a fellow drown himself.
- We've got to talk.

904
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:33,219
I was walking along the embankment
and he was swimming in the dirty water...

905
01:31:33,219 --> 01:31:36,415
with his trousers on,
and a see-through nylon shirt.

906
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:39,751
First of all, I thought
he was one of these health perverts.

907
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:42,489
Then I noticed he was keeping himself
away from the shore.

908
01:31:42,489 --> 01:31:45,930
Tiring himself out, you see,
getting weaker and weaker.

909
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,369
Then the river police came in a launch.

910
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,002
But by the time, he'd gone under.

911
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:58,277
They cruised around for a bit, then they
went away. To get a net, I suppose.

912
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,584
I've never felt suicidal, Georgy,
till the last few weeks.

913
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:16,288
Didn't you try to save him?

914
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,660
I don't want to save anybody.

915
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:24,160
That's where you're a freak, Georgy.

916
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,572
Not being big and ugly, and all that.
It's this wanting to save people.

917
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:43,749
: : : where we will have a five-minute stay:

918
01:32:43,749 --> 01:32:47,452
I would like to point out that
the commentaries on these vessels: : :

919
01:32:47,452 --> 01:32:49,018
Are entirely voluntary:

920
01:32:49,018 --> 01:32:52,725
Therefore, should any of you
care to appreciate it: : :

921
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:56,028
You may do so when I pass among you
with a hat:

922
01:32:56,437 --> 01:33:00,999
For which, I should like to thank you
very much: Thank you very much:

923
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:16,414
I love her. I do. What can I do, scuddlydoo.

924
01:33:16,414 --> 01:33:19,584
Hey, I am a desperate man, missus.
I'll stop at nothing.

925
01:33:19,584 --> 01:33:22,493
I'm going to strip stark naked
if you don't come home with me.

926
01:33:22,493 --> 01:33:25,191
Go away, Jos. Go away, or I'll cry.

927
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:28,201
Really? How very peculiar.

928
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,201
You mean, salt tears will actually
fall down your cheeks?

929
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,538
Shall I cry? I'm told it's quite easy.

930
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:48,954
It's no good, nothing happens.
Can you teach me?

931
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:54,421
Hey, fat-face, I'm talking to you.

932
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:59,626
I haven't cried
since I fell off the seat of my bicycle...

933
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:01,600
onto the crossbar when I was eight.

934
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:06,099
You're not laughing, are you?

935
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:10,437
No, you're not. Other people might think
you were, but not me.

936
01:34:10,437 --> 01:34:14,743
I can see through what other people
might think was a laugh, just like that.

937
01:34:14,743 --> 01:34:16,712
That was meant to be my fingers clicking.

938
01:34:16,712 --> 01:34:20,049
Only, because I can't click my fingers,
I use my tongue instead.

939
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:23,883
I'm like Peter Pan.

940
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:28,119
He couldn't click his, you know...
It's very embarrassing.

941
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:33,516
Georgy, could I talk to you for a minute?

942
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:35,527
Come inside.

943
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:48,675
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

944
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,809
I just want to be sure
of your undivided attention.

945
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,848
I see. It's abduction now.

946
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,015
He's gone, hasn't he?

947
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,085
Jos? Yes.

948
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,480
What are you going to do now?

949
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:06,390
Don't know.

950
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:09,958
I've been thinking.

951
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,594
What?

952
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:19,869
I've been thinking that the terms
of my proposed contract...

953
01:36:19,869 --> 01:36:22,238
could be amended to cover this.

954
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,907
Don't you start all that again.
I've had nothing else for the last six months.

955
01:36:26,907 --> 01:36:29,142
Just contracts!

956
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,344
They're still going to take the baby away.

957
01:36:34,344 --> 01:36:36,889
- No, not necessarily...
- Stop the car.

958
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:43,093
I don't care about you.

959
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:02,307
Well, say it properly then.

960
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:35,844
Oh, my God! Mother!
