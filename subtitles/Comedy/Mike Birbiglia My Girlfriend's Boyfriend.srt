1
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,015
Move! Let's go, let's go!

2
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,214
We did it, right?

3
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,931
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

4
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,849
G-Girl!
It's G-Girl!

5
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,177
Gun!

6
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,378
G-Girl! G-Girl!
G-Girl! G-Girl!

7
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,089
Wow. If you could have any
superpower, what would it be?

8
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,058
The ability to blow myself.

9
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,898
That's quite a visual.

10
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,733
But wouldn't it seem a little... Gay?

11
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,211
No, not at all. Think about it.
Yeah, really? It seems that way.

12
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,450
Oh, dude. Check her out.

13
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,053
Ooh. Wow.

14
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,019
What do we have here? Kind of
uptight librarian on the outside,

15
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,216
Ready to rumble on the inside.

16
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,019
Go ask her out. No. I'm
not ready yet. I can't.

17
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,056
Oh, Matt. You're killing me.

18
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,099
Your last insane girlfriend
dumped you, like, six months ago.

19
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,138
I would have ploughed my way
through half of SoHo by now.

20
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,893
That's cos you're soulless and shallow.

21
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,891
It is a blessing.

22
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,574
Go over there. Talk to her. Do it.

23
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,936
Matt, say hi. Give me
your bag. Come on. OK, OK.

24
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,931
Yes.

25
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,534
All out. Be strong. Breathe.

26
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,571
Eye of the tiger.

27
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,653
Hi.

28
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,734
Excuse me. I know I don't really know you,
but you look like a very interesting person,

29
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,380
So at the risk of totally
humiliating myself,

30
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,258
I thought perhaps sometime
I might buy you a cup...

31
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,331
No!

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,372
It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It
could be whatever you want. A cup of anything.

33
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,690
Juice? Hey!

34
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,251
Hey!

35
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,611
Hey!

36
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,129
Hey!

37
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,575
Somebody stop that guy!

38
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,012
That's right. You better run, asshole!

39
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,299
Keep running, my man! You don't
want any of this. Keep running.

40
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,650
Yeah!

41
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,250
What did you call me? Oh, shit!

42
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,331
What did you call me?

43
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,771
Idiot.

44
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,574
Come on! Get out of there.

45
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,892
Let's go! I know you're
in there. Get out of there!

46
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,531
Whoa!

47
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,811
Hey. How about it, huh?

48
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,774
So how about that cup of coffee? Or
it could be something more substantial.

49
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,977
Like dinner? Yeah. That'd be great.

50
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,971
Matt Saunders. Jenny Johnson.

51
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,372
Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name. You
got the whole alliteration thing going.

52
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,974
I grew up with a guy named
Francis Freddie Friedman.

53
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,736
A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd
want over if you had spare cash laying out.

54
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,458
Yeah, right. Right.

55
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,259
So, um... May I get your number?

56
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,970
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't give it out.
Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though.

57
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,494
OK. Actually, I don't
think I have a pen. I do.

58
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,970
Thanks. Isn't this something
women do just to blow off losers?

59
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,210
Yes, women do do that.

60
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,292
But that's not how I blow off losers.

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,490
Hey, Saunders, heads up.

62
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,339
Oh, you have bad reflexes. You know,
you're a danger in the workplace.

63
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,696
Do you have the bathroom layouts
for the Beijing presentation?

64
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,331
I'll take a look at those. I
finished them up last night.

65
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,249
Hey, Hannah. Hey, Vaughn.

66
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,052
Looks good. Thank you.

67
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,256
What about... Is this OK?

68
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,616
It's a bit tight, but I talked
to the structural engineer...

69
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,090
How's your boyfriend? Isn't
his name Rick? Steve. He's good.

70
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,694
He just got back from
Milan. Look at this.

71
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,898
Milan? Yes, his new
Joe Boxer ad campaign.

72
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,529
Wow. He's buff. Are you into that?

73
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,738
I would think this is more
your style. What do you think?

74
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,894
Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and
the right steroids, I look like that or better.

75
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,010
Here you go. Thank you.

76
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,730
What are you doing?! Huh?

77
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,416
Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving some
reference material, trying to stay ahead.

78
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,776
You were staring at her butt. He was?

79
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,772
No. No, I was not. Yes, he was.

80
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,773
Hannah, as you know, we have a
zero-Tolerance policy for this behaviour.

81
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,977
I actually read that
memo twice. I got it.

82
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,130
You should be familiar with this part.

83
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,734
Would you like to file
a grievance at this time?

84
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,699
Um... I don't think so, Carla.

85
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,376
Because, as your supervisor, I am officially
giving you that opportunity right now.

86
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,454
And I thank you for that, but I think
I'm just gonna let this one slide.

87
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,054
That's completely your decision.

88
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,611
Will you sign a statement
to that effect? Sure. Yes.

89
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,418
You are lucky this time,
Mr Bottom Watcher. -

90
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,334
Hello? Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson.

91
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,732
Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear
from you. So are we still on for dinner?

92
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,813
Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great.
Is that a girl? A real, live girl?

93
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,813
A great new Indian place on Madison
just opened up. Eight o'clock?

94
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,778
Indian? Love it. I'll
see you tomorrow night.

95
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,816
OK. Great. See you. Bye.

96
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,208
Saunders! Do you have a date?

97
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,098
Got a date. And it's a hot one.

98
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,490
So the assistant curatorjob's
really perfect for me.

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,972
I was an art history major in college.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

100
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,611
At least, the only thing I'm
good at I can make any money off.

101
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,818
That sounded like I was talking
about sex. No. No, it didn't.

102
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,095
Believe me, I didn't mean sex.

103
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,252
I mean, I am good at
sex. I'm sure you are.

104
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,570
Now it sounds like I'm bragging. No, no.

105
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,734
I think I'm good at sex.
I don't know, you decide.

106
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,252
Me?

107
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,059
But not tonight. It's our first date.

108
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,971
Yeah.

109
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,295
So what do you do?

110
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,816
I'm a project manager at a design firm.

111
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,576
We design and build private estates,
libraries, hotels, that sort of thing.

112
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,336
Yeah, right now, we're... -

113
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,415
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? What?

114
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,968
No. No. Um...

115
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,170
I was just trying to
listen to something.

116
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,695
I don't hear anything.

117
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,499
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I
have to go to the bathroom.

118
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,571
Sure.

119
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,455
Yo, how's it going? Well,
she's a talker, yeah.

120
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,738
<i>Only question is, will you sleep with
her? That's the only question, huh?</i>

121
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,211
Yes. I'm notjust talking about your date
tonight. I am talking about life in general.

122
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,771
That is the only question.
What's going on there?

123
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,251
Uh, some big fire at 73rd and
Broadway. Everything's burning.

124
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,535
<i>Is anyone hurt? I don't know. Probably.</i>

125
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,656
It's blocking my way to the gym.

126
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,413
My thoughts are with you
in this time of crisis.

127
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,454
Wow! Oh, man!

128
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,617
<i>What's going on? It's
G-Girl! She's doing her thing.</i>

129
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,089
Are you serious? You lucky SOB.
I've never even seen her in person.

130
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,171
How does she look?

131
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,251
She looks...

132
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,974
<i>What? Blurry. But still pretty hot.</i>

133
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,972
<i>Yeah? What's she doing now?</i>

134
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,259
She's spinning around like
one of those things that spins.

135
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,093
<i>Amazing. That's unbelievable.</i>

136
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,171
Yeah. It's so cool.

137
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,450
Oh!

138
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,772
Yes. That's it, show's over.
She put the fire out. Fantastic.

139
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,809
G-Girl! G-Girl!
GGirl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

140
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,970
Oh! OK.

141
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,769
And she's gone. Flew off
into the sunset. Amazing.

142
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,535
<i>Unbelievable. Hey, why do you
think they call her G-Girl?</i>

143
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,740
I don't know, like, "gorgeous"
or "G-Force"? I'm not really sure.

144
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,050
<i>What do you think about "good kisser"?</i>

145
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,859
I can't believe I missed
that. I'm eating Indian food.

146
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,693
<i>Oh, wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".</i>

147
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,658
<i>What about "G-Spot"? I gotta go. Bye.</i>

148
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,611
Whoo!

149
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,455
Huge line. Sorry. It was
a really, really long line.

150
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,897
You got a little something
on your chin. What? Oh. Oh.

151
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,098
I hate when that happens.
When what happens?

152
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,171
Mystery smudges.

153
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,856
Gotta go to the bathroom. Um...
You didn'tjust go to the bathroom?

154
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,659
Are you keeping track?
That's kind of creepy.

155
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,768
She sounds like a nutcase. So
you're saying she's perfect for me?

156
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,055
Crazy women are attracted to you.

157
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,132
It's like you give off a scent.

158
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,211
You should do a background check on her.

159
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,815
What do you think? Shall we keep
these walls brick or make it stucco?

160
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,972
Did you kick the plug? I don't know.

161
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,974
Let me handle this one. All right.

162
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,858
Don't do that. Don't do what?
What are you talking about?

163
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,453
You mean this?

164
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,814
Hey!

165
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,610
Sexual harassment's a two-Way street. Don't
think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me.

166
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,373
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

167
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,769
Oh, no. Sorry, her... Steve.

168
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,533
Her computer had gone down.
I was plugging it back in.

169
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,613
I'm screwing with you. I'm
not worried. Oh. None taken.

170
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,658
I missed you. I missed you too.

171
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,015
Not here! Sorry.

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,338
See, Saunders? You need to be with someone
who appreciates you, like Steve here.

173
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,777
Yeah. I'm looking for Mr Right. Haven't
found him yet, though. Not given up.

174
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,129
Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you. This is
Matt. You've met him, like, five times.

175
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,657
Oh, right, right. Sorry. It's
OK. I'm a very forgettable person.

176
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,574
When I was growing up, I'd come down
to breakfast and Mom would scream,

177
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,696
Call the cops on me.

178
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,613
It's ajoke, right? Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,012
It's a good one. Got me back. Hey,
baby, we should be going to lunch.

180
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,049
Hey, Saunders, that woman
is trouble. Do not call her.

181
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,459
OK, we're done. What
happened? We just started.

182
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,974
That's it. No. I got a twinge.

183
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,369
Dude, you should
definitely call her back.

184
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,532
Yeah? You think I should? Oh, yeah.

185
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,810
Cos she's good to go.

186
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,131
And you haven't gone in six months.

187
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,739
Oh, yes. Plus, what's the downside?

188
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,453
I don't know. She seems a little, uh...
She's neurotic, you know. And distant.

189
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,772
That's good. That's a good thing.
Neurotic and distant is a very good thing.

190
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,170
Yeah, neurotic women
are hellcats in bed.

191
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,131
Plus, if she's distant, you're
both in it for the same thing.

192
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,415
Coitus maximus.

193
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,738
There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling
hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way.

194
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,414
It' s just pure carnal nirvana.

195
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,539
Your argument's repugnant and
intriguing. That's kind of my thing.

196
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,811
Oh, hey. Hi. Oh, wow. Thank you.

197
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,618
You're welcome. A rose.

198
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,294
Different colour roses
mean different things.

199
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,373
Red ones mean passion or
love, so this is great.

200
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,577
But I'm not saying I think you're
telling me that you love me.

201
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,855
I mean, it's absurdly early for that.

202
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,659
But you never know. Maybe someday.

203
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,459
Or never. No pressure.

204
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,049
Let me get us a cab. Taxi.

205
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,051
Taxi!

206
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,651
Hey, it's stopping.

207
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,128
Here we go.

208
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,290
You OK?

209
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,019
At least we got a ride.

210
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,614
Can we stop by the gallery?
We opened a new show.

211
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,249
Sounds great. Hey, thanks
for stopping. Appreciate it.

212
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,091
Wow.

213
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,488
Wonder what she's looking at.

214
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,849
Ouch! That's gotta hurt.

215
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,011
So what do you think?

216
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,013
It's interesting. And
a little disturbing.

217
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,817
I know. It's surprising how
frightening things attract us.

218
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,896
Matt, I have to help people every day,
and nobody's ever helped me except you.

219
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,251
You're my hero.

220
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,416
I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me.

221
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,175
It's your tongue. You're
using it all wrong.

222
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,693
What are you talking about? You
shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish.

223
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,578
You're supposed to flick it a little.

224
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,857
I think that I was flicking
it, wasn't I? I was doing that.

225
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,454
No. Not enough. Really?

226
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,816
I'm not used to having my tongue
skills critiqued like this, OK?

227
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,095
Maybe not to your face.

228
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,811
Oh, man.

229
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,731
Let me help you.

230
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,774
Close your eyes.

231
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,331
Now do what I do.

232
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,775
So, uh... this is my place. I
redesigned the space when I bought it.

233
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,578
It's nice. Thank you.

234
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,413
This is the dining room.
Doesn't get a lot of use.

235
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,060
Well, I could help with that. OK.

236
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,371
This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls.

237
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,530
Hi, Biggie.

238
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,010
He's... he's never met a woman before.

239
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,653
Well, he's about to get en eyeful.

240
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,817
<i>Will you show me the
rest of your place? OK.</i>

241
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,460
<i>I'll take you over to the kitchen.</i>

242
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,297
<i>That's the refrigerator. I
can get you a juice, a beer.</i>

243
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,894
<i>I'll make you anything. Yeah.</i>

244
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,531
I'm not thirsty either.

245
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,176
And this is the, uh... Bed.

246
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,575
Oh, that's a great sweater. Wow.

247
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,938
What a blouse. Let me
help with those buttons.

248
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,090
I'm sorry. I need the, um... Oh,
yeah. The bathroom? It's right there.

249
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,615
She goes to the bathroom a lot.

250
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,489
I'm ready.

251
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,334
That's what I call structural integrity.

252
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,652
All right! You should have been
dressed like that all night.

253
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,890
You look great.

254
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,608
Let me help you with this. -

255
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,691
Ooh.

256
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,652
I must be a little nervous. It's OK.

257
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,732
I got a closet full of 'em.
Let me handle this one, though.

258
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,095
Let's take care of these. OK.

259
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,811
Thanks.

260
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,099
Who'd have thought we'd have ended up
like this after that day on the subway?

261
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,535
Ain't life grand?

262
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,931
Matt? Yeah?

263
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,129
Do you mind if I get on top?

264
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,973
Trust me, it's better that way.

265
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,051
10-4.

266
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,178
Are you ready?

267
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,013
OK. OK.

268
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,295
Here we go. -

269
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,491
Wow.

270
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,449
OK, I get it.

271
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

272
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,371
Whoo! Whoo!

273
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,291
Oh, goddamn!

274
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,570
OK, now I need a break.

275
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,531
Agh!

276
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,332
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

277
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,129
A bed or a penis? Both.

278
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,094
There are three moments I will
remember until the day I die.

279
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,334
One, the look on my father's face when
I graduated from Harvard Law School.

280
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,414
Two, helping a beached
mother whale give birth.

281
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,060
And three,

282
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,178
You and me together, here, tonight.

283
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,898
Don't speak to me again, ever.

284
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,491
Uh-Oh. Oh, no.

285
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,616
Water, please. Got a big night.

286
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,338
No, no, no.

287
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,891
Don't tell me. You have invaded the
female nation and spread your democracy.

288
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,336
What can I say? She's completely
different than I thought she was.

289
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,412
Hot, though, right? Unbelievably hot.

290
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,493
I don't even know if I should tell you
this. I don't know if you can handle it.

291
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,299
I can handle it. Please?

292
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,850
She broke my bed. Wow.

293
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,135
Busted it to pieces.

294
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,257
And that's a good thing, right?
Yeah. That's a good thing.

295
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,616
I'm gonna see her again today.
What are you talking about?

296
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,214
No! You have sex with her
once and then you move on.

297
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,771
Not if you get on the greatest ever roller
coaster, you don't. You get back in that line.

298
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,853
Get in line, ride two or three more times,
throw your hands in the air and scream.

299
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,010
But soon you're gonna end up nauseous.

300
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,011
Hey, guys.

301
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,139
How are you guys doing? Keep
that safety bar clamped down.

302
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,338
OK, I think you are gonna like this. I
have a little present for you, Saunders.

303
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,969
Anything for me there? No. No, Vaughn.

304
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,891
You have nice ears. Thank you.

305
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,653
No lobes, though. An
imperfection. We all got 'em.

306
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,576
Not me. Hey, so I downloaded some Chinese
phrases for you, for the presentation.

307
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,572
What do you think? Thought
it might help. That's great.

308
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,572
I thought it would help.
You're the best, you know that?

309
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,093
I know. I am.

310
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,853
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm going to see Jenny.

311
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,738
You're seeing Jenny? Again? Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,779
Oh. Things must really be
going well. She broke his bed.

313
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,499
Thanks. That was really
thoughtful of you.

314
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,299
Oh, no problem. I'll see you two later.

315
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,336
See you, Matt. Look after her, OK?

316
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,251
I will.

317
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,697
Man, he's seeing Jenny
again? Just a few more times.

318
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,977
Matt Saunders? We're gonna take
a ride. Wait a second! Hey! Wait!

319
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,536
Hey, now, look. I don't
appreciate being manhandled...

320
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,815
What's going on?

321
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,655
Mr Saunders, thank you for
your time. OK. Now, who are you?

322
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,892
Who am I? Do you watch television,
Mr Saunders? Read the papers?

323
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,177
Use the net for anything other
than porn? You're that Bedlam guy.

324
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,093
Professor Bedlam. The "supervillain".

325
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,173
Please, I am not super, I am not a villain.
I'm just a regular man, like yourself,

326
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,538
With 10,000 times more
money, intelligence and taste.

327
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,332
OK, so what do you want from me?

328
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,218
Are you seeing anyone, Mr Saunders?

329
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,012
Are you asking me out? Ow!

330
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,333
I want you to tell me everything
you know about your new girlfriend.

331
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,617
Jenny? Yes. Jenny.

332
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,373
Where does she like to go?
What does she like to do?

333
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,338
What music does she listen
to? Is she afraid of bugs?

334
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,650
Is she a dog person or a cat person?

335
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,176
Does she wear panties... OK, now,
look. Hold on just a goddamn...

336
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,617
Now, look. It's gotta stop
with the slapping, all right?!

337
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:40,538
I just don't feel real comfortable telling
you, a total stranger, someone's private habits.

338
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,214
You gotta understand that, right?

339
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,052
Of course.

340
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,658
Please, someone! Help! Help!

341
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,219
Save me! Please!

342
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,371
Weasel!

343
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,737
Hey! Help! Yeah, you! You!

344
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,015
Get somebody from the Park Service!

345
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,977
Oh, jeez!

346
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,938
No! Help me! Oh, no!

347
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,216
Oh, my God!

348
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,370
G-Girl! G-Girl, you saved me.
Thank you! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,928
Whoa! Hold me! Hold
me! Don't look at me!

350
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,136
But I just wanted
to... Don't look at me!

351
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,814
OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger.

352
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,136
Wow.

353
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,572
Looks like little Jenny's been
cashing in on her superpowers.

354
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,448
Idiot! We don't want her
to know we dropped by.

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,731
Ah.

356
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,377
Perfect.

357
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,412
So I'm falling, I mean,
hurdling through the sky.

358
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,492
And just as I'm about to bite
it, and I mean out of nowhere,

359
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,936
She just catches me and
sets me right on the ground.

360
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,739
It was unbelievable. The
weird thing is, though,

361
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,414
That Bedlam guy, he
kept asking me about you.

362
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,060
Do you know him? No,
how could I know him?

363
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,893
That's what I was thinking.
So what was she like?

364
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,208
GGirl?

365
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,729
I didn't really get a good look
at her, but to tell you the truth,

366
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,971
She wasn't really what I
expected, you know. In what way?

367
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,097
I don't know. She just
seemed a little... Brainy?

368
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,138
Not really. Exotic? Effervescent?

369
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,654
No, I kind of got this
vibe she was a little nuts.

370
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,369
Nuts?! Maybe she was a
little bit preoccupied,

371
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,815
Having searched the
entire city to save you

372
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,939
From being squished like
a bug on a windshield!

373
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,137
You giris all really
stick together, don't you?

374
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,609
I like it. You're like one big gang.

375
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,894
Rule number one about crossing
the street? Look both ways.

376
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,733
That's right. -

377
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,856
Jenny!

378
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,450
One of you call 911! I'm
fine. I'm fine. That was close.

379
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,178
I'm fine, I'm fine.

380
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,219
You're not fine. How can you
be fine? Look, Matt, I can walk.

381
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,815
Don't move. You probably have
internal bleeding and don't know it.

382
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,095
No, not even a scratch.
You are in shock.

383
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,458
Did anyone see this? It's like a
miracle. Truly, it's like a miracle.

384
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,256
I mean, are you sure that you're OK?
I mean, you seem to be walking fine.

385
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,217
Yeah.

386
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,376
This is the first time that
I've ever brought anybody here.

387
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,496
Ever. Really? Wow.

388
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,654
Yeah, it seems like
a really great place.

389
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,369
I'm still just kind of wondering
what the hell happened out there.

390
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,291
I know.

391
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,090
I didn't expect to do this.
At least, not yet anyway.

392
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,173
But it's good. It's good. OK.

393
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,173
Cos what we have is
so very, very special.

394
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,291
I trust you. OK.

395
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,213
There should be nothing
hanging between us.

396
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,212
Especially not this, don't you think?

397
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,217
I don't know what you're talking about.

398
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,337
I'll have to show you.

399
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,728
You look nice without your glasses.
You look good with them too.

400
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,090
I'll hold them for you.

401
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,416
OK...

402
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,493
I don't know what the explanation
is, but I like it already.

403
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:30,416
<i>Unless it's one of those Crying Game things?
It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver.</i>

404
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,855
Just wait.

405
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,092
You got a G-Girl costume on. That's...

406
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,853
Kind of went all out, didn't you?

407
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,290
And you even dyed your...

408
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,095
Oh.

409
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,171
Wow!

410
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,171
Are you kidding me?

411
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,858
Oh, man. This is incredible.

412
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,932
But you can't tell anyone!
Yeah, nobody except Vaughn.

413
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,490
He slept with a Victoria's Secret
model, I've never heard the end of it.

414
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,140
This will blow that out
of the water. No! Nobody.

415
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,337
Matt, you have to promise me
you'll never, ever tell anyone.

416
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,255
<i>Fine, you got it. No matter
what, you will never tell anyone.</i>

417
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,376
Hey, I swear.

418
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,499
Say you'd rather have a chain
saw shoved up your ass than tell.

419
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,810
Is that actually a possibility? Say it!

420
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,813
I'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up my ass than tell.

421
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,458
OK.

422
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,816
So this Bedlam guy, he's like
your arch nemesis or something?

423
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,496
Uh-Huh. He's been a pain in the butt ever
since we had this falling out in high school.

424
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,810
You guys went to
school together? Mm-Hm.

425
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,299
Wow.

426
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,213
By the way, his name's
not really Bedlam.

427
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,896
It's Barry. Barry Edward
Lambert. Bedlam, get it?

428
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,859
<i>Back then, we were both kind of
outcasts. Everybody else hated us.</i>

429
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,818
Nerd alert! Here come the geeks.

430
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,495
<i>So we looked out for each other.</i>

431
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,051
<i>It's only natural that we
spent a lot of time together.</i>

432
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,130
<i>We really liked each other.</i>

433
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,730
<i>It was close to the
end of our junior year</i>

434
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,495
<i>When I decided it was about time to
get the virginity thing over with.</i>

435
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,219
<i>I mean, Barry was harmless enough.</i>

436
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,217
<i>I figured it might
as well be him, right?</i>

437
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,337
<i>He was having some trouble
getting his pants off.</i>

438
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,809
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

439
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,533
Jenny!

440
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,249
Come on!

441
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,653
This is not how I planned this evening.

442
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,970
Oh, my God. Look at that.

443
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,728
It's so cool.

444
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,132
What are you doing? Isn't it amazing?

445
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,256
Don't. It could be dangerous.

446
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,419
<i>When I got back to
school, even with a wig,</i>

447
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,492
<i>People noticed there was
something different about me.</i>

448
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,014
Hi, giris. Ooh, my glasses.

449
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,489
<i>And it worked for me.</i>

450
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,656
Hey.

451
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,219
Ugh!

452
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,453
<i>Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.</i>

453
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,735
<i>He stopped talking to me.</i>

454
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,209
<i>And then ignored me totally.</i>

455
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,496
Anyway, things got worse
between us after I graduated.

456
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,775
I committed to being
a full-Time superhero

457
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,773
And he fell into the evil mastermind
business, yada-Yada-Yada. That's my story.

458
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,179
Wow.

459
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,775
And this whole time, I
just had this weird feeling

460
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,376
That there was just something
a little off about you.

461
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,976
Really? You just had
a secret, that's all.

462
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,894
A supersecret. Now we both do.

463
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,177
May I ask you something? What?

464
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,059
I just think it could
maybe be a fun thing to try.

465
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,654
It's kind of a request.

466
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,291
Sure.

467
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,694
Be right back. OK.

468
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,089
Is this what you had in mind?

469
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,377
Oh, yeah. That's it.

470
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,016
Matt Saunders, you've
been a very, very evil boy.

471
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,339
I think you need to
be brought to justice.

472
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,971
Yeah. I have been known to
bend a rule here and there.

473
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,054
Total unrelenting justice.

474
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,413
Hey! Wow! Shit!

475
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,859
Don't let go, all right? Oh, no.

476
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,693
Oh, yeah, you got me.

477
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,771
Scared you.

478
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,179
Wow.

479
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,694
Wow, we are high.

480
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,692
We are really, really high. Oh, yeah!

481
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,979
Jenny, you know, as fun as this is, I'm
feeling just a little bit emasculated here,

482
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,099
With you kind of carrying me around
like a toy poodle. But don't let go.

483
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,219
Careful. Where are you going?
Careful. Come on. Fly right.

484
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,291
Be careful.

485
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,974
I've always wanted
to try this. Try what?

486
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,657
That? Wow. I'm not sure
that's gonna work up here.

487
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,731
It's draughty too.

488
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,928
What if I do this?

489
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,651
You're not wearing any underwear. Yeah.
I thought it might be easier that way.

490
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,896
Isn't this fun? It is fun. Yeah.

491
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,290
Puts a whole new twist
on the mile-High club.

492
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,336
Ready?

493
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,615
Whoa. Not ready!

494
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,935
No! Just go with it.

495
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,739
Yeah, but... I know,
I know! Don't stop! Yes.

496
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,889
No! Yes!

497
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,971
Oh, god, no! Yeah!

498
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,171
Jenny!

499
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,933
Yes!

500
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,253
Yes!

501
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,094
Don't ever do that again!

502
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,170
GGirl's hair before.

503
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,974
Watch and learn.

504
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,139
Her body is made of the
toughest substance known to man.

505
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,771
But I know your secret.

506
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,577
All right, now. G-Girl's hair after.

507
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,616
Yes! Yes!

508
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,932
Saunders, what's wrong? I
got a splinter in my finger.

509
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,376
Let me see. It's no big deal.
I can get it out, I just need...

510
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,099
Come here. I'm good at
this. What are you gonna do?

511
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,171
Hold on.

512
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,735
Hey, how did you do that?

513
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,811
Well, I have my ways.

514
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,135
Thanks. You're welcome.

515
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,857
Jenny, what...

516
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,090
What are you doing in New Jersey?

517
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,933
I called your office and
found out where you were.

518
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,614
I thought I would surprise you.

519
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,018
Are you surprised? I am
surprised. I wanted to...

520
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,217
Thanks. Good to see you. Let me
introduce you to Hannah Lewis.

521
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,849
This is Jenny Johnson. Hi. It's
really nice to finally meet you.

522
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,408
Saunders talks about
you all the time. I do.

523
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,855
I feel like I already know you. Really?

524
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,773
Cos I feel like I'm
just getting to know you.

525
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,057
OK. Hey, um... Got an idea.

526
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,053
Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was
thinking, maybe we go out this weekend,

527
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,372
Just the two couples, two happy
couples, hit the town? What do you say?

528
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,098
Great. Great.

529
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,249
Great.

530
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,811
Oh, OK.

531
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,011
Bye.

532
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,532
I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news.

533
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,296
You got a little something
right there. Oh, thank you.

534
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,656
Steve can't make it. He had
an emergency thong shoot.

535
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,857
A thong shoot emergency?
Yeah, well, you know,

536
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,896
One bad wedgie can be fatal.

537
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,299
Yeah.

538
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,013
Where's our stupid waiter? Sir!

539
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,931
Hold on. Something's going on.

540
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,614
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed
an errant test missile</i>

541
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,772
<i>Is in fact on a direct
course for the tristate area.</i>

542
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,058
<i>So far, all attempts to detonate or
intercept the missile have been unsuccessful.</i>

543
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,858
Great. Perfect.

544
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,253
<i>If it strikes within the city, the death
toll could reach into the thousands.</i>

545
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,013
That does not sound good.
Yeah, it sounds serious.

546
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,217
Maybe somebody should do something.

547
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,339
Mm-Hm, yeah, like the air
force. It's theirjob, right?

548
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,379
So, Hannah, how long have you
and Matty known each other?

549
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:54,011
Well, we started working together
at Cockrum about three years ago.

550
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,854
<i>We're getting reports of sporadic
looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.</i>

551
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,899
<i>The government has urged people not
to panic and to stay in their homes.</i>

552
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,860
Mmm, gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good.
Anyone want to share a gnocchi?

553
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,898
I'm sorry, but what if the
air force can't stop it?

554
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,052
Somebody else might need to step in.

555
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,052
Maybe somebody deserves one night out

556
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,779
Without having to deal with
some impending disaster.

557
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,930
I think someone has
earned it. Don't you?

558
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,575
Are you on a diet? What
are you gonna order?

559
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,972
I don't know. I mean, shouldn't
we be leaving? Is this safe here?

560
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,496
Sir! Can we get some service here?
I mean, I'm filling up on baguette.

561
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,652
I think everybody's preoccupied
with what's happening.

562
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,618
Maybe if someone could just
take care of the problem,

563
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,295
Everyone can have a better night,
a smoother night, know what I mean?

564
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,531
You'd like that, wouldn't
you? Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

565
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,657
In fact, I'd superappreciate it.

566
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,811
All right. Fine!

567
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,331
Is she OK? Where is she going?

568
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,730
She's fine. She gets stressed. I
have her looping around the block.

569
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:23,019
<i>Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation
is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.</i>

570
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:29,209
<i>But all the citizens of New York can
do is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.</i>

571
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:35,375
<i>We're now getting a live picture of
the missile as it approaches the city.</i>

572
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,936
<i>It appears certain
that... Wait, what is that?</i>

573
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,139
<i>It is G-Girl!</i>

574
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,696
<i>She is approaching the errant
missile.  Love that girl!</i>

575
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,379
<i>My God!</i>

576
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,849
<i>She just kicked it.</i>

577
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,138
<i>She just deflected the
missile away from the city.</i>

578
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,415
<i>We're safe! We are safe!</i>

579
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,698
G-Girl!
G-Girl! G-Girl!

580
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,850
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

581
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,819
Sorry, what are you talking about?

582
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,290
You and that slut from
your office Hannah.

583
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,658
She is not a slut. That is a
terrible thing to say, Jenny.

584
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,176
You want to screw her,
don't you? No. No, I do not.

585
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,012
I don't believe you.

586
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,091
Can I say something?

587
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,138
Her boyfriend's a male
model, OK? A model.

588
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,018
I don't think she'd be very
interested in a guy like me.

589
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,818
I see your point.

590
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,337
So you want to screw her, you just
can't, because she's got a boyfriend.

591
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,732
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

592
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,573
Don't lie to me!

593
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,696
What the hell did you do that for?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

594
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,738
I'll pay for that, I swear.

595
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,970
OK, don't... d-Don't do that.

596
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,893
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

597
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,330
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

598
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,411
It's just...

599
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,529
I love you so much.

600
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,535
OK... OK...

601
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,056
Hey. Hey. How's it going?

602
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,931
Oh, sorry.

603
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,854
Look at her. She's like a
cheerleader from Spank Me University.

604
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,614
Dude, what's wrong? You look like shit.

605
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,534
Let's go with the lighter
weight today, shall we?

606
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,171
I'm actually thinking that my first
impression of Jenny was accurate.

607
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,776
Oh, no. Yeah, complete
emotional basket case.

608
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,214
Needy, jealous... Mm-Hm. Jealous.

609
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,372
...control... Controlling.
A trifecta. Perfect.

610
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,258
The truth is, I don't even love her.

611
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,134
I'm in love with somebody else.

612
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,370
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

613
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,769
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

614
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,533
I feel the same way. I totally...

615
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,253
That's not a good sign, is it?

616
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,935
Who are you talking about? I don't
wanna say. Not until I've told her.

617
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,580
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

618
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,130
God knows how I'm gonna do
that. OK, come with me. Listen.

619
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,179
There are only two ways to
successfully break it off with a woman.

620
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,820
You can either be ajerk or a weenie.

621
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,293
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

622
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,213
Just like that. It's quick,
it's easy, it's painless.

623
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,213
I don't think you have the balls for
it. Well, what's the weenie route?

624
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,292
OK, good. Weenie route.
Let's go with that.

625
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,690
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

626
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,252
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

627
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,729
You say, "Sweetheart,

628
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:54,178
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-Evaluate things."

629
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,728
Don't return any of her
calls for a year and a half.

630
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,892
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

631
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,130
I can't believe I
actually listen to you.

632
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,496
Another thing. Make sure you do
it after you've had sex with her.

633
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,219
It's really difficult
the other way around.

634
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,691
I was thinking, maybe we
should take a little time to...

635
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,374
Re-Examine where this is going.

636
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,691
My God.

637
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,374
Are you breaking up with me?

638
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,378
No. No. Not at all.

639
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:48,977
I mean, I just... I think it would be
wise to try and evaluate where we stand,

640
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,819
Just to make sure
we're on the same page.

641
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:00,138
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

642
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,609
No. No.

643
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,168
No, I'm not saying that. -

644
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,775
OK, good. You scared
me there for a second.

645
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:15,732
Although seeing other people might eventually
be a part of the evaluation process.

646
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,691
Oh, my God.

647
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,772
You are breaking up with me.

648
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,694
Jenny, it's not you, OK? Shut up!

649
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,654
I know exactly what it is. It's
that slut from your office, Hannah.

650
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,129
You're sleeping with
her. I am not sleep...

651
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,849
But you want to! Jenny,
now, hold on a second, OK?

652
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,500
You're such a liar!

653
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,893
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

654
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,529
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it any more.

655
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,612
It's crazy. Don't call me crazy!

656
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,249
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

657
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,410
Well, handle this.

658
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,618
What are you doing?!

659
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,172
You are so gonna regret this.

660
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,491
Oh, man.

661
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,577
Wednesday? Thursday? No. No.

662
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,777
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

663
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,851
Don't speak to me.

664
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,094
Oh, well. Look at it this way.

665
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,410
The hard part is over.

666
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,695
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

667
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,655
Don't worry about that.
They always say that.

668
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,492
Yeah?

669
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,571
I guess you're right.

670
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:12,171
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

671
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,933
Found out what? I just
need you to promise me...

672
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,932
I promise. Hold on, let
me finish, this is serious.

673
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:24,016
I need you to promise me that you're not...
I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

674
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,528
You know Jenny?

675
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,611
Yeah.

676
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,331
She's G-Girl.

677
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,371
Bullshit.

678
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,249
Bullshit.

679
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,377
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

680
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,452
Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl!

681
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,179
I know! It's unbelievable.
Me. Incredible.

682
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,978
I can't believe it. Knuckles.

683
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,972
Imagine the heat I'll have with
the women when they find out.

684
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,939
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

685
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,853
I warned you, Matt Saunders!

686
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,292
No!

687
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,729
Watch it, dumb-Ass!

688
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,812
What's wrong? Nothing.

689
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,937
What could be wrong?
Everything's great. Never better.

690
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,976
Tell me.

691
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,978
OK. I, uh... I broke up with Jenny.

692
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,611
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-Her-Rocker crazy.

693
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,851
I should have listened
to you from the beginning.

694
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,932
Why don't you lay off the
crazy women for a while, huh?

695
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,614
Come here. I'm sorry.

696
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,691
Hey, Hannah.

697
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,215
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

698
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,291
Yes?

699
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,257
It's about you and...

700
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,811
Sorry. Are you OK? Out. Now.

701
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,016
I'm going through a weird phase.

702
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,455
I saw that! What? No,
it was nothing, Carla.

703
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,054
Nothing? You knocked
her down! You hit her!

704
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,213
Was there groping? Did he grope
you? No, it was an accident.

705
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,291
An accident? OK, like a fender-Bender?

706
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,053
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

707
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,657
Listen, my friend. You are
headed for some serious trouble.

708
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,698
Don't make excuses. That's
the first mistake. OK.

709
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,012
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

710
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,537
I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
What? What did you just call me?!

711
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,814
What? I don't know.

712
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,496
If the company doesn't get this
project, we're going to take a major hit.

713
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,492
You really have a
problem. Call my therapist.

714
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,377
OK, I'll call him... her.

715
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,178
Matt. What?

716
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,649
Phone call. Oh, man.

717
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,817
That boy has a major
case of the hornies.

718
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,739
Yeah?

719
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,176
There's the young kid that zooms
around in here. Did he do something?

720
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,935
It's just up here. Looks like
they broke in, fried the camera

721
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,215
And then blew a huge
hole through the wall.

722
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,531
I've never seen nothing
like it. Don't make no sense.

723
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,418
We got a lot of nice cars
His is the only one they took.

724
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,138
Bitch.

725
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,931
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

726
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,329
No. No, I don't.

727
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,413
Somebody with a grudge against
you? Grudge? Against me?

728
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,254
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

729
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,535
We'll let you know if it turns up. OK.

730
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,374
Let's get to the paperwork. I
wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

731
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,776
Gentlemen...

732
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,136
If you look closely, our model here...

733
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,211
What the hell...?

734
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,810
Oh, that's just great.

735
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,858
Oh, shit! I just got that fixed.

736
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:36,412
Sorry, just came to use your
telescope. Nice and dark, isn't it?

737
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,219
Wait a second. Is this
all because of you?

738
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,010
Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes.

739
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,330
There we go.

740
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,854
Come and have a look-See.

741
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,695
I don't see any...

742
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,775
That's real mature. Save
you a fortune in parking.

743
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,933
Why are you doing this to me? I mean,
you're supposed to be the good guy.

744
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,854
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

745
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,649
It's been a pleasure seeing you, but
I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

746
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,574
I've got an important presentation
to make, so I need to get some sleep.

747
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,654
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

748
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,574
But you wanna know something?
You're the craziest, hands down!

749
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,855
Really? Aargh!

750
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,410
Dick?!

751
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,938
Will we begin soon?

752
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,535
I'm so sorry you've been kept
waiting. I apologise. It's very rude.

753
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,817
Just a few more minutes, please.

754
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,210
Hi. Excuse me, hi.
Glad you could join us.

755
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,894
Can you tell me why
you're wearing a hat?

756
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,336
No. Why am I not surprised?

757
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,969
Hi. How are you? We can finally begin.

758
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,528
Gentlemen, I give you
Matt Saunders. You OK?

759
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,054
I'm fine. I'm fine.

760
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,734
OK, gentlemen...

761
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,012
OK. Our design integrates
classic architectural ideas

762
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,056
From the history of Chinese culture

763
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,691
And transforms them into a
contemporary 21st century aesthetic.

764
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,773
But you can see clearly that
functionality has not been sac...

765
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,370
Sac...

766
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:57,133
Sacrificed, as you can see here by
the multiple entrances to the central

767
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,734
Multipurpose courtyard area.

768
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,129
Exactly. Exactly. Right.

769
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,859
And with a total capacity for...

770
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,010
You are one sick bastard!

771
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,254
Oh, man. I am so, so sorry.

772
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,331
Thanks. -

773
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,297
You gotta laugh to keep from
crying, right? Vaughn, shh!

774
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,779
Sorry.

775
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,455
<i>Man, no woman's ever done that
to me, and I actually am a dick.</i>

776
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,614
OK, all done. I am so
sorry that you got fired.

777
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,009
What happened in there? Why did you...

778
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:57,013
It's hard to explain. Let's just
say it's a good time for me to leave.

779
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,173
Where are you going?
Don't know. Don't care.

780
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,175
Look, if there's something
wrong, I'd like to help.

781
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:12,893
Look, Hannah. Please just stay as
far away from me as possible, OK?

782
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,131
If something were to
happen to you because of me,

783
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,018
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

784
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,296
Oh, damn!

785
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,890
May we come in?

786
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,971
Nice place.

787
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,414
You broke her heart, didn't you?

788
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,731
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

789
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,369
The same as you To get her
out of my life for good.

790
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,735
I want you to help me neutralise her.

791
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:08,940
Hey, whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

792
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,580
I didn't say "kill",
I said "neutralise".

793
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,857
It's a neutral word. "Kill"
is "kill". This is Switzerland.

794
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,617
I have developed the means of
permanently stripping her of her powers.

795
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,253
No powers?

796
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:28,539
So she'd just be another average, everyday,
run-Of-The-Mill, crazy ex-Girlfriend?

797
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,929
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

798
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:36,091
So what would you want me to
do? Draw her out into the open.

799
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,297
Help me get her when her guard
is down, when she's vulnerable.

800
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,931
Look, I don't mean to offend you, but
you have a reputation for doing things

801
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,375
That most people would consider to be...

802
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,132
No-Nos?

803
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,369
Yes.

804
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:53,533
Yeah. Nothing to worry
about. I'm retiring.

805
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,770
From supervillainy? Yeah.

806
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:00,012
That's good. Look, if you're going to
retire, why notjust forget about her?

807
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,568
That's what I'm gonna
do. I'm leaving town.

808
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:09,008
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

809
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,934
She has harassed me at every
turn and she never, ever stops.

810
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:19,175
So when you finally realise that she is not
the woman who is ever going to forget about you,

811
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,858
Then you give me a call. OK.

812
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,931
All right?

813
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,537
Or you can email me at
"professorbedlam. Com".

814
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,611
It's all one word.

815
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,891
I think I'll just, uh...
give running away a try.

816
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,411
<i>It's Matt. Please leave a message.</i>

817
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,732
<i>Matt, it's Hannah. Are
you there? Please pick up.</i>

818
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:59,291
<i>I... I need your help.
Something really bad's happened.</i>

819
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:04,019
<i>Oh, God, I guess you're
not there. Bye. Hannah!</i>

820
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,812
Who is it?

821
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,539
It's me, Matt. Open up.

822
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,499
Hannah. Are you OK? What did
she do to you? Is she here?

823
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,333
Is who here? G-Girl!

824
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,888
GGirl? Like the superhero?

825
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,175
Yeah, G-Girl the super...

826
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,331
Why did you call me?

827
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,058
Steve was cheating on me. Oh, thank God.

828
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,370
What?

829
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,457
Thank God that you found
out sooner rather than later.

830
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,212
I am sorry.

831
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,009
Yeah, I caught him in
bed with another woman.

832
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,660
Actually, two other women.

833
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:11,052
Maybe three. I don't know I
didn't really get a good look.

834
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,335
Three? Yeah.

835
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,050
Wow.

836
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:20,373
Steve was so good-Looking and
he loved jazz and rock-Climbing.

837
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,815
He took me to nice places
and gave me multiple...

838
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,573
I don't really need to hear that.

839
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,211
The thing is, I never
really had any fun with him.

840
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,418
Not like I have with you.

841
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,573
You've been a really good
friend to me, Saunders.

842
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,091
Hannah, the thing is,

843
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,537
I don't wanna be just a friend any more.

844
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,815
You don't? No.

845
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,976
Look...

846
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:03,217
Hannah, my life has
been really crazy lately.

847
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,258
But it has made me realise
what's most important to me.

848
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:11,858
Seeing you at work every day, that was
always the thing I looked forward to the most.

849
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:17,014
You're the smartest, most
beautiful girl that I've ever met.

850
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,176
And I'm completely and
totally in love with you.

851
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,938
Oh.

852
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,620
Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all.

853
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:55,333
I probably shouldn't tell you this, but
this might be the best moment of my life.

854
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,173
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

855
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,693
Oh.

856
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,771
Hey! Sweetie!

857
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,379
Matt?

858
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,459
I hate you, Matt Saunders!

859
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,417
Get down!

860
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,337
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

861
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,855
I can't tell you.

862
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,977
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

863
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,494
Are you in trouble? No. Well, yeah.

864
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,775
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

865
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,533
You gotta get outside the
city. Go someplace and hide.

866
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,453
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

867
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,974
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

868
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,654
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

869
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,254
I don't understand. Look.

870
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,697
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

871
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,769
If?

872
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,851
Matt, wait.

873
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,053
Oh, it's you. Come in. Wait here.

874
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,940
Right here? Where? What? Right here.

875
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,818
OK. Over there.

876
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,931
Wow.

877
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:42,212
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK? I
just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

878
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:47,932
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyse the source of G-Girl's power.

879
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:51,296
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

880
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,170
Yeah, I know about the meteor in
high school. She told me. I know.

881
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,251
She told you that? Yeah.

882
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,649
Did she talk about me?

883
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,176
I mean, she said you guys were
friends, you had a falling out.

884
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:09,492
Bullshit! That meteorite
changed everything between us.

885
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:14,654
But now, I've got something that
will totally level the playing field.

886
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,895
That?

887
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,618
The rock?

888
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,533
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

889
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,736
A special rock. It was a rock
that gave off the radiation.

890
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:35,176
I now have a rock that
will absorb the radiation.

891
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,974
So if you got Jenny close
enough to this thing...

892
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,099
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

893
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,616
Draining her of her powers permanently.

894
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:50,773
OK, so what do you need me for? Why
can't you just get her close to it?

895
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,499
With that superhearing of hers?

896
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,970
No, I need someone
who can lure her to it.

897
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,654
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

898
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,618
A weak and powerless simpleton.

899
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,691
An idiot.

900
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:24,532
No, all of these invoices were
returned. None of them have been paid.

901
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,975
Call back.

902
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:31,930
And these two are supposed to be...

903
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,731
Hi.

904
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,295
Hi.

905
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,654
What's this?

906
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,493
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

907
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,252
Flowers? Yeah.

908
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:53,128
You think flowers are going
to make me forgive you?

909
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,974
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

910
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,257
Then what the hell are you doing here?

911
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:06,939
OK, look. To be honest, I realise that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

912
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:13,209
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

913
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,611
I would.

914
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,971
Oh, God.

915
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,051
They're beautiful.

916
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,652
I'm sorry. It's OK.

917
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:38,698
Thank you. You're welcome.

918
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:44,377
What do you think about today after
work you come by my place around seven

919
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:50,330
And I'll make us a nice
dinner? Seven? I'd love to.

920
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,731
Matt?

921
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,691
Matt?

922
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,369
Oh, my God! Hey, Jenny.

923
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,736
Matt, it's beautiful.

924
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,778
Oh, what is that? Is that for me?

925
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,330
It is. It's a little
something I got you cos...

926
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,776
I wanna apologise for the
terrible way that I've treated you.

927
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,216
Itjust wasn't right. You're
so sweet. You didn't have to.

928
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,575
It's true, I'm sorry. What is it?

929
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:51,051
No peeking, OK? I want it to be
a surprise. Let's have a toast.

930
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,700
You are amazing.

931
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,658
<i>To second chances.</i>

932
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,935
<i>To second chances.</i>

933
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,891
The man's not bad. He might
have a future in our business.

934
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,615
You know, deep down,

935
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,216
I had a feeling that you'd realise
your mistake and come back to me.

936
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,291
You are wise.

937
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,018
Do you wanna know a secret? Sure.

938
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,094
That's why I didn't kill you.

939
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,968
Matt?

940
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,699
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

941
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,692
Oh, no, no, I'm not. Yes, yes, you are.

942
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:00,134
You're sweet.

943
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,211
Yummy.

944
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,655
Matt?!

945
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,537
What are you doing here?

946
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,088
Me?! What are you doing here?

947
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,411
<i>You said your life was in
danger. And what's she doing here?</i>

948
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,412
Who's that? Do we know
her? I don't know her.

949
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,649
I don't know her.

950
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,768
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

951
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,374
It didn't work. Jenny,
stop. Let me handle this.

952
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,859
Are you back with her? No.

953
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,931
What? Yeah.

954
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,978
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

955
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,779
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

956
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,693
Hannah, please, just do me
a favour, OK? Just leave.

957
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:41,819
I mean, just try to have a little
self-Respect. You're starting to look pathetic.

958
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:47,418
Matt! You are not... Oh, my God. There you
are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

959
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,094
Playoff tickets. Amazing
seats. You and me.

960
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,774
Not now. Tonight.
Third base line. Yahoo!

961
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:56,170
Now is a terrible time,
OK? Hey, what's in the box?

962
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:00,731
Stay away from that
box. You know, Hannah,

963
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,699
Why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

964
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,692
Stay away from it. It looks
big, it might be a nice present.

965
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,568
Are you threatening me? Push me
one more time and you'll find out.

966
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,778
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

967
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,579
That's it! Don't touch me!

968
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,218
Just do me a favour and leave
and take Hannah with you...

969
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:28,210
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! You're G-Girl.

970
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:31,055
You have been doing G-Girl?

971
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,853
Vaughn, open the box!
Go! Go! Go! Watch the van!

972
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,610
Open the damn box!

973
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,139
Aargh!

974
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,530
It's not much of a present. Agh!

975
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,611
I'm sorry.

976
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,211
You bastard!

977
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,579
Matt, that's a weird rock.

978
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,979
Ah.

979
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:10,019
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr Saunders.

980
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,853
You did this? You helped him?

981
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,252
I'm really sorry. You did
throw a shark at me, you know.

982
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,015
Besides, Bedlam's gonna
retire. It'll be OK.

983
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,572
You idiot!

984
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,737
Looks like you're done, honey.

985
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,416
You always thought you
were so much better than me.

986
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,297
Now it's my turn.

987
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,531
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

988
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:41,692
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

989
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:45,293
We're having a moment here.

990
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:52,054
Not so tough now, huh?! Hannah,
don't let her touch the rock!

991
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,210
Hannah!

992
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,339
Oh, no! Hannah!

993
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,528
I can't even see her.
We gotta get down there.

994
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,611
Oh, man!

995
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,496
I think she's dead, Matt.

996
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,253
I'm sorry. Let her go.
We gotta dig her out!

997
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,571
We gotta start the grieving
process. Are you crazy?

998
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,128
Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub. You!

999
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,654
I thought you were just ajerk!

1000
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,015
Now I find out you're really stupid.

1001
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,250
Teaming up with Barry?!

1002
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:49,296
You broke my heart and now I'm
gonna break your everything.

1003
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,851
Hey!

1004
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,659
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch!

1005
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,094
Bring it!

1006
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,176
Oh, man!

1007
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,615
Yes, girl fight!

1008
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,137
Stupid!

1009
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,136
Matt!

1010
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,251
No!

1011
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,612
Hannah!

1012
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,258
Hannah, are you OK?

1013
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,738
Oh, no!

1014
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,650
You rat!

1015
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:48,171
Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

1016
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,411
Uh-Oh.

1017
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,091
Wow!

1018
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,535
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

1019
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,053
Are you OK? I'm fine.

1020
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,212
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged
my knee, but I'm all right.

1021
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,895
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

1022
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,130
Come on.

1023
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,650
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

1024
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,732
Hey, it's you. Are you with them?

1025
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,811
As a matter of fact, I am.

1026
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,135
They went down there.

1027
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,168
Stop!

1028
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:10,539
Look at yourself. You're
terrifying these people.

1029
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:18,131
Jenny... Jenny, this has
gotta stop right now, OK?

1030
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,653
Please.

1031
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,095
Just give me that, OK?

1032
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,614
There you go. Just give it to me.

1033
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,329
Wow. That was a lot
heavier than I thought.

1034
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,456
Hi.

1035
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:36,170
Look, God knows I don't
want you mad at me, OK?

1036
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,694
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

1037
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,693
And yeah, I know what we
had was something special.

1038
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,010
And at times it was great.

1039
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,969
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

1040
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:56,339
You're a great girl. And you
deserve to be with the perfect guy.

1041
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,092
You do. I do.

1042
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:03,379
And I know who the perfect guy for you
is. And he's here, right here, right now.

1043
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,451
Professor.

1044
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,170
What? Barry?

1045
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,534
Go on, Professor, tell
her. Tell her what?

1046
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,373
She's my mortal enemy? I want
nothing but her destruction?

1047
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:21,409
Come on, Barry, please.
Please stop calling me Barry.

1048
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,129
It's true. This guy, he's got
a shrine to you in his house.

1049
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:28,815
There are pictures of you all
over the walls, just of you.

1050
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,256
This guy, he is hooked
on you. He really is.

1051
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,694
Is that true?

1052
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:46,614
Come on. You gotta open your
heart to her. It's now or never.

1053
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,453
It may be a little true.

1054
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:56,215
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

1055
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,814
All right, all right!

1056
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,891
It's completely true.

1057
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,894
I love you.

1058
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,778
I've always loved you.

1059
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:12,251
But if you love me so much, then how
come you're always trying to hurt me?

1060
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:17,460
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

1061
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,293
You ignored me.

1062
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,371
You left me behind.

1063
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:29,897
So I thought if I had the
powers, you may learn to love me

1064
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:33,211
The way I have always loved you.

1065
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,331
Are you sure?

1066
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,776
Do you really love me?

1067
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,890
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,292
It's over. Can you believe
it? I'm free. You were great.

1069
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,859
I can't believe that fight.

1070
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,898
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

1071
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,938
You saved my ass in
there. You were wonderful.

1072
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,057
And I'm really sorry I didn't
explain things to you sooner,

1073
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,531
But I was just trying to protect
you. I totally understand.

1074
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,689
Good.

1075
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:23,659
Oh, my God, my hair. Oh, it doesn't
look that bad. You can fix it.

1076
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,617
Here, try this on.

1077
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,497
Thanks.

1078
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,254
See? Adorable.

1079
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,535
Yes, you are. No, not me.

1080
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,293
Come here. Agh!

1081
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,052
Tight. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1082
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,689
It's OK. I'm still getting
used to all of this.

1083
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:47,537
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

1084
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:51,329
Talk? You mean... Your powers.

1085
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:56,096
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean you
have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

1086
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:59,172
You're a little scared of me.

1087
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,058
What? Scared? No, come
on, I'm not scared at all.

1088
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,131
Come here.

1089
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,657
Are you ready?

1090
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:18,858
Yeah! I am. I'm ready.

1091
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,454
OK. Here we go.

1092
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,015
OK, all right, I got it.

1093
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:39,097
Hold on, I think I tweaked
something. Oh, you poor baby.

1094
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,936
What the hell were you doing?!

1095
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,136
Sorry. Sorry.

1096
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,090
Oh.

1097
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,695
I brought it down for
you. Peace offering.

1098
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:20,338
You've done so much for
us. We couldn't be happier.

1099
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,888
How...? How...? Asteroids.

1100
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:26,211
Most of that will just buff right out.

1101
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,294
I'll fix that. I could
trick it out for you.

1102
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:36,736
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-Activated battle armour.

1103
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,970
Do you hear something?

1104
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,415
No. There's a 747 in trouble.

1105
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,094
It's a 727. Time to go to work.

1106
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,449
You need a hand?

1107
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,769
A hand? Yeah, any help?

1108
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,453
I never had any help.

1109
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:57,008
Could be some heavy lifting. Yeah?

1110
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,897
OK. Yeah? Really?

1111
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,609
Yes. Yes! All right! Whoo!

1112
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,015
OK, ready. Whoo! Here I go.

1113
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,697
Yeah!

1114
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,458
Love you, honey! We'll be waiting!

1115
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,259
What are we gonna do with
this stuff? Wanna get a beer?

1116
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,410
Sure. Let's do it.

1117
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:29,608
My God! You really do have superpowers.

1118
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:33,136
Yeah. Well, it helps
when you haven't used them

1119
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:39,489
In two years, three months,
one week and four days.

1120
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:43,334
OK, now. I got one
more in me. Here we go.
