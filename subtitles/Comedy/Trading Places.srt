1
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,697
Your breakfast, sir.

2
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:25,638
Pork bellies! I have a hunch
something exciting is going to happen

3
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:28,265
in the pork belly market this morning.

4
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:45,074
Will Miss Penelope
be dining with you this evening, sir?

5
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:48,077
Yes. Yes, she will.

6
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,746
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Folsey.

7
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:44,711
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Good morning.

8
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,219
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

9
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,015
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

10
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,893
Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.

11
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,230
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.

12
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,693
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

13
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,948
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

14
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,386
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

15
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:49,782
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

16
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,119
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

17
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:57,206
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

18
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:00,417
- Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

19
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:02,628
Good morning, Mr Duke.

20
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,287
When do we sell?

21
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:39,957
How stupid these scientists are!

22
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:44,253
The eternal question! There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

23
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:47,798
I don't care about
heredity versus environment.

24
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:52,094
I'm sick and tired of hearing it. I care
how much we get for our pork bellies.

25
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,305
Winthorpe will sell
at 76 and a quarter.

26
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,057
His charts say that's as high as it'll go.

27
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,561
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

28
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:03,898
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see if Winthorpe's right.

29
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,861
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I say we sell now.

30
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:11,739
- Just another few seconds.
- The market's closing.

31
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,491
We won't get the order in.

32
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:37,515
We just made an extra $347,000.

33
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,017
Get me Winthorpe.

34
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:43,854
Well, I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

35
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,067
Yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

36
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,277
I'll see you at the club.

37
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:22,142
Morning Mr Duke.

38
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:25,646
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

39
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,941
Vietnam did this to me
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

40
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,236
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?

41
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,155
Spare a poor war veteran some change?
I'm on my knees for life.

42
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,324
I have no money to give you.

43
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,285
Please, anything.

44
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,079
A quarter, just a couple of dollars.

45
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,999
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.

46
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:47,418
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

47
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:51,547
I don't care what it is,
smoked ham, anything, a jacket.

48
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:54,800
Thanks! How'd you
like a stump up your ass?

49
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,470
- Stay outta here!
- You've got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

50
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:05,978
Listen to this.

51
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,189
"Expect this stagnation to continue,

52
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:10,399
"until the Department Of Agriculture's

53
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,735
January crop report."

54
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,197
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

55
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:19,783
Wrong! Quite wrong. Untrue.

56
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,994
They've given this genetics fellow

57
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,664
the Nobel Prize. He doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

58
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:30,169
We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orange juice

59
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,379
and you're talking about human nature.

60
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,340
Money isn't everything.

61
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:35,633
Grow up.

62
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,260
Mother always said you were greedy.

63
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:40,262
She meant it as a compliment.

64
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,230
Ezra, right on time.

65
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:54,109
I bet you thought
I'd forgotten your Christmas bonus.

66
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:56,320
There you are.

67
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
Five dollars!
Maybe I'll go to the movies...

68
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:04,495
by myself.

69
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,958
- Half of it is from me.
- Thank you, Mr Mortimer.

70
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,639
- Gentlemen.
- Looking good, Louis.

71
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,474
Feeling good, Todd.

72
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:29,270
We need a fourth for squash today, Louis.
Are you interested?

73
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:32,731
No can do. I'll be having dinner
with Penelope, tonight.

74
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:38,737
- Oh, lucky you.
- It's not luck, Todd.

75
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,292
Randolph, Mortimer.

76
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,752
What have you got for us?

77
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:56,046
It's that time of the month again.

78
00:11:56,172 --> 00:12:00,176
Payroll cheques for our employees,
which require your signatures.

79
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,761
And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

80
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,473
We are paying some of our employees
an awful lot of money.

81
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,101
You can't get around
the minimum wage.

82
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:21,572
$50,000 to Clarence Beeks!
Who the hell...

83
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:27,119
I meant to ask you about that.
I went through our records,

84
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:30,581
and there doesn't seem to be
a Clarence Beeks employed with the firm.

85
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,295
Oh, Clarence Beeks.
Yes, of course.

86
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,966
- He's doing something top secret for us.
- Research.

87
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,553
How is Penelope?

88
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:48,724
Don't forget she's our grandniece - you'd
better make an honest woman of her.

89
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:53,020
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.
The wedding invitations go out this week.

90
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,147
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

91
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,276
Don't worry about this,
Winthorpe.

92
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:02,363
I'll take care of this one personally.

93
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:07,785
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.

94
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,757
Winthorpe is a very steady young man.

95
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,718
We're lucky
to have him managing our firm.

96
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:29,890
Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvard -
he's the product of good environment.

97
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,726
It's got nothing to do with environment.

98
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,397
With his genes, you could put him
anywhere and he'd come out on top.

99
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:40,192
Breeding, same as in race horses.
It's in the blood.

100
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,329
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How you doing?

101
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:56,667
Once you've had a man with no legs,
you never go back.

102
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,920
I know what you're thinking.
You seen "Porgy And Bess"?

103
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,464
We can make it, baby. Me and you.

104
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:05,134
You bitch!

105
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,025
- Who's that? Who's there?
- Police!

106
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:25,613
We've had complaints about con men
pretending to be blind and crippled.

107
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:29,491
I ain't seen nothing since
I stepped on that landmine in Vietnam.

108
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,702
It was very painful.

109
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,330
You were in 'Nam? So were we. Where?

110
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,416
I was in... Sang Bang...

111
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,001
Dang Gong...

112
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,712
I was all over the place, a lot of places.

113
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,339
What unit?

114
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:46,717
I was with the Green Berets,
Special Unit Battalions...

115
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:51,514
Commando Airborne Tactics...
Specialist Tactics Unit Battalion.

116
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,057
Yeah, it was real hush hush.

117
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:56,685
I was Agent Orange,
Special Agent Orange, that was me.

118
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,896
Airborne, huh?

119
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,492
I can see! I can see!

120
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:13,536
I have... I have legs.

121
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,956
I have... Oh shit, look at this.
Legs! I can walk.

122
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,917
Jesus, praise Jesus.

123
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:24,630
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe... Thank you.

124
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,715
I don't know what to do it's...

125
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:31,178
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

126
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,806
This is too much. I can't believe it.

127
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:39,186
Ah, beautiful. Listen... I can't thank you.
First Moses, now this. God, Jesus...

128
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:42,773
I'm so happy, oh God.
Look at me, this is too much.

129
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,860
What a happy day!

130
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,988
Really, I appreciate it.
Y'alls OK now. Look at this.

131
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:53,033
I can walk. I don't know what to say...
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

132
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,954
Y'all beautiful,
both of you are, the two of you.

133
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,006
How are you doing?

134
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,682
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Stop thief.

135
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,518
- Help, help!
- What are you talking about, man?

136
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,063
Don't kill me, take it, please.
I'm getting married.

137
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,858
- I don't want your bag.
- Help! Help!

138
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,111
Help! Help!

139
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:31,363
Help!

140
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,158
He's in there. After him.

141
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:41,665
- Excuse me.
- Watch out. He probably has a weapon.

142
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,796
Stop him. He has my briefcase.

143
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,132
He's inside. That guy's crazy.

144
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:56,514
He's getting away.

145
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,849
There he is. That's him. Get him.

146
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,977
He's under the table.
Somebody go under there.

147
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,188
Right there. There he is.

148
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:10,736
Is there a problem, officers?

149
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:21,163
What in heaven's name is going on here?

150
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:26,085
- He tried to rob the payroll, Randolph.
- I didn't, he bumped into me.

151
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,046
I did not.
You tried to grab my briefcase.

152
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,091
- It was an accident.
- An accident, really?

153
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,885
- What will happen to him?
- We'll book him

154
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,347
on assault, robbery, and resisting arrest.

155
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,850
Well done, Winthorpe.

156
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:44,728
I'm innocent.
I was trying to give his briefcase back.

157
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:47,398
I can't go to jail cos of some ass-wipe.

158
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:50,150
Officer, I would like to press full charges.

159
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,820
People like this are a menace
to decent society.

160
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:55,614
You're from a broken home of course?

161
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,700
Yeah, it was broke. So what?

162
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:00,786
You have a history of juvenile arrests,
I presume?

163
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:04,206
Drug abuse, reform school,
state prisons and all that-

164
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:07,418
I want a lawyer.
Is there a lawyer in the house?

165
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,970
That man is a product
of a poor environment.

166
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,598
There's nothing wrong with him,
I can prove it.

167
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:24,101
Of course there's
something wrong with him...

168
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:26,395
He's a Negro!

169
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,899
He's probably been stealing
since he could crawl.

170
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:46,540
Given the right
surroundings and encouragement,

171
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:52,421
I'll bet that that man could run
our company as well as Winthorpe.

172
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,591
Are we talking about a wager, Randolph?

173
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:01,639
I suppose you think Winthorpe...
say if he were to lose his job,

174
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:04,558
would resort
to holding up people on the streets.

175
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:08,521
No, I don't think that
would be enough for Winthorpe.

176
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:14,151
We'd have to heap a little more
misfortune on those narrow shoulders.

177
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:17,404
If he lost his job and his home

178
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,157
and his fiancee and his friends.

179
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:24,203
If he were somehow disgraced
and arrested by the police

180
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,413
and thrown in jail, even.

181
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:31,752
Yes, I'm sure he'd take to crime
like a fish to water.

182
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:36,715
You'd have to put him in the wrong
surroundings, with the worst sort of people.

183
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:40,386
I mean real scum, Randolph.

184
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,596
We've done it before.

185
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,349
This time it's in a good cause.

186
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:48,269
How much do you want to bet?

187
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:51,105
- The usual amount.
- Why not?

188
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:59,405
You're so brave, Louis.

189
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,782
Someone has to take a stand
against criminals.

190
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:04,201
But he could have killed you.

191
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:08,998
In such a situation, you have
no time to think - instinct takes over.

192
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:12,084
It's either kill or be killed.

193
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,965
Did Louis tell you what he did today?

194
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:25,055
Mr Louis kindly shared this afternoon's
excitement with me, Miss Penelope.

195
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:29,977
You're so hot tempered, darling.

196
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,649
I would have grovelled
and begged for mercy.

197
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:45,743
I want you Louis, now.

198
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,166
- Coleman.
- Sir?

199
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,545
We'll take our drinks in the living room,
by the fire.

200
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,592
- No dessert, sir?
- You have it.

201
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,638
Thank you, sir.

202
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:16,607
Hello.

203
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:20,110
Oh, hello Mr Duke, sir...
A what?

204
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:25,115
A scientific experiment.

205
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,451
Not at all, sir, no I...

206
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:30,162
It all sounds very...

207
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:33,082
...original.

208
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:37,169
Well, it's your house and I work for you.

209
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:40,172
I shall make the necessary arrangements.

210
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,676
And a very good night to you, sir.

211
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,807
What a scumbag.

212
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:54,603
Mumsie wants to have a party for us
right after New Year's.

213
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:57,231
January 2nd, is that good for you?

214
00:21:57,356 --> 00:22:00,484
OK with me, hon. Darn nice of her too.

215
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,362
Oh, heck. 2nd January. Can't do it.

216
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,991
- Oh, Louis.
- It's the day the crop reports come out.

217
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:12,997
What do those stupid old crop reports
have to do with Mumsie's party?

218
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:16,208
It's the busiest time
of year in the office, sugarpuff.

219
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:20,504
It's just not fair. Why can't you
make them do it another day?

220
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:24,675
The Department Of Agriculture gets those
estimates from all over the country.

221
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,886
Pork bellies, soybeans,

222
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,971
frozen orange juice.

223
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:31,932
I'll just have to ask Todd to take me.

224
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:37,021
Now, wait just a minute. If you think
I'm going to let that playboy...

225
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,398
Just teasing you.

226
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,734
You know something, Witherspoon?

227
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,863
- What?
- We are going to make a great couple.

228
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:48,616
We're going to have a great life.

229
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,162
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

230
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,707
Will you be needing me any more,
this evening, sir?

231
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,712
No, I think I have everything I want.

232
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:04,256
Good night, sir.

233
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:16,477
I had to keep him
under surveillance.

234
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:20,397
I had to make sure
he had his payroll before I made my move.

235
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,734
- Tell us how you cut him.
- With no knife.

236
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:28,197
- You told me you cut the dude.
- With these I cut him.

237
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:31,867
I am a chain belt in Kung Fu.
Bruce Lee was my teacher.

238
00:23:56,392 --> 00:24:01,063
That's the "quart of blood" technique.
Do it, a quart of blood drops out of a body.

239
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:05,401
- Tell him how you beat on the cop.
- Cops, plural.

240
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:10,030
Beat the shit out of ten cops and had
to change my whole strategy around.

241
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:14,743
When they brought you in and booked you,
you was crying like a pussy.

242
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:19,874
- Yeah.
- The cops threw tear gas in my face.

243
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,794
I still walked in like a man,
so get outta my face.

244
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,214
You beating up a man,
putting him in hospital.

245
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,842
- How come I don't see marks on you?
- Yeah.

246
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,386
Cos I'm a karate man, all right.

247
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:36,223
Karate men bruise on the inside
They don't show their weaknesses.

248
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:40,436
You don't know that, motherfucker.
Now get off my back, all right.

249
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:45,024
I wish my bitches would hurry up.
I ain't got time to be here.

250
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,277
Where is your bitches,
Mr Big Time Pimp?

251
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,737
Yeah.

252
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:56,285
Didn't I tell you,
the phone in my limousine is busted

253
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,496
and I can't get in contact
with my bitches.

254
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:02,291
Yeah, the phone in the limo had busted.
Are you ignorant?

255
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:08,005
- Look, sit down, all right.
- It ain't cool being no jive turkey

256
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,341
so close to Thanksgiving.

257
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:15,513
Hey, now...

258
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,226
You boys don't know what you're doing,
I can see that already.

259
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:25,064
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Back the fuck up, back up.

260
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:29,109
D'you know who you're fucking with
in cell number four on the ninth floor.

261
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:31,779
- Billy Ray Valentine?
- Yes.

262
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,405
Move it.

263
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,451
- You made bail.
- I did?

264
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,132
May I suggest using a night stick, officer?

265
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,134
Get outta here.

266
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,496
Mr Valentine.

267
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,667
Could you spare us a moment?

268
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:32,381
- Don't I know you two guys?
- Step inside, nice and warm in here.

269
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:37,887
- Whisky, all you want.
- I ain't falling for the same trick twice.

270
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:41,223
You'd get me in the car,
and have me arrested for stealing it.

271
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:44,435
Why should we do that, Mr Valentine?

272
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,313
We're the ones who bailed you out.

273
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,725
Who are y'all? What y'all want?

274
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,688
We want to help you. My brother and I
run a privately funded programme,

275
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:32,608
to rehabilitate
culturally disadvantaged people.

276
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:36,987
We'd like to supply you
with a home of your own, a car,

277
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:40,908
a generous bank account,
and employment with our company.

278
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:44,328
We're going to start you at $80,000 a year.

279
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:48,082
- $80,000?
- Mmm.

280
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:49,708
Excuse me.

281
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,713
This is a practical joke, right, brother?

282
00:27:57,132 --> 00:28:01,011
Then these dudes
are a couple of faggots, huh?

283
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,222
What's my next move, man?

284
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,017
Thank you, you've been helpful.

285
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:15,067
- What about the payroll?
- We've had the charges dropped.

286
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:17,403
You're a free man, Valentine.

287
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:20,656
We can stop right now
and you can walk out on us forever.

288
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,754
No, I believe I can hang out
with you fellas for a while.

289
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,215
- Excellent.
- I'm Randolph Duke.

290
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,426
How you doing Randy, what's happening?

291
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,846
- My younger brother, Mortimer.
- Hey Morty! What it is.

292
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:46,223
Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn.

293
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:49,685
Randy, that's like Randy Jackson
from the Jackson Five, right?

294
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,146
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Yeah.

295
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,454
Here we are, William.

296
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,791
How you doing?

297
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,669
Hey, Randy, Morty. This is nice, I like this.

298
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:18,506
- William...
- Billy Ray.

299
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,092
William, this is Coleman.
He'll look after your day-to-day needs.

300
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:26,388
- Can I relieve you of those?
- You get a glass, I'll give you a sip.

301
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:31,352
- Perhaps, your coat, sir?
- Yes, this is my coat.

302
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:34,605
Coleman is here to take care of you.
He is your servant.

303
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,732
- May I?
- Get out of here.

304
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:41,195
Valentine very badly wants to take a hot
bath and get into something comfortable.

305
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,614
Don't you, Valentine?

306
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,578
Jacuzzi, sir?

307
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:52,456
I knew you was faggots.
You ain't Jacuzzying nobody.

308
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,084
It's a whirlpool bath sir.

309
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:57,294
I think you'll enjoy it.

310
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:05,636
Bubbles, man!
Say, when I was growing up,

311
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:10,140
we want a Jacuzzi,
we had to fart in the tub. This is bad!

312
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,028
- What's he doing in there?
- He's singing, sir.

313
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:25,239
They're very musical people, aren't they?

314
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:30,911
- What shall I do with his clothes?
- Send them to the laundry.

315
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:35,624
He'll need them to wear back to the ghetto,
after I've won our bet.

316
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:40,421
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it, Randy, very nice.

317
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:43,757
I like the way you have the mirror and stuff.

318
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,845
- I don't think he understands.
- Morty, I do understand.

319
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,223
- William, this is your home.
- Right.

320
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:55,144
- It belongs to you.
- Yeah, I like my home. It's very nice.

321
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,898
- I have nice taste in houses.
- Everything here is yours.

322
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,317
- This is my stuff?
- Your own property.

323
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,527
- My own personal shit.
- You understand?

324
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:06,780
Yeah, I like that.
You know what I like most?

325
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,742
The curtains, it's beautiful the way
I've set this place up.

326
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:12,745
This is something else.
I like it. The cabinets.

327
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,332
Beautiful. I suppose
you'll give me this TV set for free?

328
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,792
- That's right.
- Everything here is mine?

329
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,712
- I guess the stereo's mine too?
- Absolutely.

330
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:24,548
This is too much.
I could really dig this. You know why?

331
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:26,759
This happens to me every week.

332
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,762
This is your house.

333
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:33,682
These are your personal possessions.

334
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:36,519
You will only be stealing from yourself.

335
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,563
Look, first you throw my ass in jail.

336
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:44,318
Then you run me some garbage
about how this is my house, this is my rug

337
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,779
and this is my personal slave too.

338
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:51,200
I understand how you feel
but the fact remains, all this is yours.

339
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,744
You may do with it whatever you wish.

340
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:57,748
This is my stuff.
I can do what I want with it, right?

341
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,793
This is my vase, Billy Ray's vase?

342
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:05,089
I can play Harlem Globetrotters
shit with it, like Meadow Lark Lemon?

343
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,805
- Hey man, I'm sorry about that.
- Perfectly all right, it was your vase.

344
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:17,017
That was a fake, right?

345
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:19,770
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

346
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:26,235
But, I seem to remember we estimated
its value at $50,000 for the insurance.

347
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,491
You see, Mortimer? William
has already made us a profit of $15,000.

348
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,544
You want me to break something else?

349
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,004
No.

350
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,440
Excuse me.

351
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,991
I hope we're not pushing it, using Mr
Beeks for this, as well as the crop report.

352
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:18,287
We are involved in a very important
scientific experiment, Mortimer

353
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:21,123
and Mr Beeks has always proven reliable.

354
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,872
Excuse me... Sorry.

355
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,589
Hello, Todd. Gents.

356
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:29,525
Gentlemen. There is something rotten
in the Heritage Club.

357
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,571
Something that has
never raised its vile head

358
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,324
in the 208 years of the club's history.

359
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,703
There is a thief,

360
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,913
and he's sitting here among us.

361
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:46,083
Not an ordinary thief like the man

362
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,587
Winthorpe had the guts
to stand up to yesterday.

363
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:54,508
No, this man is a hundred times lower.

364
00:34:56,927 --> 00:35:00,598
I'd like to introduce Mr Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

365
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:09,940
Thank you. I'd like
to ask you gentlemen to all stand up.

366
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:21,160
I'd like to ask you to place
your left hand on the shoulder

367
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,205
of the man to your left.

368
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,045
I would now ask you

369
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,091
to place your right hand in the coat pocket
of the member to your right.

370
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,678
And empty the contents
of those pockets onto the table.

371
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,893
Thank you.

372
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,229
You may sit.

373
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,159
We marked three $50 bills with red X's.

374
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:06,831
Less than ten minutes ago

375
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,001
those bills were stolen
from a coat in the cloakroom.

376
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,214
One of our operatives witnessed the theft.

377
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,707
Now, wait a minute. I've never seen
this money before in my life.

378
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:54,128
Randolph, Mortimer, this is outrageous.
I haven't done anything wrong.

379
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,506
Oh, Winthorpe.

380
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,676
I'm glad your parents
are not alive to see this.

381
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:04,930
Wait, this is preposterous.
This is insane.

382
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,933
I have no reason to steal. I'm not a thief.

383
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:11,228
I demand a fair hearing.
At least grant me that.

384
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,210
You realise you're making
a grave mistake.

385
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,255
Boy, are you two going to be sorry.
You know who I am?

386
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,051
Yeah, Winthorpe Louis III.

387
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,095
I'm permitted two calls,
point me to the phone.

388
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,516
- Take off your clothes.
- Wait, I know my rights.

389
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,059
Take off your clothes.

390
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,189
You are making a career decision here.
Now, you'd better think about it.

391
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,400
Because you'll have to live with it
for the rest of your life.

392
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,613
Strip, before I tear you a new asshole.

393
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,660
Did you hear what this man said?

394
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,247
Now, I have witnesses.
This man is physically threatening me.

395
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,418
Winthorpe...

396
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,338
Louis the third.

397
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,133
All right. One gold watch.

398
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,974
One alligator skin wallet.

399
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,687
Master Charge,
American Express... Gold Card.

400
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,816
Visa, Diner's Club, Carte Blanche.

401
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,027
Two tickets...

402
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,282
- "La Bo-heem"
- "La Boheme" - it's an opera.

403
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:49,118
It's an opera.

404
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:01,088
- One cellophane bag.
- I've never seen that before in my life.

405
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,179
That's PCP - phencyclidine.
Angel dust.

406
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,806
You ever seen
what this stuff does to kids?

407
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:15,269
You're looking
at three to five, mandatory... Louis.

408
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,500
What's happening, Terry?
Gimme a bottle of your best champagne.

409
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,589
You've got a nerve,
showing your face here after all this time.

410
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,050
Look, man, I got your money.

411
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,679
I got your poor... measly... $27...

412
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,973
with interest.

413
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,394
Billy Ray, honey. Is that you?

414
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,482
Who do you think it is?
Terence, get the lady some champagne.

415
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,945
In fact, champagne for everybody,
courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine.

416
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,121
A toast to Billy Ray?

417
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,169
I'm very sexy.

418
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,382
People will say, "Billy Ray, you're sexy,"
and not understand my sexuality.

419
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,050
I know.

420
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,640
You was in the tank last night,
braggin' on your limousine.

421
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,310
You're the motherfucker
I was gonna carve.

422
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,312
Yeah.

423
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,484
Motherfucker?

424
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,403
<i>Moi?

425
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,407
That's my limousine outside,
why don't you take a look at it?

426
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,617
Right outside?

427
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,121
Yeah.

428
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,331
You took care of him, baby.

429
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,960
I was gonna kick his ass,
but I'm a peaceful man.

430
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,138
Ladies, it's time for me to get home.

431
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,726
But if any of you ladies want
to drop by my house for cocktails,

432
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,478
there's plenty of room in my limousine.

433
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,689
Come on, everybody.

434
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,341
- You're looking so fine, Billy Ray.
- Thank you very much.

435
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,934
If you're gonna vomit,
the bathroom's downstairs.

436
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,144
No, downstairs, man.

437
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,356
Shit!

438
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,236
Hey! Hey!

439
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,572
That's a Persian rug. It's from Persia.

440
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,582
What is this shit here?

441
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,419
Hold up! Hey, who's been
putting out their Kools on my floor?

442
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,550
Who has been putting out
their Kools on my floor?

443
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,683
Have you people ever heard of coasters?

444
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,275
Would you like me to prepare some
more hors d'oeuvres for the guests, sir?

445
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,485
Fuck them.

446
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,906
Coleman, there was more people
in this room before, where 'd they go?

447
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,702
I believe some of them
have adjourned upstairs, sir.

448
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,787
To my bedroom?

449
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm waiting for you, Billy Ray.

450
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,086
Put your clothes on
and get out.

451
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,231
Yeah, that's my girl, over there.

452
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,991
Can I have everybody's attention please?

453
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,050
Get the fuck out!

454
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,932
Good night, sir.

455
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,560
Good night, madam.
I hope you enjoyed it.

456
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,107
Thank you.

457
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,240
It was a stone groove, my man.

458
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,450
You are the most righteous...

459
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,079
Get the fuck out, man.
Let's go, come on.

460
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,998
Hurry up.

461
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:33,003
And be quiet out there.
My neighbours are asleep, they work too.

462
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,926
Well, your...

463
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:42,680
Your friends seemed to enjoy it,
I thought it was a great success.

464
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:47,852
They weren't friends. They're a bunch of
freeloaders, treating my house like a zoo.

465
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:54,233
Why don't you retire, sir? I'll straighten up.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

466
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,822
Yeah, yeah, I think I will...

467
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,576
...retire.

468
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,121
Good night, Coleman. Thanks, man.

469
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,628
Good night, sir.

470
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,318
Let's go, Winthorpe.

471
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:54,001
- Excuse me.
- I'll see you later, we'll have lunch.

472
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,171
How would you like
to make a fast hundred?

473
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,381
I just got out.

474
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:04,094
Are you trying to entrap me right here?
You guys must be getting desperate.

475
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,542
Is that your purse?

476
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,587
Yes.

477
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,798
That's a nice purse.

478
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,219
Thank you.

479
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,561
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

480
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,273
Louis, you're making a scene.

481
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,234
The good news is I'm innocent.

482
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,529
I've never done anything resembling this.

483
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,782
Louis, you look awful. I'm so ashamed.

484
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,702
Those clothes and those shoes and...

485
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,498
you've been fighting, and you smell.

486
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,626
I smell?

487
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,463
Penelope, do you realise
where I've been since yesterday?

488
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,300
They beat me up and stole my clothes.

489
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,719
Those men wanted to have sex with me.

490
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,639
- Can we discuss this somewhere else?
- They tried to bend me over this...

491
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:35,227
If this place is indicative
of correctional institutions in this country,

492
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,897
they might as well let all the convicts out.

493
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,107
It's far worse on the inside.

494
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:45,070
Stealing from your friends, Louis?
Heroin, Louis? Have you lost your mind?

495
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,532
Mother wants me to call off the wedding
and so does Todd.

496
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,285
Todd, what does Todd have to do with it?

497
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,207
You've been fired from Duke & Duke.
They're charging you with embezzlement.

498
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,211
Embezzlement?
I've never stolen anything in my life.

499
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,505
How could the man I loved,

500
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,425
whose children I wanted to have
and breast-feed, be a heroin dealer?

501
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,886
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust, PCP...

502
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,307
Listen Penelope,
I swear to you, on my honour,

503
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,518
with almighty God as my witness,

504
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,187
I am not an angel dust dealer.

505
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,902
Oh, Louis.

506
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,867
I've been looking
everywhere for you, baby.

507
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:36,205
- Louis, I'm hurting. I just need a shot.
- Would you please...

508
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,501
- Who is this person?
- I've never seen this woman before.

509
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,129
Don't say that, Louis.

510
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,844
Come on baby, just a dime bag.
I'll do all those things you like.

511
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:58,310
You lying... filthy... disgusting... creep.

512
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:03,357
Todd was right about you. I never want
to see you again as long as I live.

513
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,998
Grand! Great! Thanks a lot.

514
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,586
It was a joke.
Your friend said it would get you off.

515
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,799
- Someone told you to do this to me?
- Yeah, and he paid me $100.

516
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,384
He's over there.

517
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:37,600
Let me get this straight,
I give you 20 for the cab,

518
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,102
and you'll give me 50 at your house?

519
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,606
That is correct.
My butler will give you $50,

520
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,816
and drive you anywhere you wish.

521
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,403
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

522
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:54,116
- If you're hustling me...
- Hustling you, hustling you?

523
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,789
You don't think they give these
to just anyone, do you?

524
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:05,169
I can charge goods and services
in over 86 countries around the world.

525
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,465
Yeah? Well I don't take credit cards.

526
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,228
You'll see what a mistake all this was.

527
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,072
Yes?

528
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,909
Coleman, could you let me in?
I'm having trouble with my key.

529
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:42,456
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Just let me in, I'm in no mood for jokes.

530
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:47,294
Coleman? There's no Coleman here.
You've made a mistake.

531
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,887
Excuse me, for a moment.

532
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,183
Coleman! Let me in.

533
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,355
If you don't go away,
I shall call the police.

534
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,957
Hello. I'll be making a cash withdrawal
for the amount of $500.

535
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,502
In fact, make it $1,000.

536
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,386
Excuse me.

537
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:50,524
I'm sorry, Mr Winthorpe,
but the IRS has frozen your accounts.

538
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,651
What? You know me.

539
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,029
You're a heroin dealer, Mr Winthorpe.

540
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,824
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust - PCP
and I never touched it.

541
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,496
Regardless, it's not the kind of business
we want at First National.

542
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,249
May I see your credit cards please?

543
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,965
- I've been ordered to repossess them.
- What?

544
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,762
Wait, what am I supposed to live on?
What's going to happen to me?

545
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,389
Roger.

546
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,572
Why is someone
deliberately trying to ruin my life?

547
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,492
Tell you what. Forget about the $50, OK?

548
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,702
I'm just real tired. I'm going home.

549
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,041
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

550
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,503
I have been framed.
You can't just leave me here.

551
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,130
I've got enough problems, Louis.

552
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,178
Come on, come on.

553
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,390
Listen! Wait!

554
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,641
Wait.

555
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:11,772
I have over $150,000 in that bank.

556
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,610
But you don't care because
you helped them do this to me.

557
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,162
Get off your knees, Louis.

558
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,505
Give me your hand.

559
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,343
Soft hands.

560
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:46,807
And a manicure. Never done a hard day's
work in your life, have you?

561
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,398
I'm gonna regret this but...

562
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,942
come on. Get in.

563
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:19,381
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
This has been a grave mistake.

564
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,968
Hey, that looks just like
the dude that had me busted.

565
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,095
Sir?

566
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:28,265
Right there,
he looked just like the mother...

567
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,811
I mean, he looks just like
the gentleman that had me busted.

568
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,271
To whom are you referring, sir?

569
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,273
The dude right there.

570
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,778
- Right over there.
- That's my car.

571
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:45,115
Coleman!
Coleman, that's my car!

572
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,786
That's my car! That's my driver.

573
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,752
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

574
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,297
You don't want
to be late for your first day, sir.

575
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,432
What do they want me to do here?

576
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:14,270
- I'm sure they'll tell you.
- What if I can't do it?

577
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,231
Just be yourself, sir.

578
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:20,985
Whatever happens,
they can't take that away from you.

579
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,628
- Excuse me, my name is...
- Mr Valentine.

580
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,339
They're waiting in the last office
down the hall.

581
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:09,742
- Ah, William, my boy. Right on time.
- Come in, come in.

582
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,330
Sit down.

583
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,085
No thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast.

584
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,880
This is not a meal, Valentine.

585
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:27,426
We are here to try to explain to you,
what it is we do here.

586
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,471
We are commodities brokers, William.

587
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,932
Now, what are commodities?

588
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,976
Commodities are agricultural products.

589
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:39,897
Like coffee, that you had for breakfast.

590
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,775
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

591
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,194
Pork bellies, which is used to make bacon,

592
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,365
which you might find in a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

593
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:56,789
Then there are other commodities like...
frozen orange juice... and gold.

594
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:01,585
Though, of course, gold
doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

595
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,673
- Clear so far?
- Yeah.

596
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,802
Good, William.
Now, some of our clients are speculating

597
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,305
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

598
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,644
We have other clients who are speculating
that the price of gold is going to fall.

599
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,564
They've placed their orders with us

600
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:25,526
and we buy or sell their gold for them.

601
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,445
Tell him the good part.

602
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:33,993
The good part is that no matter whether
our clients make money,

603
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:39,248
or lose money,
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

604
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:42,334
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

605
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,090
Sounds to me like you guys
are a couple of bookies.

606
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,842
I told you he'd understand.

607
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,347
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what happened.

608
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,894
It's the same guy who tried
to rob the payroll, no doubt, that's him.

609
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,104
He planted the drugs on me.

610
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,523
Rachim, Mohammed, Larry.
How are you guys doing?

611
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,568
Hey, hey, how ya doing?

612
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,363
You know those people?

613
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,878
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

614
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:30,466
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh sure, he went to Harvard.

615
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:37,389
If he's being driven around in my car,
he could actually be living in my house.

616
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,643
Maybe he's even taken my job.

617
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:45,147
For all I know, right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancee.

618
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:49,610
And Coleman -
after years of service, this betrayal.

619
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,821
I don't understand it.

620
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,574
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

621
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,327
- The things that I...
- Shut up, Louis.

622
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,997
Taxis cost money,
food costs money and rent costs money!

623
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:06,126
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

624
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:10,422
These were here when I moved in.
Put 'em on if you want.

625
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:21,809
Look, I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this...

626
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:26,272
- Ophelia.
- Ophelia, you realise that's the name...

627
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,650
I know, Hamlet's girlfriend.
He went crazy, she killed herself.

628
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,695
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

629
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,575
I'm 24. I'm from a small, miserable
mining town you probably never heard of.

630
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:43,455
The only thing I've got going for me,
is this body, this face,

631
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,666
and what I got up here.

632
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,428
I don't do drugs.

633
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,638
And I don't have a pimp.

634
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,350
This place is a dump.

635
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:06,854
But it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

636
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:10,524
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

637
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:14,028
I've got three more years on my back.
I'll have enough to retire.

638
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,698
You're a prostitute?

639
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:26,415
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

640
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:31,712
I help you get back on your feet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

641
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,965
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

642
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,176
Understood?

643
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:58,155
By the way, food and rent are not
the only things here that cost money.

644
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,282
You sleep on the couch.

645
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:04,995
It's hit rock bottom. Come on, let's buy.

646
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,916
Buy 200 May belly contracts at 66.8.

647
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:13,420
- Put them on my personal account.
- That's a big mistake, man.

648
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:19,718
- Valentine, this is very important, watch.
- You're going to get reamed on this one.

649
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:22,805
Why shouldn't we buy now, William?

650
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,765
Price is going to keep going down.

651
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,436
Randolph, this isn't
Monopoly money we're playing with.

652
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:35,192
This is Randolph Duke.
Hold that belly over a moment.

653
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:41,240
Tell me why you think
the price of pork bellies is going down.

654
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:46,287
- It's Christmas time. Everybody's uptight.
- Could we please buy now?

655
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:49,915
- If you want to lose money go ahead.
- What are you trying to say?

656
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,711
OK, pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

657
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:58,591
So everybody's waiting for them
to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap.

658
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,635
The people with
pork belly contracts are thinking,

659
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,055
"Hey, we're losing all our money
and Christmas is coming.

660
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:08,309
"I won't be able to buy my
son the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip.

661
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:12,605
"And my wife won't make love to me
cos I ain't got no money."

662
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,316
They're panicking, screaming, "Sell, sell."

663
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:19,904
They don't want to lose all their money.
They are panicking right now. I can feel it.

664
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:21,739
Look at them.

665
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:24,783
He's right, Mortimer, my God, look at it.

666
01:02:25,618 --> 01:02:28,120
I'd wait till you get to 64, then buy.

667
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,748
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

668
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:34,543
Do you realise how much money
he just saved us?

669
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,171
Money isn't everything, Randolph.

670
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:44,345
Advise our clients
interested in bellies to buy at 64.

671
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,805
Mr Valentine has set the price.

672
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:53,229
Well done, William.
Very well done.

673
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:56,232
Come on, Randolph, we're gonna be late.

674
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:30,099
Yo...
Mortimer dropped his money clip.

675
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:34,270
- You can count it, it's all there.
- Thank you.

676
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:39,316
- It's all there, count it.
- I'm sure it is. Keep up the good work.

677
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,569
All right, Randy.

678
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:43,779
Nice try, Mortimer.

679
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,461
That was great, that was really great.

680
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:46,967
...and she stepped on the ball.

681
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:53,098
Oh my God, I don't believe it.

682
01:04:56,101 --> 01:05:00,314
- Ah, there you are.
- I think I'm going to be sick.

683
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,525
Don't worry, I'll handle this, Pookums.

684
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:06,320
Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip.

685
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:10,449
I realise this looks completely awful
but I just wanted to assure you,

686
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,327
my friends, that I am completely innocent.

687
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:17,832
I'm going to fight this.
Someone is out to get me and I know who.

688
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:21,585
The important thing is
that I can rely on you,

689
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,088
my friends, as character witnesses.

690
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,430
I'm going to be defending myself

691
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:37,059
and I wondered
if you could see your way clear

692
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:41,981
to perhaps advance me
a small loan until the hearing.

693
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:48,279
Frankly, Winthorpe,
and I think I speak for all of us,

694
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:52,867
I think it shows incredibly bad taste
for you to embarrass us like this.

695
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:57,079
I believe I'm still a member of this club.

696
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,670
Nobody wants to buy your drugs, Louis.
Why don't you just go away?

697
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,060
Burnt my fingers, man.

698
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:25,191
I beg your pardon.

699
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,612
Man, that watch is so hot, it's smokin'.

700
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:33,574
Hot? Do you mean to imply, stolen?

701
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:37,244
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
- 50 bucks!

702
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:42,082
No, no, no. This is a Rochefoucauld, the
thinnest water-resistant watch in the world.

703
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,877
Singularly unique, sculptured in design,

704
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:49,798
hand-crafted in Switzerland
and water-resistant to three atmospheres.

705
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:55,596
This is the sports watch of the '80s.
$6,955 retail.

706
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,431
Got a receipt?

707
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:59,850
Look, it tells time simultaneously

708
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:03,312
in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills, London,
Paris, Rome and Gstaad.

709
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:07,733
In Philadelphia it's worth 50 bucks.

710
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:10,736
Just give me the money.

711
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,460
How much for the gun?

712
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:34,802
So, this snail is standing
in front of the Cadillac salesman, see,

713
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:38,472
and says,
"How much is that Cadillac?"

714
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,775
The snail says,
"I want a big 'S' put on each door

715
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:55,239
"and on top of the car, I want a big 'S'
so everybody can see it."

716
01:07:55,364 --> 01:07:59,702
Salesman says, "Why do you want that?"
He says, "When I drive down the avenue...

717
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:04,498
"I want everybody to say
'Look at that S-car-go."'

718
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,883
"Look at the S-car-go."

719
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:25,269
I'm considering going long on April wheat.
What do you think, Valentine?

720
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:32,318
I can think of three good reasons
why you shouldn't do that, judge.

721
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:36,822
One, the Russian wheat harvest isn't going
to be as bad as people think... and two...

722
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,078
...and three, judging by
the jewels around your girlfriend's neck,

723
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:46,874
I think you're going to need every penny
just to keep her happy.

724
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,668
103.
That's it, you're staying in bed.

725
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:36,006
That man has moved into my house.
He's stolen my job. I have to do something.

726
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,219
Stay here.

727
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,936
It's ten o'clock - here's Johnny.

728
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:53,190
Listen, baby, I'm sorry.
My momma just came in from outta town.

729
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:55,401
Can we do it next week?

730
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,282
Flowers for me?

731
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:03,075
Thanks.

732
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,541
- What are you doing?
- You've got company.

733
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:13,169
Business is business.
I'll go for a walk.

734
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:16,422
- Fresh air will do me good.
- Lay down.

735
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:24,054
I'm sorry you had to cancel
your appointment.

736
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:28,893
What are you doing?

737
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:46,160
Ophelia, I can't tell you
how good that feels.

738
01:10:47,036 --> 01:10:49,747
You've been so kind to me.

739
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:53,334
I'm just protecting my investment.
That's all.

740
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:57,463
Shut up and go to sleep.

741
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:16,190
99 and a half. You're not
getting out of bed until it's normal.

742
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:19,026
I feel fine and I've
inconvenienced you enough.

743
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:21,821
You have work to do and so do I.

744
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:24,031
Nobody works on Christmas Eve.

745
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:28,244
I'm going shopping
and then I'll make you a nice quiet dinner.

746
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:30,454
Now, read your paper.

747
01:11:46,095 --> 01:11:50,349
Christmas! I'll give him a Christmas
present he'll never forget.

748
01:13:17,603 --> 01:13:20,523
Ah William, where've you been?
The party's already begun.

749
01:13:20,648 --> 01:13:22,733
I have some work to finish.

750
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:25,986
It's Christmas Eve
and William wants to keep working.

751
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:30,658
I'll think of you in Stockholm,
when I accept the Nobel Prize.

752
01:13:30,783 --> 01:13:35,287
The wager has two parts - something
about a second party turning to crime.

753
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:41,544
Didn't you say you had work to do?

754
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:46,173
Yes sir. I was wondering about this
$10,000 cheque to Mr Clarence Beeks.

755
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,384
I'll take care of it, Valentine.

756
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:51,428
I don't recall a Clarence Beeks, Mr Duke.

757
01:13:51,554 --> 01:13:54,056
It was before you joined us, Valentine.

758
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:58,853
We did manage to stay in business
for 47 years before your arrival.

759
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:02,273
Have a drink, William.
Merry Christmas.

760
01:14:02,398 --> 01:14:05,526
- Merry Christmas, Mr Duke.
- What?

761
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:08,696
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.

762
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,835
Ho, ho, ho!

763
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:35,806
Just what do you think you're doing?

764
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:40,728
Randolph, Mortimer, come in here quickly,
I've finally caught him.

765
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:46,609
- Who are you?
- I've caught him red-handed.

766
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:48,819
Winthorpe, is that you?

767
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:52,698
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
This man is a drug dealer.

768
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:55,910
Look, his office drawer,
he's got all the bad drugs here.

769
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:58,954
Marijuana joints, pills, Quaaludes,

770
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:03,542
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

771
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,836
He's the pusher, not me.

772
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:09,048
I just came in
and caught him planting this stuff.

773
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:12,092
It's obviously
some primitive attempt to frame me.

774
01:15:12,218 --> 01:15:16,806
Frame you? Boy, if that
isn't the pot calling the kettle black.

775
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:19,809
This man's obviously a lunatic.
I'm calling security.

776
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:23,062
Put that phone down.

777
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,067
Hello, security...
Merry Christmas.

778
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:32,863
You tried to rob me,
plant drugs on me.

779
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:37,076
You steal my house, my car, my job.
I ought to kill him now.

780
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:39,286
Look, this is a big misunderstanding.

781
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:43,249
I don't know nothing about it.
Could you put the gun away?

782
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:47,169
Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe.
Have you lost your mind?

783
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,922
Freeze, slime ball.

784
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:57,429
I realise this whole experience
must have been rather unsettling for you.

785
01:15:57,555 --> 01:15:59,682
Winthorpe, don't leave. We can explain.

786
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:03,060
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

787
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:08,941
You'll all be very, very sorry.

788
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:35,384
Poor, deluded creature.
We caught him pilfering at our club,

789
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:38,971
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

790
01:16:39,096 --> 01:16:41,515
Now he's dressing up like Santa Claus.

791
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,518
Very sordid business.

792
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:48,355
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

793
01:16:48,606 --> 01:16:50,900
It's not my business,
but he belongs behind bars.

794
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:54,487
- He's unemployed, Valentine.
- It's no excuse, Mortimer.

795
01:16:54,612 --> 01:16:57,198
He's flat broke, obviously hungry.

796
01:16:57,323 --> 01:16:59,575
But he has money to buy drugs, right?

797
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:03,787
You can't be soft on people like that.
Take it from me, Randolph.

798
01:18:09,395 --> 01:18:11,730
Pay up, Mortimer, I've won the bet.

799
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:16,819
Here, one dollar.

800
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:24,243
We took a perfectly useless
psychopath, like Valentine,

801
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:28,205
and turned him
into a successful executive.

802
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:31,417
And during the same time,

803
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:35,671
we turned an honest, hard-working man

804
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:40,092
into a violently deranged, would-be killer.

805
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:45,723
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

806
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:47,933
and returning Valentine to the ghetto?

807
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:51,353
I don't want Winthorpe back
after what he's done.

808
01:18:52,438 --> 01:18:56,275
You mean keep Valentine on,
as Managing Director?

809
01:18:57,443 --> 01:19:02,406
Do you really believe I would have a nigger
run our family business, Randolph?

810
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:05,743
Of course not. Neither would I.

811
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,538
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

812
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:12,791
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don't you?

813
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,586
Absolutely, no sense
rocking the boat until then.

814
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:19,423
If Mr Beeks does what we paid him to do,

815
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:22,843
we should have a very happy New Year.

816
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:25,054
Indeed.

817
01:19:43,614 --> 01:19:46,367
Hey, Winthorpe, Winthorpe.

818
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,292
Hey.

819
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:20,609
Hey, Winthorpe.
Yo, Winthorpe.

820
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:24,155
Winthorpe. Yo.

821
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:29,702
Sorry about that.

822
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:45,801
Yo! Yo!

823
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:49,221
Hey, Taxi!

824
01:22:46,589 --> 01:22:48,799
Hi, Louis. Merry Christmas.

825
01:22:53,304 --> 01:22:55,723
Louis, I have a big surprise for you.

826
01:22:57,141 --> 01:23:02,062
Excuse me. The door was open...
I'm looking for a Louis Winthorpe.

827
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:06,025
- Does he live here?
- Wait here a minute, I'll be right back.

828
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:13,532
Louis, Louis. It's him. It's Valentine.

829
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:17,870
Louis... Louis?

830
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:24,710
Louis.

831
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:28,797
It was close but he's going to be all right.

832
01:23:28,923 --> 01:23:31,717
Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest.

833
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:34,053
And for God's sake, no excitement.

834
01:23:35,721 --> 01:23:37,807
Thanks, Doc. Merry Christmas.

835
01:23:37,932 --> 01:23:41,060
Merry Christmas to you.
I'll let myself out, Coleman. Thank you.

836
01:23:41,185 --> 01:23:43,270
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

837
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:54,990
It was a dream.
I dreamt the whole thing.

838
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:57,201
It was just a bad dream.

839
01:23:57,326 --> 01:23:59,370
Good morning, sir.

840
01:23:59,495 --> 01:24:01,080
Merry Christmas.

841
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:05,000
Coleman, I've had
the most absurd nightmare.

842
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,670
I was poor and no one liked me.

843
01:24:07,795 --> 01:24:11,715
I lost my job, I lost my house.
Penelope hated me.

844
01:24:12,508 --> 01:24:15,469
And it was all because
of this terrible, awful Negro.

845
01:24:19,348 --> 01:24:23,227
- Oh dear!
- It... was... the... Dukes.

846
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:25,855
You're a dead man, Valentine.

847
01:24:27,314 --> 01:24:31,360
It was an experiment.
They used us as guinea pigs, man.

848
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,574
The Dukes used us as guinea pigs.

849
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:39,994
To see how our lives would turn out.
They made a bet.

850
01:24:40,119 --> 01:24:43,038
- I'm afraid it's true, sir.
- I believe him, Louis.

851
01:24:43,164 --> 01:24:48,169
The Dukes ruined my life over a bet?

852
01:24:48,294 --> 01:24:52,798
- For how much?
- A dollar.

853
01:24:54,133 --> 01:24:56,218
One dollar.

854
01:24:57,219 --> 01:25:00,347
Fine, that's the way they want it.

855
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:03,100
No problem.

856
01:25:05,644 --> 01:25:09,273
You can't just shoot people
with a double-barrelled shotgun

857
01:25:09,398 --> 01:25:11,484
cos you're pissed at them.

858
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:14,653
- Why not?
- It's assault with a deadly weapon.

859
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:17,114
You get 20 years for that shit.

860
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:19,325
Do you have any better ideas?

861
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:24,455
Yeah, it seems the best way to hurt rich
people is by turning 'em into poor people.

862
01:25:25,956 --> 01:25:29,543
You have to admit,
you didn't like it yourself a bit.

863
01:25:29,668 --> 01:25:32,796
Under heavy security,

864
01:25:32,922 --> 01:25:36,675
the crop estimates
for next year's orange crop

865
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:40,721
are being delivered to the Department
Of Agriculture in Washington DC.

866
01:25:40,888 --> 01:25:45,017
Louis, Louis, that's him,
the guy who paid me to talk dirty to you.

867
01:25:45,142 --> 01:25:48,813
In charge of security, Mr Clarence Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

868
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:51,023
Clarence Beeks.

869
01:25:51,148 --> 01:25:55,861
- The Dukes gave him 10 grand.
- I saw 50,000 in the payroll.

870
01:25:55,986 --> 01:25:58,239
Mortimer said it was for research.

871
01:25:58,364 --> 01:26:03,369
Research, so he can get that top secret
report, two days before it goes public.

872
01:26:03,494 --> 01:26:08,624
Oh my God, the Dukes will corner
the entire frozen orange juice market.

873
01:26:08,749 --> 01:26:10,960
Unless somebody stops them.

874
01:26:11,085 --> 01:26:13,796
Or beats them to it.

875
01:26:13,921 --> 01:26:15,589
Eggnog?

876
01:26:15,714 --> 01:26:18,384
Duke & Duke, may I ask who's calling?

877
01:26:18,509 --> 01:26:21,637
Duke & Duke, he's busy.
Can you hold please?

878
01:26:21,762 --> 01:26:25,432
May I help you? One moment,
Mr Beeks, I'll put you right through.

879
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:38,195
Operation "strange fruit"
proceeding according to plan.

880
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,826
I anticipate penetration and acquisition
at 21:00 tomorrow. Hold on.

881
01:26:44,285 --> 01:26:46,370
Fuck off!

882
01:26:46,495 --> 01:26:51,458
- When can we expect delivery?
- I will be leaving DC by train.

883
01:26:51,584 --> 01:26:57,256
Will rendezvous at 24:00 at the
Hilton Hotel, parking level D, Section 4.

884
01:26:57,381 --> 01:27:00,134
That's the orange section.

885
01:27:00,259 --> 01:27:02,553
Orange, I like that, very good.

886
01:27:02,678 --> 01:27:05,639
The final payment is due on delivery,
in cash.

887
01:27:19,153 --> 01:27:20,988
Jesus, hey!

888
01:27:21,447 --> 01:27:23,532
Happy New Year!

889
01:27:56,649 --> 01:28:01,862
- Ever make it with an ape?
- Harvey, haven't you had enough drink?

890
01:28:02,029 --> 01:28:04,573
Are you kidding,
it's not even New Year's Eve.

891
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,159
Come here, kiss this beautiful ape.

892
01:28:07,284 --> 01:28:09,662
Come on.

893
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:12,832
Harrisburg Express...

894
01:28:20,673 --> 01:28:23,467
- What?
- It's my turn to drive.

895
01:28:25,469 --> 01:28:27,805
- No it isn't.
- It is.

896
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:31,725
- I'm sure you think it is, but it isn't.
- Don't you remember?

897
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:34,478
You drove the shipment of anchovies.

898
01:28:34,603 --> 01:28:39,108
Yeah, but you had the video tape
recorders this afternoon.

899
01:28:41,193 --> 01:28:43,279
I backed them up about five feet.

900
01:28:43,404 --> 01:28:47,575
We take turns. Sometimes it's longer,
sometimes shorter. It's my turn now.

901
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,244
- No it isn't.
- Yes it is.

902
01:28:57,543 --> 01:29:01,213
- Merry New Year.
- Happy New Year.

903
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:03,466
In this country, we say, "Happy New Year".

904
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:08,888
Thank you for correcting my English,
which stinks.

905
01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:13,601
I am Naga Eboko,
exchange student from Cameroon.

906
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,965
Beef jerky time.

907
01:29:45,549 --> 01:29:48,886
- You want some beef jerky?
- No, please.

908
01:29:49,553 --> 01:29:51,263
There's plenty, you know.

909
01:29:51,847 --> 01:29:54,225
This animal's being
routed through to New York.

910
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:57,520
Its care and feeding instructions
are on this bill of lading.

911
01:29:57,645 --> 01:29:59,730
OK, gotcha.

912
01:29:59,855 --> 01:30:03,692
I doubt you'll have need it but, there's
a tranquilliser gun in the First Aid kit.

913
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:09,532
- Oh, yeah?
- Say, have you guys been drinking?

914
01:30:09,657 --> 01:30:13,285
- No, sir. Not us.
- There's enough drunks here already.

915
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:20,000
Happy New Year.

916
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:24,213
That's kind of you, son.
A Happy New Year to you, too.

917
01:30:24,338 --> 01:30:29,301
Could I offer either of you two gentlemen
a wee jolt of Irish whisky,

918
01:30:29,426 --> 01:30:31,720
to usher in the New Year.

919
01:30:31,846 --> 01:30:33,931
Not for me, pal.

920
01:30:35,474 --> 01:30:38,602
I do not drink. It is against my religion.

921
01:30:38,727 --> 01:30:43,232
I always say, religion's a fine thing,
taken in moderation.

922
01:30:43,357 --> 01:30:45,442
Beef jerky?

923
01:30:45,568 --> 01:30:48,529
No son, it gives me wind,
something terrible.

924
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:54,827
We are moving! We are moving!

925
01:30:59,123 --> 01:31:02,251
New York, here we come!

926
01:31:14,805 --> 01:31:17,141
Come in, my child, join the party.

927
01:31:17,266 --> 01:31:21,395
Let me see, you would be from Austria.
Am I right?

928
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,608
- No, I am Inga from Sweden.
- Sweden?

929
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:28,903
But you're wearing <i>Lederhosen.

930
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:32,156
<i>Ja,</i> for sure, from Sweden.

931
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:39,121
Please, help me with my rucksack.

932
01:31:40,956 --> 01:31:43,042
Oh yeah, sure, why not?

933
01:32:11,362 --> 01:32:14,990
I'm hungry, man.
I've got to get something more to eat.

934
01:32:15,115 --> 01:32:18,953
Well, maybe there's
some pretzels in the bar car.

935
01:32:36,262 --> 01:32:38,222
You're welcome!

936
01:32:50,025 --> 01:32:53,154
- Who is that?
- Open the door, man.

937
01:33:00,411 --> 01:33:03,956
I'm dressed as a baggage handler.

938
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:08,961
Imagine how embarrassed I was that
someone had the same costume I had!

939
01:33:09,837 --> 01:33:14,175
Monkey, monkey?
I'm a fucking gorilla you clown!

940
01:33:14,675 --> 01:33:18,929
I certainly hope there's
enough space on the train for me.

941
01:33:19,847 --> 01:33:23,225
Naga, Naga Eboko, from Cameroon.

942
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,978
Do you remember me? It's Lionel Joseph.

943
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:31,901
Lionel, from the African Education
Conference, right?

944
01:33:32,026 --> 01:33:36,780
I was Director of Cultural Events
at the Haile Selassie Pavilion.

945
01:33:36,906 --> 01:33:39,575
I remember
we have big fun there.

946
01:33:55,341 --> 01:33:58,385
Now we are all here,
we will have a picnic, <i>ja?

947
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:02,640
You will help me get my rucksack down
for the Swedish meatballs.

948
01:34:06,894 --> 01:34:09,396
- Remember the one we did?
- Yeah.

949
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:18,280
- The memories.
- All day long I could tell those stories.

950
01:34:18,405 --> 01:34:21,534
- Those were good ones.
- The good old days.

951
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,953
- There you are, sweet pea.
<i>- Danke.

952
01:34:27,456 --> 01:34:30,626
So, the train will be
pulling into Philadelphia soon.

953
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:33,796
Will you be getting off
at the city of brotherly love?

954
01:34:33,921 --> 01:34:36,215
I will but you won't...

955
01:34:37,508 --> 01:34:39,593
...Winthorpe.

956
01:34:39,718 --> 01:34:42,012
- See if this one's empty.
- Hey, back off.

957
01:34:42,138 --> 01:34:45,224
I'll rip out your eyes
and piss on your brain.

958
01:34:45,349 --> 01:34:47,685
- Excuse me.
- You got it.

959
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:51,647
All right. On your feet. Up! Let's go.

960
01:34:51,772 --> 01:34:54,900
Bunch of fucking weirdos!
We're going to take a little walk.

961
01:34:55,025 --> 01:34:58,112
Don't try anything funny
or the whore loses a kidney.

962
01:35:26,098 --> 01:35:28,893
- No, I'm from Sweden.
- Beat it.

963
01:35:29,018 --> 01:35:33,647
Hey, I'm King Kong,
the biggest, baddest guy in the jungle.

964
01:35:33,772 --> 01:35:35,858
Get lost, you maggot.

965
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:39,945
Hey, who is that guy,
your father or something?

966
01:35:44,825 --> 01:35:46,911
All right, hold it right here.

967
01:35:47,036 --> 01:35:49,580
- Honestly, Beeks.
- This is as far as we go.

968
01:35:50,789 --> 01:35:53,209
No more cockamamie cigar smoke.

969
01:35:53,334 --> 01:35:56,170
No more Swedish meatballs there, tootsie.

970
01:35:56,712 --> 01:36:00,007
And no more phoney Irish whisky.

971
01:36:00,132 --> 01:36:02,384
No more goddamn jerky beef.

972
01:36:03,093 --> 01:36:05,179
The party's over.

973
01:36:05,304 --> 01:36:08,933
The party's over. Hey, come on.

974
01:36:09,058 --> 01:36:11,143
What do you mean, "The party's over"?

975
01:36:11,268 --> 01:36:14,146
It's not even ten o'clock, you dummy.

976
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,899
Hey, come on. Loosen up, man.

977
01:36:17,024 --> 01:36:19,109
It's almost New Year's Eve.

978
01:36:51,392 --> 01:36:54,061
Hey, look what happened to me!

979
01:37:03,404 --> 01:37:06,115
Sometimes, they look so human,
it gives you the creeps.

980
01:37:08,617 --> 01:37:11,912
Boy, that other one's
getting kinda horny, ain't he?

981
01:37:12,037 --> 01:37:15,416
Think we ought to hit him up
with the tranquilliser gun?

982
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:17,626
It's New Year's. Let 'em have their fun.

983
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:23,215
That black one must be the female.

984
01:37:41,317 --> 01:37:46,071
- Where is he?
- Beeks. Are you there, Beeks?

985
01:37:53,078 --> 01:37:55,206
I'm over here.

986
01:37:59,293 --> 01:38:01,712
That's far enough.

987
01:38:01,837 --> 01:38:03,923
Did you get the report?

988
01:38:05,049 --> 01:38:07,384
Let's see the money.

989
01:38:15,559 --> 01:38:17,645
OK, toss it over.

990
01:38:29,406 --> 01:38:31,492
Thank you, Beeks.

991
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:45,673
Wonderful news. Wonderful.

992
01:38:45,798 --> 01:38:49,135
Beeks, Happy New Year.

993
01:39:00,688 --> 01:39:05,067
My life savings. Try not to lose it.

994
01:39:05,192 --> 01:39:09,530
Lose it? In a couple of hours, you're going
to be the richest butler that ever lived.

995
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,830
I worked real hard for this, Louis.
Hope you know what you're doing.

996
01:39:19,123 --> 01:39:22,042
- Thank you, Ophelia.
- What are you doing?

997
01:39:23,961 --> 01:39:26,046
10:31...

998
01:39:26,172 --> 01:39:28,257
That's us, Louis.

999
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:35,973
Coleman, would you please.

1000
01:39:36,098 --> 01:39:38,184
Thank you.

1001
01:40:16,347 --> 01:40:21,018
I could use a stiff drink.
Would you care to join me?

1002
01:40:47,545 --> 01:40:50,256
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1003
01:40:50,381 --> 01:40:52,466
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1004
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:07,106
Keep the change.

1005
01:41:08,232 --> 01:41:11,527
Think big, think positive.
Never show any sign of weakness.

1006
01:41:11,652 --> 01:41:16,824
Always go for the throat. Buy low, sell high.
Fear, that's the other guy's problem.

1007
01:41:16,949 --> 01:41:21,412
Nothing can prepare you for the unbridled
carnage you are about to witness.

1008
01:41:21,537 --> 01:41:23,622
The Super Bowl, the World Series.

1009
01:41:23,747 --> 01:41:28,794
Pressure? Here it's kill or be killed.
Make no friends and take no prisoners.

1010
01:41:28,919 --> 01:41:32,047
One minute you're up half a million,
the next, boom.

1011
01:41:32,173 --> 01:41:34,717
Your kids don't go to college
and you've lost your Bentley.

1012
01:41:34,842 --> 01:41:38,304
We've got to kill the motherfucker...
We've got to kill them.

1013
01:41:38,429 --> 01:41:42,475
We want you to buy as much OJ
as you can, the instant trading starts.

1014
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,395
Don't worry if the price starts going up,
just keep buying.

1015
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,315
They'll broadcast the crop report
in an hour, what if...

1016
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,692
Let us worry about that, Wilson.

1017
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:56,822
Yes, sir.

1018
01:42:00,367 --> 01:42:05,998
- How's the ulcer, Harry?
- Pretty good. How's the hypertension?

1019
01:42:06,123 --> 01:42:08,209
Hasn't bothered me in months.

1020
01:42:36,195 --> 01:42:38,280
Let's kick some ass.

1021
01:42:59,426 --> 01:43:03,472
This is it. The last
bastion of pure capitalism left on earth.

1022
01:43:03,597 --> 01:43:08,018
Here in New York they trade everything,
gold, silver, platinum,

1023
01:43:08,144 --> 01:43:11,063
heating oil, propane, cocoa and sugar

1024
01:43:11,188 --> 01:43:13,649
and, of course,
frozen, concentrated orange juice.

1025
01:43:13,774 --> 01:43:17,820
The people on the phones are taking
orders from brokers all over the world.

1026
01:43:17,945 --> 01:43:22,449
The runners hand those
orders to the traders in the pits.

1027
01:43:26,453 --> 01:43:29,999
They're trading cotton over there.
And that's the silver pit.

1028
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:34,044
The Dukes' trader is going to be
buying like crazy right from the opening.

1029
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:36,255
We wait until he drives the price up?

1030
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:40,968
Right. I can't wait to see his face, when
they broadcast that genuine crop report.

1031
01:43:41,093 --> 01:43:43,179
OJ trading opens at 9:00.

1032
01:43:43,304 --> 01:43:46,223
- Let's go kick some butt.
- Let's go.

1033
01:44:47,952 --> 01:44:51,413
Hey, hey. The Dukes
are trying to corner the market.

1034
01:44:51,539 --> 01:44:54,667
- They know something.
- Let's get in on it.

1035
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:57,294
200, taken.

1036
01:44:57,419 --> 01:45:01,549
- 130.
- 200, 200.

1037
01:45:01,715 --> 01:45:03,801
Louis.

1038
01:45:03,926 --> 01:45:06,011
Not yet, almost.

1039
01:45:06,345 --> 01:45:08,514
- 220 taken.
- 209.

1040
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:11,809
- Yeah, yeah, got 'em.
- 139.

1041
01:45:15,729 --> 01:45:19,608
Now!
Sell, 200 April at 142.

1042
01:45:33,789 --> 01:45:37,960
That's not right.
How can the price be going down?

1043
01:45:38,085 --> 01:45:40,796
Something's wrong. Where's Wilson?

1044
01:45:43,215 --> 01:45:45,301
What are they doing here?

1045
01:45:45,426 --> 01:45:49,346
- They're selling, Mortimer.
- Why, that's ridiculous.

1046
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:56,645
- Unless that crop report...
- God help us.

1047
01:46:06,864 --> 01:46:10,284
I told you we shouldn't have
committed everything, you asshole.

1048
01:46:10,409 --> 01:46:14,580
We've got to get Wilson and tell him to sell.

1049
01:46:40,564 --> 01:46:42,024
Ladies and gentlemen,

1050
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:44,068
the Secretary Of Agriculture.

1051
01:46:54,245 --> 01:46:58,666
Ladies and gentlemen, the
orange crop estimates for the next year.

1052
01:47:12,805 --> 01:47:17,351
After calculating the estimates from
various orange producing states,

1053
01:47:17,476 --> 01:47:19,520
We have concluded the following...

1054
01:47:19,937 --> 01:47:24,024
The cold winter has apparently
not effected the orange harvest.

1055
01:47:29,613 --> 01:47:34,285
...consumers can expect
orange juice prices to fall...

1056
01:47:41,459 --> 01:47:43,586
Wilson, for Christ's sake, sell.

1057
01:47:55,347 --> 01:47:57,224
Buy 'em.

1058
01:48:31,842 --> 01:48:33,928
Wilson, where are you going?

1059
01:48:34,053 --> 01:48:38,641
You idiot. Get back in there at once
and sell, sell.

1060
01:48:51,779 --> 01:48:53,864
- Five.
- Yeah, 200.

1061
01:48:53,989 --> 01:48:56,909
- 100.
- Yeah, that was 100.

1062
01:48:57,034 --> 01:49:00,037
Did you get that?

1063
01:49:16,762 --> 01:49:18,848
Happy New Year.

1064
01:49:20,724 --> 01:49:23,894
- Winthorpe.
- Valentine.

1065
01:49:24,019 --> 01:49:27,940
- How'd you make out today?
- How could you do this to us,

1066
01:49:28,065 --> 01:49:30,151
after everything we've done for you?

1067
01:49:30,276 --> 01:49:33,404
Oh, see I made Louis a bet here.

1068
01:49:33,529 --> 01:49:37,366
Louis bet me that we couldn't get rich
and put you in the poorhouse.

1069
01:49:37,491 --> 01:49:40,411
He didn't think we could do it. I won.

1070
01:49:40,536 --> 01:49:42,621
I lost.

1071
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,000
- One dollar.
- Thank you, Louis.

1072
01:49:47,543 --> 01:49:49,628
- After you.
- Certainly.

1073
01:49:53,716 --> 01:49:55,801
Margin call, gentlemen.

1074
01:49:55,926 --> 01:49:58,471
- Why you can't expect...
- You know the rules.

1075
01:49:58,596 --> 01:50:03,726
All accounts to be settled at the
end of the day's trading, without exception.

1076
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:08,147
You know perfectly well,
we don't have $394 million in cash.

1077
01:50:08,272 --> 01:50:13,402
I'm sorry, boys. Put the Duke brothers'
seats on the exchange up for sale at once.

1078
01:50:13,527 --> 01:50:16,906
Seize all assets of Duke & Duke
Commodity Brokers,

1079
01:50:17,031 --> 01:50:20,743
as well as all personal holdings
of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

1080
01:50:20,868 --> 01:50:24,038
We're ruined!

1081
01:50:24,163 --> 01:50:26,999
This is an outrage,
I demand an investigation.

1082
01:50:27,124 --> 01:50:31,754
You can't sell our seats. A Duke has been
on this exchange since it was founded.

1083
01:50:31,879 --> 01:50:34,256
We founded this exchange. It's ours.

1084
01:50:34,381 --> 01:50:36,467
It belongs to us.

1085
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:39,553
We'd better call your brother
an ambulance.

1086
01:50:39,678 --> 01:50:43,224
Fuck him!
I want trading reopened, right now.

1087
01:50:43,349 --> 01:50:47,353
Get those brokers back in here.
Turn those machines back on.

1088
01:50:47,478 --> 01:50:50,397
Turn those machines back on.

1089
01:50:54,652 --> 01:50:58,447
You and your Nobel Prize, you idiot.

1090
01:50:58,572 --> 01:51:01,408
Where's Beeks? Where in hell is Beeks?

1091
01:51:01,534 --> 01:51:04,203
- Beeks!
- Yeah, I forgot all about that guy.

1092
01:51:13,587 --> 01:51:16,132
OK, one male gorilla.

1093
01:51:16,257 --> 01:51:18,926
Wait a minute.
There's two of them in that cage.

1094
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:22,930
One gorilla, two gorillas. Big deal.
Whole bunch is getting sent back to Africa.

1095
01:51:23,055 --> 01:51:27,560
It's a big scientific experiment.
What do I know? Anyway, they're in love.

1096
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:51,417
- Hey, Coleman.
- Yes.

1097
01:51:52,793 --> 01:51:55,588
What about lunch?
The lobster or the cracked crab?

1098
01:51:55,713 --> 01:51:59,133
- What do you think?
- Can't we have both?

1099
01:51:59,258 --> 01:52:01,302
Why not?

1100
01:52:01,427 --> 01:52:03,512
- Dimitri.
- Sir.

1101
01:52:03,637 --> 01:52:08,893
- Lobster and cracked crab for everyone.
- Extra prima good, Mr Coleman, sir.

1102
01:52:18,068 --> 01:52:20,654
Looking good, Billy Ray.

1103
01:52:20,779 --> 01:52:23,282
Feeling good, Louis.

1104
01:56:10,384 --> 01:56:11,427
