Oh, God.

They're getting whiter.

They're getting whiter!

00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,504
You should bleach
your teeth!

Very cute.

Hello, there.
Can I help you?

363
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,088
Hi. I'm looking for a Hal Jackson.

364
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,590
Well, look no further.

365
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,091
Is he inside?

366
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,593
You're talking to him.

367
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,095
To Halbert Jackson?

368
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,598
The one and only.

369
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,099
You're white.

370
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,601
Well, that's true, darlin'.

371
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,603
But when we're alone in the dark,

372
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,105
What difference is that gonna make?

373
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,610
No, see, I'm looking
for the Halbert Jackson

number is 540-82-9789.

Are you a process server?

What's that?

377
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,619
Did my ex-wife send you?

378
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,622
God damn it! We settled
all that alimony shit!

379
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,124
No more legal crap.
She agreed.

380
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,626
No, wait! Wait!

381
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:39,130
I'm sorry, but I don't know
anything about your ex-wife.

382

Oh. Hell, I'm late.
Don't get me wrong.

I think we're good together.

384
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,636
We got a thing, a connection,

385

But I gotta go,

386

Why don't you hop on in here?

Make up your mind.
I got to get to work.

Coming or going?

390
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,652
Well, that's a shame.

391
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,153
No!

392
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,656

I may have mentioned llama.

00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,319
Wait a minute. Wait.

671
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,321
What does that mean,
you found your father?

672
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:21,822
I went to the sperm bank,

673
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,825
Got your file from the computer,

674
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,326
And he's my father.

675
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,827
Ma, it was terrible!

676
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,329
Are you crazy?

677
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,330
I'm sorry!

678
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,331
What did you do?

679
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,332
I'm sorry!

680
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,334
Ok. o--I'm sorry.

681
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,835
Ok, come here.
Come here.

682
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:35,837
It's ok. It's ok.

683
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,839
It's ok. Mommy's here.

684
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,841
It's ok. It's ok.

685
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,342
It's all right.

686
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:45,846
Um, ma?

687
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,351
You haven't heard the worst part.

688
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,852
What?

689
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,354
He's, um...

690
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,856
He's--he's a...

691
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:57,358
Car salesman.

692
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,360
Car salesman?

693
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,861
Yeah.

694
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,866
And, ma, you're not gonna
believe this, but, um...

695
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,368
He's a white car salesman.

696
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,873
Wait. What do you mean, white?

697
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,875
He's like--like white-white?

698
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,877
White-white-white.

699
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,879
You mean he's like

700
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,881
A creamy eggshell kind of tan.

701
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,883
No. Like white.

702
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,884
Like totally white.
Like a white guy.

703
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:25,886
No. you mean that
he was so light

704
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:27,888
You thought he was
a white guy.

705
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,391
He's so light, ma,
He <i>is</i> a white guy.

706
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,393
What do you mean, he's white?

707
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:34,395
I didn't ask--
I didn't want no white--

708
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,397
What is he doing being white?

709
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:37,898
I didn't ask for a white man!

710
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,400
I distinctly asked for a black man!

711
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,903
Did you see the guy?
Was the guy black?

712
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,906
Didn't I tell you
the man came in a tube?!

713
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:45,907
I couldn't see anything!

714
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:47,408
Well, you should've
asked to see him!

715
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,910
So kill me!
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

716
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,412
No, don't kill me.

717
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:52,913
I'll kill myself.
How's that?

718
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,415
What do you mean,
he's white?

719
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:57,918
I can't--wait. Forget it.
It doesn't matter.

720
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,920
Ok.

721
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,921
It's no big deal.

722
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,923
Hell, your hair's always been fine.

723
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:02,924
So what?

724
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,926
You're a little bit
lighter than me. Big deal!

725
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,928
Right. I mean,
look at Lacie and Rissa.

726
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:07,929
They're both really light,

727
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,430
And both of their parents
are really dark.

728
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,931
They're my complexion.

729
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,433
And look at those kids
on <i>the cosby show.</i>

730
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,934
Oh, please.
Let's not get into that.

731
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:14,936
You know they're mixed, right?

732
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:16,437
Well, of course they're mixed!

733
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,439
Ok. Well, then, we can
never really tell.

734
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,940
Who's gonna tell?
Who cares?

735
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,442
Are you gonna tell somebody? 
No!

736
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:23,444
I won't tell, so let's eat!

737
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:24,445
Ok.

738
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:25,446
Ok!

739
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:26,447
Ok.

740
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,950
Ma, it's even worse.

741
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,451
Oh, please!
What?

742
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,453
It's Hal Jackson.

743
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:33,954
Who?

744
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,456
Hal Jackson.

745
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,458
"Because real cowboys
are strong and tough,

746
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,960
And so are
American trucks."

747
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,463
You mean the schmuck
on the television

748
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:43,964
With all the animals?
"Hal's your pal"?

749
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,967
That's my dad.

750
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:49,970
This is Hal Jackson
from Jackson motors,

751
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,472
And this is Larry.

752
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:52,473
Larry and I

753
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,475
Just saw Thelma and Louise
together,

754
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,477
And we figure if those
2 gals can see America,

755
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,479
Then, hell, it's high time
we did, too.

756
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,480
The old-fashioned way--

757
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,482
Behind the wheel
of a top-of-the-line

758
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,983
American vehicle.

759
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,986
Sit down there, Larry,
and grab the wheel.

760
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:05,986
Here, turn around
and grab the wheel.

761
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,488
There you go.
You're driving there, son.

762
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,991
So come on down
to Jackson motors

763
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,492
And see the specials
we got goin'

764
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,493
On cars and trucks.

765
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,994
Could change your life.

766
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,497
I know Larry's
gonna change mine.

767
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,998
Larry's my pal.

768
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,001
Don't forget--
Hal's your pal.

769
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:22,503
Well, give me 5 here, Larry!

770
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:24,004
All right!
Grab your pistola

771
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,007
And let's go.

772
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,009
Adios, folks. Go on.
Pick your nose later.

773
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,510
Grab the wheel.
Let's do some drivin'.

774
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:33,514
Idiot.

775
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,534
Oh, Lord.

776
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,538
Stupid bear.

777
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,044
Guru: You are beautiful
because you are you--

778
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,046
Unique and individual--

779
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,048
But maybe
you don't believe this

780
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,050
Because your beauty
can't completely be seen.

781
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,051
Oh, Lord.

782
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,553
Maybe you have unwanted extra weight.

783
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,555
Maybe bad skin.

784
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,056
Maybe poor posture.

785
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,558
Maybe facial hair.

786
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:20,060
Close your eyes right now

787
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,563
And visualize these
negatives disappearing.

788
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:26,567
See the new
more beautiful you emerging.

789
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,068
[Click]

790
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,076
Good morning.

791
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,077
I need to speak to somebody

792
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,579
In your records department.

793
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,082
We're looking for 
books on weddings.

794
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,583
Her daughter Cindy's
getting married.

795
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:43,584
Finally!

796
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,087
Well, that's nice,
but I only carry books

797
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:47,588
With traditional
African ceremonies.

798
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,590
Well, that's a start, I guess.

799
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:51,092
Yes, um, look...

800
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,095
17 years ago,
I purchased some...

801
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,596
Some, uh...

802
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,099
We can't find
the wedding books.

803
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,101
Over by the voodoo dolls.

804
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,103
Oh!
Oh!

805
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,105
Sperm.
I bought sperm.

806
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:06,106
I asked for
an African-American.

807
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,108
I don't think that's what I got.

808
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,609
I filled out all of these forms.

809
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:10,110
Nobody seems to be able
to tell me--

810
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,112
Are the books in order

811
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,113
Of subject matter or author?

812
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:13,114
Author.

813
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,615
Who's the author
of the wedding book?

814
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,617
Babe, I'm on the phone here.

815
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,118
I don't know.

816
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,121
My life is hanging in the balance,

817
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,622
And you want talk to me about authors.

818
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:23,124
Would you just do your thing?

819
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,125
What thing?

820
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:27,128
I just don't think
I got what I paid for.

821
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,630
Why do all complaints
have to come in writing?

822
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,132
It's obvious to me
you people can't read.

823
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,634
Do the
"Urban bush woman"

824
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:34,635
T-Shirts come in petite?

825
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,637
What exactly is 
an urban bush woman?

826
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,640
Me! Me!
I'm an urban bush woman!

827
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,641
I'm an urban bush woman!

828
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:41,642
Oh.

829
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,644
This is not a mix-up.

830
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:45,145
A mix-up is when you
order a hamburger

831
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,147
And get a cheeseburger

832
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,648
Or when you bring your
clothes to the dry cleaner,

833
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:49,149

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,251
Look, wait a minute.

1000
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,753
Anyone mind if I
have a cigarette?

1001
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,254
Yes, I do mind!

1002
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,256
This is his office!

1003
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,757
But these are my lungs.

1004
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,258
Let him kill himself
and not me.

1005
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,761
How about a drink, then?
You got a problem with that?

1006
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,764
No, I don't.
Why don't you make it two?

1007
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,266
Ma, you never drink hard liquor.

1008
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,268
What a shame.

1009
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,769
Make it a double.

1010
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,771
All right. One drink coming up.

1011
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,273
You know, I noticed

1012
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,274
That you're having a hard time

1013
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,277
Keeping yourself
in school these days.

1014
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,779
I wanted to talk to Hal.

1015
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,781
You know, a good education
is invaluable.

1016
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,782
She knows that.

1017
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,285
She's going to Berkeley
next fall.

1018
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,787
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

1019
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,288
I got into M.I.T.,

1020
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,290
And that's my first choice.

1021
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,292
Yeah, well, she doesn't
really want to go

1022
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,794
All the way to Boston.

1023
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,295
Yes, I do really want to
go all the way to Boston.

1024
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,298
We can't afford it, can we?

1025
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,300
My science teacher

1026
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,302
Is helping me with scholarships.

1027
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,304
Ahh!

1028
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,306
She's always winning stuff like that.

1029
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,307
Look at her.

1030
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,309
She's so cute, she's so smart.

1031
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,810
Ma...

1032
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,811
Mom, don't start.

1033
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,812
I'm sorry.

1034
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,814
First you don't want me to go,

1035
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,816
Now I'm winning all these awards.

1036
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:46,817
What?

1037
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,318
Well, I just think

1038
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,320
That you could take
all your awards you win

1039
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,321
And use them in Berkeley.

1040
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,322
This is really good.

1041
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,326
Ma, I don't want
to go to Berkeley!

1042
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,827
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

1043
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,829
Who asked ya?

1044
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,831
The--never mind.

1045
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,333
Can I have some more?

1046
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,836
You've got to sit down

1047

In this baby.

1048
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,840

Yeah. Yellow.

1053

You're not feeling too nervous

1054

About buying a truck, are you?

1055
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,851
No. No, not at all.

By surprise yesterday, Zora.

1166
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,588
I Want to apologize
if I hurt your feelings.

1167
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,589
It's ok.

1168
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,592
I'm sorry that
my mom showed up here.

1169
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,094
No problem.

1170
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,099
Good-bye.

1171
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,602
Bye.

1172
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,106
Ooh, ooh, ooh, shit!

1173
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,109
Oh, Christ!

1174
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,610
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah...

1175
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,117
God damn it!

1176
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,123
[Car alarm]

1177
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,555
What is wrong with you, coming
around that corner like that?

1178
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:09,556
Are you crazy?

1179
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,057
Stop the car. Aah!

1180
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,959
Oh, look at that--
A Parking space.

1181
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,945
God damn it, pull the car over!

1182
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,447
Just let me out.

1183
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,449
Are you gonna unlock
the door, or what?

1184
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,451
Come on and unlock this damn door

1185
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,952
Before I slap you!

1186
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,453
I Can't stand your ass!

1187
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,456
Son of a bitch!
What is wrong with you?

1188
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,458
Are you crazy, coming
Around that corner!

1189
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,460
Where do you think
you are, in L.A.?

1190
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,961
Goddamn crazy white people.

1191
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,462
Hello there, folks!

1192
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,465
Thank you very much
for the ride!

1193
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,467
Do you mind
if I come in

1194
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,969
And drain the lizard?

1195
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,970
If you drain the--

1196
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,473
Does that mean you have
to go to the bathroom?

1197
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,473
Uh-huh.

1198
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,975
Fine. come on in!

1199
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,476
You crazy...

1200
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,980
You locked us in.

1201
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,982
We were gonna call 911,

1202
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,984
But then we started reading books.

1203
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,486
I'll take these. They're fascinating.

1204
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,489
We'll take everything,
and...

1205
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,492
I am so sorry, dear.

1206
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,495
I really had no idea we'd
done so many awful things.

1207
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,497
Hello.

1208
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,499
Hello.

1209
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,500
Ladies.

1210
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,001
Hell of an idea--

1211
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,003
Lock the customers in
till they buy something.

1212
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,504
Wonder if that work
with trucks?

1213
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,007
Oh, my god,
look at this place.

1214
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,008
Book city.

1215
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,509
You read all this?

1216
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,011
The bathroom's upstairs

1217
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,012
On the right.

1218
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,514
Oh...we haven't been up there.

1219
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,516
No!

1220
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,518
There's nothing up there to buy.

1221
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,019
Oh.
Oh.

1222
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,021
Well, we have a check

1223
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:35,025
All made out for you,
including tax at 7 1/2%.

1224
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,527
Oh, no, no, no.
It's 8 1/2.

1225
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,529
Maybe you're right.

1226
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,031
Who cares? You're done.

1227
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,032
Oh! thanks.

1228
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,033
Thank you.

1229
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,034
That's great.

1230
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,035
Happy wedding.

1231
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,036
Bye! Thanks.

1232
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,038
Let me help you.
Bye-bye, now.

1233
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,539
Bye!

1234
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,541
Bye-bye, ladies!

1235

Whoo! Black authors
up the Wahzoo.

1238
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,048
I read black authors, you know.

1239
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,550
Wilt Chamberlain book
changed my life.

1240
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,053
Heh heh heh heh heh!

1241
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,554
Oh, wait a second here.

1242
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,056
Maybe I don't have to go anymore.

1243
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,059
Nope, there it is!

1244
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,560
Little silvery feelin'.

1245
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,062
The call of the wild.

1246
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,064
# Wild thing #

1247
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,566
# You make my heart sing #

1248
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,572
# Wild thing #

1249
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,576
# You make my heart sing #

1250
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,079
# You make everything #

1251
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,081
# Groovy #

1252
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,106
Is this the guy?

1253
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,110
Is who what guy?

1254
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,112
The guy.

1255
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,615
The guy that was supposed
to be Zora's father but isn't,

1256
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,117
Because...you know.

1257
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,120
Yeah. That's
my husband Charles.

1258
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,621
Charlie.

1259
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,624
Looks nice.

1260
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,627
Was he nice?

1261
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,631
Yeah, he was nice.

1262
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,633
Never remarried?

1263
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,635
Tthh. no.

1264
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,136
I mean,

1265
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,638
What's the point?

1266
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,640
Yeah.

1267
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,141
Yeah, I'm divorced.

1268
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,142
Twice.

1269
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,647
Right now, I'm...
Living with someone.

1270
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,649
Mmm...

1271
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,651
Never had any children.

1272
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,654
Huh.

1273
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,157
That Zora, looks like a nice kid.

1274
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,661
Ohh, she's a great kid.

1275
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,163
I don't know what I
would've done without her.

1276
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,668
Family really is the way to go.

1277
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,672
I live to enjoy myself.

1278
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,183
Funny thing--sperm.

1279
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,690
Well, what do we got here?

1280
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,693
"Jesus was a black man."

1281
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,196
Well, hell, at least you
got yourself a point of view.

1282
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,699
Must be a real bummer
having a half-white kid.

1283
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,201
Fuck you.

1284
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,203
Apparently we already did that.

1285
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,205
You know what? Get out.

1286
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,707
For being such a free spirit,

1287
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,209
You are surprisingly uptight.

1288
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,212
You, not surprisingly,
are a pain in the ass.

1289
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,214
It turns out,
that I have a daughter

1290
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,715
That I'd never even heard about.

1291
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,718
You don't have a daughter.

1292
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,220
I have a daughter.
You have a car dealership.

1293
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,721
I thought we straightened
all this out.

1294
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,223
Fine by me.

1295
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,725
But are you sure
it's fine with her?

1296
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,226
She's the one
that hunted me out.

1297
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,728
Maybe she wants to see me.

1298
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,230
I don't think so.

1299
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,232
I was always good
at math and science.

1300
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,234
Maybe I had something 
to do with that part.

1301
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,735
You had nothing to do with it.

1302
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,738
Nothing. Do you understand me?

1303
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,740
I understand you, your highness.

1304
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,742
I can't talk to you anymore.

1305
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,244
It's ok. I'm outta here.

1306
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,245
Mm-hmm.

1307
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,747
Have a nice life.

1308
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:18,749
I will.

1309
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,761
Hi.

1310
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,262
Hi.

1311
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,265
Ok. What's up?

1312
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,767
You think he's my father?

1313
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:38,769
Look...

1314
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,271
All he was was some sperm

1315
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,273
With one motivated swimmer.

1316
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,774
That's all.

1317
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,779
I just wish I could've
asked him a few questions.

1318
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,283
Why? The man is so dumb,
what was he gonna tell you?

1319
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,785
Forget it. It's over.
Leave it alone.

1320
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,287
I know, ma, but you don't--

1321
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:01,791
Please. I really don't want
to talk about this anymore.

1322
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,795
Ok.

1323
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,798
[Sewing machine starts]

1324
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,800
Ma, just one thing.

1325
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,301
What?

1326
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,303
When you were alone with him,

1327
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,804
Did he say anything about me?

1328
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,309
Is it really that important to you?

1329
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,312

01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,676
Quite a family, huh, man?

2001
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,179
I mean, like mother
like daughter, huh?

2002
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,681
You know what I mean?

2003
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,183
You lay a hand on that girl,

2004
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,684
And I'll kill you personally.

2005
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,186
Whoa. What's it to you?

2006
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,689
I'll tell you what it is to me.

2007
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,190
She's my daughter.

2008
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,191
Daughter?

2009
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,192
Oh, hell.

2010
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,194
I bet you I'm late.

2011
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:27,695
Good night, Diego.

2012
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:33,501
[Door closes]

2013
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,003
Oh, I'm tired.

2014
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,509
So what did you do?

2015
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,011
What?

2016
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,012
You heard me, ma.

2017
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,014
What were you guys doing?

2018
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,516
Doing?

2019
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,518
Nothing.

2020
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,520
So that's why the house looks

2021
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,021
Like a cyclone hit it?

2022
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,522
What are you talking about?

2023
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,024
You told me to stay away from him,

2024
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,025
But you can do

2025
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,526
Whatever you want with him?

2026
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,029
Zora--

2027
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,530
This is my father, ma,

2028
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,532
And he needs me, not you.

2029
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,535
My whole entire life,

2030
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,037
You brought me up with this fantasy,

2031
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,038
This ghost of Charlie,

2032
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,540
Then I finally bring
home something real,

2033
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,544
And you want to take
that away from me!

2034
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,045
What are you...

2035
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:19,547
What is going on?

2036
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,051
Ma, I wanted this
for me, not you.

2037
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,552
When this doesn't work out

2038
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,054
Between the two of you,

2039
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,056
Where is that gonna leave me?

2040
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,578
Sorry I got hung up, sweetheart.

2041
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,079
Oh, hi, Hal.

2042
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,081
You remember Bruce, don't you?

2043
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:56,084
Bruce gave me a lift home.

2044
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,588
Sure. Well, thank you, Bruce.

2045
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,089
No biggie.

2046
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:02,590
Hey, have a seat, man.

2047
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,092
Where were you?

2048
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,095
Oh, I was just out driving around.

2049
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,097
I lost track of time, honey.

2050
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,098
Oh.

2051
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,599
I got to cruise.

2052
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,102
Oh, no, no. You got to?

2053
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,103
Yeah. I got to.

2054
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,604
I hear that. I'm beat.

2055
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:17,606
Hey, the night's

2056
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,107
Just starting to cook.

2057
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,108
I'm going to hear a new band--

2058
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,609
Stinky Nightgown.

2059
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,611
Stinky Nightgown?

2060
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,112
Oh, you like 'em?

2061
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,114
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2062
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,115
We got all their stuff.

2063
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:28,116
They're gonna record

2064
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,618
As soon as the drummer
gets out of rehab.

2065
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,622
Hey, you dudes want
to hang with us tonight?

2066
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:34,623
No problem.

2067
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,624
Hey, why don't you go, sweetheart?

2068
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,126
I'll bet you'll enjoy that.

2069
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,128
Oh, wow. You don't mind?

2070
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,629
Hell, no. I want you to go.

2071
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,132
Thank you, sweetie.

2072
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,134
Let's fly.

2073
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,636
Oh. Have one of those sex dreams

2074
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,138
About me tonight, ok?

2075
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:51,639
Ok.

2076
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,141
You're welcome.

2077
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,144
He had this dream where
he was a big, stupid dog

2078
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,146
And I was a little smart dog...

2079
01:21:58,647 --> 01:21:59,648
I like dogs.

2080
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:00,649
Arf, arf.

2081
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:05,153
# Why #

2082
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:08,656
# Why #

2083
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:12,160
# Do angels fall #

2084
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,663
# Are they letting go of heaven? #

2085
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:19,167
# Are they letting go of heaven #

2086
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:25,674
# Or learning well how to fly? #

2087
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:30,678
# Hey-hey #

2088
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,682
# Hey #

2089
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:37,685
# A lastin' love #

2090
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:41,690
# Is trouble out the door #

2091
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,693
# Trouble out the door #

2092
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:51,199
# And sweeter, oh, here today #

2093
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:59,207
# I know I don't walk on water #

2094
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,209
# Will forgive myself #

2095
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:05,713
# For the way I've been for so long #

2096
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:13,721
# Oh, I know I don't walk on water #

2097
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:20,228
# But I do believe love is the only color #

2098
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,230
# Hey #

2099
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,241
10% off sticker, Charlie.

2100
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:35,243
Hey, everybody.

2101
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,744
Hey, my favorite chief.

2102
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:37,746
Good morning.

2103
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,749
Oh, my god. What a beautiful scarf.

2104
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,251
You gave it to me.
Christmas '83.

2105
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:45,253
Did I? You know something, Alberta?

2106
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,754
You work too hard. Take the day off.

2107
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:47,756
Really?

2108
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,258
Do it now. Run!

2109
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,759
I'm feeling good.

2110
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,132
Great.

2111
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,134
Hi.

2112
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,635
Hi.

2113
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,142
I was thinking about last night.

2114
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,145
Oh, lord. Me, too.

2115
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:13,148
I'm, uh, I'm talking about Zora.

2116
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,651
She was really...

2117
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,153
Very upset about...

2118
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,658
This. Us. Uh...

2119
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,159
Why?

2120
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,162
Well, just because nobody's ever come

2121
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,664
Between us before.

2122
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:31,666
Well, sweetheart, I--

2123
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,170
I don't want to come
between you and Zora.

2124
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,671
Well, I know that,

2125
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,674
But, uh, you have.

2126
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,178
Well, how?

2127
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,679
Wait--uh, wait a minute.

2128
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,681
What did she say?

2129
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,683
It doesn't matter what she said.

2130
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,685
This would be easier
if you were a parent.

2131
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,686
Then I could explain it.

2132
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,689
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2133
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,190
What is this?

2134
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,194
Something feels really off here.

2135
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,196
Well...

2136
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,698
Look, Zora's really upset,

2137
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,700
And you couldn't see her upset

2138
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,701
For any longer

2139
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:07,702
Than you could take it.

2140
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:08,703
This is as long

2141
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,704
As I could take it for.

2142
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,707
All right.

2143
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,208
Let me talk to her, all right?

2144
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,212
What are you gonna say?

2145
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,214
Huh?

2146
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:20,215
You gonna explain--

2147
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,216
What you gonna say?

2148
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:23,718
Hey, what's the big deal?

2149
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,220
Come on, Hal, what was this?

2150
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,222
This was nothing but some kind of...

2151
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,224
Some kind of what, Sarah?

2152
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,226
Well, just some sort of...

2153
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,227
You know, attraction,

2154
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,229
Some...weird old attraction.

2155
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,730
Let's just get out of it

2156
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,232
Before somebody gets hurt.

2157
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,734
All right.

2158
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,236
Oh. Ok. I see what this is.

2159
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:43,738
What--

2160
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,740
You can go on with your
little speech if you want,

2161
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,241
But this is bullshit.

2162
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,743
What do you mean, this is bullshit?

2163
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:51,746
Don't give me your
motherly crap about Zora.

2164
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,247
What's going on is you got scared.

2165
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:55,250
What do you mean--Wait a minute.

2166
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,251
You know what? Just back off.

2167

Oh, yeah, right.

2168

Oh, right.
Just back off, right?

2169
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,756
Walk away, make your life easy.

Every god damn thing, don't you?

2172
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,262
You can even have a kid
without meeting a man.

2173
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,764
All you gotta do
is put pictures on the wall

2174
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:10,765
And call it daddy!

2175
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,267
I got news for you.
It doesn't work that way!

2176
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,771
I got news for you, too.
Stay away from us!

2177
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,272
That's what we both want.

2178

Just stay away from us.

2179

Sir, Sarah Mathews, please.

Are you family?

2214
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:27,902
This is her daughter.

01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,904
She came into E.R. this morning.

2216

We're sustaining her vital signs.

She has a concussion,
and she's still unconscious.

We operated on her leg
this afternoon.

Mr. Jackson,
Ms. Mathews,

At this time we ask
the family and friends

2224
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,942
To make a blood donation.

2225

Honey, why don't you go first?

2226
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,445
Come on. I'll take you.

2227
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,448
It's just right down the hall.

2228
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,451
Don't worry. It's gonna be ok.

01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:26,460
Did you see that doll
in here right before you?

2230

Mm-mm-mm. Coffee with just
the right touch of cream.

Whoo, was she hot.

2234
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,971
Her butt was a 10. You saw her?

2235
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:37,972
She's my daughter.

2236
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:40,475
And the interesting thing
is she's ab-negative.

2237
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,977
That's not very common.

2238

Well, she's an unusual girl.

2239

01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,521
And then...

2246
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,525
Well, I guess it's just
what you're afraid of--

2247
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,527
That you'll--you'll yell at someone

2248
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,529
And fight with them,

2249
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,531
And then they'll die or whatever.

2250
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,532
I know.

2251
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,534

Which fight got her run over.

2254
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:45,540
One thing we do know is,

2255
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,043
Neither one of us can
ever fight with her again,

2256

she's so damn good at it.

Where did we go wrong?

I mean, we were going
to buy a dog together!

A terrier...

2294

Or maybe--maybe a lab.

Boy, I sure am lucky

2296
01:32:37,368 --> 01:32:38,869

I know you will!

2314

Maybe not right away,

2315
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:17,407
But in the long run this is best.

2316

You know, someday
I think you'll thank me.

2317

01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:05,172
Go ahead. Go ahead.

2330
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,173
Ma.

2331
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,674
What's going on?

2332
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,677
I won a Westinghouse science award.

2333
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,679
They only give out 10 each year.

2334
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,180
That's 10 in the whole country.

2335
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,681
Yes, and the principal's
gonna give it to me

2336
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,183
Next week at graduation.

2337
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,184
Isn't that something?

2338
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:19,686
I'm telling you, This is our baby.

2339
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,188
Our baby's getting this award.

2340
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,190
Yes, they'll give me
a trophy or something,

2341
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,193
And they'll pay for
my whole college tuition.

2342
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:27,695
Congratulations, sweetheart.

2343
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:28,695
That's wonderful.

2344
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,197
Thank God.

2345
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,201
How about that, huh?

2346
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:37,704
What's wrong?

2347
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:39,707
Well, I just--

2348
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,209
I've just come from
the hematology lab.

2349
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,211
Ooh. Why?

2350
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,214
Well, that's where they
keep all our blood.

2351
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,216
You're type "A," Sarah.

2352
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:52,219
Sweetheart, they want you
to give some more blood.

2353
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:55,722
You're AB-negative,
And that's kind of rare.

2354
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,726
And they took some of mine, too.

2355
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:00,227
And i'm "O."

2356
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:06,734
You couldn't be.

2357
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:11,238
They did it twice, honey,

2358
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:12,739
And i'm "O."

2359
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:16,743
Wait a minute.

2360
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,245
What are you sayin'?

2361
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:21,749
Well, it turns out

2362
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,751
That I'm not her father.

2363
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,264
But I got the name from mom's file.

2364
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,267
They had <i>your</i> name
at the sperm bank.

2365
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:41,768
I know that, sweetheart.

2366
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,270
I called.

2367
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,272
I talked to the fella

2368
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:46,273
That runs the place.

2369
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:48,775
He said the files were done by hand

2370
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,277
Up until about 10 years ago

2371
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,279
When they...

2372
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:53,280
Sent 'em overseas

2373
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,781
To be put on computer disks.

2374
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,284
When they came back,
they were messed up.

2375
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,785
Well, I jus--

2376
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,789
How can they do that to people?

2377
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,792
I'm afraid that the most

2378
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:06,794
You're ever gonna know

2379
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,295
Is that the donors came

2380
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,297
From the university.

2381
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,799
Mostly science majors.

2382
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,807
You're not my father.

2383
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:23,310
No.

2384
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:31,818
I made a mistake.

2385
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:35,322
I made a horrible, horrible mistake.

2386
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,332
Should I go talk to her?

2387
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,833
Mm-mmm. No.

2388
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,836
She just--she just has to be alone

2389
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:49,837
For a while.

2390
01:36:58,345 --> 01:36:59,846
Well.

2391
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,852
Well.

2392
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:07,354
I guess you probably want to go back

2393
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:08,855
To work or something.

2394
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,861
You probably need your rest, huh?

2395
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:17,865
Yeah.

2396
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,870
Ok, then.

2397
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:26,874
I, uh...

2398
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,880
I don't think I thanked you

2399
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:37,384
For being there for Zora and...me.

2400
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:39,886
I wanted to be there.

2401
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:49,897
I got to go to Las Vegas tomorrow.

2402
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:52,900
Ahem. I have a dealer's convention.

2403
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,902
Sounds fun.

2404
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:57,404
It's work.

2405
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:00,907
I'll call you when I get back.

2406
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:05,412
Ok.

2407
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:11,919
Sarah, I'm sorry.

2408
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:18,925
Me, too.

2409
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:46,954
Hey! Miss Westinghouse award!

2410
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:47,955
# Go, Zora #

2411
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:49,456
# Put your thing down #

2412
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:50,457
# Congratulations #

2413
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:51,458
# You won a Westinghouse #

2414
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:52,459
So what'd you get?

2415
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,461
Like free light bulbs and stoves

2416
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,463
And microwaves and shit?

2417

2418
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,467
Thanks.

Hey, what's wrong?

2420
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:06,974
He's not my father, Tea.

2421
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:21,988
And, you know, the worst part...

2422
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,992
Is I wanted a dad.

2423
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,997
And he was my dad.

2424
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,000
Come here.

2425
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:39,005
I'm sorry, baby.

Hi, mom!

2439
01:40:22,966 --> 01:40:24,417
Um...

2440
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:28,422
I guess the cool thing
about giving this award is

2441
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,924
That I get to give it to my friend.

2442

Well, my best friend, actually.

to make their heads spin

Just like she did ours.

2447
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,439
There are certain people

2448
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:47,941
That just bring out 
the best in others,

2449
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,444

I ain't one of them peoples.

But Zora Mathews is,

2452
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:00,787
And that's why I take great pleasure

2453
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,290
In presenting this Westinghouse award

2454

If I've done well in school,

2457
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:35,823
It's because I got 
the message at home
