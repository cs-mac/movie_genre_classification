00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:05,054
Episode 19

3
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:10,078
This program has received production support
from Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA).

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,930
This drama spans the first year of the Korean War,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,091
which broke out on June 25, 1950 and raged for three years.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,099
Most of the events of the Korean War
 have been dramatically recreated

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,200
and do not reflect any actual individuals or troops.

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:25,744
1950, war-torn and bitterly cold,
passed into the new year,

9
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,108
and yet, spring came once again.

10
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,434
Contrary to the expectations
that war would soon come to an end,

11
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:34,525
intense battles unfolded near the 38th parallel,

12
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:37,471
and the war continued mercilessly.

13
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,897
2nd Company, who spent the
winter recovering at Dae Jeon Hospital,

14
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,260
braced themselves for battle as they were deployed

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,376
on the front lines near the outskirts of Seoul.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,756
Bombing within position!

17
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,678
Everyone take cover!!

18
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:01,841
<i>Because I wanted to live,</i>

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,068
<i>I did it because I wanted to live.</i>

20
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:05,432
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:06,704
<i>It's me.</i>

22
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>It's me, Su Yeon.</i>

23
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,010
Su Yeon.

24
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:24,707
Su Yeon.

25
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:27,079
Su Yeon!

26
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,219
Forgive me.

27
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,288
Su Yeon.

28
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:48,132
<i>Shin Tae Ho, I'm going to get discharged.</i>

29
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:52,675
<i>Lee Jang Woo, can you really abandon your Company?</i>

30
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:58,048
<i>Su Yeon is waiting in Yeongchon.</i>

31
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:07,990
Attention!

32
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,781
Salute Captain!

33
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,132
At attention!

34
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:36,985
Aboard vehicle!

35
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,260
Aboard!

36
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,209
Hey you punks!

37
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,131
Fight fast and smart!

38
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,333
If I hear rumors you guys are moving sluggishly,

39
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:17,015
I'm going to rush out there and give you hell!

40
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:18,327
Oh Jong Ki!

41
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:21,769
You just take care of yourself and live well!

42
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,831
What? Oh Jong Ki?!

43
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,560
Hyungnim! Stay healthy!

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,175
I'm gonna miss you.

45
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,237
Stay healthy, big Hyungnim!

46
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,175
So long Jong Ki Hyung!

47
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,881
Stay healthy!

48
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:35,819
Stay healthy!

49
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,982
Stay healthy!

50
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,377
Stay healthy!

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,266
Bye!

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,654
You sons of bitches!

53
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,144
Don't die.

54
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,919
You gotta stay alive.

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,454
[May 1st, 1951, near Paju.]

56
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:31,503
This is Magpie 1, come in Black Kite.

57
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,085
Hey.

58
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,344
It's 1st Platoon Leader.

59
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:45,822
This is the Captain.

60
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,310
It's the enemy field artillery corp.

61
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,969
Judging from the size of the camouflage net,

62
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,651
it looks like they have at least 20 cannons.

63
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,690
Have you seen them with your naked eyes?

64
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,341
- I haven't been able to get closer.
- What kind of shoddy recon is that?

65
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:04,086
Don't you even know that the Chinese
soldiers are using logs to masquerade as cannons?!

66
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,830
Approach closer and confirm
whether they're real or not and report!

67
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,101
We don't have time.

68
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:10,334
If they are real,
as soon as they reload their ammunition,

69
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,869
they'll fire at our troops.

70
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:15,086
Hey 1st Platoon leader,
are you the Company Commander?!

71
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,505
If you receive an order, you carry it out!

72
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,636
Over!

73
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,334
What did he say?

74
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:27,358
So, did the Captain tell us to return?

75
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:36,433
We're going to approach closer until we
can confirm their fire power with our naked eye.

76
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,565
Excuse me?

77
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,835
We should relay the recon report to the superiors.

78
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:47,688
What?

79
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,827
If it is as Lieutenant Shin says,
not only our Company,

80
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,091
but the main force of the battalion
behind us will be in danger.

81
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,479
I think at least reporting it for now …

82
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,731
Hey Kim Duk Shil.

83
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:59,088
You become a Lieutenant a mere month ago,

84
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,661
and you're giving me advice?

85
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,936
Yes, I'm sorry.

86
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:13,060
If a perennial platoon leader
and a newbie lieutenant spouts nonsense,

87
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,334
did you think that I, as the Company
Commander would say, "Yeah sure, let's do that"?

88
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,597
Listen carefully.

89
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:23,241
The Company moves as I, the Commander orders.

90
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:27,142
Impudent punks, who are you trying to teach?

91
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,196
Who am I?

92
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:35,425
You think I got this Captain
rank by just farting around?

93
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:38,681
From the bloody stench
of the Nakdong River front line,

94
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,208
to the near-dead Pyeongyang,

95
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:45,022
don't you know I'm a hero of heroes
 who fought all sorts of hardships?!

96
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:51,870
2nd Company!

97
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,358
Move out!

98
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,912
Is Captain Lee Jang Woo really not coming?

99
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:41,501
Our real Commander of 2nd Company.

100
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:45,280
Is that guy really going
to continue to lead our Company?

101
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,419
Why did a guy that left come back?

102
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:50,132
He needs more field experience to get promoted.

103
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,466
Be quiet.

104
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:55,045
If Captain Han Young Min hears, he'll get pissed.

105
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,920
I really don't like him.

106
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,750
Where do you think you are, pouting like that?

107
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,851
He'll hear you, pal.

108
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,339
Let him hear me.

109
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,923
But, what's happened to Captain Lee Jang Woo?

110
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:07,028
Did he really abandon us and get discharged?

111
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,900
Do you think I'd know?

112
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,921
Captain! What should we do?!

113
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,874
Captain!

114
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:24,801
Hide.

115
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,902
We gotta take cover!

116
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,484
Take cover!

117
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,391
2nd Company!

118
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,894
Disperse!!

119
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,693
Disperse your platoons!

120
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,118
3rd Platoon, disperse! Disperse!

121
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,901
Disperse! Disperse!

122
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,689
Captain!

123
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,605
Lieutenant, the Company is
getting fired on and is retreating.

124
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:20,571
What's the damage?

125
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:22,308
I don't know the details yet,

126
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,478
but I think the Captain has been killed.

127
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,630
Let's move.

128
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,491
Get down.

129
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:40,607
We're totally isolated in
the enemy territory, aren't we?

130
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:51,711
It looks like the Chinese
army have already seized this area.

131
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:55,612
There's no route to escape.

132
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,806
In the jaws of death like this,
I really wish he were here.

133
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,942
Who do you mean?

134
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,105
Who do you think?

135
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,089
Captain Lee Jang Woo.

136
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,557
The Lord is my shepherd,

137
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,619
I shall not want.

138
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,983
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

139
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,883
He leads me beside still waters;

140
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,395
he restores my soul.

141
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:15,855
Are you leaving now?

142
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,088
I'm going to regiment headquarters
and report for discharge,

143
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,902
and then I'll go to the reserves.

144
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:24,973
You made the right decision.

145
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,275
Forget all about this battlefield,

146
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,483
and start a new life.

147
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,498
You take care of yourself too, Sergeant.

148
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:42,025
And do something about that temper of yours.

149
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,649
That kid says she's going
to keep me as a brother forever.

150
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,442
Even if I have to force myself,
I'm going to pretend to be good.

151
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,969
But, weren't you the
one who demoted me to private?

152
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,520
Now that we're parting,
what's with the Sergeant, Lee Jang Woo?

153
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:12,473
2nd Company's Senior Sergeant
will always only be you, Hyungnim.

154
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,686
Captain Lee.

155
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,794
I almost didn't get to say goodbye.

156
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,167
I heard you went out to support a field hospital.

157
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,461
I have to pack some medicine and go back out.

158
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,313
The situation on the front lines has worsened.

159
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,851
Ah, I shouldn't have said anything.

160
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:50,386
Please stay healthy, Captain Lee.

161
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,696
You too, Captain Yoon.

162
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,251
By the way,

163
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:01,320
I have a request.

164
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:07,215
If you see Lieutenant Shin,

165
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,673
please tell him to at least write me.

166
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,409
How can someone be so heartless?

167
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:17,688
I'm on my way to report for discharge.

168
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:20,789
I know.

169
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,882
I just thought I'd ask, in case.

170
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:25,284
If you see him, just give him the message.

171
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:27,067
Then …

172
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,926
Who do we have here?

173
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,482
Lee Jang Woo!

174
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,637
Have you been well, sir?

175
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:53,343
What's going on?
Shouldn't you be with the division about now?

176
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,337
How's 2nd Company doing?

177
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,771
It's chaos.

178
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:03,903
The Company Commander was killed,
the bulk of the Company is retreating,

179
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,466
and 1st Platoon has been
caught isolated in enemy territory.

180
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,203
Though, it doesn't really
have anything to do with you anymore.

181
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,288
- Then …
- 1st Platoon means …

182
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,164
You're asking because you don't know?

183
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,577
It's Shin Tae Ho.

184
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:53,555
1st Platoon.

185
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,842
1st Platoon.

186
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,927
<i>Magpie1, this is Black Kite Commander.</i>

187
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,911
<i>Magpie1, respond.</i>

188
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,041
Isn't that the Captain's voice?

189
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,304
<i>Magpie1, this is Black Kite Commander.</i>

190
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,242
<i>Magpie1! Come in!</i>

191
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:11,250
This is Magpie1 Leader.
Come in, Black Kite Commander.

192
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,180
Shin Tae Ho,

193
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,970
it's Captain Lee Jang Woo.

194
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,725
<i>Do you hear me, Shin Tae Ho?</i>

195
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,291
It's Lee Jang Woo.

196
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,453
Captain!

197
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,895
Oh my God.

198
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:33,489
Is it really Captain Lee Jang Woo?

199
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,613
Is this a dream or real?

200
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:38,419
<i>Report your location.</i>

201
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,970
Map.

202
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,106
Our current position is in the
vicinity of Charlie Hotel 3356 3675.

203
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,088
Homing to the right,
the enemy's infantry battalion is on the move.

204
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,629
The battery is front and center.

205
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,645
We're breaking through to the right, immediately.

206
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,459
I'm connecting to base.

207
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,451
Immediately now,
we're breaking through to the right.

208
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,312
We're moving.

209
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,335
Recon team!
We're moving to the right.

210
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:26,486
Run!

211
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,416
To the right. Hurry!

212
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,303
To the right, to the right. Run!

213
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:48,528
<i>Shin Tae Ho, we're 2nd Company.</i>

214
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:52,218
<i>You will absolutely live and we'll meet again.</i>

215
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:54,810
<i>Don't stop and keep running!</i>

216
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,841
Don't stop. Run.

217
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,252
Keep running!

218
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,576
<i>Shin Tae Ho, run.</i>

219
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,165
<i>2nd Company and I are waiting.</i>

220
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:04,731
<i>Don't stop. Run!</i>

221
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:10,490
<i>2nd Company!</i>

222
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,397
<i>It won't be long now.</i>

223
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:13,839
<i>Don't stop, keep running!</i>

224
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:36,608
Keep running!
The Captain and 2nd Company are waiting!

225
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:50,648
Get down!

226
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,407
Lieutenant, it's our troops.

227
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:10,600
We've been saved!

228
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,755
Here, here, here!

229
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,996
Here!

230
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,842
In Je!

231
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,688
You get caught isolated in enemy territory.

232
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,936
You've lost all your military
discipline since I last saw you!

233
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,870
We were on our way back to camp.

234
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,149
You didn't have to come back on our account.

235
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:29,248
Now it really feels like 2nd Company! Doesn't it?

236
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:33,573
Saying the same thing over will just make
our mouths hurt. Do we really even need to say it?

237
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
I was waiting.

238
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,498
My boys,

239
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,684
I kept seeing them in my head.

240
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:52,868
I couldn't just go.

241
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,884
Because they're you're 
Company Captain Lee Jang Woo.

242
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,071
Captain!

243
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:12,148
Captain!

244
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,788
As the Battalion Commander,
this is my final order.

245
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:51,207
At the same time,

246
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,533
as Regiment Commander, it will be my first order.

247
00:24:56,882 --> 00:24:59,518
2nd Company will move immediately to Yeongchon,

248
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,200
and build up defense preparations.

249
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:08,034
You're going to your homeland, 2nd Company.

250
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,816
To your hometown, Yeongchon.

251
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:21,251
Homeward!

252
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,933
Homeward!

253
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,549
I see it! I see it!

254
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:43,797
What is it?

255
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,455
What do they see?

256
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,472
It's still the same. That tree!

257
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:50,635
That tree is the first to welcome us.

258
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,512
Stop running!

259
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,218
Hooray!

260
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,737
Hooray!

261
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,862
This day has finally come.

262
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:26,986
I occasionally had nightmares.

263
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:33,256
This field turned into ruins,

264
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:36,729
and the tree collapsed.

265
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:43,729
It seemed so real, it was terrifying.

266
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:02,983
I never imagined I'd be returning
to an unchanged Yeongchon.

267
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:09,872
I made a promise to someone under this tree.

268
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,632
It was a promise of marriage.

269
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,251
I see.

270
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:29,034
When I look back, I wonder if it was all a dream.

271
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,119
Still, for some reason,

272
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:41,066
it seems fitting for promises to
be made under this tree, don't you think?

273
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,973
Hyungnim,

274
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:56,249
is it all right to call you that from now on?

275
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:00,078
No!

276
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:04,950
When's your birthday?

277
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,438
June, 1927.

278
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:10,066
June.

279
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:12,669
Then, I suppose it's okay.

280
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:14,374
Because mine's in March.

281
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:15,948
Fine.

282
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:17,623
Call me Hyungnim from now on.

283
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,480
I don't think I can.

284
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,790
I take back the Hyungnim.

285
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:24,178
Since we were born in the same year,

286
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:26,178
I think it's better we become friends.

287
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,430
Do you know how long the days are in May and June?

288
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:36,376
In three months, do you know how
many times a fort can be won and lost?

289
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:42,882
All right.

290
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:45,052
I'll regard you as Hyungnim from now on.

291
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:55,660
Thanks.

292
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,926
And, I'm sorry.

293
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:06,236
If you're sorry,
then have a good life with Su Yeon.

294
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,104
And be a good Hyungnim to me.

295
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,938
Little Brother, can I ask you a favor?

296
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:39,487
If, if by chance,

297
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,202
something happens to me,

298
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,885
look after Su Yeon for me.

299
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,438
You can do that for me, can't you?

300
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,128
Now that we're in a position
to wait for the end of the war

301
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:59,500
and hope for happy days,

302
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,903
why are you asking that all of a sudden?

303
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,545
That's why I said "if."

304
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:12,607
Can you make that promise?

305
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:18,092
Don't worry, I'll look after her for you.

306
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,348
Thanks.

307
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,445
Then, you've promised.

308
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:26,468
<i>Captain!</i>

309
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,468
Lieutenant Shin!

310
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:32,164
Come quickly. The sun's going down on us.

311
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:34,412
Okay, we're coming.

312
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:45,147
Aigoo, wait for me!

313
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:48,814
Geez, what's up with that?

314
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,323
Wait for me!

315
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:30,337
Baby,

316
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,781
do you know who's come?

317
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:37,580
Your dad has come to meet us.

318
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,363
Your dad.

319
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:18,228
Su Yeon.

320
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,502
Hello, Hyungsoonim*. (*Hyungnim's wife.)

321
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,791
Captain, no matter what,
you'll spend tonight out of the barracks.

322
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:08,640
What?

323
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:14,671
Give them to me.

324
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,693
We'll go there first.

325
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,274
2nd Company!

326
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:22,328
Yes, sir!

327
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,111
We're headed to our barracks immediately!

328
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,321
Yes, sir!

329
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:43,744
You came.

330
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:46,751
Have you been well, Su Yeon?

331
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:52,490
Our baby too?

332
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:59,311
Baby, Daddy's kept his promise.

333
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,340
He came back.

334
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:06,503
You should say hello.

335
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:17,502
This little guy is kicking me.

336
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,595
The baby's really strong.

337
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:22,665
I'm sure he's a boy and he's just like his dad.

338
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,382
So pretty.

339
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,057
My baby's mother.

340
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:08,677
Are you crying?

341
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:11,014
No.

342
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,184
My heart,

343
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:16,734
my heart is laughing.

344
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,244
Right. From now on, we laugh.

345
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:29,271
Okay.

346
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,015
I will.

347
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:35,628
Look.

348
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:40,385
I'm laughing now.

349
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:17,532
Su Yeon, I'm not dreaming right now, am I?

350
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,695
You didn't know? We're in a dream.

351
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:24,621
A dream we'll never wake from.

352
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:28,838
So, don't worry.

353
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:44,504
So then, before the war, 2nd Company lived here?

354
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:49,842
It's a long ways away.
It's a really long way away from Daegu.

355
00:38:50,524 --> 00:38:52,230
Let's see, let's see.

356
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:57,195
This was my spot.

357
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,492
This was Hong Ki's.

358
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:06,043
And this was Ju Hwan's.

359
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,880
Those bastards.

360
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,184
Don't cry.

361
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:24,463
Hong Ki and Ju Hwan are gone,
but you have me and Go Man Yong.

362
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,998
That's right.

363
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,595
We'll use these spots now.

364
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:34,447
Sitting in for Hong Ki and Ju Hwan
will be Park Dal Mun and Go Man Yong.

365
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,726
Aigoo, it's all good.

366
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,726
Aigoo, it's all good.

367
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:04,184
[Captain Yoon Sam Soo]

368
00:40:36,169 --> 00:40:38,324
<i>I'm not speaking as your Captain,
but as your hyung!</i>

369
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,278
<i>You have to be cold, Tae Ho.</i>

370
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:41,828
<i>Cold and unemotional.</i>

371
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,620
<i>How can this Captain die, leaving our Tae Ho?</i>

372
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:13,034
<i>Hyungnim, I think I can
truly become a soldier now.</i>

373
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:15,468
<i>One like you, Hyungnim.</i>

374
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,973
<i>For the rest of my life, as a soldier,</i>

375
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:23,539
<i>protecting family and loved ones,</i>

376
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:27,289
<i>I will offer up my life.</i>

377
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,877
Ahh, gently.

378
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,411
Now, the left arm.

379
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,807
You're dirty!

380
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,338
Oh, Su Yeon, that hurts.

381
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,981
You're going to take off all my skin.

382
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,214
What do you mean that hurts?

383
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:08,481
A Company Commander can't even tolerate this?

384
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,597
See, you should have
at least kept yourself washed.

385
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,062
I'm standing out on a live-or-die
battlefield with bullets flying.

386
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:18,305
When do I have time to wash?

387
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:25,204
There will always be some excuse.

388
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:27,484
A magpie is likely to call you Hyungnim.

389
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,546
Ooh, look at this murky water!

390
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:34,925
What are you trying to see, embarrassing me?

391
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,404
Huh?

392
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:38,466
- What? 
- Where are you going?

393
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,605
- Come here! 
- What are you trying to look at?

394
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,822
Come here, I'm trying to wash you!

395
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,566
Are you not going to come out?

396
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:48,923
Come out!

397
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:50,969
Hey!

398
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:52,551
Lee Jang Woo!

399
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,353
Oh.

400
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:00,338
Jang Woo.

401
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:04,415
Lee Jang Woo.

402
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:14,996
Come out!

403
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:22,752
What's the matter?

404
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:24,643
Does it hurt?

405
00:43:39,857 --> 00:43:43,407
Being in this room makes me think of long ago.

406
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:44,973
Me too.

407
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:48,120
The time I snuck a peak
when you were taking a bath.

408
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:54,088
Back then, if I were the young master, I probably
wouldn't have let me get away with that either.

409
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,716
A servant boy daring to set
my eyes on such a pretty little lady.

410
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,475
Right?

411
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,915
Does it hurt?

412
00:44:06,035 --> 00:44:07,140
Still?

413
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,396
No.

414
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:13,675
I'm sorry, about this scar.

415
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,513
I always feel bad about it.

416
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:21,784
Come here.

417
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:26,247
This isn't a scar.

418
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:27,829
It's a medal.

419
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,566
A medal I received in my fight
to be with you since I was young.

420
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,675
Right, it's a medal.

421
00:44:41,865 --> 00:44:44,190
It seems like it's been such a long time,

422
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:47,736
but it's been just a year.

423
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:53,395
Yes, it's felt like a really long time.

424
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:58,130
Su Hyeok Oppa, Su Hee,

425
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:00,579
your father,

426
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:03,029
and our baby ...

427
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:06,673
They all departed,

428
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,721
and only the two of us remain.

429
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:15,830
No, the three of us.

430
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,023
Shall we lay down?

431
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,662
What should we name our baby?

432
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,642
Il Nam. Or if it's a daughter Il Soon? (Il = One)

433
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,107
Oh! That's too corny.

434
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:47,367
What are you talking about?

435
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:50,049
We're going to have about 10 kids,

436
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:51,615
so we have to make the names easy.

437
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:54,003
That way the kids can remember the names.

438
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:59,217
Il Nam, Yi Soon, Sam Nam, Sa Soon, 
(Yi = two, Sam = three, Sa = four)

439
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:02,659
Oh Nam, Yuk Soon, Chil Nam 
(Oh = five, Yuk = Six, Chil = seven)

440
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:04,272
I like refined names.

441
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:05,822
C'mon, listen …

442
00:46:05,942 --> 00:46:09,264
Il Nam, Yi Soon, Sam Nam, Sa Soon …

443
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:12,070
No, I don't like them, I don't like them!

444
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,644
Oh Nam, Yuk Soon, Chil Nam …

445
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,324
One, two!

446
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,293
One, two!

447
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,448
One, two!

448
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:25,371
One, two!

449
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:27,091
One, two!

450
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:28,940
One, two!

451
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,630
One, two!

452
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:31,932
- One, two! 
- Park Dal Mun.

453
00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:32,909
Take it easy.

454
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:36,211
No way. If we want to plant all these,
there isn't even time to take a piss.

455
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,846
Aigoo, as if we don't
already know you're a farmer.

456
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,259
One, two!

457
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:43,948
- One, two! 
- 3rd Platoon Leader!

458
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,176
Yes, sir!

459
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,091
Wanna take me on?

460
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:49,238
Excuse me?

461
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:50,827
You don't remember?

462
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:53,129
What we did last year during the rice-planting?

463
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,919
Of course I remember.

464
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:57,527
I believe you lost back then.

465
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:01,739
The losing platoon buys the makgeolli*.
(*unfiltered rice wine).

466
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:03,427
3rd Platoon!

467
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:05,378
Everyone gather up!

468
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,840
1st Platoon, gather up!

469
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:11,862
I'm not sure we can win
with such a feeble horseman!

470
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:14,572
Why do you talk so much, huh?

471
00:47:14,692 --> 00:47:15,888
Don't you worry!

472
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:18,954
When I'm on horseback, I fly!

473
00:47:20,222 --> 00:47:23,597
Lieutenant Woo Bum Jin was
the best horseman in this game.

474
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:25,610
Right, he was.

475
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,128
Who was he?

476
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:29,469
Was Lieutenant Woo part of our Company?

477
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:32,952
Yeah, when the North came down with their tanks,

478
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,662
he died in a suicide charge.

479
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,769
It's not the tanks, it's the wheels!

480
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:42,776
Aim for …

481
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:44,030
With bravery.

482
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,275
That's right, with bravery.

483
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,542
I'm sorry.

484
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:49,524
I'm sorry for bringing it up.

485
00:47:49,644 --> 00:47:52,237
So then, just leave it up to me!

486
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:55,319
In the spirit of Lieutenant Wu Bum Jin,

487
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,208
I'll take you right down!

488
00:47:57,548 --> 00:47:59,530
The losing team buys the makgeolli!

489
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,605
And it's 20 laps around the drill field!

490
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,677
Get your head in the game!

491
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:28,281
They say you notice the missing
people more than the ones present.

492
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:30,929
A lot of people have departed over the year.

493
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:32,522
Yes.

494
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,693
Lieutenant Woo always beat me at this game.

495
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:41,107
Even if I asked him to give me a break,

496
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:42,656
he never did.

497
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,125
Even as I think of how
thankful I am to have survived,

498
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:58,547
sometimes, I'm overwhelmed with feeling guilty,

499
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:02,505
wondering if it's really
okay to laugh like this so easily.

500
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,974
Wondering if our departed
comrades would be saddened.

501
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:17,464
Happiness and sadness are
all left to the people that remain.

502
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,664
We can only do all we can to survive,
even when we are feeling guilty.

503
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,913
It's only now that we've been able to laugh.

504
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:32,691
I'm sure no one in heaven is protesting.

505
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,240
Your team lost fair and square, 
so go and get the makgeolli.

506
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:47,515
- Right.
- Park Dal Mun, get to it!

507
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:50,114
You said you fly on horseback,
what a bunch of crap!

508
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,368
Oh look at this!

509
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,830
We lose because the horse is weak,
and you're trying to blame me?

510
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,379
Aigoo, really!

511
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:56,668
Hey, hey, hey!

512
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:58,185
You guys can quarrel amongst yourselves,

513
00:49:58,305 --> 00:49:59,827
but go and get the makgeolli.

514
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:01,267
I'm feeling pretty thirsty.

515
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:04,658
But,

516
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:07,290
I don't really know the local streets here.

517
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,092
So, maybe someone who knows the
roads could go with Dal Mun Hyungnim?

518
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:13,112
Whoa, sounds like you're trying to get out of it.

519
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:15,450
Stop making excuses, and get going.

520
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,078
Just past Yeongchon bridge,
if you go a little further,

521
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,781
you'll see a place called the Widow's House.

522
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:21,097
Get going!

523
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,187
Get going, guys.

524
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:25,602
How am I gonna do 20 laps
around the drill field? Aigoo.

525
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,010
You do my share and take 40.

526
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,116
All right, 1st Platoon!

527
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:44,311
Where are you going, Hyungsoonim?

528
00:50:44,431 --> 00:50:46,571
I'm on my way back from a house
call to the village chief's house.

529
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:49,080
Did you lose again today?

530
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,303
We won.

531
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:52,474
Congratulations.

532
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:53,712
Thanks.

533
00:51:13,598 --> 00:51:18,165
I suppose he'll be well in no time,
since an angel's been to see him.

534
00:51:28,778 --> 00:51:29,676
Platoon Leader!

535
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,324
Platoon Leader!

536
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,265
The Regiment's engineering corp
is headed toward Yeongchon bridge.

537
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:36,674
- The engineering corp? 
- Yes, sir!

538
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,855
The enemy route has changed, and so just in case,

539
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:41,704
they've ordered the Yeongchon
bridge to be prepared with explosives!

540
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:43,082
Has our military situation worsened critically?

541
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:45,219
No, I don't think it's gotten to such a point.

542
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,113
I think it's just a move to be prepared.

543
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:51,806
Shall I go and fetch the Captain?

544
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:54,330
No, we'll take care of this ourselves.

545
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,497
He's taking a well deserved break for a day.

546
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,554
2nd Company!

547
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:03,231
Oh my, oh my! Aigoo!

548
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:05,198
Aigoo, be careful!

549
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:08,542
You keep spilling like that
and the road will be dead drunk.

550
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:10,259
The road is uneven, what can I do?

551
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:11,792
That's why I said let's take the main road!

552
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:12,999
What the hell is this?

553
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,043
The ahjumma said this was the fastest way!

554
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:16,499
What's the rush?!

555
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,667
- We can take our time.
- Aigoo, really!

556
00:52:19,795 --> 00:52:21,854
Are people from your town all as slow as you?

557
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,078
What are you talking about?

558
00:52:23,198 --> 00:52:26,221
I was famous in our town for being impatient.

559
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:28,461
Aigoo.

560
00:52:28,863 --> 00:52:34,546
If he's anything like you,
your kid is going to take his time coming out.

561
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:39,818
"Wah. I'm a coming.
Just wait a little while" Just like that.

562
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:43,410
Aigoo, why?

563
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,299
Does it make you that
happy thinking about your kid?

564
00:52:45,419 --> 00:52:46,724
You know it.

565
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:49,905
When the war is over and I get back home,
we'll come up with a name.

566
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,358
And, I'll carry him on
my back and show him our fields.

567
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:57,523
Geez, why not give him a weeding
hoe instead of a rattle and put him to work?

568
00:52:57,643 --> 00:53:00,403
He's got to learn if he's gonna work those fields.

569
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:01,998
Aigoo.

570
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:04,847
Wait, wait, wait.

571
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,526
When we go back home,

572
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:11,517
you have to deliver on your
promise to find me a sweet pretty gal.

573
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:12,585
Did I say that?

574
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:13,685
Of course!

575
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:17,680
After you said we'd be brothers,
you made that promise.

576
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,382
I think the ahjumma was right.

577
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:20,001
Huh?

578
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:21,643
Looking down at the area down there,

579
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,826
I think we're pretty much there.

580
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:28,424
About the girl, about the girl …

581
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:30,791
- I don't know!
- You promised!

582
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:31,860
I don't know!

583
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,028
That's really low, man!

584
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,567
Forget it!

585
00:53:36,687 --> 00:53:38,363
What are you doing?!

586
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:43,068
You got me mad and hot, why?

587
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:45,777
Hey! The Company will
be waiting with such a thirst!

588
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:47,620
Give it here!

589
00:53:49,246 --> 00:53:51,589
Tell me you'll keep your promise about the girl.

590
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,308
I said give it here.

591
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:55,383
So you can take it?

592
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,117
Wanna try to catch me?

593
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,619
If you've got the nerve, give it a shot.

594
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:01,595
Hey!

595
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:05,450
Come here.

596
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,676
Oh my god! What is this?

597
00:54:25,616 --> 00:54:27,892
Snap out of it!

598
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:32,189
Hyungnim, save me.

599
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,288
Is anyone here?!

600
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,945
Help us!!

601
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,221
Someone's hurt!

602
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:21,095
You can do it.

603
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:24,517
You can do it, Shin Tae Ho.

604
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,530
Platoon Leader!

605
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:29,675
What happens if these don't go off?!

606
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:32,571
Just connect them like I showed you!

607
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:48,966
Park Hong Ki!

608
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,586
I'm sorry,

609
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:57,399
Du Sik,

610
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,892
Hong Ki,

611
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:03,159
Ju Hwan.

612
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,820
Unload them carefully.

613
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:19,373
I'm 2nd Company 1st Platoon Leader, Shin Tae Ho.

614
00:56:19,493 --> 00:56:20,989
I'm Engineering Corp Lieutenant Shin Chang Ho.

615
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,414
- We'll leave it to you, then.
- Yes.

616
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:24,210
We'll be installing them immediately.

617
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,206
All right.

618
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,895
Put that there.

619
00:56:31,373 --> 00:56:35,507
From now on, we will regulate
all people using the Yeongchon bridge.

620
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:38,418
Do your best in each of your posts to be on guard.

621
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:39,718
Yes, sir!

622
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,713
One year ago, in this exact spot,

623
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,082
we had the same mission.

624
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,495
We failed then,

625
00:56:55,842 --> 00:57:00,072
but this time, we will absolutely not fail.

626
00:57:04,113 --> 00:57:06,544
- To your positions.
- To positions!

627
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:16,238
Hello! Someone please come!

628
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:18,716
Can't you hear me?!

629
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:32,563
Am I bleeding a lot?

630
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:37,115
No. In a battlefield, that's just a piece of cake.

631
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:40,864
When we get to camp, it'll heal just like that.

632
00:57:40,984 --> 00:57:42,707
That's right.

633
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:47,739
I was so lucky to have
gotten treatment at the hospital,

634
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:51,818
and then I throw a tantrum. I'm being punished.

635
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:57,392
But, why am I so sleepy?

636
00:57:57,512 --> 00:57:59,271
Snap out of it!

637
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:00,928
You can't fall asleep!

638
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:02,693
Don't fall asleep!

639
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,133
I'm sleepy.

640
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:07,671
This won't do.

641
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,660
If we stay like this, we'll get nowhere.

642
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,447
So, I'll rush and get someone.

643
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,555
Hyungnim, don't go.

644
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,597
I'm scared.

645
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:23,941
What if I die here?

646
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:25,180
Are you crazy?!

647
00:58:26,312 --> 00:58:28,154
Who's gonna die?!

648
00:58:29,269 --> 00:58:32,010
No matter what happens, I'll make sure you live,

649
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,363
so you just stay put here!

650
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,677
Got it?!

651
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:44,977
Man Yong!

652
00:58:45,097 --> 00:58:46,231
You can't die!

653
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,160
You absolutely can't die!

654
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,059
You poor kid!

655
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,591
Hyungnim!

656
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,286
Hurry back!

657
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,057
I will!

658
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:27,695
What should we do?

659
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,744
Go Man Yong and Park Dal Mun haven't returned yet.

660
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:34,352
They don't know the roads really well,
so I wonder if they took another route.

661
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:36,504
Big trouble! Big trouble!

662
00:59:36,624 --> 00:59:37,836
Lieutenant!

663
00:59:39,485 --> 00:59:40,693
Big trouble!

664
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:41,916
Big trouble!

665
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:45,849
Man Yong, our Man Yong is on the brink of death!

666
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:47,893
What are you talking about?

667
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:50,783
Park Dal Mun!

668
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,424
I'm asking you what happened!

669
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:56,450
Man Yong stepped on a mine!

670
00:59:58,014 --> 00:59:58,602
What?

671
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:00,571
I was going to carry him,

672
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:03,776
but he's lost so much blood, I came on my own.

673
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:06,658
- Medic!
- Byung Gu!

674
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:07,943
Yes, sir!

675
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,752
- Go Man Yong stepped on a mine.
- What?

676
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:15,320
- How's his condition?
- There’s nothing below his ankle. 

677
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,333
And, he keeps saying he's sleepy.

678
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:19,036
I don't think the emergency kit will do it.

679
01:00:19,156 --> 01:00:20,801
The medical officer will have
to look at it and operate immediately.

680
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:22,133
Then get him immediately!

681
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:24,146
He went back to the regiment medical corp earlier.

682
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:24,796
What?

683
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,004
What do we do?

684
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,258
Our Man Yong!

685
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,487
What do we do about our Man Yong?!

686
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,494
Captain!

687
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,903
Captain!

688
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:41,433
It's Shin Tae Ho!

689
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,431
Captain!

690
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:44,964
Captain!

691
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:48,660
What is it?

692
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,302
Go Man Yong stepped on a mine.

693
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:51,308
A mine?

694
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:54,002
Yes, he went on an errand with Park Dal Mun, and …

695
01:00:54,122 --> 01:00:56,882
Anyhow, he needs surgery immediately,
but there are no medical officers.

696
01:00:57,374 --> 01:00:59,510
I think Hyungsoonim is going to have to help us.

697
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,616
I'll go and get ready right away.

698
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:11,712
You were going out to support the civilians today,
so why are you dressed in uniform?

699
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,481
There was an order sent down
to set up explosives on Yeongchon bridge.

700
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:17,596
What?

701
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,960
The Engineering Corp are working on it now.

702
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,942
Why didn't you report this?

703
01:01:22,236 --> 01:01:25,751
It wasn't a serious situation,
and you were resting.

704
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:27,532
I didn't want to bother you.

705
01:01:30,283 --> 01:01:31,321
I'm sorry.

706
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:36,771
I'm sorry. I should have
stayed in the barracks with you.

707
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:38,273
No, sir.

708
01:01:43,343 --> 01:01:45,372
The wounded soldier is
north of the Yeongchon bridge.

709
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:49,893
While I bring him back, I'd like you
to prepare for surgery at the Yeongchon clinic.

710
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:03,794
We just got a transmission
from Regiment operations.

711
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:08,439
An American scouting plane discovered
enemy movement in a southwest direction.

712
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,254
It appears the numbers are quite large.

713
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:11,431
Are they coming this way?

714
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:12,840
That's not clear.

715
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,664
Regiment operations have mandated
top security alert at 19:30.

716
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:18,213
Captain.

717
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:21,356
Please save our Man Yong.

718
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:23,471
He's about to die!

719
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:24,756
Don't worry.

720
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:26,676
It'll be all right.

721
01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:29,030
It's been over 2 hours
since he stepped on the mine.

722
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,392
The bleeding would have continued.

723
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:32,220
At this rate, the danger is high.

724
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:35,099
I should be the one killed.

725
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:38,165
I should have carried him down no matter what.

726
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:41,729
I'll go with Park Dal Mun and
get him down here as fast as possible.

727
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:42,810
You can't.

728
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,320
You move him and he could go into shock.

729
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,146
We have to ensure he's in stable condition first.

730
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:55,917
It would have probably been more
dangerous for him if you'd carried him down.

731
01:02:56,798 --> 01:02:58,342
You did the right thing.

732
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,097
Where's the patient?
Lead the way.

733
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:04,502
Su Yeon.

734
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,649
We don't have time, Jang Woo.

735
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:10,016
We have to hurry and
do something with the patient.

736
01:03:10,136 --> 01:03:12,153
You can't. That's towards the north.

737
01:03:12,273 --> 01:03:14,732
I will bring back Go Man Yong.

738
01:03:15,612 --> 01:03:19,180
If you want to save the patient,
a doctor has to go directly.

739
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,342
I said you can't.

740
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,206
Jang Woo.

741
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,631
I'll count on you.

742
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,252
Captain.

743
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:42,943
Hurry back.

744
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,676
We don't know how the situation will change.

745
01:03:46,062 --> 01:03:46,974
All right.

746
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,467
Thank you!

747
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,062
Thank you so much, Doctor!

748
01:04:07,565 --> 01:04:08,630
Su Yeon!

749
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,623
Hurry back!

750
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,383
I'll be waiting!

751
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:13,418
All right!

752
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:15,722
I'll be right back!

753
01:04:33,258 --> 01:04:36,167
Captain, do you think it will be all right?

754
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:42,963
You know how strong Su Yeon
gets in the presence of the wounded.

755
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:45,762
Let's put our faith in her.

756
01:04:48,897 --> 01:04:53,963
We have our own work ahead of us too.

757
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:57,558
This time, we have to protect Yeongchon.

758
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:05,443
You haven't forgotten your promise, right?

759
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,640
Right.

760
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,331
Hey, put those on this side.

761
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:18,060
The rigging is complete.

762
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:22,877
Thank you. We'll take it from here.

763
01:05:22,997 --> 01:05:26,954
Until we're no longer on top security alert,
we've been ordered to stand by in Yeongchon.

764
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:31,223
Finish connecting the detonator,
and then we're on standby in the vicinity.

765
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:32,489
Yes, sir!

766
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:37,215
Don't worry; our men are highly skilled.

767
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:39,902
If the order comes,
we can blow the bridge immediately.

768
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:45,369
I hope we don't have to see how skilled they are.

775
01:06:30,977 --> 01:06:35,209
<i>Please help me to see someone.</i>

776
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,336
Who?

777
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,483
Who are you looking for?

778
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:41,563
<i>Tomorrow, and the next day,</i>

779
01:06:41,683 --> 01:06:46,737
why did I think it was such
a given that you'd be next to me?

780
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:50,778
My woman and my child are up there.

781
01:06:50,898 --> 01:06:52,493
<i>I have to go myself.</i>

782
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:53,635
<i>Captain,</i>

783
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,133
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

784
01:06:55,381 --> 01:06:57,265
What is this?

785
01:06:57,558 --> 01:06:59,350
The regiment has sent the order.

786
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,203
As soon as we see the main force of the enemy,

787
01:07:01,323 --> 01:07:02,578
we blow up the bridge immediately.

788
01:07:02,698 --> 01:07:05,327
Su Yeon, get up;
 The Chinese army is approaching.

789
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:08,122
Then, just one minute. Wait one minute more.

790
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,099
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

791
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:11,194
Let go, you bastard!

792
01:07:11,314 --> 01:07:13,001
- Lieutenant!
- Lieutenant!
