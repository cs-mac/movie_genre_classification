<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I was growin' up,
people didn't really talk about miracles.</i></font>

2
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:06,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm not sure I understood what they were
or if I believed in them.</i></font>

3
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A miracle is defined</i></font>

4
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>as something not explicable
by natural or scientific laws.</i></font>

5
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But then how do you explain it?</i></font>

6
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>How does it happen?</i></font>

7
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:43,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who or what is behind it?</i></font>

8
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin, Adelynn, Annabel, let's go!</font>

9
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin! Abbie!</font>

10
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my gosh. This is so fun!
- Wait.</font>

11
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Okay, my turn.</font>

12
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, okay.
- I want a turn now.</font>

13
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never got a turn.</font>

14
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You'll get dizzy.
- You're dizzy.</font>

15
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Adelynn, it's not good
for a 6-year-old.</font>

16
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:13,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brain's still developing.</font>

17
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sucks being 6.</font>

18
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should watch your mouth, Adelynn.</font>

19
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:18,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
you could go to hell for swearing.</font>

20
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:19,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to hell.</font>

21
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell is in California.</font>

22
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:24,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who told you that, Adelynn?
- Liz Johnson from school.</font>

23
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is she the one whose parents think
that Disneyland's the work of Satan?</font>

24
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's her.
- Well,</font>

25
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no one here is goin' to hell.</font>

26
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you girls get your clothes dirty.</font>

27
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times have I told you
not to play outside</font>

28
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:36,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your Sunday school dresses?</font>

29
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come here.
- Sorry, Mom.</font>

30
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry, Mom.
- It's all right.</font>

31
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just pretend you're not mine.</font>

32
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kevin!</font>

33
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to tell you not to play
outside before church, too?</font>

34
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They get cranky when they're hungry, baby,
you know that.</font>

35
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

36
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Grab my sweater, would you, honey?
- Okay.</font>

37
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's quarter to, hon. We're gonna be late.</font>

38
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax, baby, we're good.</font>

39
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got to get you changed.
- Don't you worry about it, baby.</font>

40
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:00,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it all under control.</font>

41
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's not shirtless Sunday at church.</font>

42
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:06,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, girls.
Abbie, Adelynn, Anna, let's go!</font>

43
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on and get in the truck.
Your mother's stressin' out.</font>

44
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look pretty.</font>

45
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Daddy.</font>

46
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- They take after their mama.</font>

47
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please.</font>

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, do I look handsome?</font>

49
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or fetching, maybe?</font>

50
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:29,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

51
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buckle up, girls. Let's go.</font>

52
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:37,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothin', really?</font>

53
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Tough crowd.</font>

54
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey!</i></font>

55
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Here we go!</i></font>

56
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>God, I'm runnin' for your heart</i></font>

57
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm runnin' for your heart</i></font>

58
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Till I am a soul on fire</i></font>

59
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lord, I'm longing for your ways</i></font>

60
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm waiting for the day</i></font>

61
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Help me out.</i></font>

62
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:05,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Till I am a soul on fire</i></font>

63
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, I am a soul on fire</i></font>

64
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm running God,
I'm running</i></font>

65
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I want to be, I want to be</i></font>

66
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How 'bout we go this time. Come on.</font>

67
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A soul on fire</i></font>

68
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:22,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lord, let me be your soul on fire</i></font>

69
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, help us sing it now.</i></font>

70
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:30,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Soul on fire</i></font>

71
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Woo-hoo!</font>

72
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hear it for Mac and the band!</font>

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That's fantastic.</font>

74
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a common phrase,
"No pain, no gain."</font>

75
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it is, of course,
attributed to the sculpting of our bodies.</font>

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the same principle can be applied</font>

77
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the sculpting of our character
and the deepening of our spiritual life.</font>

78
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, when the road gets bumpy,</font>

79
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the storms rain down,</font>

80
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could do a few things to protect myself.</font>

81
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I could get a nice helmet.</font>

82
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we might be able
to find ourselves an umbrella.</font>

83
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:28,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just happened to be there.</font>

84
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that that's open,
uh, we better make sure</font>

85
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that our insurance premiums
are paid up, too.</font>

86
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we can get an umbrella,</font>

87
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:47,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we can get a helmet,
and we can get insurance.</font>

88
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:53,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there's one thing that we need
that can't be seen,</font>

89
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it can't be bought.</font>

90
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is faith.</font>

91
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Amen.</font>

92
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faith is really the only true shelter.</font>

93
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>

94
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>

95
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, I'm right where I belong</i></font>

96
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Got a good thing going on</i></font>

97
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, that smells really good.</font>

98
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ain't no sweeter easy going,
ain't no softer summer breeze</i></font>

99
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:34,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ain't no place I'd rather call home</i></font>

100
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, I'm right where I belong</i></font>

101
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody,
I just want to thank the Beams</font>

102
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for opening up their home
for our monthly picnic.</font>

103
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so good.</font>

104
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember,</font>

105
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sign-ups for the trip
to the Dallas Aquarium are this week.</font>

106
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not next week, this week.
- Yeah, I want to go.</font>

107
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, we'll go.
- And finally, anybody</font>

108
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who has an animal
or who has a friend with an animal</font>

109

to get out of the house</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you know, some air conditioning
and a bowl of water,</font>

113

our brother Kevin Beam...</font>

114

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, Kevin!

116
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send everybody!
Send everybody and their animals.</font>

117
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- We'll be prayin' for you.</font>

118
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be prayin' for all of you.</font>

119
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not even want to know
what you paid for that.</font>

120
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, more than I care to think about.</font>

121
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We took every bit of equity
out of this house so he could open.</font>

122
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:35,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christy.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every bit of equity.</font>

124
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You agreed to that?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

125
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, see, no.</font>

126
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:43,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could not let Travis do that.
I would not be able to sleep at night.</font>

127
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:47,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good for you.
Good for you that you're doin' that.</font>

131
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,273

- Okay.</font>

132
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prayed that I make
the Fort Worth all-star team.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

134
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I have
the second most goals on the team,</font>

135
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so, you know, I think that
I at least deserve a tryout.</font>

136
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm with you.</font>

137
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, goober nugget.</font>

138
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Bedtime.</font>

139
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say your prayers?</font>

140
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Share one.</font>

141
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I can be older than Abbie and Anna.</font>

142
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I prayed that you'll
change my name to Taylor.</font>

143
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I wonder how that's
gonna turn out for you.</font>

144
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mom.</font>

145
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Adelynn.</font>

146
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I prayed that Daddy's business does well.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

147
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:52,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I prayed that he can bring home
some more dogs that don't have homes.</font>

148
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, can you cancel that part?</font>

149
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have enough dogs, Anna.</font>

150
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too late. It's already been sent.</font>

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Express mail.</font>

152
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how do you like this?</font>

153
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Love.
- Me, too.</font>

154
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm gonna spend
a lot of time there,</font>

155
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">enjoying baguettes
and freshly-ground espresso.</font>

156
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, let's do that together.</font>

157
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paris would be a good mother-daughter trip.</font>

158
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, count me in. I would love it.</font>

159
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Anna.</font>

160
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, too.</font>

161
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep tight, ladybug.</font>

162
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, good night.</font>

163
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night.</font>

164
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, honey.</font>

165
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay. Oh!</font>

166
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sweetie.</font>

167
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh.</font>

168
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Lord.</font>

169
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my baby.</font>

170
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sweetie.</font>

171
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think it was something
from the barbecue?</font>

172
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all ate the same things.</font>

173
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, maybe you should run her
by Dr. Sponder's in the morning.</font>

174
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:58,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- I'm okay.</font>

175
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

176
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your feet there.</font>

177
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to be better for the aquarium.</font>

178
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will be, honey.</font>

179
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

180
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get you to bed.</font>

181
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna sit with you.</font>

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

183
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you still up?</font>

184
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it about Anna?
- Mmm.</font>

185
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna's gonna be okay.</font>

186
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's probably just a bug.</font>

187
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:34,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The doctor will give us somethin' for it.</font>

188
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just feel anxious.</font>

189
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About what?</font>

190
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About everything.
The kids, the house, your business.</font>

191
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The kids? Come on, the kids are fine.
- Hmm.</font>

192
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my business is gonna work.</font>

193
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, babe, you say that like it's absolute.</font>

194
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this may take a while,</font>

195
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it'll be okay.</font>

196
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be okay.</font>

197
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good life, Christy Beam.</font>

198
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good...</font>

199
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good life, Kevin Beam.</font>

200
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope this gastroenterologist
can get to the bottom of this.</font>

201
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I checked him out online.</font>

202
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's supposed to be one
of the best in Fort Worth.</font>

203
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, good. He better be.</font>

204
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the third guy we've seen.</font>

205
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want to get this figured out.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

206
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's your book, ladybug?</font>

207
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

208
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, everything looks okay.</font>

209
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It does?
- Yeah, I've gone through</font>

210
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her entire chart and all
of Dr. Sponder's notes,</font>

211
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the X-ray doesn't show anything.</font>

212
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Dorsi, she's in constant pain.</font>

213
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this little girl
has been throwing up for weeks.</font>

214
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She hasn't kept anything down.</font>

215
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her little tummy's all bloated</font>

216
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's been on, well, Xifaxan,
she's been on Augmentin,</font>

217
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 4 different antibiotics.
- Look, look, that's why</font>

218
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ruling out anything that's bacterial.</font>

219
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it's viral.</font>

220
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Beam, I think your daughter
is lactose intolerant.</font>

221
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

222
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You think she's lactose intolerant?
- Christy.</font>

223
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like, allergic to milk?
- Ms. Beam.</font>

224
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering what y'all have been through,
I would think this is really good news. Huh?</font>

225
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is easily treatable.</font>

226
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't have pizza?</font>

227
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not just pizza, sweetheart.</font>

228
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can't have any dairy.</font>

229
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She can have cheese-less pizza.
- Who would want that?</font>

230
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, um, if Anna can't have pizza,
then I won't have it either.</font>

231
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm.
- Well, Abbie, that's a great idea.</font>

232
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in.</font>

233
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

234
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever?</font>

235
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:11,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not gonna have pizza ever?</font>

236
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, until Anna's better.</font>

237
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my body's still growing.</font>

238
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wrong answer, genius.
- Abbie.</font>

239
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Adelynn.</font>

240
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're only 6. No pressure.</font>

241
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, me, too.</font>

242
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at that.
- Yeah, that was hard.</font>

243
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hear it for you, ladybug.</font>

244
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Here's to you
gettin' well soon, sweetheart.</font>

245
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy.</font>

246
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy?</font>

247
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy!</font>

248
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy.</font>

249
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin!</font>

250
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy!</font>

251
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming!</font>

252
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm coming, baby, I'm coming.
- Mommy.</font>

253
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming.</font>

254
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no, Anna.
- Mommy, it hurts!</font>

255
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Kevin.</font>

256
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming. What is it?</font>

257
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come here, baby. No.
- Mommy, it hurts!</font>

258
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it?
- It hurts, Mommy!</font>

259
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think we need to take her to the hospital.
- It hurts!</font>

260
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna call Emmy to come over.
- It's okay, baby.</font>

261
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call Emmy.
We're gonna get you some help.</font>

262
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, hold on. Okay.</font>

263
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go. All right.</font>

264
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, honey. It's okay.</font>

265
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Okay. Okay.</font>

266
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- It hurts.</font>

267
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the door, honey.</font>

268
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

269
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be okay.</font>

270
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey. How is she?</font>

271
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know. I know, baby.
- Thank you so much.</font>

272
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God.
- Thank you.</font>

273
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd do it for me.</font>

274
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, all right. Go, go, go.
- Thank you, my friend.</font>

275
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:45,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes Mama.</font>

276
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me in, honey-baby.</font>

277
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

278
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we got here?</font>

279
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 36-year-old male...
- Just hang on.</font>

280
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do we got?
- Chest pains.</font>

281
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2201. 2201, please.</font>

282
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

283
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be with you in just a minute.</font>

284
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:06,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

285
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:10,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...blind by then, of course,
but they teach her to do it as well,</font>

286
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so Mary is just twisting.
They would have this...</font>

287
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't be long now.</font>

288
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

289
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom and Dad, you can relax. She's fine.</font>

290
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got her fever down
and she's starting to respond</font>

291
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to some anti-nausea medicine I gave her.</font>

292
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're good to take her home.
- Wait.</font>

293
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anti-nausea medicine, but for what?</font>

294
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I think this is just
a severe case of acid reflux.</font>

295
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not. No, it's not.</font>

296
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I examined her throat
and it's very raw, but other than that,</font>

297
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- everything is fine.
- Hold on a minute.</font>

298
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everything is not fine, Doctor.
- Okay.</font>

299
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we can have
this conversation outside.</font>

300
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do that.</font>

301
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor, this is our 4th time here.</font>

302
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't acid reflux.</font>

303
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her throat's raw 'cause she's been
throwing up for weeks.</font>

304
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Mom, I'm the doctor,
and that's my diagnosis.</font>

305
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you'll excuse me,
I have other patients I need to see.</font>

306
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, this is not acid reflux.</font>

307
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not lactose intolerant.</font>

308
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something wrong
with our little girl.</font>

309
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Beam, you need to calm down.</font>

310
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you calm down!</font>

311
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You find me another doctor,
you run some more tests!</font>

312
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leavin' this hospital
until I know what's wrong with my daughter!</font>

313
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

314
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, let's make sure she's okay.</font>

315
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. and Mrs. Beam, um, this is Dr. Burgi.</font>

316
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's head of our Pediatrics.</font>

317
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dr. O'Neil to the ER, please.</i></font>

318
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dr. O'Neil to the ER.</i></font>

319
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, we did a series of X-rays
and a sonogram,</font>

320
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm sorry to tell you</font>

321
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there appears to be
100% complete abdominal obstruction.</font>

322
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

323
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:12,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Part of her, uh,
intestines are twisted off.</font>

324
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

325
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I can tell you, emphatically,</font>

326
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that if we don't clear
that obstruction right now,</font>

327
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your daughter's gonna die.</font>

328
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna need to take her right now.</font>

329
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

330
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, let's go.
- I'm so sorry.</font>

331
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

332
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

333
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">BP 110/70.</font>

334
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:45,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay,
all the fluids are ready.</font>

335
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you check the suction?
- Right. Suction's good.</font>

336
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you get me
the Tegaderm, please?</font>

337
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's standing by.</font>

338
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Beam, will you step back?</font>

339
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Thank you.</font>

340
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

341
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll need to insert this tube
into Annabel's nose</font>

342
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then run it down into her stomach
to begin suctioning, okay?</font>

343
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Mrs. Beam, if you could step back.</font>

344
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mommy.
- Mr. Beam, if you could come</font>

345
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hold her down
and help her keep her still,</font>

346
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that will make it easier, okay?</font>

347
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, it's imperative
that we do this now, okay?</font>

348
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay. Okay.</font>

349
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we can give her
any anesthesia, all right?</font>

350
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's me.
- All right, sweetheart, here we go.</font>

351
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm right here with you, okay?</font>

352
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, it's gonna be okay.</font>

353
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna make you...</font>

354
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna make you feel better, okay?</font>

355
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, don't be scared, okay?</font>

356
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You need to swallow, sweetheart.
- Daddy!</font>

357
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Daddy, it hurts!
- You need to swallow, sweetheart.</font>

358
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Baby.
- There you go. There you go.</font>

359
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, it's okay.
It's gonna make you feel better, okay?</font>

360
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right. Okay, all right.</font>

361
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's gonna make you feel better.
- All done.</font>

362
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All done.</font>

363
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What bird turns into other birds?</font>

364
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The tiny blue one.
- The blue one.</font>

365
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you talking about
the one that launches...</font>

366
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- ...and you click it and 3 come out?</font>

367
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Yeah, it's that tiny little one.</font>

368
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What level are you on?</font>

369
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh, Chirp Valley.</font>

370
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been stuck on this King Pig Boss
for quite a while.</font>

371
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not very good, Pastor Scott.</font>

372
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Mr. and Mrs. Beam.</font>

373
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. and Mrs. Beam.</font>

374
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

375
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're praying for you.</font>

376
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hands, little one.</font>

377
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heavenly Father,
we pray for the health and well-being</font>

378
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:21,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Anna Beam and the entire Beam family,
especially these two...</font>

379
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, so, Anna is okay.</font>

380
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, she's in recovery.</font>

381
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my findings weren't good.</font>

382
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, there were other obstructions
in the small bowel</font>

383
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that required extensive, um, dissection
to free them.</font>

384
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You cleared 'em all out,
though, right?</font>

385
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did. I did.</font>

386
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But?
- Um...</font>

387
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, um, I'm afraid</font>

388
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:04,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Annabel appears to have
a very severe intestinal motility disorder.</font>

389
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are... Are you sure?</font>

390
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

391
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, Kevin?</font>

392
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's when her, um...</font>

393
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her body can't process food.</font>

394
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the, um...</font>

395
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The intestines aren't able
to function properly,</font>

396
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what she eats and drinks
tends to sit there.</font>

397
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she'll be all right now, right?</font>

398
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, she's sick,
but she'll get better, right?</font>

399
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no cure, is there?</font>

400
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I'm sorry to say that
presently there isn't.</font>

401
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is she restricted to tubal feeding?</font>

402
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the short term.</font>

403
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually she'll need a gastrostomy tube,</font>

404
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which aren't always successful
in the long term.</font>

405
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:27,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did talk with my colleagues,
and there is a specialist, Samuel Nurko.</font>

406
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the country's
foremost motility expert.</font>

407
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a pediatrician from Mexico
who's based out of Boston.</font>

408
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He might be able to help.</font>

409
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to give you false hope,
you know?</font>

410
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But people do come
from all over the world to see him, so...</font>

411
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

412
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very sorry.</font>

413
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

414
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tramadol,
gabapentin, glucosamine.</font>

415
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, baby.</font>

416
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have water, Anna?</font>

417
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

418
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see how breakfast was today.</font>

419
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

420
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, must have been good. It's all done.</font>

421
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you get that assignment done?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

422
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It looked really hard. Was it okay?
- Great.</font>

423
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no.</font>

424
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looked really hard to me.</font>

425
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll tell you that.
- Ready?</font>

426
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I did my homework.
- I bet it was easy for you.</font>

427
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby.</font>

428
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy.</font>

429
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy.</font>

430
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Almost, almost, almost.
- It hurts, Mommy.</font>

431
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, honey. I know.</font>

432
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:03,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.</font>

433
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it.</font>

434
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let me get you dressed.</font>

435
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attagirl.</font>

436
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a girl.</font>

437
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go, baby.</font>

438
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cute.</font>

439
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're all like that.
- Not to worry, baby.</font>

440
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take you shopping.</font>

441
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for today...</font>

442
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now, let's try these.</font>

443
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

444
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:50,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think God hasn't healed me?</font>

445
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are so many things I don't know.</font>

446
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I know God loves you.</font>

447
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Anna.</font>

448
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

449
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry you had to miss the aquarium.</font>

450
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me, too.</font>

451
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are you going?</font>

452
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

453
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Library.
- I'll go with you.</font>

454
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

455
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. I love the library.</font>

that Dr. Nurko had received my letter.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure he does,</font>

462
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there are specifics to Anna's condition
that I think that he would find...</font>

465
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then I'll call again tomorrow.</font>

466
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much.</font>

467

I just wanted to make sure.</font>

472
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you spoken to Dr. Nurko?</font>

473
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just am wondering
why I haven't heard from him.</font>

474
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been weeks.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

476
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I want you to know
I've called him 3 times,</font>

477
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and, uh, you're on the waiting list.</i></font>

478

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I just checked the other day.
You're still on it.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">when people no longer need his care.</font>

481
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you mean when they're cured?</font>

485
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just pray that Anna

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you there?</font>

487
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you even hear me?</font>

488
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I don't hear you.</font>

495
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,484

- He's a Yorkie terrier.</font>

496
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His name's Napoleon.
- He's adorable.</font>

- Oh, really?</font>

503
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause he looks like a purebred,
probably from a breeder.</font>

509

00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, giving her
something to look forward to</font>

511

to be adding somethin' to my plate.</font>

00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great message.
- Keep on askin' that question.</font>

537
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you.</font>

538
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:13,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you.</font>

539
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much. Thanks again.</font>

540
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad your mom is feeling better.</font>

541
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you forget your sweater?</font>

542
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah.
- I'm sure it's...</font>

543
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll grab it.
- Well, now or never.</font>

544
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back. Good to see you.</font>

545
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Let me think of something.</font>

546
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's do it.
- Christy, hey.</font>

547
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hi.</font>

548
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that sweet little
girl of yours doin'?</font>

549
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye-bye.
- Good days and bad days.</font>

550
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Christy, we just</font>

551
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">want you to know that
we're prayin' for Annabel.</font>

552
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

553
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- It's been goin' on for quite a while now.</font>

554
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, longer than you can imagine.</font>

555
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, since she's not been healed,</font>

556
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it may be a good time for you and Kevin</font>

557
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to ask yourselves some difficult questions.</font>

558
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

559
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, Anna is not better,
and she should be.</font>

560
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:59,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, somebody's sins
are preventing the healing.</font>

561
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either yours or Kevin's or</font>

562
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe even Anna's.</font>

563
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

564
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Christy.
- Christy, I don't think you understood.</font>

565
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:08,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me.</font>

566
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Christy.
- I think you might have misunderstood us.</font>

567
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not havin' it. I'm not havin' it.</font>

568
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, you can't...
- I'm gonna go and give them a call.</font>

569
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you can't, you can't, you can't.
- I'm gonna...</font>

570
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want the girls to know
that we're fightin' about people at church.</font>

571
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is Mommy yelling at the cows?</font>

572
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:22,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you something.</font>

573
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think they're fighting about me.</font>

574
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why?</font>

575
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like Pastor Scott said,
you need to look at yourself...</font>

576
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, because when
someone you love gets sick,</font>

577
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it causes stress.</font>

578
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can handle her thinkin' that
this is your fault or my fault,</font>

579
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but no one can say that
this is Anna's fault!</font>

580
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Baby, relax.</font>

581
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, just because
we're all in the same church,</font>

582
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't mean we're always
gonna see eye to eye.</font>

583
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just got to let it go.</font>

584
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be okay.</font>

585
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't be okay! Stop sayin' that!</font>

586
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothin' is okay!</font>

587
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And until it is, I am never
goin' back to that church.</font>

588
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you goin'?</font>

589
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take Anna shoppin'
to see if I can get her some clothes</font>

590
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make goin' to school more bearable!</font>

591
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:03,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Girls, let's go.</font>

592
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

593
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prayed that Anna would get better</font>

594
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that we could play soccer
again like we used to.</font>

595
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that prayer.</font>

596
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Anna gonna die?</font>

597
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:50,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A recent open letter saying that climate
change is, quote "not valid"...</i></font>

598
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

599
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you pick up Abbie and Adelynn
from school tomorrow?</font>

600
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think so. Why?</font>

601
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm taking Anna to Boston.</font>

602
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay...</font>

603
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:06,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we don't have an appointment yet.</font>

604
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's dying, Kevin.</font>

605
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see it.</font>

606
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, I'm scared, too, okay,
but you can't just</font>

607
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take her to Boston without an appointment.</font>

00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can.</font>

- Hi.</font>

631
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What doctor are you here to see?</font>

632
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Sam Nurko.</font>

633
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what time is your appointment?</font>

634
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't have an appointment.</font>

635
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daughter is Annabel Beam.</font>

00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's her right there.</font>

637
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Christy Beam.</font>

638
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've probably called 100 times.</font>

639
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna's doctors have called,
they've written letters.</font>

640
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're from Texas.</font>

00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, ma'am.</font>

642
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The doctor can't see you
without an appointment.</font>

643
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have kids of your own?</font>

644
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:25,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if you do,
you'll understand why I flew all this way</font>

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Dr. Nurko available?</font>

647
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:32,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, ma'am,
but he's got a 9-month waiting list.</font>

648
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. We're on it.</font>

649
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

650
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right here,</font>

651
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how sick Anna is.</font>

652
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She starts her day with Align/Culturelle
for digestive immune support.</font>

653
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At 9:00 a.m., she takes rifaximin,</font>

654
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an antibiotic for bacterial overgrowth
in the GI tract.</font>

655
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She takes hyoscyamine
for intestinal spasms.</font>

656
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At 12:30, she needs gabapentin for...</font>

657
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,720

658
00:34:55,803 --> 00:35:00,183

than 3 to 4 hours without tramadol.</font>

00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's always in pain.</font>

660
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

661
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to check in other patients.</font>

662
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Zach. Zach will...</font>

663
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

664
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,779

our patient policy to you...</font>

00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Anna's always played soccer.</font>

666
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:17,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When she was little,
we used to call her Monkey.</font>

667
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because she was forever
climbing on everything.</font>

668
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

669
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then one day she got sick.</font>

670
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:35,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of nowhere, she just got sick.</font>

671
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nobody knew what it was.</font>

672
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they told me,
"Oh, she's lactose intolerant."</font>

673
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She has acid reflux."</font>

674
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It's an infection."</font>

675
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I knew it wasn't. I'm her mother.</font>

676
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I knew, I just knew
it was something bad.</font>

677
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure Anna can wait much longer.</font>

678
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry.</font>

679
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to help you, I really do,</font>

680
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I've only had this job for 2 weeks
and I really need it.</font>

681
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just doing what I'm told.</font>

682
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

683
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, I'm sorry.</font>

684
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trying to help my little girl.</font>

685
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- If something opens up</font>

686
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll let you know.
- Excuse me.</font>

687
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

688
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

689
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay, Mom?</font>

690
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, baby.</font>

691
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to eat, Mom.</font>

692
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't let yourself get iron deficient.</font>

693
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about me.</font>

694
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, take these.</font>

695
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God. Great.
- It's okay.</font>

696
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this day's just gettin' better
and better, huh?</font>

697
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

698
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take the table.</font>

699
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be my guest, your majesty.</font>

700
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I got it, I got it.</font>

701
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.</font>

702
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everything is fine.
- Thank you.</font>

703
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

704
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what? Being human?</font>

705
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't mind him.</font>

706
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He don't have kids,
and he has no personality.</font>

707
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when you got kids,
things get messy.</font>

708
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:34,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have 3.</font>

709
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? So, you know.</font>

710
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You either roll with it
or you get rolled on.</font>

711
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get rolled on, you get flat.</font>

712
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where y'all from? What you doin' here?</font>

713
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, we're from Burleson, Texas,</font>

714
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there's a doctor
at Children's Hospital we're tryin' to see.</font>

715
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Boston is one
of the finest cities I know.</font>

716
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you ask me,
it is the finest city in the country.</font>

717
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I might be a little biased
because I live here.</font>

718
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'm here.</font>

719
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course it is.</font>

720
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, no, it's a gorgeous city.</font>

721
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, yeah.
- Well, good.</font>

722
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe we should try
to do a tour while we're here</font>

723
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we have time.</font>

724
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

725
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

726
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm off tomorrow.</font>

727
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:28,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I could be your tour guide.</font>

728
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to see the city?</font>

729
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You know what?</font>

730
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't. We can't.</font>

731
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have time, honey.</font>

732
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what
the schedule's gonna be and...</font>

733
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:37,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But, Mom, I really want to go.
- It's...</font>

734
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, we're just...
- Mom, please.</font>

735
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just hopin' to get
this call from this doctor.</font>

736
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, please.
- Right, right.</font>

737
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got a cell phone, right?
- Well...</font>

738
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have a cell phone, either way.
- I do have...</font>

739
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:46,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I have a cell phone.</font>

740
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we don't have to go far.
I mean, I could...</font>

741
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I could show you
a couple really cool places.</font>

742
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I just need to be
able to get right here</font>

743
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- if they call us and tell us...
- I'm a fast driver.</font>

744
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You should see me drive.
- Mom, please.</font>

745
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

746
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to go, baby?</font>

747
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

748
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

749
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

750
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we're goin'.</font>

751
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm Angela Bradford.</font>

752
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Anna. This is my mom, Christy.</font>

753
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

754
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Angela, you know, how about
you leave the guests alone</font>

755
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and help the rest of us get
some work done here?</font>

756
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:18,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are now my new friends.</font>

757
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Anna and Christy.</font>

758
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Welcome now.
- And they're gonna give me a huge tip</font>

759
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a few minutes.</font>

760
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just kidding.
- I'm sure they don't want you</font>

761
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to lose the job either.
- All right.</font>

762
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to take care of these customers.</font>

763
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll talk in a sec. I'll come back.</font>

764
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Bye.</font>

765
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

766
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She seemed nice.</font>

767
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe something came up.</font>

768
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:40,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

769
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe she had to work,
maybe she forgot she had an appointment.</font>

770
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know her.</font>

771
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know? Things happen.</font>

772
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, ready to have some fun?</font>

773
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:49,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Angela.</font>

774
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

775
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sweetie.</font>

776
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:57,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I was thinking,
why don't we start at the aquarium.</font>

777
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh.</font>

778
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say something wrong?</font>

779
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No.</font>

780
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, come on!</font>

781
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should look for a crosswalk.</font>

782
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Or just wait for</font>

783
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the traffic to thin out.
- This is thin.</font>

784
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

785
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch it!
- Out of the way, lady!</font>

786
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a life!</font>

787
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong with you? Oh, sorry.</font>

788
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's early and I'm trying
to quit smoking.</font>

789
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we doing?</font>

790
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting in.</font>

791
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you, this is a personal tour.</font>

792
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

793
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's great.</font>

794
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me help you, sweetie.</font>

795
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we could meet you there.</font>

796
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We could...
- No, I got you.</font>

797
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could all hop in a cab
or there are buses...</font>

798
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There we go.</font>

799
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you, beautiful.</font>

800
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won this garbage can
in a divorce settlement.</font>

801
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting me a new one
as soon as I get my license.</font>

802
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. I'm sorry.</font>

803
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have a license?</font>

804
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">CFP.</font>

805
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna become
a certified financial planner.</font>

806
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Of course I have a license.
- Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

807
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll just get in the backseat.</font>

808
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I meant to get that out of there.</font>

809
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:11,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why don't we just go three across?</font>

810
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 across.</font>

811
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 3 across.
- 3 across.</font>

812
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:14,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's do it.</font>

813
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, thank you, ma'am.</font>

814
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Off we go.
- Does this close?</font>

815
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we come.</font>

816
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would your daddy say?</font>

817
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:25,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put on your seat belt, Anna.</font>

818
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

819
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hey, hey!</font>

820
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

821
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the Prud,</font>

822
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the famous Prudential Center.
- What?</font>

823
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- It's so big.</font>

824
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is very important. Focus.</font>

825
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fenway Park.</font>

826
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:06,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a fire hydrant right there.</font>

827
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing famous about that.</font>

828
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this is the famous Beacon Hill.</font>

829
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is one of the wealthiest
neighborhoods in the entire city,</font>

830
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's home to my sweet, sweet boyfriend,</font>

831
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:16,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom Brady.</font>

832
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does he really live there?
- Yeah, he does.</font>

833
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, babe!</font>

834
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh.</font>

835
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:34,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that fish.</font>

836
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh!</font>

837
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:39,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so big.</font>

838
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:41,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

839
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:44,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my goodness.
- What is...</font>

840
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:12,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, look how cute they are.</font>

841
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:15,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'd be even cuter on some rice
with some soy sauce.</font>

842
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Angela, there are fishes here!</font>

843
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are awful.</font>

844
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:21,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm just kidding.</font>

845
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I really would fry 'em with some...
- Oh, my...</font>

846
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:24,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just...</font>

847
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:43,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

848
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>May I speak
with Christy Beam, please?</i></font>

849
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:47,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, this is... This is she.</font>

850
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:48,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm calling from Dr. Nurko's office.</i></font>

851
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:50,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We just got an opening
at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i></font>

852
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:52,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can you make it?</i></font>

853
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

854
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:55,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

855
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>See you tomorrow, then.</i></font>

856
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

857
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent. Good.</font>

858
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:06,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

859
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:20,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Anna, I need you to relax,
take deep breaths and don't move.</i></font>

860
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:57,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, somebody there?</font>

861
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let me hear your thoughts.</font>

862
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:09,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

863
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:10,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, lie down.</font>

864
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:30,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, tell me,</font>

865
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:33,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you prefer Anna or Annabel?</font>

866
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my friends call me Anna.
Annabel's too formal.</font>

867
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I understand.</font>

868
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:45,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My real name is Dr. Nurkobel,
but I prefer Nurko.</font>

869
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you wear an Elmo tie?</font>

870
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I lost a bet to him.</font>

871
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:57,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had won, he'd be wearing
a Dr. Nurko tie right now.</font>

872
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:00,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when can you take it off?</font>

873
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When my next patient gets better.</font>

874
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:07,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, do me a favour, get better fast</font>

875
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:10,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because my wife pretends
she doesn't know me when I wear it.</font>

876
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:16,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what I'd like to do next is</font>

877
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:19,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a motility test and an endoscopy.</font>

878
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I want to put a camera
inside and look around.</font>

879
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

880
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Will it hurt?
- Not a bit.</font>

881
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be sleeping.</font>

882
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

883
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:43,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again, picture, please.</font>

884
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:44,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There.
- Got it.</font>

885
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heart rate is 73.</font>

886
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's holding steady at 115/74.</font>

887
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:03,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Beam, I didn't take
her medical history at face value.</font>

888
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:08,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you know, we ran
an extensive battery of new tests.</font>

889
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:12,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And unfortunately,
the testing confirmed that she is very ill.</font>

890
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:15,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in a tremendous amount of pain.</font>

891
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:18,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? So, look.</font>

892
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you.</font>

893
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one shows normal function.</font>

894
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other side,
it's what's happening to Anna.</font>

895
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called Pseudo Obstruction
Motility Disorder.</font>

896
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her condition is akin to a...</font>

897
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To a paralysis of the GI tract.</font>

898
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:38,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The top part of the stomach works,
but the bottom doesn't.</font>

899
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nerves don't fire correctly,</font>

900
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:44,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the intestines can't pick up
the messages the neurons are sending.</font>

901
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:47,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what about the pain she's in?</font>

902
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:53,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I have to say,</font>

903
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:56,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pain is one of the most
complicated things to treat.</font>

904
00:48:56,768 --> 00:49:00,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Nurko, we came all the way here
because everyone told me</font>

905
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you were the one person who could help.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

906
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you were the person</font>

907
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- who could help me.
- Listen...</font>

908
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you were the person
who could help my daughter.</font>

909
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Beam, I see this every day.</font>

910
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:12,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And although there is currently
no cure for Anna's condition,</font>

911
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">our treatments are focused on
improving quality of life</font>

912
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:17,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and controlling the pain.</font>

913
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's hope.</font>

914
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the good news.</font>

915
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our center is one of the very,
very few places</font>

916
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:31,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's been granted permission by the FDA
to prescribe a drug</font>

917
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that can help Anna digest some foods.</font>

918
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:36,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's successful,
the distension in her stomach</font>

919
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be reduced
and we could end the tubal feeding.</font>

920
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This would give her
the semblance of a normal life.</font>

921
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A normal life.</font>

922
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be wonderful, Doctor.</font>

923
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, however,
there's potential side effects.</font>

924
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Headaches, diarrhea, swelling,</font>

925
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:56,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and some that are more dangerous,
like cardiac arrhythmia.</font>

926
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:05,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of that, I am required to see her
every 6 weeks for monitoring.</font>

927
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't believe
it was worth the risk.</font>

928
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:34,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$1,000 for plane tickets to Boston
every 6 weeks.</font>

929
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:37,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$2,000 more a month
to increase our yearly cap.</font>

930
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the non-covered procedures,
the new medication,</font>

931
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:41,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the out-of-network doctors.</font>

932
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:43,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our co-pay is going up across the... Kevin.</font>

933
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm listening.
- I don't know how we're gonna afford this.</font>

934
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'd say sell the house,
but there's no money in it.</font>

935
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I know. It just makes me crazy!</font>

936
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:54,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just never thought
you needed such a big place!</font>

937
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man. Okay.</font>

938
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go. So now it's my fault?</font>

939
00:50:57,806 --> 00:50:59,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to know how we're gonna do it.</font>

940
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we'll figure it out.</font>

941
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. You can't say that.
I hate when you say that!</font>

942
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:04,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry, babe, but I don't have</font>

943
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:05,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- any answers right now.
- I need an answer!</font>

944
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't give you an answer, but...
- I need an answer!</font>

945
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot operate under the assumption</font>

946
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it's all just gonna be okay! I...</font>

947
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:12,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called faith, Christy!</font>

948
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:16,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have faith about anything.</font>

949
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't even pray, Kevin.</font>

950
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:30,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry.
- No.</font>

951
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you.</font>

952
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:40,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't help you with your faith.</font>

953
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:45,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I tell you, I'm gonna do
whatever I have to do.</font>

954
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:48,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? I'll open this
place 7 days a week.</font>

955
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? I'll work double shifts.</font>

956
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get a second job if I have to.</font>

957
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, whatever it takes, I'm gonna do.</font>

958
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really appreciate you coming by.
I got to say, I miss having you here.</font>

959
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:04,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Kevin put you up to this.</font>

960
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he's worried about you.</font>

961
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

962
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a little worried about me, too.</font>

963
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Kevin told me
what those ladies said to you, and I...</font>

964
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to say, I sure wish
that I could give everybody</font>

965
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:23,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a spiritual IQ test
before they walk in the door.</font>

966
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, um...</font>

967
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:28,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't choose our neighbors.</font>

968
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:31,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just asked to love 'em.</font>

969
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:34,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm gonna have to try
and love 'em from home,</font>

970
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I'm not going to church with 'em.</font>

971
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christy, that's not the reason
you stopped coming, is it?</font>

972
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:50,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I say or do to help you come back?</font>

973
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:53,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you could tell me why a loving God</font>

974
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:57,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would let Annabel suffer the way she has.</font>

975
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:08,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. I don't have an answer for that.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

976
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:13,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But just because she's sick
doesn't mean there's not a loving God.</font>

977
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:18,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me tell you,
at the lowest points of my life,</font>

978
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've tried it both ways,</font>

979
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:25,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doing everything I can
to connect to God or walking away.</font>

980
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in my experience,</font>

981
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one feels a whole lot
better than the other.</font>

982
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:43,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"...he seemed more interested
in the potted plants</font>

983

coming in to tune the piano."</font>

00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lord, your love offers more</i></font>

995

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Angela, look, she's coming over!</font>

1008
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:12,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like this yellow one.</font>

1033
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:57,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's the tummy?</font>

00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we're gonna do some more tests.</font>

1038
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:13,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

1039
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:14,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, pretty girl. I like your necklace,</font>

1040
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:16,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we're gonna have to take it off.</font>

1041
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:19,062

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. You know what?</font>

1043
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we put it here,</font>

1046
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:31,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

1047
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:34,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good idea.</font>

1058
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:11,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- With these disorders, there are flare-ups.
- Mmm.</font>

she doesn't have any obstruction</font>

1064
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that requires surgery.</font>

1065
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:33,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once the episode resolves, she can go home.</font>

00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:55,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have 5 dogs,
2 pigs, 3 cows, and some goats.</font>

1071
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and a donkey.</font>

1072
00:58:58,328 --> 00:58:59,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky.</font>

1073
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:00,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad's a vet.</font>

1074
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He brings a lot of dogs home for me.</font>

1075
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes my mom mad.</font>

1076
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad writes for the newspaper.</font>

1077
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:11,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes we get tickets
to see the Red Sox.</font>

1078
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:15,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just me and him.</font>

1079
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:16,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom left.</font>

1080
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:19,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1081
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you want the cross with you?</font>

1082
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:33,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just, like, a reminder.</font>

1083
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:35,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of what?</font>

1084
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Jesus is with me.</font>

1085
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:45,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think he's with me, too?</font>

1086
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he is.</font>

1087
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have cancer?</font>

1088
00:59:57,053 --> 00:59:58,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1089
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:00,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have a weird stomach disease.
- That sucks.</font>

1090
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:02,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a weird bone disease.</font>

1091
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It always hurts.</font>

1092
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:07,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

1093
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:16,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you afraid you're gonna die?</font>

1094
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes.</font>

1095
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:33,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Anna,
we are gonna roll you down the hall.</font>

1096
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:35,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, now let's get you down gently.
Ready?</font>

1097
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:36,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, step back.</font>

1098
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:38,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful.</font>

1099
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:39,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

1100
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay? Good.</font>

1101
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:52,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haley.</font>

1102
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:56,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you when I get back.</font>

1103
01:00:58,406 --> 01:00:59,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the first one.</font>

1104
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:01,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yay.
- Right.</font>

1105
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. All right.</font>

1106
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

1107
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:06,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there's two more.</font>

1108
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait to see.</font>

1109
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- All right.</font>

1110
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's red now. It's bold.</font>

1111
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I like that one, too.
- All right. Okay.</font>

1112
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:14,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good choice. Not bad.</font>

1113
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, tell me...
Tell me about your friend. Hmm?</font>

1114
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:19,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your roommate.</font>

1115
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, um, her name's Anna.</font>

1116
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:23,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They live in Texas.</font>

1117
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:28,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, they have 5 dogs,
3 cows, 2 pigs,</font>

1118
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goats, and a donkey.</font>

1119
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:35,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1120
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:39,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She told me not to be afraid to die.</font>

1121
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:47,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why'd she say... Why'd she say that?</font>

1122
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:50,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to die.</font>

1123
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because she's not afraid.</font>

1124
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:55,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She says God is always with her.</font>

1125
01:01:58,216 --> 01:01:59,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1126
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess if that makes her feel better,
that's good.</font>

1127
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:10,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's her.</font>

1128
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:12,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Anna. Welcome back.</font>

1129
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1130
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:14,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1131
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:16,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

1132
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:17,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go, ladybug.</font>

1133
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:18,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

1134
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on to Mama.</font>

1135
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:23,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Nice and slow.</font>

1136
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:24,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1137
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3.</font>

1138
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice and easy.</font>

1139
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to give you something.</font>

1140
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:34,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't reach, honey.</font>

1141
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get it for you.</font>

1142
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want Haley to have it.</font>

1143
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:49,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

1144
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:50,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty, isn't it?</font>

1145
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:53,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1146
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:56,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we?</font>

1147
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:58,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1148
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:02,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor.</font>

1149
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:07,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Ben, Haley's dad.</font>

1150
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:08,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1151
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1152
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:14,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm happy that the girls hit it off,</font>

1153
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'd appreciate it if
your daughter didn't...</font>

1154
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't fill her head
with that kind of stuff.</font>

1155
01:03:21,549 --> 01:03:24,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't know what made Anna do that,</font>

1156
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:28,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I am certain that
she didn't mean any harm by it.</font>

1157
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:30,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, I'm sure that she didn't.</font>

1158
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:35,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's not really our thing.</font>

1159
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:39,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I just don't want anyone
to give her false hope.</font>

1160
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you can understand that.</font>

1161
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More than you know.</font>

1162
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie.</font>

1163
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abigail.</font>

1164
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:11,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sweetie.</font>

1165
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

1166
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:17,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1167
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:19,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, what is it?</font>

1168
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, nothing.</font>

1169
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:24,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1170
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:26,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you all eat?</font>

1171
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:27,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1172
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:28,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1173
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:33,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I didn't think I'd be here.</font>

1174
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:39,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I'd be at my all-star tryouts
and then we'd pick something up.</font>

1175
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1176
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:47,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.</font>

1177
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
I mean, there's another one next year.</font>

1178
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:52,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you'll remember that one.</font>

1179
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie, wait.</font>

1180
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:58,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie. Abbie!</font>

1181
01:05:06,529 --> 01:05:08,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie.</font>

1182
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:12,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie, can I come in?</font>

1183
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, I need to talk to you.</font>

1184
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. I'm not mad at you.</font>

1185
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:23,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just hard without Mom here.</font>

1186
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong, Daddy?</font>

1187
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:30,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, nothin'.</font>

1188
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy just made a mistake.</font>

1189
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back to bed.</font>

1190
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:39,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1191
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you too, Daddy.</font>

1192
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1193
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:23,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1194
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:27,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see here.</font>

1195
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:30,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I take you down to the playroom?
- No.</font>

1196
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:33,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to read? Can I read to you?</font>

1197
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:35,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have King Arthur and His Knights,
A Tale of Two Cities,</font>

1198
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Moby Dick.</i>
- I don't feel like reading.</font>

1199
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A Moveable Feast.</i></font>

1200
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is, um, Hemingway,
and it's set in Paris.</font>

1201
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1202
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm never going to Paris anyway.</font>

1203
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:54,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to go home.</font>

1204
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:58,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haley got to go home.</font>

1205
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:01,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just can't take a chance, honey.</font>

1206
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I have the heating pad for my stomach?</font>

1207
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:06,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- It's getting worse, Mommy.</font>

1208
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:07,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, baby.</font>

1209
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:09,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, honey.</font>

1210
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:15,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need another tramadol.</font>

1211
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:22,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't time yet, baby.</font>

1212
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1213
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it hurts, Mommy.</font>

1214
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:29,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you understand
that it never stops hurting?</font>

1215
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:31,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It never stops.</font>

1216
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:35,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I know it does.</font>

1217
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:37,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it does.</font>

1218
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to die.</font>

1219
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Annabel.</font>

1220
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go to heaven
where there's no pain.</font>

1221
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:05,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, baby,
if you went to heaven, you...</font>

1222
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:09,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wouldn't be with me and Daddy anymore
and you would...</font>

1223
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd leave a hole in my heart.</font>

1224
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:13,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Mommy.</font>

1225
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:15,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to make you sad.</font>

1226
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:19,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I just want it to be over.</font>

1227
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:45,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this one.</font>

1228
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1229
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:48,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We still have to go through security.</font>

1230
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:51,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...front of the line.
- Sir, can we go ahead of him?</font>

1231
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is there another line?
- How many cards does he have?</font>

1232
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:54,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- This is nuts.</font>

1233
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:07,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is embarrassing.</font>

1234
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:09,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if Anna dies</font>

1235
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:13,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- before we get there?
- Hey, she's not gonna die, okay?</font>

1236
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:14,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1237
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:16,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry to hold you up.
- No.</font>

1238
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:18,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need to see.
- We're gonna miss our flight.</font>

1239
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:20,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the last one.</font>

1240
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:26,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is this taking so long?</font>

1241
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:28,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The flight boards in 20 minutes.</font>

1242
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- Really?</font>

1243
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is nuts.</font>

1244
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:34,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everybody stop...
- Can we move it along?</font>

1245
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to get in another line?</font>

1246
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been here for 30 minutes already.</font>

1247
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh...</font>

1248
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:46,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There seems to be a problem with my system.</font>

1249
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:49,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I guess I'm gonna have to
manually issue the tickets.</font>

1250
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just be aware there may be</font>

1251
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:56,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an overdraft fee from
your credit card company, okay?</font>

1252
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:05,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nurse
wants you to take a shower.</font>

1253
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me why.</font>

1254
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:12,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Annabel, it's been 5 days.
You need a shower, little girl.</font>

1255
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:14,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what? Why do I need a stupid shower?</font>

1256
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:17,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter. None of it matters.</font>

1257
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:20,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me. Annabel, look at me.</font>

1258
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:22,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that!
I am here trying to help you!</font>

1259
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't want any more help!</font>

1260
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:27,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just want to be left alone!
- Well...</font>

1261
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, honey.</font>

1262
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hi.</i></font>

1263
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, I was wonderin' if you...</i></font>

1264
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:57,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Maybe you'd be able
to put Annabel on the phone.</i></font>

1265
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup. She's right here.</font>

1266
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your daddy, young lady.</font>

1267
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:11,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Daddy.</font>

1268
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hi, sweetheart.</i></font>

1269
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:18,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, how do you feel about playin' a game
before you have a shower?</i></font>

1270
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know I need a shower?</font>

1271
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:26,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, 'cause I can smell you
right out here in the hall.</i></font>

1272
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:27,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>1, 2, 3, go!</i></font>

1273
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:29,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Surprise!
- Surprise!</font>

1274
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abbie!</font>

1275
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna!</font>

1276

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna!</font>

1277

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yay.</font>

1278
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna!</font>

1279

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a hand?</font>

1280
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:42,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. God. Hey.</font>

1281
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:43,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

1282
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:45,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is more like it, huh?</font>

1283
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:46,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There we go.</font>

1284
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:48,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at my girlies.</font>

1285
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:49,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We missed you, baby.</font>

1286
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:52,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at my girlies.
- We missed you.</font>

1287
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:54,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop squeezing so hard.</font>

1288
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop being such a baby.</font>

1289
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:58,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on.
- Who are you calling a baby?</font>

1290
01:11:58,691 --> 01:12:00,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- Who's the baby now?</font>

1291
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are.</font>

1292
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.</font>

1293
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:08,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, girls, you're gonna
get us kicked out of here.</font>

1294
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:09,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh!
- Excuse me?</font>

1295
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:11,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you lost your mind?</font>

1296
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:12,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch it!
- Oh, oh!</font>

1297
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:14,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, get Daddy. Get Daddy.</font>

1298
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

1299
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to be sick.</font>

1300
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, all right.</font>

1301
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:25,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could use you as a pillow.</font>

1302
01:12:25,092 --> 01:12:26,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you. I'm sorry.</font>

1303
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:28,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That hurt!
- I love you, too.</font>

1304
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:31,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your mom.</font>

1305
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your... Get your mom.</font>

1306
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:34,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get Daddy! Get Daddy!</font>

1307
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:37,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down there. Get down there.</font>

1308
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, baby, I miss you.</font>

1309
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:41,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you, too.</font>

1310
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:50,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do I always have
to go out in a wheelchair?</font>

1311
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:51,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My thoughts exactly.</font>

1312
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I keep telling the nurse.</font>

1313
01:12:53,162 --> 01:12:56,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one who's old, so let's switch.</font>

1314
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:59,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? My turn, <i>mademoiselle.
S'il vous plait.</i></font>

1315
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm so tired. So tired.</font>

1316
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:03,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster.</font>

1317
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:05,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so tired.</font>

1318
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster. Faster.</font>

1319
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:11,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, end of the trip.</font>

1320
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:13,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, pretty girl.</font>

1321
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a safe flight, okay?</font>

1322
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Dr. Nurko.</font>

1323
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:30,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1324
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:38,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christy, it's not uncommon
for kids to fall into a depression.</font>

1325
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:41,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And depression can make the pain worse.</font>

1326
01:13:42,044 --> 01:13:44,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, make an appointment</font>

1327
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a child psychologist
as soon as you can.</font>

1328
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:48,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- Okay.</font>

1329
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:53,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, Christy, uh,
spend all the time you can with her.</font>

1330
01:13:55,099 --> 01:13:57,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her family is the best medicine right now.</font>

1331
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:04,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, team Beam.</font>

1332
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye-bye.
- Say, "Bye-bye."</font>

1333
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:07,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye-bye, Annabel.
- Bye.</font>

1334
01:14:07,945 --> 01:14:09,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>

1335
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:25,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi there, this is Christy Beam.</font>

1336
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was referred by Dr. Samuel Nurko
up in Boston,</font>

1337

1338
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:34,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was hoping I could talk to Dr. Crites
for a few minutes, please.</font>

1339
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,472

01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:12,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's bring her up.</font>

1472
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:19,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slowly.</font>

1473
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice and slow.
- Careful, guys.</font>

1474
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:26,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1475
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:31,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scratches on her arm,
on her face as well...</font>

1476
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:32,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just secure her neck.</font>

1477
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:34,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got her?</font>

1478
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxygen comin' through, guys.</font>

1479
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:50,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's released.</font>

1480
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out, guys. Let me in.</font>

1481
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:06,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's breathing.</font>

1482
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:07,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you, God.</font>

1483
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:17,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2, 3, up.</font>

1484
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:20,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trauma One, we got a female, 10 years old,</font>

1486
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:24,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mrs. Beam, I need you to follow me.
- Okay.</font>

1487
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:27,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna need you to stay here, Mr. Beam.
- I understand.</font>

1488
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:31,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's swing around.</font>

- Good to go.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. and Mrs. Beam.</font>

1495
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh, don't know how to say this,</font>

1496
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:39,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but other than the possibility
of a slight concussion,</font>

1497
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:41,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your daughter has no broken bones,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">complete movement of all her limbs.</font>

1499

<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no internal bleeding,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">no indication of bruising.</font>

1501
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, after hitting the ground skull first
with dirt packed to the top of her head,</font>

1502
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:55,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she regained consciousness,</font>

1503
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:57,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">woke up with a smile on her face.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1505
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite frankly,
I've been a doctor for 25 years.</font>

1506
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:06,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never seen anything like it.</font>

1507
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:08,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come on. Come on.</font>

1508
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:10,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Go get it.</font>

1509
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:12,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get it.</font>

1510
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Anna, take it easy, honey.</font>

1511
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:21,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will, Mom.
- I don't want you to overdo it.</font>

1512
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Oh, my. Honey.</font>

1513
01:24:26,438 --> 01:24:29,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin, I forgot to give Anna
her pain medicine this morning</font>

1514
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:32,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she hasn't asked for
a single pain pill.</font>

1515
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:33,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- 2 days ago,</font>

1516
01:24:33,737 --> 01:24:35,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she could barely get off the couch</font>

1517
01:24:35,155 --> 01:24:36,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know how in the world
she's doin' this.</font>

1518
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'll take a good day
whenever we can get it, babe.</font>

1519
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay. I'm fine.
- Okay.</font>

1520
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:45,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mom, have you seen my pink jeans?</font>

1521
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:47,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, honey, I put those away.</font>

1522
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, I have a couple
other options for you.</font>

1523
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:54,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Annabel.</font>

1524
01:24:56,426 --> 01:24:57,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What... It's normal.</font>

1525
01:24:57,886 --> 01:24:58,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin!</font>

1526
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's flat. Kevin!</font>

1527
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, stop acting so weird.</font>

1528
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me I'd be fine.</font>

1529
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:11,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you you'd be fine?</font>

1530
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:15,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something happened in the tree
that I didn't tell you about.</font>

1531
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as I hit, everything went black.</font>

1532
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I stepped right out of my body.</font>

1533
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was kind of weird because...</font>

1534
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:33,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I could see my body,
but I wasn't in it.</font>

1535
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:36,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then what happened?</font>

1536
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:41,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The butterfly was there.</font>

1537
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The butterfly?</font>

1538
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1539
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:07,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't know where I was at first, but...</i></font>

1540
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But I knew I was safe.</i></font>

1541
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I love you.</i></font>

1542
01:27:47,055 --> 01:27:50,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, you spoke to God?</font>

1543
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:52,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but...</font>

1544
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:54,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was different.</font>

1545
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:57,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was like... It was like
you could talk to each other</font>

1546
01:27:57,357 --> 01:28:00,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without really saying any words.</font>

1547
01:28:02,028 --> 01:28:03,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know?</font>

1548
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:09,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I said I wanted to stay,
but he told me I needed to come back.</font>

1549
01:28:09,953 --> 01:28:12,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he told me that
when I came back, I'd be healed.</font>

1550
01:28:13,581 --> 01:28:17,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so I asked him
if he was 100% certain because...</font>

1551
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I didn't want to come back
unless he was right.</font>

1552
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:25,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you told anyone about this?</font>

1553
01:28:26,177 --> 01:28:27,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not yet.</font>

1554
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:32,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm worried what they might say to you.</font>

1555
01:28:34,644 --> 01:28:38,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, Mom.
Not everyone's gonna believe.</font>

1556
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:41,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's okay.</font>

1557
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll get there when they get there.</font>

1558
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:50,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

1559
01:28:51,703 --> 01:28:54,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get there when we get there.</font>

1560
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor.</font>

1561
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:33,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's asymptomatic.</font>

1562
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:37,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both her stomach and her intestines
are functioning normally.</font>

1563
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:40,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, all the parts are
talking to each other.</font>

1564
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that's what's happening medically,
but can you tell me how?</font>

1565
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you... Can you explain it?</font>

1566
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:52,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe when she fell and hit her head,
something happened.</font>

1567
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:58,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her central nervous system
has been regenerated.</font>

1568
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:01,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like her software's been reset.</font>

1569
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:06,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're telling me
that when this baby girl fell 30 feet,</font>

1570
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:08,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she hit her head just right
and it didn't kill her</font>

1571
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:10,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it didn't paralyze her</font>

1572
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:12,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and instead it healed her?</font>

1573
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:17,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People in my profession use the term
"spontaneous remission"</font>

1574
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:21,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to explain what can't be explained.</font>

1575
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:25,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying she's cured?</font>

1576
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:27,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no cure for Anna's condition.</font>

1577
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:30,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But according to everything
you're telling me, she's cured.</font>

1578
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:33,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't medically say that.</font>

1579
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:37,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then please figure out what you can say.</font>

1580
01:30:43,815 --> 01:30:45,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Dr. Nurkobel!</font>

1581
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:48,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch me!</font>

1582
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:16,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My patient's better</font>

1583
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:21,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I have a wonderful feeling
that this is good-bye.</font>

1584
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1585
01:31:37,285 --> 01:31:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1586
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

1587
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:47,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hi.</font>

1588
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much.</font>

1589
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:52,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Thank you for my little girl.</font>

1590
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:54,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, thank you.</font>

1591
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:24,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you take care of yourself,
Christy Beam.</font>

1592
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:25,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, too.</font>

1593
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something for you.</font>

1594
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had this one since
I was really little.</font>

1595
01:32:33,507 --> 01:32:35,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anna, honey.</font>

1596
01:32:38,221 --> 01:32:40,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have a question.</font>

1597
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:42,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it, baby?</font>

1598
01:32:44,227 --> 01:32:46,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it okay if I call you Aunt Angela?</font>

1599
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:49,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're way more
than a friend to me.</font>

1600
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. Of course.</font>

1601
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:12,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Next, from our
sister station in Fort Worth, Texas,</i></font>

1602
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:15,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>this is a feel-good story
