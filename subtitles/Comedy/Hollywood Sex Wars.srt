1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Max: THERE'S A WAR GOING
ON EVERY NIGHT IN HOLLYWOOD.

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,900
( dance music playing )

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
BOYS TRYING TO GET LAID.

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,200
AND GIRLS TRYING TO GET PAID.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,500
( cash register dings )

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
NOW MOST BACHELOR PARTIES SUCK.

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,500
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF DRUNKEN DUDES

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,800
HUDDLED AROUND A SKANKY STRIPPER.

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
BUT THIS ONE WAS THE SHIT...

10
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,200
AND ALL BECAUSE OF THIS
GUY-- JOHNNY EYELASH.

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,300
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SARAH?

12
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,000
MY SHOE BROKE.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
SARAH, HOLD ON, LOOK.

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
THERE YOU GO.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
( gasps ) YOU'RE THE BEST!

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
( laughing )

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,400
( men chattering )

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,800
Max: THIS IS A STORY
OF LOVE AND ROMANCE...

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,700
( men yelling )

20
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,800
AND WHAT COULD BE MORE ROMANTIC
THAN WHORES ON ALL FOURS

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,100
WITH STICKS POKING OUT OF THEIR ASSES?

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
( cheering )

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,400
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
NOTHING!

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,300
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
OH, NO.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,900
COME ON, LET'S FUCK.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,200
UH, NO, I CAN'T. I
GOTTA GET UP FOR WORK.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
BUT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME HOME, RIGHT?

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,500
UH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME.

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,900
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL YOUR
FRIENDS ABOUT THIS, ARE YOU?

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
NO...AND YOU BETTER
NOT TELL NOBODY, EITHER.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,000
IT LOOK LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT
TO TELL EVERY GODDAMN BODY.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Max: THERE'S A CERTAIN
TYPE OF WOMAN IN L.A.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,000
FROM HERE ON OUT, WE'LL
CALL THEM "THE ENEMY."

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ACTUALLY, FAHID, THE
LAW IS ON PAGE'S SIDE.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,300
THE INJURY WAS SUSTAINED AT
WORK, THUS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,600
SHE WAS DRUNK! SO WHAT?

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,100
THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC RULES.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,500
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ANY
GIRLS TO WORK HERE FOR MONTHS.

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,600
YOU KNOW WE CAN DO IT.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
I SAW YOU ALL OVER HIM!

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
IF LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD,
THEN THIS IS THE FRONT LINE.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,600
I WANT MY HAIR! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET!

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,400
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS FIGHTING
ABOUT? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS?

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,300
SHE WENT HOME WITH MY TUESDAY/THURSDAY,
AND I REALLY LIKED HIM.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,100
SHE WAS STILL FUCKING WORKING.
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER A CUSTOMER?

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,600
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS REALLY ISN'T ANY
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
I KNOW, BUT CAN YOU TALK, PLEASE.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,900
WHATEVER! UHH!

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
GIVE ME BACK MY HAIR!

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,500
I HAVEN'T CHECKED MY EMAIL IN WEEKS.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
WHAT?

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,500
YOU HAVE AN EMAIL ACCOUNT?

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,400
OF COURSE I DO.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,700
NOTHING. JUST...

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,300
YOU GIRLS ARE FIGHTING OVER A GUY
WHO MOST LIKELY COULDN'T CARE LESS

60
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,700
ABOUT EITHER ONE OF YOU EXCEPT
FOR TO STICK IT IN. SHE STARTED IT.

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,200
WHAT IS HIS NAME? SHAWN.

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,700
LAST NAME? UM, I DON'T KNOW,

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,400
BUT I KNOW HE WORKS AT THE BEAUTY BAR.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,100
OH, LOOK. HERE WE GO.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,300
SHAWN, 6'1", SOUR MILK BREATH.

66
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,500
YEAH, THAT'S HIM. THREE STARS IN BED?

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,300
LIKE THE RESTAURANT SYSTEM?

68
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
NO, SWEETIE, OUT OF TEN. YEAH.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,100
OH, LOOK...HPV.

70
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,200
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
WHAT? ( mouths )

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,800
THAT MOTHERFUCKER. OOH, LET ME SEE.

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
OH, MY GOD. HOW DO YOU
KNOW ALL THIS STUFF?

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,500
WE WERE JUST SO OVER THE
LYING, THE GAMES, THE CHEATING,

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,300
SO WE STARTED A GROUP WITH OUR
FRIENDS TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
WOW. THIS THING IS AMAZING.

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,700
( crying ) IT WAS...

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
IT WAS SIX YEARS, AND...

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,700
AND IT ENDED SO SUDDENLY.

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
YEAH, I KNOW, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,900
AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS
WOULD HELP, BUT IT DOESN'T.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
NO, I GET IT. I GET IT.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,300
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM THE BAR,

84
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,900
AND I SEE THIS CHICK
SITTING AT THE BUS STOP.

85
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,600
SHE WASN'T THE HOTTEST, BUT SHE
WAS OK FOR THAT TIME OF NIGHT.

86
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,300
ANYWAY, WE GET TO TALKING, AND BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT, SHE'S COMING HOME WITH ME.

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
I JUST GOT TO GET MY STUFF.

88
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,600
THEN I SEE SHE'S GOT THIS BIG
PLASTIC BAG WITH ALL HER STUFF IN IT.

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,500
SHE'S A VAGABOND. SHE'S
PUTTING THE "HO" IN HOMELESS!

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
BUT I WAKE UP, AND
SHE'S CHECKING HER EMAIL.

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,500
I MEAN, THAT MAKES SENSE.

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
I MEAN, WHERE ELSE SHE
GONNA CHECK HER EMAIL?

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
SHE AIN'T GOT NO WIRELESS
INTERNET IN THE BUSHES.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
WAIT. I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,600
OKAY.

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
( grunts )

97
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,700
( panting )

98
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
THAT IS OUR DATERBASE,

99
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,600
AND ANY TIME ONE OF US MEETS A GUY,

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,500
WE PUT ALL HIS INFORMATION IN THERE.

101
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,700
OKAY, BUT WHAT FOR?

102
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,900
WE USED TO BE
JUST LIKE YOU TWO--

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,700
YOUNG AND INNOCENT.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
PREY FOR GUYS LIKE HIM.

105
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,100
HE DOESN'T CARE 'CAUSE THERE'S
SO MANY GIRLS IN HOLLYWOOD,

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
BUT ORGANIZED AND TOGETHER,

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
IDIOTS LIKE HIM, THEY
DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,500
SO IT'S LIKE A TRADE
UNION FOR HOT CHICKS?

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,800
WE GOT A SMART ONE HERE, WENDY.

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
EXACTLY. GIVE IT A TRY.

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
GO OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
AND DO A DOUBLE ACT.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OH, I DON'T KNOW.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
GO AHEAD, GO.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BRO? WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT CHICK? DUDE, SHE WAS FINE.

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,700
OHH. YEAH, MAN, I WAS OUTSIDE
WITH HER AND HER FRIEND, RIGHT?

117
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,000
OH, NO, THE BUSTED ONE?

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YEAH, YEAH, THE BUSTED ONE.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
AND, UM, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS
GETTING A TEXT FROM SOME DUDE,

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,900
AND THEN SHE JUST BROKE OUT,

121
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
AND I WAS THERE WITH THE FRIEND,

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
AND SHE SAID SHE LIVED AROUND
THE CORNER, AND I WAS...

123
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,900
YEAH, MAN, I WAS TORE UP DRUNK, MAN.

125
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,700

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,600
YEAH, MAN, I MEAN, SHE
DID HAVE NICE TITS, THOUGH.

127
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
BRO, WE HAVE GOT TO DO BETTER.

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
( belches )

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
HEY, BRO, WHEN YOU TAKE THINGIE HOME,

134
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,600

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,200
DIG DEEP, GENTLEMEN, DIG REAL DEEP.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,000

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600

146
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,900

I, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,100
YOU WERE LATE FOR WORK
A MINUTE AGO. YEAH.

151
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900

HEY, MAN, I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK, MAN.

153
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,900
IS THIS YOUR HOUSE OR
YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE?

154
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,700
WE CAN ALL LEAVE NOW,

155
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,200
OR I CAN PULL THE FUCKING
FIRE ALARM ON MY WAY OUT.

156
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200

158
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,400
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

167
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
DO YOU HAVE AN ASPIRIN?

168
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,900
MY MOUTH TASTES LIKE ASS.

169
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200

( horn honks )

187
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,900

188
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,400
( indistinct singing )

189
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,700
FUCK YOU GUYS!

190
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,300
ASSHOLES!

191
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
WHAT THE FUCK'S UP WITH YOU HAIR TODAY?

192
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
WHY YOU ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT MY SHIT,
MAN? JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER.

193
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
OH, ANYWAY, SO, THESE
TWO CHICKS COME IN, RIGHT?

194
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
FUCKIN' SMOKIN'. BIG
FAKE TITS, YOU KNOW.

195
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,500
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, I'M BUSY,
BUT... HOW CAN I RESIST?

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,600
BUT AS SOON AS THEY LEFT, I GET
THIS FEELING I'VE BEEN CHUMPED.

197
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,700
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? LIKE
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT ONE OVER ON ME.

198
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,100
LIKE THEY'RE NOT REALLY INTO
ME, LIKE THEY'RE PRETENDING.

199
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,400
YEAH.

200
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,100
SO, LATER, I'M PRINTING
UP THE T-SHIRTS,

201
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
IT ALL STARTS TO MAKE SENSE.

202
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
"WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS
TO BE SELF-EVIDENT

203
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,600
THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED ASSHOLES"?

204
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE THEY
CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH US.

205
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,600
NOW THEY HAVE WHAT? MAN-HATING CLUBS?

206
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
OH, MY GOD!

207
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
OH, GEE!

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,800
JESUS, WATCH WHERE
THE FUCK YOU'RE GOING!

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
MAN, I'M SO SORRY,
BROTHER. ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?

210
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,500
NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
( sniffs ) SMELLS DANK IN THERE, MAN.

212
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200

WE COOL? WHAT IS THIS, A FUCKING
BAG OF WEED? ARE YOU KIDDING?

214
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,200
HOW ABOUT YOU CALL AN AMBULANCE?
NO NEED TO CONCERN THE AUTHORITIES.

215
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
THAT'S NEARLY HALF AN OUNCE.

216
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,600
COME ON, MAN, WHAT CAN I
DO? LET'S MAKE THIS RIGHT.

217
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
HOW ABOUT YOU LET HER
COME RUB IT BETTER?

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
DO ME A FAVOR...

219
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,400
DUDE, HE IS ALWAYS WITH THE BOMB CHICKS.

220
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM
TO INTRODUCE US TO SOME.

221
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,200
SHIT, OR MAYBE SHOW US EVEN

222
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,500

223
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
AAH.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,800

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,400
ALL RIGHT, NAME IT.

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,600
WHY DON'T YOU TEACH US HOW
TO GET WITH CHICKS LIKE THAT?

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,400
SERIOUSLY? YEAH.

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,300
ALL RIGHT.

231
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS COME BY

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,900

SO, WHAT? YOU GUYS

258
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,700

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,500
T.O.B. CLUB.

269
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,800
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS.

270
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,500
SEE, WOMEN ARE NATURALLY MORE DEVIOUS,

271
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
BUT IT'S THAT BITCHINESS
THAT USUALLY DIVIDES THEM

272
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,800
AND GIVES US GUY AN ANGLE.

273
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
DUDE, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE TITS

274
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
ON THE GIRLS THAT LEFT THAT WITH ME.

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,000
NOW THEY'RE GETTING ORGANIZED.

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
THIS DOESN'T BODE WELL.

277
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,000
REGULAR GUYS LIKE YOU
DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP.

279
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
DUDE, COME ON, JUST PASS ON YOUR WISDOM.

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
YOU GOTTA HELP US OUT, MAN.

281
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
WHAT THE FUCK DOES "BODE" MEAN?

282
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,900
LOOK AT THESE FREAKS, COME ON.

283
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,100
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, RELAX, JESUS.

284
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
ALL RIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

285
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
ABOUT THESE HOT CHICKS
YOU'RE SO SCARED OF.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,200
YOUR AVERAGE HOLLYWOOD BABE.

288
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,700
NICE, RIGHT?

289
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,100
YOU TAKE AWAY THE HAIR...

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,300
THE IMPLANTS...

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
THE LIPO...

292
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,800
THE STRAPPY SHOES, CUTE LITTLE DRESS,

293
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,100
OH, AND THE MAKEUP...

294
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,400
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH.

295
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,100
NOT PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE.

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,100
NOT THAT SMART, NOT
THAT INTERESTING--

297
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,300
BASICALLY SOMEONE IN YOUR OWN LEAGUE.

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
THAT'S THE WAY YOU GOTTA
THINK ABOUT 'EM, GUYS.

299
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,300
I SWEAR TO GOD, BEFORE LONG,

300
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
YOU'LL BE A GODDAMN HUMAN SHISH KABOB.

301
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,800
DUDE, THAT'S HARSH.

302
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
I SWEAR, IT'S AS IF YOU HATE THEM.

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,300
MAN, I DON'T HATE 'EM...

304
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,000
ANY MORE THAN A LION HATES A GAZELLE.

305
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
BUT I HAD MY HEART BROKEN ONCE...

306
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,200
COME ON, WEN, PLEASE!

307
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
IT'S OVER.

308
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES.

309
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,300
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

310
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,700
ALL I NEED IS A CHANCE. DON'T DO THIS.

311
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,400
BUT I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER.

312
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
AND NOW, I JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

313
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
COME ON, DON'T GO, MAN.

314
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,300
I LOVE YOU, WENDY.

315
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,300
OKAY, COOL. WHY DO YOU
HAVE A LITTLE GIRL'S DOLL?

316
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
WHO THE FUCK CARES?

317
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,100
WILL YOU PLEASE HELP US?

318
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,300
HEY, LOOK, I'LL HELP YOU GUYS,

319
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,900
BUT YOU GOTTA DO WHAT I SAY

320
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
EXACTLY WHEN I TELL YOU TO DO IT,

321
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,900
NO QUESTIONS ASKED, OR I'M OUT.

322
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
ALL RIGHT, COME BACK NEXT
WEEK AND BRING YOUR LAPTOPS.

323
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
OH, WAIT, I DON'T GOT A LAPTOP, MAN.

324
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I STILL GOT THAT DIALUP SHIT,
THAT... ( imitates dialup )

325
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
JESUS, CHRIST, YOU GOT A LAPTOP? YES.

326
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,000
YOU GOT A LAPTOP?
YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE.

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ALL RIGHT, WELL, GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,300
SO I CAN SHARE OF YOURS, HUH?

329
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
NO, SHARE OFF HIS, DUDE, I GOT A DELL.

330
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
SO, TO BUSINESS...

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
GRETCHEN, HOW'S YOUR REFINANCE GOING?

333
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,400
OKAY, WELL, THE GUY
CAME OVER THE OTHER DAY

334
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
AND TOOK ME TO LUNCH, BUT
WE GOT A LITTLE TOO DRUNK.

335
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
WE DIDN'T FINISH THE PAPERWORK.

336
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,200
Women: GRETCHEN!

337
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,900
I KNOW, BUT DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

338
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
OKAY, LADIES, NOT THIS
DATERBASE ONLY WORKS

339
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
IF WE KEEP IT UPDATED.

340
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
SO DID ANYBODY HAVE A DATE THIS WEEK?

341
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,900
I MET A GUY.

342
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,100
WHAT WAS HIS NAME? ADEN.

343
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,900
ISN'T THAT YOUR OTHER
BOYFRIEND'S BEST FRIEND?

344
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,400
YEAH, HE HIT ON ME YESTERDAY

345
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
JUST 'CAUSE I WAS SUNBATHING
TOPLESS BY HIS POOL.

346
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
UHH, SUCH A PIG. I KNOW.

347
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,200
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WILL
USE THAT AGAINST HIM.

348
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,600
ANYONE ELSE? YES, CHANEL?

349
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,400
THERE IS A BIG, HUGE HAIR SPIDER.

350
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,400
IT CRAWLED INTO MY CLOSET, AND
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT.

351
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO INTO
MY CLOSET FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,700
I'VE BEEN BUYING ALL OF MY CLOTHES
BRAND-NEW BECAUSE I'M SCARED OF IT.

353
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,000
THAT'S EASY, I'LL SEND ONCH.

354
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
ONCH!

355
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
YES, WENDY?

356
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,700
GO! NOW?

357
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,300
NO. TOMORROW. GO.

358
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,400
HOW ABOUT OUR NEW GIRLS?
ANYTHING YOU GIRLS NEED?

359
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,500
LIKE WHAT?

360
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
ANYTHING?

361
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,200
UM, OKAY, WELL, MY
SHOWER KEEPS DRIPPING,

362
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,700
AND IT'S KIND OF GROWING MOLD IN THERE.

363
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,600
I MEAN, I
CLEAN IT, BUT--

364
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,700
I'LL SEND ONCH OVER.

365
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,200
HOW MUCH IS THAT GONNA COST?

366
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,100
SWEETIE, WE JUST SAY
"OUR HOT GIRLFRIEND"

367
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
AND "SHOWER" IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

368
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,200
COOL, THANK YOU.

369
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, YVONNE?

370
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
I'M COOL.

371
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,500
REALLY?

372
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
I THINK SO.

373
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,600
I MEAN, THIS ALL SEEMS
A BIT COLD-HEARTED.

374
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,400
YOU LIKE TO FUCK AND PARTY, DON'T YOU?

375
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
YEAH! A LOT.

376
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
( laughter )

377
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,200
THOSE ARE MARKETABLE SKILLS.

378
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
AND COMPLETELY TAX-FREE, SWEETIE.

379
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

380
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,400
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

381
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,500
THANKS, JOHNNY. BYE, SARAH.

382
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,700
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, ALL RIGHT.

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
DUDE, YOU ARE LIKE THE KING.

384
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
IT'S JUST WORK.

385
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
WORK? WHAT DO YOU DO?

386
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,700
I'M IN PHARMACEUTICAL SALES.

387
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,900
YOU A DRUG DEALER? NO, I'M A SALES REP,

388
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,300
FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, KELOCOTE.

389
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,600
IT'S AN OINTMENT THAT WOMEN
USE AFTER THEY GET BOOB JOBS.

390
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,300
IT HEALS THE SCAR TISSUE.

391
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,500
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU GET PAID TO RUB CREAM

392
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,800
ON WOMEN'S TITTIES, YO?

393
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,400
YEAH. I REALLY AM A BOOB INSPECTOR.

394
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
OH, MY GOD.

395
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,500
COME ON IN, GUYS. DAMN.

396
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,900
WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS
A JOB LIKE THAT GOT?

397
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,800
THAT'S TIGHT. HA.

398
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,200
AH, MAN, FLING, MAN, THEY
GOT SOME SWEET PUSSY ON HERE.

399
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT THE DEAL.

400
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,400
WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS OURSELVES.

401
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
NO, DUMBSHIT. THESE ONLINE DATING SITES

402
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
ARE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN ABOUT WOMEN

403
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,900
AND THE GAMES THEY PLAY.

404
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,000
( water splashing )

405
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
( whistling )

406
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
HEY, GIRLS. LOOK WHAT I GOT.

407
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
YAY, DRINKS!

408
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,500
OHH!

409
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,000
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!

410
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,900
I HATE TAN LINES!
IT'S TOO NICE OUT HERE!

411
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,800
"DOGS ARE CONTROLLED
BY THEIR BASEST MOTIVES.

412
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
EAT, SLEEP, AND COPULATE."

413
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

414
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,700
THEY EVEN CALL THEMSELVES DOGS.

415
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,100
IT'S SO PATHETIC.

416
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
THEY WOULD SPEND
THEIR WHOLE LIFE--

417
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,600
CAR, JOB,
AND BEING--

418
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
JUST TRYING TO SQUIRT.

419
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
( laughing )

420
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,300
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THIS SHIT.

421
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,500
"I LIKE CUDDLING, SOFT KISSES, ANIMALS,

422
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,800
"WALKS ON THE BEACH, DINING, A NICE MAN,

423
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
SINCERE, KIND"?

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
THIS SHIT MAKES ME SICK.

425
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
WHY? SOME OF THAT STUFF IS CUTE.

426
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,800
OKAY, WINETASTING.

427
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,800
THAT MEANS SHE LIKES TO GET FUCKED UP.

428
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,700
DINING. THAT MEANS YOU
TAKE HER OUT TO DINNER.

429
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,500
WHAT, VACATIONS?

430
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
YOU THINK SHE'S PAYING
FOR THESE VACATIONS?

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,900
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER

432
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,000
AND YOU THOUGHT THAT IF YOU
WERE REALLY NICE TO A GUY

433
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
HE'D BE REALLY NICE BACK?

434
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,900
YES. OH, MY GOD, I
DID EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

435
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,500
I MEAN, I REALLY TREATED HIM WELL.

436
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,800
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU?

437
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
HE SLEPT WITH MY SISTER.
AND MY BEST FRIEND.

438
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
HEY, DUDE, CHECK OUT THE FRIEND.

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
YEAH, DUDE, SHE'S FINE.

440
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Max: YEAH, SHE IS BOMB.

441
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,300
BUT TAKE A CLOSE LOOK
AT ALL THESE PHOTOS.

442
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,700
DO YOU NOTICE ANYTHING?

443
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,000
A LOT OF THEM AREN'T FULL BODY SHOTS.

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,500
RIGHT.

445
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
THEY'RE TAKEN FROM HIGH ANGLES, TOO.

446
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
YEAH, LOTS OF THEM ARE
WEARING BABY DOLL DRESSES.

447
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

448
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
WHY DO WOMEN WEAR BABY DOLL DRESSES?

449
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,900
BECAUSE IT HIDES THEIR FAT ASSES.

450
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
SEE, ALL THESE PICTURES,

451
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,900
THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO
TRICK YOU IN SOME WAY.

452
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,300
THE PERSONAL AD IS A GREAT WAY

453
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,000
TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF WOMEN.

454
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO GET AN IDEA

455
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,900
OF HOW DECEITFUL THE AVERAGE GIRL IS.

456
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,200
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AVERAGE GIRLS.

457
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,300
I WANT YOU TO SEPARATE
OUT ALL THE HOTTIES,

458
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,100
AND THAT'S WHO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON.

459
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,300
THE TRICK IS TO GET THEM ALL EXCITED,

460
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,200
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM AGAIN,

461
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,900
LEAVE THEM WANTING MORE.

462
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,000
REALLY? OH, YEAH.

463
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
OKAY, THE NEXT TIME
YOU BRING A GUY HOME,

464
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,300
I WANT YOU TO GET OFF FOR HIM.

465
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,700
I MEAN, MAKE A HUGE SHOW. PORN-STYLE.

466
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,000
OHH! YEAH!

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
SEXY!

468
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,900
THAT'S IT!

469
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,200
THANK YOU.

470
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
AND THEN HE'LL BE SO EXCITED.

471
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,700
OHH, OHH!

472
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,000
BUT DON'T LET HIM PUT IT IN.

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
LEAVE WITHOUT GIVING YOUR NUMBER.

475
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,100
THAT WORKS? OF COURSE.

476
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
THE REJECTION PLAYS
ON THEIR INSECURITIES,

477
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,700
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT ALL MEN
REALLY CARE ABOUT IS TITS AND ASS.

478
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,300
THANK YOU. HA HA HA!

479
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,100
THEY WOULD SIT AROUND OGLING
US ALL DAY LONG IF THEY COULD.

480
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,300
( laughter )

481
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
OH, MAN, SHE WAS MADE TO GET LAID.

482
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,000
YOU GUYS CHECK THIS OUT,
27 LEVELS OF COMPATIBILITY.

483
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,700
IS HER ASS COMPATIBLE WITH MY DICK?

484
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
AND WHAT THE FUCK IS A CUPID SCORE, MAN?

485
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,900
JUST SHOW ME YOUR TITTIES.

486
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,400
RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT
MEN ARE DESIGNED TO DO.

487
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,900
GET WITH ATTRACTIVE WOMEN.

488
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
NOW, LOOK AT WHAT THEY
SAY, FIRST, "NO PLAYERS.

489
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,800
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A
HOOKUP, THEN MOVE ON, MISTER."

490
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
THEN WHY THE FUCK IS SHE STANDING

491
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,500
IN FRONT OF A FERRARI WITH HER TITS OUT?

492
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,400
RIGHT. IT'S TO GET YOU ALL RILED UP.

493
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,500
AND CHECK IT, "I'M LOOKING FOR A GUY

494
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,100
"WHO'S KIND AND LOYAL AND SPIRITUAL

495
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,000
AND CARING AND AMBITIOUS."

496
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,300
AMBITIOUS? DOESN'T REALLY FIT, RIGHT?

497
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,500
THE ONE COMMON WORD IN ALL THE HOTTIES.

498
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
YOU KNOW, "GENEROUS"
SEEMS TO CROP UP THE MOST.

499
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,300
YEAH, I'M GETTIN'
"GENEROUS" A BUNCH, TOO.

500
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE RIGHT
THERE. RIGHT, RIGHT.

501
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,900
BUT YOU CAN'T BE GENEROUS
IF YOU DON'T HAVE CASH.

502
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,100
YOU KNOW, THE WOMEN WE'RE
AFTER ARE MONEY-GRUBBING HOS.

503
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,500
GODDAMN RIGHT.

504
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
WE KNOW FROM CAVEMAN TIMES

505
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,500
THAT A MAN IS GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED

506
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,900
TO BE FAITHFUL FOR A
MAXIMUM OF THREE YEARS

507
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,000
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES
FOR AN INFANT TO LEARN HOW TO WALK.

508
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,300
THEN THEY LEAVE THE CAVE AND THE MOTHER

509
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,400
TO GO SPREAD THEIR SEED FAR AND WIDE.

510
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
IT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE,

511
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,300
SO FORGET ABOUT THAT FAIRY
TALE, GROWING OLD TOGETHER...

512
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,500
I LOVE FAIRY TALES.

513
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,100
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE SEEDS TO SPREAD,

514
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,200
BUT WE DO HAVE LEGS.

515
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
YEAH, WE DO!

516
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,400
EXACTLY. I MEAN, YOU GUYS ARE
ALL COOL AND HIPSTER LOOKING.

517
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,300
WHAT, ARE YOU IN A
BAND? YEAH, WE GOT BEATS.

518
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,100
YEAH, LIKE CREEPY BEATS. YOU
KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A GOTH VIBE

519
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,500
WITH, YOU KNOW, HIP-HOP.

520
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
YEAH, LIKE BAUHAUS MEETS BOWWOW,

521
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
BUT LIKE MORE PALE. ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

522
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,500
WITH A HINT OF C&C MUSIC FACTORY.

523
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
UNLESS YOU'RE FREDDY FUCKING MERCURY,

524
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,600
ALL THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
ABOUT BEING IN THE BAND

525
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
GETTING YOU LAID DOESN'T
APPLY WITH THESE CHICKS.

526
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,800
MAN, THESE CHICKS WERE GETTING
DICKED OVER BY BAND DUDES

527
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,500
WHEN YOU WERE STILL POPPING
ZITS ON YOUR HISTORY HOMEWORK.

528
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
THAT'S YOU, BUDDY!

529
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,800
AND THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT

530
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,100
ABOUT YOUR "GIG" AND YOUR CREEPY BEATS.

531
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,000
SO, LOOK, GO GET YOUR HAIR CUT,

532
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,600
GO SEE MY TAILOR-- HE'LL
GET GUYS ALL SORTED OUT--

533
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,700
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.

534
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,800
I'M SORRY. WAIT. TAILOR?

535
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,100
IS THIS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE?

536
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,200
YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE!

537
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

538
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,500
AND THIS THRIFT-STORE SHIT
AND THESE IRONIC T-SHIRTS--

539
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,300
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA CUT IT.

540
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
AND WHAT'S WITH THOSE GLASSES--
DO YOU EVEN NEED THOSE GLASSES?

541
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,100
NO, THEY'RE NOT FOR
SEEING. IT'S FOR THE LOOK.

542
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,600
YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE STUPID.

543
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,500
AND TAKE OUT THAT FUCKING NOSE RING.

544
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,400
JESUS, YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

545
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
AND BY GIVING A LITTLE BIT
TO A FEW DIFFERENT GUYS,

546
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
IF IT'S DONE WITH CLASS,

547
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,800
A WOMAN CAN EASILY SUPPORT HERSELF.

548
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,600
AND THE RICHER THE GUY,
THE BIGGER THE PAYOFF.

549
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT.

550
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,800
YOU SAID IT.

551
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,900
OKAY, I AM SO IN. WHERE
DO WE MEET THESE GUYS?

552
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,800
ELLE, GRETCHEN, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE THE NEW GIRLS OUT

553
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,100
AND SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE?

554
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,200
YEAH!

555
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
OH, MY GOSH, WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

556
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
( cheering )

557
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.

558
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,900
YOU GOT A CREDIT CARD, DON'T YOU?

559
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,400
YEAH. MY MOM'S. WELL, CHARGE IT.

560
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
LOOK, YOU GOTTA AT LEAST LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD THROW DOWN SOME CASH, ALL RIGHT?

561
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,300
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE UP, MAN.

562
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,800
I'M PAYING OFF MY STUDENT LOANS.

563
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,500
LOOK, DINGLEBERRY, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH.

564
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,300
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK RICH.

565
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,400
LOOK, MAN, I THOUGHT YOU WAS
JUST GONNA GIVE US SOME TIPS,

566
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,200
WE SPEND ALL THIS
MONEY... NIGGA, I'M BROKE.

567
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
ARE YOU OKAY, YVONNE?

568
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,200
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN HELP YOU WITH?

569
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
NOT REALLY.

570
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
ANYTHING YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH?

571
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,300
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
CHANGE ABOUT YOUR BODY?

572
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,600
NO. WHY?

573
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,700
YOU'D BE SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
IF YOU JUST GOT SOME BOOBS.

574
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,600
I LIKE MY BOOBS!

575
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,800
I KNOW, DEAR, BUT
THEY'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

576
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,600
LOCK IT IN. YOU GOT IT LOCKED
IN, NOW PUT SOME PRESSURE ON IT.

577
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,900
( choking )

578
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,800
YOU WANNA CUT OFF
CIRCULATION TO HIS BRAIN.

579
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
THAT'S GOOD. BONES, GOOD JOB.

580
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
THANKS. THANKS A LOT, JOHNNY.

581
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,900
THANKS, JOHNNY. YEAH, NO PROBLEM, GUYS.

582
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,700
HEY, NICE SHOES, GUY TOWN. VERY PRETTY.

583
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,600
FAGGOTS. COME ON, MAN.

584
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,300
IS THIS THE ONLY REASON YOU CALLED
US DOWN HERE WAS TO MAKE FUN OF US?

585
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,600
NO. IT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON.

586
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,300
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

587
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
I THINK I CAN HELP. NOW WHAT HAPPENED.

588
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,000
IT WENT PRETTY GOOD. YOU
KNOW, WE GOT TO THE VELVET,

589
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,500
YOU KNOW, WE MET THESE CHICKS,
WE WAS BUYING THEM DRINKS,

590
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,000
THEY WAS FEELING OUR NEW FLY
GEAR AND SHIT... AND MY HAIR.

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
YEAH, WE EVEN DEFENDED THEM FROM
THIS DUDE WHO TRIED TO SNAKE IN.

592
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
YEAH, MAN, BUT WHEN IT CAME
TIME TO CLOSE THE DEAL UP, MAN,

593
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,700
THIS DUDE INVITED THEM TO SOME JACUZZI
PARTY IN THE HILLS, AND THEY ALL BROKE OUT.

594
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,600
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
THEY WERE GONNA BE LIKE,

595
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
"NO, LET'S ALL GO BACK
TO MY PLACE AND FUCK"?

596
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,900
I WAS HOPING SO.

597
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,500
THERE PROBABLY WASN'T EVEN A PARTY,

598
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,000
BUT THE DUDE HAD A PLAN.

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,900
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

600
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,100
YOU TELL THEM YOU WANT TO HAVE
A PHOTO SHOOT AT YOUR STUDIO

601
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
AFTER THE BAR CLOSES.

602
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,100
WILL THEY GO FOR THAT? OF COURSE.

603
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,800
LOOK, THEY SPEND A LOT
OF MONEY TO LOOK GOOD,

604
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,500
SO YOU KINDA GOTTA PLAY TO THEIR VANITY.

605
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,200
OKAY, BUT WHERE ARE WE GONNA TAKE THEM?

606
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,900
I DUNNO, MAN, YOU'LL
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

607
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,500
HEY, JOHNNY, LET'S GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

608
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,600
WHAT ABOUT A CAMERA?
NO, I'VE GOT A CAMERA.

609
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
GOOD. BUT YOU ARE GOING TO
NEED TO GET A POLAROID, TOO.

610
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,500
POLAROID? THEY DON'T MAKE
THAT SHIT NO MORE. THAT'S OLD.

611
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,600
JOHNNY, LETS GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE, MAN. LET'S ROLL.

612
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,900
IT DOESN'T MATTER. LOOK, YOU SAID
YOU'D DO WHAT I TELL YOU, RIGHT?

613
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,700
TRUST ME. ALL RIGHT, MAN.

614
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
PATCH ON YOUR SHOULDER?

615
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,700
IT'S A FLEUR DE LIS. IT'S COOL.

616
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,800
NO, IT'S NOT COOL.

617
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,100
WELL...

618
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,700
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. BYE, LADIES.

619
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,000
Max: SO JOHNNY TOLD US
TO GET BACK ON THE HORSE,

620
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,800
BUT I THOUGHT HE SAID "WHORES."

621
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
YEAH. I'M UP AND COMING, THOUGH.

622
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,200
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.

623
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,900
OH. THIS IS SO OLD.

624
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,400
YOU WANNA COME BACK TO MY BUDDY
AARON'S STUDIO, HAVE A PHOTO SHOOT?

625
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
A PHOTO SHOOT?

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
ARE THOSE REAL?

627
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,300
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

628
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,800
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIND OUT...MAYBE.

629
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,000
YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER.

630
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
ARE THEY PROFESSIONAL?

631
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,100
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS.

632
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,300
LET'S DO IT. YOU GOT SOME
BOOZE BACK AT THE OFFICE RIGHT?

633
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
YEAH, YEAH. A LITTLE, A LITTLE.

634
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,900
WE COULD DO SOME SHOTS TOGETHER.

635
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,500
YEAH, LETS GO PARTY. COME ON.

636
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,800
UH, THIS IS OUR BACKDROP.

637
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,000
LIKE, USUALLY WE HAVE,
LIKE, MOUNTAINS AND LAKES

638
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND
INDIANS IN THE BACKGROUND,

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
BUT WE ON A TIGHT BUDGET NOW.

640
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.

641
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,400
OKAY, JUST LIKE LITTLE
CHICKEN STRIPS, THERE YOU GO.

642
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,200
LET ME GET SOME LIGHT. MOVE TO
THE RIGHT SOME. MOVE TO THE RIGHT.

643
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,300
RIGHT, NOW YOU'RE A TIGER. TIGERS.

644
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,000
RAWR! ( laughs )

645
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ALL RIGHT, YOU A CHEETAH.

646
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,300
YOU A JAGUAR. YOU A
LEOPARD. OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

647
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,500
( growling )

648
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,200
HO HO HO! SWEET!

649
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
MAN, THAT SHIT WAS
CRAZY. SO MANY TITTIES,

650
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,600
I JUST WANTED TO RUN DOWN AND GO...

651
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,100
NICE.

652
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,600
MAN, IT WAS FUCKING TITSVILLE.

653
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,500
SO, WHO'D YOU END UP WITH, AARON?

654
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,400
I ENDED UP WITH THE BLONDIE.
UH, COURTNEY. SHE'S SO COOL.

655
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,600
DUDE, I NEARLY MADE OUT
WITH THAT ASIAN CHICK.

656
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
YEAH, MAN, AND I WAS SNUGGLING UP

657
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,700
WITH SOME OF THE FIRMEST,
SMALLEST LITTLE TITTIES

658
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,400
YOU EVER WANNA GET UP AGAINST, MAN.

659
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
WAIT. "NEARLY MADE
OUT WITH"? "SNUGGLING"?

660
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,500
ARE YOU GUYS IN JUNIOR HIGH?

661
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,400
OKAY, WAIT. NONE OF YOU
GOT LAID OUT OF THIS?

662
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
FOR CHRISSAKES, YOU BROUGHT 'EM BACK,

663
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
YOU GOT 'EM FUCKED
UP-- WHAT HAPPENED?

664
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BOOZE.

665
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
YEAH, I BROKE OUT
MY VAPORIZER, BUT--

666
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,100
OKAY, NO BOOZE? WHY NOT?

667
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,000
WHAT IS THIS, AMATEUR HOUR?
AND, WHAT, A VAPORIZER?

668
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
NO, JOHNNY! I USE VAPORIZER!

669
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,200
OF COURSE YOU DO, SWEETHEART.

670
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,700
I LIKE. IT'S GREAT.

671
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,400
IT'S GREAT FOR WASTING WEED.

672
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
NO. NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT.

673
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
YOU HAVE TO SUCK HARD. I SUCK HARD.

674
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,300
I SUCK SO HARD. YOU KNOW I SUCK GOOD.

675
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,700
YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO, SWEETHEART.

676
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,600
YOU'RE SO BAD. YOU'RE BAD.

677
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
YOU'RE BAD. EVIL.

678
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,200
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SMOKING A BLUNT FOR?

679
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS COOL TO SMOKE HERE.

680
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
CLAUDIA. TIME FOR MY MEDICINE.

681
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,700
LOOK AT THIS SHIT. THIS
IS COLD-SORE CHRONIC.

682
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,100
I DON'T WANT YOUR HEPATITIS,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

683
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,300
THANK YOU, CLAUDIA.

684
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I USE A CARBONITE.

685
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,300
YOU GRIND IT UP FINE,
THE WATER COOLS THE SMOKE,

686
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,500
AND THE CARBON TRAPS THE GUNK.

687
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,600
HERE, CHECK IT.

688
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
BLACK SMOKE IN...

689
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,600
WHITE SMOKE OUT.

690
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,700
IT'S A MONSTER HIT, NO COUGHING.

691
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,500
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS HOW
YOU GET HER PROPERLY STONED.

692
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,700
THANKS, CLAUDIA.

693
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Max: OH, MAN, THAT'S TIGHT.

694
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,400
SO, ALL RIGHT,
WELL, NEXT TIME--

695
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
NO, NO, NO. NO NEXT TIME.

696
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
LATE-NIGHT WEED IS ONLY GONNA GET HER

697
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,500
HUNGRY OR TIRED OR PARANOID.

698
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,900
WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

699
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
WEED IS FOR DAYTIME.
COKE IS FOR NIGHTTIME.

700
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,500
YEAH, MAN, BUT WE DON'T REALLY DO COKE.

701
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,600
I DO. SINCE WHEN?

702
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,700
WELL, YOU DO NOW MAX. YOU'RE A BIG BOY.

703
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,600
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING YOU
TO SHOOT UP IN YOUR EYEBALL!

704
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,900
I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

705
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,200
OKAY, JOHNNY, ALL DONE. YOU LIKE?

706
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
I LIKE. THANK YOU.

707
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
OKAY, NOW I HAVE TO WAX YOUR BALLS.

708
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
OKAY, GO, GO, GO.

709
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,700
I HAVE TO WAX YOUR BALLS.

710
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,000
MAN, THESE CLOTHES, COKE...

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,900
WE'RE TURNING INTO HOLLYWOOD DOUCHEBAGS.

712
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,600
HEY, MAN, THAT'S HOW WE GONNA
GET THAT HOLLYWOOD TAIL, MAN.

713
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
RIGHT ON.

714
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
"THE MALE G-SPOT..."

715
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,600
ISN'T THAT HIS DICK? NO, IT'S HIS TAINT.

716
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
IT'S RIGHT BETWEEN THE
SCHLONG AND THE TURKEY GOBBLE.

717
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,700
( laughing )

718
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,600
NO, IT'S IN HIS ASSHOLE.

719
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,900
NASTY.

720
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,900
YOU GUYS LOOK SO CUTE. LOOK.

721
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,500
LET ME SEE.

722
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,000
AHH, THIS LOOKS LIKE SUCH A FUN NIGHT.

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,800
IT WAS OK. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUN,

724
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY
BOOZE OR DRUGS OR ANYTHING.

725
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,900
OH, I KNOW A GUY WE
CAN BUY SOME DRUGS FROM.

726
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,500
SWEETIE...WE'RE THE
REASON WHY GUYS BUY DRUGS.

727
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,800
AND IT'S NOT JUST DRUGS.
BEING HOT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

728
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,600
EVERY PENNY COUNTS.
WENDY, SHOW HER THE SCALE.

729
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,700
A BAG OF WEED AND A RIDE TO THE
AIRPORT IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.

730
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,600
FLASH THEM, YOU LET THEM JERK OFF.

731
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,500
AND SOME COKE OR A BOTTLE OF XANAX,

732
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,800
AND THEY MIGHT GET A HANDJOB.

733
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
SHOES OVER 500 BUCKS,
AND THEY MIGHT GET LAID.

734
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,600
IF YOU LIKE THE GUY.

735
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,000
STRIPPER SHOES, AND THEY MIGHT GET

736
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,900
TO SUCK A NIPPLE AND BEAT OFF...

737
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,100
NOW, IF IT'S A DAY AT THE
SPA, THAT COULD BE A BLOW JOB.

738
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,000
OR IF THEY HELP YOU MOVE,
THAT COULD BE ONE, TOO.

739
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,600
OKAY, BUT THAT'S ONLY IF
YOU'RE IN THE MOOD TO SUCK COCK.

740
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,500
OF COURSE. WHAT IS IT, COURTNEY?

741
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,900
UM, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S KIND
OF LIKE WE'RE PROSTITUTES.

742
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,600
( laughter )

743
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,700
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

744
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,900
HEY! PRIVATE PARTY!

745
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,500
ONCH. BACK IN YOUR ROOM.
WHERE YOU BELONG. GO.

746
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,200
OHH, TENANTS!

747
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
LOOK, GIRLS, IT'S NOT
AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD.

748
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HEARD ABOUT A GUY

749
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
WHO WAS TRYING TO JUGGLE
A CAREER AND A FAMILY?

750
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,600
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
CUTE AND YOUNG. THANKS!

751
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,900
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND
TO KEEP UP THE HOTNESS AS YOU AGE.

752
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,200
HOW MUCH IS THAT? A LOT.

753
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO END UP
AS STRETCH-MARKED SINGLE MOTHER

754
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
WITH A WASTOID HUSBAND WHO'S IN A BAND,

755
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,600
WHO CAN'T PAY CHILD SUPPORT OR ALIMONY,

756
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,100
YOU BETTER TO GET THAT MONEY.

757
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,600
I'M GOING TO TINKLE.

758
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
THAT'S WHAT THE T.O.B.
CLUB IS ALL ABOUT.

759
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,800
HOW DO YOU THINK WENDY GOT US OUR HOUSE?

760
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,300
I DON'T KNOW, HOW?

761
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,200
WELL, SHE WAS WORKING AT THIS TECH FIRM,

762
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
AND SHE STARTED SLEEPING
WITH THE OWNER...

763
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
AS WE ALL DO.

764
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
AND I THINK HE LIKED HER,

765
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,300
AND THEY BECAME VERY CLOSE.
I THINK HE EVEN LOVED HER.

766
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,600
OHH!

767
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,300
BUT HE WAS OLD, AND HE WAS JEWISH.

768
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,700
OHH.

769
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,000
YEAH. YEAH.

770
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,700
AVI... HI.

771
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,800
HI, HONEY.

772
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
I'VE FOUND THE PERFECT ONE.

773
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
YEAH, YEAH, SURE. NICE, NICE.

774
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
NO...LOOK.

775
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
NOT NOW.

776
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,100
OH, AVI, YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY.

777
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,000
YOU SHOULD JUST BUY ME A HOUSE.

778
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
I'M NOT BUYING YOU A HOUSE.

779
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,600
WELL, THE DOWN PAYMENT AT LEAST.

780
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,900
I COULD GET ROOMMATES
TO PAY FOR THE MORTGAGE.

781
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
WELL, WELL, IT WOULD APPRECIATE...

782
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,200
THE MARKET'S UP... MAYBE.

783
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,400
AND IT'D BE IN MY NAME, RIGHT?

784
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,700
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
IT'LL BE IN MY NAME.

785
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,200
NO, MY NAME.

786
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,900
LOOK, I BUY YOU ENOUGH STUFF ALREADY.

787
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
BUT YOU PROMISED AFTER A
YEAR, YOU'D BUY ME A HOUSE.

788
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,000
NO WAY DID I SAY THAT!

789
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,300
YES, YOU DID! YOU PROMISED!

790
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,100
NO WAY, I'M NOT BUYING YOU NO HOUSE!

791
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,000
FUCK YOU, YOU ASSHOLE LIAR!

792
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,500
FUCK YOU! NO! OW! OW!

793
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,800
MY PLUG! YOU FUCKING LITTLE BITCH!

794
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
I'M NOT BUYING YOU ANYTHING!

795
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
OWW! WRITE ME THE FUCKING CHECK.

796
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,300
FUCK YOU.

797
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,000
( gasps ) LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

798
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,400
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

799
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
GO AHEAD, CALL THEM.

800
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'LL CALL THEM,

801
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,400
AND I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

802
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,400
OH, YEAH, WHO ARE THEY GOING TO
BELIEVE, A 90-POUND LITTLE GIRL

803
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,800
OR AN OLD MAN WITH TWO DUIs WHO'S
BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSING ME AT WORK?

804
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,300
"I'M SORRY, OFFICER, SHE PULLED MY
HAIR, SO I BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HER."

805
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
GIVE ME THAT!

806
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
GIVE IT! GIVE ME IT!

807
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
GIVE IT, I'LL SCREAM.

808
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,400
GO AHEAD, SCREAM.

809
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,500
IT'S SWELLING UP!

810
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,400
YOU KNOW I'M A MODEL. HOW AM
I EVER SUPPOSED TO WORK AGAIN?

811
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
I NEVER LAID A HAND ON YOU.

812
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,100
OH, YEAH. LET'S SEE WHAT THE
JUDGE HAS TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

813
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE'LL
SEE WHAT THE JUDGE SAYS"?

814
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,900
I NEVER TOUCHED YOU.
YES, YOU DID, YOU BASTARD!

815
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,300
OH, MAN, FORGET WITH THE
PICTURES. I DIDN'T TOUCH YOU.

816
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,900
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.

817
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,200
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN. YOU WIN.

818
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,600
I'M GETTING OUT MY CHECKBOOK.
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU THE CHECK.

819
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
GOOD. YOU SHOULD.

820
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,200
NOW YOU GET YOUR STUFF, YOU PACK IT UP,

821
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,500
AND YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE.

822
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
JUST SIGN IT.

823
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,700
HERE'S YOUR CHECK.

824
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,600
IT'S WORTH A MEASLY HUNDRED
GRAND JUST TO GET RID OF YOU,

825
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,000
YOU SPITEFUL LITTLE CUNT.

826
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,300
BUT THEY CAME UP WITH A HAPPY SOLUTION,

827
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,500
AND THEY BOTH GOT WHAT THEY WANTED.

828
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
AS WE ALL SHOULD.

829
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,300
OKAY, LADIES...

830
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,300
OHH! OHH! WHAT IS THAT?

831
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,000
SEX TIP OF THE WEEK...

832
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,700
"TO DRIVE YOUR MAN CRAZY,
PLACE THE DONUT OVER THE SHAFT

833
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,200
AND GENTLY NIBBLE IT OFF."

834
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,400
OKAY, WHO WANTS TO HELP?

835
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,700
UH, LYRIC AND PAGE. COME ON.

836
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,600
( chanting ) DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

837
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,500
( indistinct shouting )

838
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,200
DUDE, JOHNNY'S GUY IS NOT
FUCKING AROUND. THIS SHIT IS NICE.

839
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,300
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BABY GLACIER.

840
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,600
THEY CALL IT FISH SCALE, LIKE
WHEN IT GLISTENS, YOU KNOW.

841
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,400
MAN, IF WE START SELLING THIS SHIT,

842
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,600
THEN I COULD ACTUALLY RAP ABOUT IT.

843
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,700
YEAH, RIBBITY RAP RAP, RAP ABOUT IT

844
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
DUDE, WE MAY NOT EVEN HAVE TO SELL IT.

845
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,200
THAT GIRL GRETCHEN CALLED ME.
SHE WANTS TO GET SOME OF THIS.

846
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
I'M THINKING I MIGHT
GET SOME OF THAT. HA.

847
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,200
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE ROCK OF COKE

848
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
IT LOOKS LIKE A BABY GLACIER

849
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,500
I MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME IF
YOU HIT ME ON THE PAGER

850
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
HIT YOU UP LATER

851
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,900
OH, I'M ONTO SOME
SHIT RIGHT HERE. RIGHT?

852
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
I HATE IT.

853
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,200
YOU NEED TO STOP HATIN'
'CAUSE YOU CANT RAP.

854
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,900
I'M NOT--WHY AM I A
HATER ALL OF A SUDDEN?

855
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,800
DON'T WORRY, YVONNE,
YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT,

856
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,500
BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO FIX THESE.

857
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,300
I'M FINE WITH THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.

858
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,500
I KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT
DID THE DOCTOR CALL?

859
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
YEAH. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO OUT
NEXT WEEK, BUT WHAT DO I DO?

860
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,400
IT'S EASY. HE'S A DOG,
SO JUST THROW HIM A BONE.

861
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,700
HE DID BOTH OF OURS, AND ELLE'S.

862
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,300
( sighs )

863
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,700
WHAT SIZE WOULD I GET?

864
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,500
SIZE DOESN'T MATTER, SWEETIE.

865
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,700
MINE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL.

866
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,000
MINE ARE BIG.

867
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,300
BUT WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE HERE.

868
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,000
GUYS LIKE GIRLS WITH IMPLANTS,

869
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,900
AND WE DIDN'T GET THEM
DONE TO PUT THEM AWAY.

870
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,500
SO WHEN IS YOUR DATE?

871
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,900
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

872
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,600
OKAY, SO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH HIM,

873
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,400
AND LET HIM TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT HE IS

874
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,000
AND LAUGH AT ALL OF HIS STUPID JOKES.

875
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,700
"OHH, OH, OH, IT HURTS, IT HURTS!"

876
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,300
"WELL, MRS. PLOTNICK, I THINK
YOU GOT A BROKEN FINGER."

877
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,700
( laughing )

878
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,500
YOU'RE SO FUNNY!

879
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,800
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

880
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,300
I WORK IN THE RESEARCH
LAB FOR A WHILE...

881
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,500
Big Wendy: TOUCH HIM A LITTLE BIT.

882
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,100
YOU'RE SO SMART.

883
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
YOU HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER HERE.

884
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,400
YOU ISOLATE THE TISSUE FROM THE RAT.

885
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,000
Little Wendy: HE'S GOING TO
INVITE YOU BACK TO HIS PLACE.

886
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
Yvonne: DO I GO?

887
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,800
Little Wendy: OF COURSE.

888
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
YOU'RE A MOUSE KILLER.

889
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,600
Big Wendy: IT'S $8,000 OTHERWISE...

890
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,900
PER TATA! LOOK AT YOU!

891
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,800
Little Wendy: SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS CAR.

892
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,800
Big Wendy: OH, THEY LOVE THEIR CARS.

893
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,800
OH, MY GOD. I LOVE YOUR CAR, BY THE WAY.

894
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,500
IT IS SO HOT.

895
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,700
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

896
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
HOW ABOUT YOUR PLACE?

897
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,700
AND THEN?

898
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,700
AND THEN I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU...

899
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,200
Little Wendy: ...AND GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

900
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
( whispering )

901
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,500
...LIKE, ALL OVER MY FACE AND LIPS.

902
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,700
OH, BABY, THAT'S SO HOT.

903
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,200
Yvonne: EWWW. DO I REALLY HAVE TO DO IT?

904
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,000
OF COURSE NOT, BUT YOU WANNA
KEEP HIS HEAD IN THE GAME.

905
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
EVERY MAN HAS SOMETHING
THAT DRIVES HIM CRAZY.

906
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,200
DR. EUGENE IS A NEAT FREAK, METROSEXUAL,
BUT, LIKE, TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW?

907
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,900
Big Wendy: HE'S A CLEAN FREAK

908
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,600
IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD.

909
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,200
BUT USE THAT AGAINST HIM.

910
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,800
MAKE A MESS, BEND OVER AND CLEAN IT UP.

911
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,900
HE'LL BE WET SOAP IN YOUR HANDS...

912
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,600
IT IS SO HOOKED UP. AND I LOVE THE
WAY YOU DECORATED THE PLACE, TOO.

913
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,500
IT IS SO NEAT.

914
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I LIKE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

915
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,800
AND IT IS SO CLEAN, TOO. I
MEAN, LOOK AT THIS TABLE...

916
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,400
YOU COULD PRACTICALLY
DO OPERATIONS OFF OF IT.

917
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,200
ONLY MY THOUGHTS ARE
DIRTY, MY DEAR YVONNE.

918
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,700
EXCEPT FOR THIS. I MEAN, IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR KNOB IS A LITTLE DIRTY.

919
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,800
DO YOU MIND IF I
JUST... POLISH YOUR KNOB?

920
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,900
( blows air )

921
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,700
A KNOB CANNOT BE TOO SHINY IN MY BOOK.

922
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,000
OH, YEAH, WELL, I LOVE TO CLEAN, TOO.

923
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,100
I'M A BIT OF A FREAK ABOUT IT
ACTUALLY. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

924
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,900
LOOK AT THIS MESS. WHY DON'T I
HELP YOU OUT AND CLEAN THIS FOR YOU?

925
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,000
( whirring )

926
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,000
LET ME SEE HOW THIS
FEELS! OHH...I LIKE THAT.

927
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,800
YEAH... I USE THE HOSE ATTACHMENT.
IT'S MY GUILTY PLEASURE.

928
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,000
I'M SURE YOU DO.

929
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,700
( whirring stops )

930
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,700
OH, LOOK AT THAT DIRTY GLASS.
LET ME HANDLE THAT FOR YOU.

931
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
THAT'S AMAZING!

932
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,900
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO GET MY DRESS WET,

933
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,500
SO I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE IT OFF.

934
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,200
( singing in foreign language )

935
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:39,300
WOW. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE ALMOST PERFECT.

936
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,200
ALMOST?

937
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
WITH A LITTLE SHAPING HERE AND THERE...

938
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
REALLY? BECAUSE I'M PRETTY
HAPPY WITH HOW I AM NATURALLY.

939
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,300
THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO FAKE.

940
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,200
OH, NOT IF I DO IT.

941
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,900
I'M THE BEST. LATEST
TECHNIQUES, TINY INCISIONS,

942
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,100
ATRAUMATIC PROCEDURES...
NO BRUISING AT ALL.

943
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
ALL RIGHT, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

944
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,300
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT, LOVE IT.

945
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
RIGHT NOW, I'D LOVE A DRINK.

946
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,000
OH, YOU WILL HAVE THAT.

947
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,900
NOT IF I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU. ( laughs )

948
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,500
HERE YOU GO.

949
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,300
Little Wendy: AND THEN
JUST SEAL THE DEAL.

950
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,900
( clink )

951
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,600
NO, I REALLY SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING NOW.

952
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,400
OH, PLEASE STAY. I'LL
DROP YOU IN THE MORNING.

953
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,600
NO, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO NOW.

954
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,300
BEFORE YOU GO DO YOU MIND IF I...

955
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,100
WHAT? TAKE A BITE OUT OF CRIME?

956
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
YEAH.

957
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,900
GO AHEAD.

958
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,600
OHH! WHOA! THAT'S FORWARD!

959
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,100
DO YOU MIND IF I... TOUCH MYSELF?

960
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,200
WHY DON'T I HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT?

961
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,600
( singing in foreign language )

962
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,100
LET ME GET MY PANTS OFF.

963
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,600
SO CLEAN... I KNOW
HOW YOU LIKE THAT SOAP.

964
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,000
HERE WE GO.

965
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,300
OHH.

966
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
OHH.

967
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,700
YOU LIKE THAT?

968
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,700
OH, YEAH. CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN?

969
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,200
MAYBE.

970
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,500
OHH. SCOUR IT, I DON'T CARE.

971
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,600
YEAH, RUB IT.

972
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
BUT IF I SEE YOU AGAIN, WE'LL
DEFINITELY BE CLEANING YOUR BEDROOM.

973
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,300
BEDROOM. YEAH.

974
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
DIRTY BEDROOM. DIRTY BEDROOM.

975
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,700
MUD TRACKING IN FROM OUTSIDE. OH, YEAH!

976
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,800

978
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,400
TWO GRAMS... ONE HUNDRED.

979
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,500
HMM, WELL, I DON'T HAVE
THE WHOLE HUNDRED...

980
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,200
BUT I HAVE THESE.

981
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
I ACCEPT THOSE.

982
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Max: ALL RIGHT, REMEMBER
WHAT JOHNNY EYELASH SAID...

983
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,300
DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

985
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,400
I HAVE THE SAME DRESS.

986
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,100
( women talking indistinctly )

987
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,300

YEAH, IT WAS OKAY.

991
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,200
SO DO YOU HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW?

992
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,300
NO. WELL, NOT UNTIL 6 P.M.

993
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,800
OKAY, DO YOU WANNA GET OUT
OF HERE? WE COULD SHARE A CAB.

994
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,400

995
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500

SO YOU WANNA GO BACK TO MY SPOT

997

998
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE AT HOME?

999
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
YEAH. A GRIP.

1000
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,300
OKAY. BUT NO FUNNY STUFF.

1001
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,400
I KNOW. ( scoffs )

1002
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400

1003
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,800
DAMN. AHH.

00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
NICE TOUCH. AHEM.

1005
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,500
MY SISTER AND HER FRIENDS, THEY'RE

1006
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,600
THERE'S THIS ONE GIRL CARLY-- SHE WALKS

1007
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,700
BUT THEN SHE WATCHED THE SECRET, AND I
WATCHED THE SECRET WITH MY FRIEND TIESTO.

1008
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,900
YOU KNOW WHO TIESTO IS, RIGHT?

1009
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,000
HUGE D.J. DOES ALL THE BIG PARTIES.

1010
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,000
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT ATKINS DIET.

1011
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,400
THAT'S TOO MANY RULES FOR ME.

1012
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,700

1018
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,000
( whistling )

1019
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,900
YEAH, THIS ONE, THIS
IS WHEN I WAS IN FRANCE.

1020
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,600
REALLY AWESOME TRIP. YOU SEE THIS
GUY? HE'S PRETTY GOOD-LOOKING, HUH?

1021
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,900
SO GOOD IN BED. YEAH,
BUT HE'S A BIT BORING.

1022
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,800
HELL, YES. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1023
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,000
HEY, YOU GOT ANY MORE BLOW?

1024
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,700

UH, I WAS WONDERING, UH...

1027
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,200
BEFORE YOU LEFT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND

1028
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,800
IF I JUST LOOK AT YOU
AND BEAT OFF TO YOU?

1029
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,200
I SAID NO FUNNY STUFF.

1030
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU SAID
THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

1031
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
WE STARTED LOOKING AT

1032
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,800
LOOK, I'LL EVEN DO IT OVER HERE.

1033
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,300
OKAY, FINE.

1034
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,300

1038
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,700
NOW I'M GOING TO GET MY FUCK ON.

1039
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,900
IS THIS GONNA TAKE MUCH LONGER?

1040
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,000
CAN YOU SHOW ME YOUR NIPPLE?

1041
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,800

OH, YES. THAT'LL DO.

1043
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,500
IT'S GETTING LIGHT OUTSIDE. I HATE THAT.

1044
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,900
DO NOT GET ANY OF THAT ON ME.

1045
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
ALL RIGHT. AH, THAT'S IT.

00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,800
YEAH, IT BETTER BE IT, 'CAUSE

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,200
AND BEFORE YOU CAN SAY,
"THREE-DOLLAR COKE WHORE,"

1095
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
THIS MORNING WE WOKE UP,
AND I MADE HER BREAKFAST.

1096
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,700
WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. DUDE,
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD GIRL.

1097
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,500
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I'M GOING
TO ASK HER TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

1098
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,400
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING HER!

1099
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,700
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE'S
NOT ALL MONEY-GRUBBING.

1100
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,300
YEAH, MAYBE NOT YET, BUT...

1101
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,100
I USED TO BE LIKE YOU.
ALL WIDE-EYED AND IN LOVE.

1102
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,500
IT'S OVER! COME ON, WEN, PLEASE!

1103
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,100
DON'T GO WITH THIS BOOB! YOU
LIKE MY HAIR AND MY SHOES,

1104
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,300
BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY
FOR IT WITH YOUR STUPID LYRICS?

1105
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,500
JESUS, WEN, I'M SORRY, OKAY? COME ON.

1106
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
GET A JOB, DICKWAD.
FUCK YOU, QUEERBURGER!

1107
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,200
WENDY! WENDY!

1108
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,600
COME ON, MAN!

1109
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,400
...BUT I DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

1110
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,900
LISTEN, THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE THAT, BRO.

1111
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,600
BLAZE OUT, BRO.

1112
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,200
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

1113
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,300
HERE, COME WITH ME. LET
ME SHOW YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

1114
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,200
ALL RIGHT, TAKE A LOOK
AROUND, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

1115
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,700
TITTIES. THAT'S RIGHT.

1116
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,500
YOU GOT YOUR CHERRIES,

1117
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
APRICOTS,

1118
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,400
TANGERINES,

1119
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,500
LEMONS,

1120
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,600
CANTALOUPES,

1121
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,600
OH, AND, OF COURSE, WATERMELONS.

1122
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,900
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FRUIT ARE THOSE?

1123
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,500
THAT IS AN ASIAN PEAR.

1124
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,900
HEY, CHECK IT OUT... A
GRANNY SMITH! HA HA HA!

1125
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,900
NICE. BUT, LOOK, ALL THESE
TITTIES AIN'T FOR FREE.

1126
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,600
CHECK OUT THIS COUPLE OVER HERE.

1127
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,500
WHO DO YOU THINK PAID FOR THAT MEAL?

1128
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
THE DUDE?

1129
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
THAT'S RIGHT.

1130
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,000
TAKE A LOOK OVER THERE.
WHO'S BUYING THOSE CLOTHES?

1131
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,500
DEFINITELY THE DUDE.

1132
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,800
LOOK AT THIS GUY IN HERE.

1133
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,900
HUNDRED BUCKS FOR THAT ROUND, AT LEAST.

1134
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,800
AND TRUST ME, HE AIN'T
NAILING ALL OF THEM.

1135
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
IS HE, AARON?

1136
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,300
I DON'T KNOW.

1137
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,800
CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT
THE ROCK ON HER FINGER.

1138
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT RING!

1139
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,900
AND WHO PAID FOR IT?

1140
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,700
THE MAN. THAT'S RIGHT.

1141
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,400
AND WHEN SHE GETS HOME,
SHE'S GONNA DROP THOSE PANTIES

1142
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,600
LIKE MY IPHONE DROPS CALLS.

1143
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,500
LOOK, ALL THESE HOLLYWOOD
CHICKS WANT SOMETHING,

1144
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,800
AND SEX IS THEIR CURRENCY.

1145
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,600
I HAVEN'T SEEN COURTNEY
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1146
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,300
WHY DON'T YOU STOP BY HER WORK TONIGHT,

1147
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,400
AND YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE?

1148
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,900
YO, DUDE, MAN, WE'VE BEEN
GETTING SOME WORTHY TAIL LATELY.

1149
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,800
MAN, I THINK YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.

1150
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,400
YEAH, OR JUST MAKE HER YOUR GIRLFRIEND

1151
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,600
AND THEN SEE OTHER ONES ON THE SIDE.

1152
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,800
NO. WHY NOT?

1153
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
NO! NO, LOOK, YOU DON'T CHEAT.

1154
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,600
IT'S NOT COOL, EVER,
AND THERE'S NO NEED TO.

1155
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,000
LOOK, GUYS, DON'T DATE ONE
CHICK THAT YOU'RE FAITHFUL TO.

1156
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,600
YOU DATE LOTS OF
CHICKS, YOU ROTATE THEM,

1157
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,900
AND YOU BE HONEST ABOUT IT.

1158
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,700
LOOK, GUYS, I ALWAYS WANTED A SON,

1159
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,500
BUT AT THIS POINT, IT'S
PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

1160
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,500
I WANTED HIM TO BE PREPARED
WHEN DEALING WITH THE UNFAIR SEX,

1161
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,700
SO I RECORDED SOME LITTLE
NUGGETS OF WISDOM ON THIS.

1162
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,100
BUT BE CAREFUL WITH IT, ALL RIGHT?

1163
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,900
THERE'S A LOT THERE.

1164
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,700
GOOD LUCK PICKING UP CHICKS
NOW, MOTHERFUCKER, PIECE OF SHIT!

1165
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,200
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!

1166
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,600
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T CHEAT.

1167
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,900
BUT IF YOU DO, STICK
TO YOUR FUCKIN' STORY.

1168
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,200
PAPA SMURF CALLED! HE WANTS
HIS DICK BACK! OH, YEAH?!

1169
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,700
GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, RIGHT NOW!

1170
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,100
SADIE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1171
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,200
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!

1172
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,700
IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT BEING
HONEST AND STRAIGHT UP,

1173
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,600
YOU KNOW, OWNING YOUR INNER PIG.

1174
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,100
Woman: STILL UPSET ABOUT
THE FIGHT WITH JOHNNY.

1175
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,800
CAME HOME AND GOT DRUNK AND
HAD SEX WITH MY NEIGHBOR FRANK.

1176
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,200
IT FELT GREAT.

1177
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,800
I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT A MAN ANYMORE.

1178
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,900
NEVER READ YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S DIARY.

1179
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,900
GIRLS LIKE A TAKE-CHARGE GUY.

1180
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,900
SO YOU JUST LAY DOWN WHAT YOU WANT,

1181
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
TELL HER YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A GIRLFRIEND UPFRONT,

1182
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,800
AND SHE CAN'T NEVER ACCUSE
YOU OF BEING AN ASSHOLE.

1183
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,900
( moans ) YES, JOHNNY...

1184
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,200
OH, THAT'S GOOD RIGHT
THERE. THAT'S GOOD. AHH!

1185
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,000
RIGHT THERE. OHH! NO!

1186
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,400
WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR?

1187
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,700
WHAT THE FUCK?

1188
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,700
THAT'S WEIRD. I JUST WAXED YESTERDAY.

1189
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,000
NO, THIS IS NOT YOUR
PUBE. YOUR PUSSY'S BALD!

1190
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,200
OH, I KNOW WHO THAT WAS.
THAT WAS--NEVER MIND.

1191
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,800
NEVER GO DOWN ON A
STRIPPER YOU JUST MET.

1192
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
DOUBLE-BOOKING BITCH.

1193
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,800
ALTHOUGH GIRLS WANT
TO FUCK AND DO DRUGS,

1194
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,300
THEY FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT. I
MEAN, THEY WANT TO GET DOWN,

1195
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,300
BUT THEY KIND OF WANT
TO BE "TRICKED" INTO IT.

1196
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,000
THIS IS RETARDED. BE STRAIGHT
UP AND HONEST WITH THEM,

1197
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
BUT THEN GET THEM HIGH AND
WASTED AND TRICK THEM INTO IT?

1198
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,400
YOU MAKE THAT SOUND
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

1199
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,000
I WISH I COULD GET
DRUNK AND HIGH FOR FREE.

1200
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,500
YEAH. THEY SHOULD BE THANKING US.

1201
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS. I'M
GOING TO SEE MY GIRLFRIEND.

1202
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,000
THERE'S A REASON THEY
CALL IT "COMMITTED," AARON.

1203
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,200
YOU'RE GONNA BE AT SOME PARTY, WASTED,

1204
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,800
AND SOME HOTTIE'S GONNA BE JOCKING YOU,

1205
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,100
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SLIP UP, MAN.

1206
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,400
I'M OUT. PFFT.

1207
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,900
YO, MAN. LATERS.

1208
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,200
YOU GUYS GOT YOUR ASSIGNMENTS, RIGHT?

1209
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
JUST REMEMBER, JUST BE STRAIGHT UP,

1210
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,200
AND TELL HER, "WE CAN SLEEP TOGETHER,

1211
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,900
BUT I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.
NO DINNERS, VALENTINES."

1212
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,800
SHE CAN FIND SOME OTHER SUCKER FOR THAT.

1213
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,400
HUH? I MEAN, I'M SORRY, MAN.

1214
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,000
THIS CANDY BAR IS KICKING IN, MAN.

1215
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I KNOW WE WAS TALKING
ABOUT FRUITS EARLIER, RIGHT?

1216
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,800
I'M SORRY, MAN. YOU TAPE-RECORDED IT?

1217
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,500
OH, NO, THAT WAS ANOTHER TAPE RECORDER.

1218
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,100
I'LL REMEMBER FOR REAL, I'M SORRY.

1219
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,800
Woman: FOR YOU

1220
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,100
I'D TRAVEL

1221
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,000
AROUND THE WORLD

1222
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,500
FOR YOU

1223
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
I'D DO

1224
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,000
ANYTHING

1225
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,300
'CAUSE YOU

1226
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,200
ARE EVERYTHING

1227
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,300
THE FEELING IS LOVE, THE FEELING IS LOVE

1228
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,900
THE FEELING IS LOVE, THE FEELING IS LOVE

1229
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,000
THE FEELING IS LOVE, THE FEELING IS LOVE

1230
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,400
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND, WHEN YOU'RE AROUND

1231
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,000
THE FEELING IS LOVE

1232
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,400
HEY, HUN, I'M GONNA
SPLIT. I'M REALLY HORNY.

1233
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,500
DON'T LEAVE ME WITH HIM!

1234
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,800
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT ELLE SAID?

1235
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,500
YEAH. ELLE IS A TOTAL DRAMA QUEEN.

1236
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,100
I MEAN, LOOK, HE'S REALLY NICE...

1237
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,400
AND FUNNY.

1238
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,800
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME YET.

1239
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,300
AND HE IS KIND OF CUTE.

1240
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,300
SEE? YOU ARE GONNA BE FINE.

1241
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,300
I JUST HOPE HE'S NOT AN ASSHOLE.

1242
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,800
YO, MAN, YOU WANNA GO
TO THIS PARTY LATER?

1243
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,500
NO. IT'S GONNA SUCK.
IT'S JONZO'S PLACE, MAN.

1244
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,600
YO, I'M GOING HOME TO GET SOME ASS.

1245
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,300
YOU SHOULD TAKE HER. SHE'S BANGING.

1246
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,200
MAYBE I WILL.

1247
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,300
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

1248
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,500
THAT WE'RE GOING TO THIS
PARTY JUST AS FRIENDS.

1249
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:46,400
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE
SPLITTING THIS CAB FARE...JUST AS FRIENDS.

1250
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,400
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH ON ME. WHY
DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE?

1251
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,500
( humming )

1252
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
( deep breathing )

1253
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,700
( moaning )

1254
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,300
COURTNEY, I AM YOUR FATHER.

1255
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,800
EW, GROSS.

1256
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
( laughing ) NO, BABE, IT'S JUST ME.

1257
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,300
NO, NO, NO. YOU HAVE TO BE THE
HELPLESS PRINCESS, REMEMBER?

1258
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,500
YEAH, CAN YOU MAKE THAT THING VIBRATE?

1259
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,300
UM, SHOOT, I DON'T THINK SO.

1260
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,800
I THINK THAT'S ONLY THE DELUXE EDITION.

1261
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,000
YEAH.

1262
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,700
Johnny: USE HER ADDICTIONS AGAINST HER.

1263
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,500
GO AHEAD, FUCK WITH THAT ONE, TOO.

1264
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,900
ALL RIGHT.

1265
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,800
Johnny: OWN YOUR INNER PIG.

1266
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,300
HERE YOU GO.

1267
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,600
NO, I'M GOOD. I'VE GOT A DEADLINE.

1268
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,000
I COULD REALLY USE
TOMORROW TO CATCH UP. SO...

1269
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,300
ARE YOU FOR REAL? I
MEAN, I JUST GOT HIGH.

1270
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,700
IF YOU LIKE, I CAN BLOW EVERYTHING
OFF THAT I GOT TO DO TOMORROW,

1271
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,500
AND WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN, BUT I
GOTTA LET YOU KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT,

1272
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,100
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE
HIGH AND DRUNK AND IN MY BED,

1273
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,200
AND I'M GOING TO NEED
TO BUST A NUT. NEED TO?

1274
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
YEAH. I MEAN, I'M SORRY FOR
BEING SO HONEST AND OPEN ABOUT IT,

1275
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,800
BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, THEN MAYBE
WE SHOULD MEET FOR COFFEE SOMETIME

1276
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,900
AND REALLY GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER, TAKE IT NICE AND SLOW...

1277
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,700
FINE.

1278
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,600
FINE FOR THE NUTBUSTING?

1279
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
WHATEVER.

1280
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,000
JUST FILL UP MY DRINK, PLEASE.

1281
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,900
DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN A MAN ORGASMS

1282
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,600
IT RELEASES A CHEMICAL THAT'S 20 TIMES
STRONGER THAN A NORMAL SLEEPING PILL?

1283
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,800
THIS IS SOME LADY AND
THE TRAMP SHIT RIGHT HERE.

1284
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,700
( laughing )

1285
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,600
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE. YOU'VE
BEEN FLAGGED ON THE DATERBASE.

1286
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,600
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW. WHAT'S A DATERBASE?

1287
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,300
JUST SHUT UP AND KISS ME.

1288
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,100
OH, YEAH. OH. OH, YEAH.

1289
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,300
( crickets chirping, owl hooting )

1290
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
BABE, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT OUTFIT?

1291
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,600
THANK YOU. IT'S MY APRON.

1292
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,100
I WORE IT UNDER MY DRESS LAST NIGHT

1293
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,700
SO I COULD COOK YOU
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING.

1294
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,100
AH, I AM TAKING YOU OUT. BABY,
DO YOU WANNA GO TO THE ZOO?

1295
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,600
YES! I LOVE THE ZOO.
ANIMALS ARE MY FAVORITE.

1296
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,000
OH, ME TOO. THAT'S PERFECT.
IT'S A DONE DEAL. WE'RE DOING IT.

1297
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,100
UM, BABE, CHECK OUT MY...

1298
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,000
TROUSER ELEPHANT.

1299
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
HA HA HA.

1300
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,900
DO YOU WANT ME TO COME PULL ITS TRUNK?

1301
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,600
( elephant trumpets )

1302
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,100
SO...YOU GONNA TAKE ME TO BREAKFAST?

1303
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,800
( laughs ) BREAKFAST?!
AIN'T NO BREAKFAST, BABY.

1304
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,900
I DON'T ROLL LIKE THAT. YOU
HAD FUN LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

1305
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,000
YEAH. EVENTUALLY.

1306
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,100
HEY, THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
MY PERFORMANCE. THAT WAS THE COKE.

1307
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,100
ANYWAYS, IF WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE
YOU OUT TO DINNER ALL THE TIME

1308
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,900
AND CALL YOU UP EVERY DAY,

1309
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,300
THAT AIN'T ME. THAT'S
BOYFRIEND TERRITORY.

1310
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,100
LOOK, I'M JUST HUNGRY.

1311
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,200
YOU DON'T GOTTA BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

1312
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,900
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SOME
ASSHOLE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING.

1313
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,200
PSHH. WHATEVER.

1314
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,000
DICK.

1315
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,900
Johnny: IF SHE'S ASKING
FOR TOO MUCH CAB FARE,

1316
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,800
TAKE A TWENTY OUT OF HER PURSE
WHILE SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM

1317
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,300
AND GIVE IT TO HER.

1318
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,000
IT'S NOT STEALING IF YOU GIVE IT BACK.

1319
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,900
DUDE, THIS STUFF IS GOLD!

1320
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,300
HEY, AARON, THOUGHT YOU'D
BE MARRIED OFF BY NOW.

1321
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,200
UM, SHE'S A GOOD GIRL. IT COULD HAPPEN.

1322
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,400
UH, JUST KEEPING MY
OPTIONS OPEN FOR NOW.

1323
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,900
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MAX? HOW'S IT GOING?

1324
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,400
OH, MAN, SHIT WENT PERFECT, YO.

1325
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,900
IT'S JUST ONE THING, THOUGH, MAN...

1326
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,200
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

1327
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,300
WITH THE COKE AND THE CONDOMS, MAN...

1328
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,900
I KIND OF HAD A LITTLE
BIT OF PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

1329
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,900
REALLY? WHAT, ARE YOU GAY NOW?

1330
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,900
ALL YOU NEED IS... ONE OF THESE.

1331
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
WHAT'S THAT, MAN?

1332
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,800
UGH. DUDE, WHY'S IT ALL
SLIPPERY? WHAT IS THAT?

1333
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,900
THAT'S JUST LUBE. IT'S MY COCK RING.

1334
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,100
OHH! WHAT THE FUCK! ARE YOU KIDDING?

1335
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,100
GUYS, I'M TELLING YOU, NO
MATTER WHAT STATE I'M IN,

1336
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,000
IT KEEPS ME TURGID, AND IT
ALWAYS, ALWAYS GET'S ME OFF.

1337
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,100
YO, I PUT THAT SHIT ON MY NOSE, YO!

1338
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,500
AND WHAT THE FUCK IS "TURGID"?

1339
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,600
"TURGID" MEANS HARD. HOW DUMB ARE YOU?

1340
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,000
OH, I'M GONNA USE THAT SHIT.
"GIRL, YOU GOT MY DICK TURGID."

1341
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,100
AND I KNOW WITH ALL THE
ALCOHOL AND THE DRUGS,

1342
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,200
SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH, SO I
ALWAYS KEEP ONE OF THESE BABIES AROUND.

1343
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
THOSE ARE LIKE 50
BUCKS EACH. EVERY TIME?

1344
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,100
JESUS, FUCKFACE.

1345
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,900
LOOK, YOU GENTLY TAKE IT OUT OF
THE BOX, YOU CAREFULLY CUT IT OPEN.

1346
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,100
EVERY TIME YOU USE IT, YOU PUT
IT IN THE DISHWASHER, GOOD AS NEW.

1347
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,400
OH, YEAH. ECONOMICAL.

1348
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,200
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT CONDOMS?

1349
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,900
MAN, I HATE CONDOMS, MAN.

1350
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,600
IT'S LIKE EATING A SNICKERS
WITH THE WRAPPER ON.

1351
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
LOOK, THE FIRST COUPLE OF
TIMES YOU KIND OF HAVE TO, BOYS.

1352
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,500
FUCK THAT. JUST DO WHAT I DO.

1353
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,400
YOU CUT A HOLE RIGHT IN THE
TIP OF THE CONDOM, RIGHT?

1354
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,300
JUST LIKE THAT.

1355
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,500
AND IT WEARS AWAY AS YOU
GET GOING, THEN IT BREAKS.

1356
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,400
THE BEAUTY OF IT IS,
WHEN SHE LOOKS DOWN,

1357
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,200
IT STILL LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE WEARING ONE.

1358
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,400
I JUST TOLD HER IT RIPPED
BECAUSE MY DICK'S TOO BIG.

1359
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,700
DUDE, THAT IS FUCKED UP ON SO MANY
LEVELS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

1360
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,300
WHAT?

1361
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,700
"WHAT?"

1362
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

1363
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,300
ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE HAVE HERPES.

1364
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,700
ONE IN FOUR WARTS.

1365
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:02,400
THROW IN CHLAMYDIA, CRABS, U.T.I.,

1366
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,100
THEN YOU RAMP IT UP BECAUSE
WE'RE IN HOLLYWOOD...

1367
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,600
AND THE CHANCES THAT ONE OF THESE CHICKS

1368
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,300
THAT YOU GUYS ARE TAKING HOME
HAS "SOMETHING" IS ABOUT...

1369
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,300
72%.

1370
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
GRETCHEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1371
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,500
OH, I'M PUTTING A FABRIC
SOFTENER SHEET DOWN MY PANTS

1372
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,600
SO LATER TONIGHT WHEN
I TAKE MY JEANS OFF,

1373
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,500
IT'LL BE NICE AND FRESH DOWN THERE.

1374
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,100
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

1375
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,400
RIGHT?

1376
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,200
DOES THAT MAKE YOUR SKIN SOFT?

1377
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,300
OH, GOD, I HOPE IT DOESN'T
MAKE HIS DICK SOFTER! UGH!

1378
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,300
I GOT A DATE TONIGHT.
LET ME TRY SOME OF THAT.

1379
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,100
SO ARE YOU GIRLS ALL
SET FOR THE INITIATION?

1380
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,800
YEAH, WE ARE.

1381
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,600
YEAH. OH. CAN I STILL JOIN
IF I HAVE GOT A BOYFRIEND?

1382
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,200
HE BETTER GO DOWNY ON ME
AFTER ALL THAT TROUBLE!

1383
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,200
NO. THAT DEFIES THE WHOLE POINT.

1384
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,600
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE
USING HIM FOR SOMETHING.

1385
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,800
I JUST LIKE HIM. I LIKE
THE WAY HIS HAIR SMELLS,

1386
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,900
I LIKE HIS SMILE, I LIKE WAKING
UP NEXT TO HIM, I LIKE HIS COCK.

1387
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,500
COURTNEY, COURTNEY, YOU
CANNOT SEE THIS GUY ANYMORE.

1388
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,800
WHAT? WHY?

1389
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,600
BECAUSE HE WILL DICK YOU OVER.

1390
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,900
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE MADE.

1391
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,600
IF IT'S SEX YOU WANT,
WE'LL FIND A GUY FOR YOU.

1392
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,400
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DO YOU WANT
A NERD, DO YOU WANT A BAD BOY?

1393
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,700
WHAT, AND I JUST FUCK THEM?

1394
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,600
FIRST, YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM

1395
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,300
THAT HE CAN'T CALL YOU AFTERWARDS,

1396
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,900
AND IF HE SEES YOU OUT SOMEWHERE,

1397
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,800
HE'S GOTTA WALK IN
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

1398
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,300
THAT'S CRAZY. I REALLY,
REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.

1399
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,900
I KNOW, BUT IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

1400
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,600
NOW, YVONNE,

1401
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,500
DID THE DOCTOR SET A DATE
FOR YOUR IMPROVEMENTS YET?

1402
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,900
YEAH. THREE WEEKS.

1403
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,500
I KNEW HE WOULD DRAG IT OUT A BIT.

1404
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,900
A FEW DAYS IN OUTPATIENT,

1405
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,400
AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN!

1406
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,600
RIGHT ON.

1407
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,400
( knock on door )

1408
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,700
HEY.

1409
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,400

AH-AH-AH.

1410
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,900
( sighs )

1411
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE BY YOURSELF?

1412
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,400
OH, MY GOD, YOU REMIND
ME OF BEETLEJUICE.

1413
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,900
REMEMBER THOSE LEGS THAT
WAS SITTING BY THEMSELVES?

1414
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,000
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

1415
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,500
WHERE YOU KNOW ME FROM?

1416
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,100
DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE. NASTY.

1417
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,800
MAN, WHAT? MAN, THIS
LOOKS LIKE SOME--

1418
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,000
HEY, THIS AIN'T EVEN TRUE.
THEY TRYING TO SET ME UP.

1419
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,600
THEY TRYING TO SAY I DISHONORABLY
DISCHARGED, BUT THAT EVEN TRUE.

1420
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,000
OHH!

1421
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,100
OH, FUCK!

1422
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,900
OH, SHIT. OH, MAN, SORRY, MAN.

1423
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,100
FUCK.

1424
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,100
I KNOW THAT GUY.

1425
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,600
DID YOU DO SOME?

1426
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,700
NO. HE JUST CAME BY TONIGHT.

1427
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,200
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

1428
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,800
I KNOW.

1429
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,000
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?

1430
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,900
NO.

1431
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,700
I JUST GET SO HORNY.

1432
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,600
WE ALL GET A LITTLE
BIT HORMONAL SOMETIMES,

1433
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,200
BUT, NEXT TIME, SPECIFY AN AMOUNT,

1434
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,600
OR HE'S GONNA HAVE YOU WHORING
YOURSELF OUT FOR LITTLE KIBBLES, OKAY?

1435
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,000
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1436
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,300
WENDY, CAN I TALK TO
YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER?

1437
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,800
OKAY.

1438
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,700
( sighs )

1439
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,800
OKAY, LADIES, AS YOU KNOW,

1440
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,300
YVONNE WILL BE GETTING HER ENHANCEMENTS
THIS WEEK, THUS ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP.

1441
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,000
( cheering )

1442
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
WHAT DAY, YVONNE?

1443
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,700
HE SAYS I GO IN ON FRIDAY,
AND I'LL BE OUT BY SATURDAY.

1444
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,900
SO SATURDAY NIGHT. DOES
THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE?

1445
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,100
YEAH. YES. YES.

1446
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,700
OOH OOH!

1447
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,100
15 SECONDS. EXCELLENT WORK,
MAX. CONGRATS ALL AROUND.

1448
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,100
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOUR STABLES
DEVELOPING. I'M UP TO FOUR NOW.

1449
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,400
YOU STILL TAKING DRUGS TO
THAT STRIPPER CHICK? YUP.

1450
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,000
SHE'S FUCKING YOU NOW
RIGHT? LIKE I'M JOHNNY DEPP.

1451
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,200
NICE. AND NOW CAN BRING AS
MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS YOU LIKE.

1452
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,900
DUDE, I'M GETTING LAID FOR DUB-SACKS!

1453
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,900
SWEET!

1454
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,800
UM, WHERE'S COURTNEY?

1455
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,500
SHE SAID SHE CAN'T COME ANYMORE.

1456
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,200
WHY NOT?

1457
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
BECAUSE SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND NOW,

1458
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,800
AND SHE SAID IT WOULD BE UNFAIR
TO COME TO A MAN-HATING GROUP.

1459
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,400
WHAT? WHAT? WHATEVER.

1460
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,400
WE DON'T HATE MEN.

1461
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,200
WE JUST KEEP THEM ON TASK, SWEETIE.

1462
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,400
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU, AARON?

1463
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,000
I'VE BEEN DABBLING,

1464
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,800
BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE GIRL FOR ME.

1465
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,400
YEAH, WHEN SHE'S IN TOWN.

1466
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
OH! OH HO HO!

1467
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,800
WHAT?

1468
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,000
IT'S THAT COURTNEY AGAIN, RIGHT?

1469
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,100
YEAH.

1470
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,900
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT YOUR OTHER CHICKS?

1471
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,800
UH, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
I LIKE TO BRING UP.

1472
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,000
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ROTATING HER, RIGHT?

1473
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,600
WHAT?

1474
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,500
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE HER?

1475
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,900
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE TWO,
THREE, FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

1476
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,300
AARON, YOU HAVE TO ROTATE THEM.

1477
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,000
SHE'LL BE BACK.

1478
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I HOPE SO. I REALLY LIKED HER.

1479
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,100
I REALLY LIKED HER, TOO.

1480
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,600
I THINK SHE'S REALLY INTO HIM.

1481
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,200
AARON, RIGHT? SHORT, DUMB-LOOKING?

1482
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,500
( laughter )

1483
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,100
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, HE'S A MAN,

1484
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,600
AND HE'S HARDWIRED TO CHEAT.

1485
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,500
OH, I THINK HE ALREADY DID.

1486
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,300
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

1487
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,200
I SAW LAST WEEK HIM AT A PARTY
ALL OVER SOME UGLY-ASS GIRL.

1488
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,600
LAST SATURDAY AT ROSS'S? YEAH.

1489
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,900
WAS THAT GUY MAX THERE? YEAH.

1490
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,100
( warbling sounds )

1491
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,000
MY EARRING COLLECTION IS GROWING DAILY.

1492
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,400
AH, YES. THE "LEAVE BEHIND."

1493
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,500
DO THEY MEAN TO LEAVE
THIS SHIT AT YOUR APARTMENT

1494
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,400
OR ARE THEY JUST TOO HUNGOVER
TO REMEMBER? WHO KNOWS?

1495
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,400
IT'S LIKE HOW DO THEY NOT KNOW THAT
THEY LEAVE NOT WEARING THEIR OWN PANTIES?

1496
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,100
THAT SHIT IS DUMB!

1497
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,400
LET ME SEE THIS HAIRCLIP.
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

1498
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,300
I NEEDED IT ONE MORNING, AND
THE GUY I WAS WITH GAVE IT TO ME.

1499
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,500
MAX?

1500
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
THE GUY THAT JIZZED ON ME? YEAH.

1501
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,100
THIS IS MY HAIRCLIP. I
WAS WITH HIM LAST WEEK.

1502
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,500
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH HIM?

1503
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,100
WE JUST HOOKED UP A COUPLE OF TIMES.

1504
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,400
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SEEING HIM.

1505
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,200
I TOLD YOU THAT I LIKED HIM.

1506
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,700
WHATEVER. NOW YOU OWN HIM.

1507
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,400
JASMINE! YVONNE! JASMINE! YVONNE!

1508
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,600
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

1509
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,400
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT IS GOING ON?

1510
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,700
WAIT A MINUTE. IS THIS
THE MAX THAT ELLE FLAGGED?

1511
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,800
Elle: THAT ASSHOLE?!

1512
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,400
THIS IS FUCKING OUTRAGEOUS!

1513
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,100
WHY DO WE EVEN KEEP A DATERBASE

1514
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,400
IF YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN FOLLOW IT?

1515
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,600
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE T.O.B. CLUB

1516
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,000
IS FOR SHIT LIKE THIS NOT TO HAPPEN.

1517
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,600
COURTNEY'S DUDE IS CHEATING ON HER.

1518
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,500
YOU'RE GETTING RIPPED
OFF BY YOUR COKE GUY,

1519
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,300
AND THE TWO OF YOU

1520
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,500
ARE IN SOME SORT OF T.O.B.
CERTIFIED SCUMBAG'S STABLE.

1521
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,600
SCUM!

1522
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,400
WE HAVE STABLES.

1523
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,700
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
CALLED STABLE BOYS, OKAY?

1524
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,200
THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
COULD ANYTHING ELSE GO WRONG?

1525
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,300
( crying ) I'M PREGNANT!

1526
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,200
OH, SWEETIE!

1527
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,100
IT'S OKAY.

1528
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,300
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE IT?

1529
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,300
I DON'T THINK SO.

1530
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,800
GOOD. GOOD.

1531
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,200
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT A THING.

1532
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,400
REALLY? YEAH.

1533
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,600
WE'LL FIX ALL OF THIS TOGETHER.

1534
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,400
NOW, HOW MANY MEN HAVE YOU BEEN
SLEEPING WITH? TWO OR THREE.

1535
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,200
GRETCHEN. NOT IN THE
LAST WEEK, GRETCHEN,

1536
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,600
THE LAST THREE MONTHS?

1537
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,400
MAYBE SEVEN OR EIGHT.
OH, PLUS THE DRUG GUY.

1538
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,800
ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?

1539
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,600
Both: ABORTION EXTORTION.

1540
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,300
"IN 1934,

1541
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,400
"HITLER ELIMINATED ALL OF
HIS OPPOSITION IN ONE NIGHT.

1542
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,700
IT WAS CALLED 'THE NIGHT
OF THE LONG KNIVES.'"

1543
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,700
THIS FRIDAY, OUR TIME WILL COME.

1544
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,400
WE'RE GOING TO TEACH
THESE CRETINS A LESSON

1545
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,700
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
FORGET. YEAH, WE WILL.

1546
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,600
THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1547
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,000
WE MET ONE OF THESE
PESTS THREE MONTHS AGO

1548
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,300
WHEN WE GOT THOSE T-SHIRTS MADE,

1549
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,900
AND HE WAS A BIG FAT LOSER.

1550
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,800
NOW HIM AND HIS BUDDIES ARE
WREAKING HAVOC ON US! HOW?

1551
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,400
YES, IT FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY
ELSE IS BEHIND THIS.

1552
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,600
ANOTHER GIRL GANG?

1553
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
( gasps ) THE ECHO PARK PUTAS?

1554
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,800
SILVERLAKE SKANKS?

1555
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,000
THE THREE ONE HOES?

1556
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,700
THE LOS FELIZ LESBOS?

1557
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,300
WHO KNOWS? BUT BY
SACRIFICING ONE OF OUR OWN,

1558
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,600
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE THAT
WE WE'RE NOT PLAYING AROUND.

1559
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:04,000
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SEEMS FAMILIAR.

1560
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,600
IS IT A MAN, A PLAYER OUT FOR REVENGE?

1561
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,100
SLICE, GRETCHEN, ELLE, I
WANT YOU TO HIT THE STREETS.

1562
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,500
TALK TO YOUR PEOPLE, BUST SOME BALLS...

1563
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,100
SUCK THEM IF YOU HAVE TO,

1564
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,700
BUT FIND OUT WHO IS PULLING THE STRINGS.

1565
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,100
WE WILL. GOOD.

1566
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,500
THEN TASSELING IN, NEXT SATURDAY,

1567
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,900
YVONNE WILL GET HER BOOBS,

1568
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
COURTNEY WILL BE BACK IN THE GANG,

1569
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,800
AND THESE FOOLS WILL RUE
THE DAY THAT THEY CROSSED US.

1570
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,000
YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

1571
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,500
NIGHT OF THE LONG NAILS.

1572
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,900
( cheering )

1573
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,900
WHY ARE WE DRINKING BRANDY?

1574
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,000
'CAUSE CHURCHILL USED TO DRINK IT.

1575
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,900
OH, YEAH. THAT JAMAICAN GUY
YOU USED TO DATE. HE WAS SO HOT.

1576
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,400
LOVED HIM.

1577
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,600
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

1578
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,600
AND? LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT WORKS,

1579
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,200
AND YOUR CLIENTS LOVE IT, RIGHT?

1580
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,700
THEY'RE PATIENTS.

1581
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,900
YES, THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE.

1582
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,900
THANK YOU.

1583
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:03,600
BUT BEFORE YOU GO, YOU'RE
A BIT OF LADIES MAN, RIGHT?

1584
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,800
YEAH, I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

1585
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,900
I HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM HERE.

1586
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,600
EVERY NOW AND THEN I
MEET A GIRL THAT I LIKE,

1587
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,900
ONE THAT SEEMS ALMOST
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,

1588
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,800
THEN I DO SOME WORK ON
HER, AND SHE DISAPPEARS.

1589
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,600
MM-HMM. SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING PLAYED?

1590
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,100
NOT SURE, BUT THERE IS THIS ONE GIRL...

1591
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,700
SHE'S VERY NICE TO ME. TOO NICE.

1592
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,600
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE'S
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO...

1593
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,200
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1594
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,800
OH, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, BABY.

1595
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
YOU'RE HUNGRY RIGHT?

1596
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,200
I AM STARVING. I LOVE THIS PLACE.

1597
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,000
I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU PICKED IT.

1598
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
WE ALL REALLY MISS YOU AT THE MEETINGS.

1599
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,900
OH, MY GOD, I MISS YOU GUYS, TOO!

1600
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,300
STOP.

1601
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,200
NOW THERE'S AN ARMY OF TWO.

1602
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,300
TAKE CARE OF THEM, SUGAR. OKAY.

1603
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,200
AND YOU, LET'S SEE
THOSE PRIVATES ON PARADE.

1604
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,400
I LIKE HOW YOU'RE SHOWCASING THAT PUSSY.

1605
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
LOOKIN' GOOD. ( spanks )

1606
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,000
WHOA. THAT SKIRT'S WAY TOO LONG.

1607
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,900
COME ON. BE ALL YOU CAN BE.

1608
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,800
LET'S SEE THESE. THE NIPPLES
ARE JUST RIGHT AT THE EDGE.

1609
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,200
GOOD, SHOW THOSE GIRLS OFF.

1610
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,100
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. ARE
YOU READY FOR YOUR MISSION?

1611
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,100

1612
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,900
HANDLE IT.

1613
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,000
I SEE YOU BROUGHT OUT THE
BIG GUNS. SHAKE THOSE BABIES.

1614
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,900
SLICE MY GLAMAZON. TURN AROUND.

1615
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,300
LET'S TIGHTEN UP THAT T-BACK.
IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE.

1616
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,800
EXCELLENT JOB, GRETCHEN.

1617
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,900
THANK YOU. LET ME SEE THOSE TEARS.

1618
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,700
( crying )

1619
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,800
TOO MUCH?

1620
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,900
NO, EXCELLENT.

1621
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,400
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO TAKE
CARE OF THIS COURTNEY SITUATION.

1622
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,900
WENDY, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO
DO THIS, RIGHT? YOU'RE MY SISTERS.

1623
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,300
I COULDN'T ASK YOU TO DO
ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO MYSELF.

1624
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,100
THIS IS WAR... AND WE'RE THE SEX BOMBS.

1625
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,400
( crying )

1626
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,000
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU OK?

1627
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,100
NO. MY PHONE DIED, AND I
REALLY NEED TO SEND AN EMAIL,

1628
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,000
OR MY BOSS IS GONNA FIRE ME.

1629
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,500
THAT'S OKAY. I LIVE RIGHT HERE.

1630
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,100
YOU CAN TOTALLY USE MY COMPUTER.

1631
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,300
REALLY?

1632
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,400
OF COURSE.

1633
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,200
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1634
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,400
REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIXED MY TRANSMISSION?

1635
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,900
WELL, I'M PREGNANT.

1636
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,600
I DON'T WANT A KID WITH YOU.

1637
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,000
ME NEITHER.

1638
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,400
HI.

1639
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? ARE YOU CRAZY?

1640
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,000
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
MY WIFE IS UPSTAIRS.

1641
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,600
WELL, I SUGGEST YOU TELL HER TO
COME DOWN HERE. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1642
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,900
I'M PREGNANT. SHH!

1643
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,900
SO, ANYWAY, I NEED MONEY
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

1644
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,500
NO, NO, NO. YOU SAID TO ME THAT
YOU ARE USING CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS.

1645
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,200
UGH, AZIS, I TOLD YOU, IT
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK ALL THE TIME.

1646
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,400
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? THAT'S NOT MY BABY.

1647
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
I GOT SIX WHITE BITCHES
ON DECK RIGHT NOW.

1648
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,100
I GOT BABY MOMMA'S FROM HERE TO DETROIT.

1649
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,100
YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING.

1650
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,300
HOW MUCH TO SUCK IT OUT?

1651
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,100
WANNA SPLIT IT? OKAY.

1652
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,600
JONZO? YEAH?

1653
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,100
JONZO, CAN I TALK TO YOU?
WE'RE KIND OF BUSY HERE.

1654
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,200
WELL, CAN YOU TAKE FIVE,
'CAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.

1655
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,600
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
REHEARSAL. WHAT'S GOING ON?

1656
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,800
DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER ME?

1657
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,700
UM...YEAH.

1658
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,600
THE BATHROOM AT THE BURGUNDY?

1659
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,100
YEAH, THE FUCKING
BATHROOM AT THE BURGUNDY.

1660
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,500
I TOTALLY REMEMBER
THAT. WHAT'S GOING ON?

1661
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,200
I'M PREGNANT, THAT'S HOW I'M DOING.

1662
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,300
PREGNANT? THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

1663
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,700
THIS IS A GIFT FROM THE LORD.

1664
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,700
NO, ACTUALLY, A GIFT FROM YOU.

1665
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,100
$450. WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

1666
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,300
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, DO YOU
THINK WE COULD WORK SOMETHING OUT?

1667
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,100
450? MORE LIKE 199!

1668
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,100
SHIT, YOU WANNA FUCK WITH MISS KIM
RIGHT THERE ON CRENSHAW AND FLORENCE.

1669
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,400
HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW IT'S MINE?

1670
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,500
'CAUSE YOU CAME IN ME!

1671
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,400
I FUCKING REMEMBER THAT NIGHT.

1672
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
I ASKED IF I COULD COME,
YOU SAID YES, I COULD COME.

1673
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,700
ON MY TITS!

1674
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,100
FOUR HUNDRED AND FUCKING FIFTY DOLLARS!

1675
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,300
I DON'T HAVE THAT MONEY ON ME.

1676
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,800
YOU SHOULD SAY THAT.

1677
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,400
WHAT THE FUCK AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THAT?

1678
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,200
SHE GOT THIS NAIL
SALON OUT FRONT, RIGHT,

1679
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
BUT YOU GO TO THE BACK,
SHE GOT THE ABORTION CLINIC.

1680
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,700
COME ON. GET THE HELLS FROM OUT OF HERE.

1681
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,700
GET YOUR NAILS DONE AT THE SAME
TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1682
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,200
PEDICURE, JUMP OFF, EVERYTHING.

1683
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,400
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

1684
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

1685
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,400
HE'S A FERTILE LITTLE FUCKER, OKAY?

1686
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,700
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

1687
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,500
SHIT. YOU THINK I GOT
THIS MOTHERFUCKING PAID

1688
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,800
FROM PAYING CHILD SUPPORT?

1689
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,700
FUCK! FUCK!

1690
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,400
AFTER THAT NIGHT, I
NEVER HEARD FROM YOU.

1691
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,400
YEAH, I'VE BEEN TAKING THE TRAIN,

1692
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,200
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE ABOUT.

1693
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,700
YOU SEE, I'M PREGNANT.

1694
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,200
DON'T BE UPSET, DARLING.
THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.

1695
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,000
YOU CAN MOVE IN WITH ME. WE'RE
GONNA HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN,

1696
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,400
BIG FAMILY, STRONG SONS.

1697
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
I GOTTA GO.

1698
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,700
I'VE HAD THIS ONE FANTASY
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

1699
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,700
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

1700
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,500
OH, COME FUCKING ON!

1701
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,300
( sighs ) MARSHMALLOWY GOODNESS.

1702
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,800
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY FAVORITE
CEREAL. JUST SAYING.

1703
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,900
THANK GOD. ( sighs )

1704
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,000
I NEED A DRINK. DO YOU HAVE ANY VODKA?

1705
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,400
YEAH. YEAH?

1706
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,500
YEAH, LET ME GO GET SOME.

1707
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
AND, YOU KNOW, WE LOVE YOU TO DEATH,

1708
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,000
AND IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN,

1709
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,000
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS
COME BACK TO THE MEETINGS,

1710
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,100
AND WE'D ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU.

1711
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,700
THANK YOU.

1712
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:11,400
MEMORY FOAM. I LOVE IT.

1713
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,100
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE
ON A GOOD NIGHT IN BED.

1714
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,800
DO YOU MIND IF I SMOKE?

1715
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
NO. NO, NO, NO. BY ALL MEANS.

1716
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,900
LET ME GO GET AN ASHTRAY.

1717
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,000
HEY.

1718
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,400
HEY, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

1719
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,900
I'M ALL RIGHT, BUT, I DON'T KNOW,

1720
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,000
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS ONE IS BIGGER.

1721
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,800
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYTHING
UNTIL THE CAST IS OFF.

1722
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,000
THEY'RE GONNA LOOK SO HOT.

1723
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,600
THEY'LL SETTLE IN SOON, CUTIE.

1724
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,600
YOU PROMISE? MM-HMM.

1725
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,600
OKAY, YOU GUYS, LET'S
GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

1726
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,400
HEY, MAX. YEAH.

1727
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,900
PUT HIM ON SPEAKER. YEAH.

1728
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,700
Max: I WAS THINKING WE
COULD HANG OUT TONIGHT, BABE.

1729
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS
THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING.

1730
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,200
ALL RIGHT, SO, YEAH,
YOU KNOW, WE'LL MEET UP,

1731
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,600
AND WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN TONIGHT, BABY.

1732
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
MOTHERFUCKER, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS DOUCHEBAG.

1733
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,500
OH, WAIT, CAN YOU
BRING YOUR FRIEND GLEN?

1734
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,600
OH, YEAH, I'LL BRING HIM. I'M
LOOKING AT HIS BIG ASS NOW,

1735
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,100
MAKING A TRIPLE-DECKER SANDWICH.

1736
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,800
Jasmine: OKAY, BIG KISS. ALL RIGHT.

1737
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,300
THAT'S JASMINE? YVONNE'S FRIEND?

1738
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,700
THAT'S A DANGEROUS GAME, MAN.

1739
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,900
NAH, MAN, LOOK, ACTUALLY IT'S COOL

1740
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,700
BECAUSE YVONNE'S IN THE
HOSPITAL GETTING HER TITS DONE.

1741
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,900
NICE ROTATION, BRO.

1742
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,100
AND SHE'S BRINGING A
FRIEND JUST FOR YOU!

1743
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,100
WHAT?! YEAH, MAN!

1744
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,700
YOUR HAIR IS BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT COLOR IS THAT?

1745
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,800
I'M A DIRTY BLONDE.

1746
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,800
OHH. HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER DRINK?

1747
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,800
I CAN'T TONIGHT, SWEETIE.
IT'S MY TIME OF THE MONTH.

1748
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,300
NO, NO, NO. I DIDN'T
EVEN MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

1749
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,800
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

1750
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,900
THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS TALKING ABOUT.

1751
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING.

1752
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,300
UM, CAN I USE YOUR RESTROOM?

1753
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,600
YEAH. UH, IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

1754
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,200
( beeping )

1755
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,300
OHH.

1756
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,800
( sighs )

1757
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,800
ARE--ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, IT'S JUST MY MOM.

1758
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,900
MY STUPID KID'S ACTING UP,
AND I HAVE TO GO AND SEE IT.

1759
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,300
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE A MOM.

1760
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,300
I KNOW, RIGHT? LOOK AT ME.

1761
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,000
YOU'RE WAY TOO HOT TO BE A MOM.

1762
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,800
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT.

1763
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,700
I KNOW. I MEAN, I'M A GOOD MOM.

1764
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,000
I SEE MY KID EVERY MONTH.

1765
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,300
BUT I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1766
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,900
OH, I'M TOTALLY COOL. MY BOYFRIEND
ACTUALLY LIVES RIGHT NEXT DOOR, SO...

1767
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,100
Glen: SO SERIOUSLY YOU SAID
SHE WAS BRINGING SOME FRIENDS?

1768
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,700
TWO FRIENDS. TWO FRIENDS?

1769
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,800
GRADE A FUCKING TAIL?

1770
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,000
TWO TENDERONIES. TWO?

1771
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,200
HEY, WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

1772
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,900
HELLO. GLEN, THESE ARE MY
FRIENDS CANDACE AND DENISE.

1773
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,300
HI. HOW ARE YOU? HI.

1774
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,400
YOU GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC.

1775
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,200
I'M DOING GOOD OBVIOUSLY.

1776
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
BYE.

1777
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,400
BYE, AARON.

1778
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,200
( phone vibrating )

1779
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,900
HI, HEY, SWEETHEART.

1780
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:44,300
GOT YOUR OWN LITTLE
REFUGEE CAMBODIAN OUTFIT ON.

1781
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,200
MM-HMM. MMM, YEAH. I LIKE
THAT LOOK YOU GOT GOING ON.

1782
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,500
LOOK LIKE YOU IN TRAINING
MODE. YOU ARE READY FOR ACTION.

1783
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,200
I KNOW. I'M A TOUGH GIRL.

1784
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,000
I LIKE THESE LITTLE
EARRINGS YOU GOT, TOO.

1785
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,800
MMM, I LIKE THIS LITTLE THIGH
MEAT STICKING OUT RIGHT HERE.

1786
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,100
MEAT? GONNA STICK MY FORK IN IT!

1787
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:02,400
ALISSA, AMY, CARMEN.

1788
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,500
Glen: WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

1789
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,900
LET'S DO SHOTS.

1790
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,000
LET'S DO SHOTS. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

1791
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,600
IT'S EARLY. LET'S GET THE PARTY STARTED.

1792
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,100
GLEN...

1793
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,100
HEY, GRETCHEN. YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

1794
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,600
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PRIVATE.

1795
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,600
RIGHT NOW?

1796
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,400
IT'S IMPORTANT. NOW.

1797
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,100
OKAY. EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

1798
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,600
ZELDA. SEND.

1799
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,900
OH, IT'S THE TEXT.
OH, THIS IS PRICELESS.

1800
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
"IT'S MAX, AND I'M HORNY.

1801
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,100
"WHICH ONE OF MY
BITCHES IS UP RIGHT NOW,

1802
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,600
"READY FOR A FACELOAD OF JIZZ?

1803
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,200
I GOT THE BEER."

1804
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,000
OH, MY GOD. THAT IS SO EPIC.

1805
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,600
WHO DO YOU THINK THIS WENT OUT TO?

1806
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,600
KNOWING WENDY, PROBABLY EVERY
SINGLE FEMALE IN HIS PHONE.

1807
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,000
( beeping )

1808
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,600
FUCKING ASSCLOWN!

1809
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,400
THANK YOU.

1810
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,200
NO, I'M GOOD.

1811
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,900
BUT WE USED A CONDOM.

1812
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,900
( sighs ) IT BROKE SOMETIMES, REMEMBER?

1813
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:05,000
BECAUSE YOU WERE "TOO BIG"?

1814
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
THANK YOU.

1815
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,500
OH, MY GOD. LET ME SEE.

1816
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,700
PERVERT!

1817
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,300
FIVE MINUTES?!

1818
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,200
UM, NO, NO, NO, IT'S
FINE. TAKE YOUR TIME.

1819
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,400
UM, I'M JUST GOING TO
BE STRAIGHTENING UP.

1820
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,100
OKAY. OKAY, BYE.

1821
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,200
FUCK!

1822
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,600
LOOK AT THAT KNEE. MMM.

1823
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,600

1824
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,000
WHAT? YEAH.

1825
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
YOU GOTTA GO? MM-HMM.

1826
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,200
WHY?

1827
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,000
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
GIRL STUFF. COME ON.

1828
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,100
GIRL STUFF? NO, YOU DID NOT
JUST KISS ME ON MY FOREHEAD.

1829
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,600
$500.

1830
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,800
$500? I KNOW.

1831
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,400
DO YOU HAVE ANY OF IT?

1832
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,700
NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY OF IT.

1833
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,300
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TALKING TO YOU.

1834
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,700
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
I COULD ASK MY MOM,

1835
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,800
BUT SHE WANTS GRANDKIDS, SO WHAT... GOD.

1836
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,500
DID YOU DO ANY, LIKE, SHOPPING AROUND?

1837
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,700
IT'S MY VAGINA!

1838
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,700
( phone rings )

1839
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,300
Text voice: IT'S MAX.

1840
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,100
IT'S FROM MAX!

1841
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,100
"TEXT TO LANDLINE" MESSAGE. IT'S MAX.

1842
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,100
IT'S A "TEXT TO LANDLINE" MESSAGE.

1843
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,800
...AND READY FOR A FACELOAD OF JIZZ?

1844
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,200
WHAT IDIOTS. THEY TOTALLY DESERVED IT.

1845
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,300
( beeping )

1846
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,400
OH...

1847
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,100
MOMMY, WHAT'S "JIZZ" MEAN?

1848
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,800
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FILTH?

1849
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,500
MAX.

1850
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,500
( phone vibrates and rings )

1851
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,400
PICK UP!

1852
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,200
SCHOOL'S OUT, AARON.

1853
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,500
JOHNNY...I FUCKED UP.

1854
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,700
OKAY, RELAX.

1855
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,900
ALL RIGHT, MR. "PERFECT BOYFRIEND,"

1856
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:35,200
LOOK, JUST STOP AND
THINK. WHAT DID SHE TOUCH?

1857
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,400
Johnny: DID SHE DRINK
ANYTHING? CHECK FOR LIPSTICK.

1858
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,400
WHAT ABOUT CIGARETTES? WAS SHE SMOKING?

1859
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,500
CHECK THE BED. TAKE A
LINT ROLLER TO THE BED.

1860
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,600
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

1861
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,600
JUST LOOK AROUND CAREFULLY.

1862
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,300
LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

1863
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,900
HI.

1864
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,700
MMM, LUCKY YOU WERE
JUST AROUND THE CORNER!

1865
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,600
HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING?

1866
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,500
NO. NO.

1867
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,200
WHAT ARE
YOU--NO.

1868
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
OH, MY GOD.

1869
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,500
SHIT.

1870
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,900
( phone ringing )

1871
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,500
YOU WERE RIGHT.

1872
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,900
HE JUST HAD SOME
MENSTRUATING WHORE OVER HERE!

1873
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,400
COME ON, SWEETIE. YOU
KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.

1874
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,800
I KNOW. I JUST...

1875
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,400
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN SO SOON.

1876
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,800
I MEAN, I REALLY, REALLY LIKED HIM.

1877
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,700
YEAH, SHE'S IN THE
BATHROOM. I THINK IT'S COOL.

1878
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,700
UH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN.
SERIOUSLY YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

1879
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,100
NO PROBLEM, BUT, DUDE, IF YOU
INSIST ON HAVING A GIRLFRIEND--

1880
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,100
NO, NO, NO. I WASN'T EVEN GOING TO DO
ANYTHING, DUDE. PLUS, SHE WAS ON HER PERIOD.

1881
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,700
HER PERIOD. DID YOU CHECK THE BATHROOM?

1882
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,400
OH, FUCK! OH, SHIT!

1883
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,800
HE'S A BOY. BOYS WOULD FUCK A
STICK OF BUTTER IF THEY COULD.

1884
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,000
HE'S BASICALLY AS FAITHFUL
AS THE OPTIONS OPEN TO HIM.

1885
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,400
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

1886
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,100
NO. DON'T DO A THING.

1887
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,700
YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY COMING
UP NEXT WEEKEND, DON'T YOU?

1888
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,900
YES.

1889
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,900
OKAY, CLEAN UP THE BLOOD, DRY YOUR EYES,

1890
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,700
AND PRETEND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

1891
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,000
WE ARE GOING TO TURN
THIS WHOLE THING AROUND.

1892
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
OKAY. CAN I COME BACK TO THE MEETINGS?

1893
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,100
OF COURSE YOU CAN, SWEETIE.

1894
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,900
COME NEXT WEEK, WE'LL GET YOU
TASSELED IN, AND WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN.

1895
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:33,700
OH, AND YVONNE'S GOING TO
BE UNVEILING HER NEW BOOBIES!

1896
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,300
GOOD. I CANT WAIT.

1897
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:38,000
THANKS.

1898
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,200
HEY, GUYS.

1899
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,600
GIRL, WHAT'S UP?

1900
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,000
HOW DID IT GO? HOW DID IT GO?

1901
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,100
AWESOME!

1902
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,900
GET DOWN! YEAH, WE DID!

1903
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,300
WE SENT THE TEXT MESSAGE FROM HELL!

1904
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,900
I'M SORRY I WASN'T THERE.

1905
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,900
( all speaking at once )

1906
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,800
THEY KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE. ABSOLUTELY.

1907
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,000
BABE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1908
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,800
( sadly ) YES.

1909
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,600
ARE YOU CRYING?

1910
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,800
NO. IT'S MY ALLERGIES.

1911
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,000
SO, WHERE ARE YOU TAKING
ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

1912
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,200
UM, WHAT ABOUT THAT LITTLE
RESTAURANT YOU LIKE DOWNTOWN?

1913
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,500
YEAH. WHAT ABOUT MAUI?

1914
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,100
( grunts )

1915
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,700
WHERE YOU BEEN AT, MAN?

1916
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,300
BEEN AT THE FUCKING ATM.

1917
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,700
THIS IS... THIS IS DEEP SHIT, MAN.

1918
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,900
SHIT. YOU GOT NO IDEA, MAN. I BEEN
GETTING SOME CRAZY ASS TEXT MESSAGES.

1919
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,100
YEAH? ( phone ringing )

1920
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,300
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MOM?

1921
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,800
WE ARE THE LADIES OF THE T.O.B.

1922
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,200
WITH THE BOOTY THAT THEY WANT

1923
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,900
BUT THIS SHIT AIN'T CHEAP

1924
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,800
WE NEED MORE JEWELRY
AND TIGS FOR RELAXIN'

1925
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,400
TANNING BOOTHS AND
SILICON AND INTIMATE WAXIN'

1926
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,200
WE NEVER HAVE TO PAY 'CAUSE WE GOT THESE

1927
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,900
TIG OLD BITTIES, WE RUN THIS CITY

1928
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,400
COURTNEY'S IN OUR GANG
'CAUSE SHE'S GOT TIG BITTIES

1929
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,200
( cheering )

1930
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,800
YOU DODGED A BULLET, MY FRIEND.

1931
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,900
$450 FOR AN ABORTION, OR
18 YEARS OF CHILD SUPPORT?

1932
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,100
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

1933
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,400
YEAH, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

1934
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,900
NOW, COURTNEY, THAT WAS THE EASY PART,

1935
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,100
BUT TIME TO JUMP YOU IN!

1936
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,900
( cheering )

1937
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,300
( chanting ) COURTNEY,
COURTNEY, COURTNEY...

1938
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,100
( cheering, screaming )

1939
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,900
ONCHIE! ONCHIE!

1940
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,900
AND WHAT ARE YOU SO MISERABLE ABOUT?

1941
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,900
YOU GOT LUCKY, TOO.

1942
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,300
I KNOW. I JUST FEEL BAD.

1943
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,900
WHY? 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET TO FUCK

1944
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,300
THAT CENTERFOLD YOU "HELPED"?

1945
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,300
DID THEY PAY UP? MOSTLY.

1946
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,400
GOD, I'VE FUCKED SOME CHEAP BASTARDS.

1947
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,200
BUT WE DID MAKE SOME
MONEY, RIGHT, WENDY?

1948
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,500
WELL, BECAUSE OF YOU, GRETCHEN, $2000!

1949
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,300
HOLLA! HOLLA! NICE.

1950
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,300
DUDE, SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE
HER TO HAWAII FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

1951
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,800
( laughing )

1952
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,800
YOU'RE 25. YOU DON'T NEED ALL THAT!

1953
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,900
NO, I KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1954
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,000
I SHOULD PROBABLY CALL HER, MAN,

1955
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,800
AND MAKE THINGS A BIT LESS FORMAL.

1956
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,800
CALL HER.

1957
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,800
( laughing )

1958
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,200
( phone vibrating )

1959
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,200
OH, IT'S THE BOY. SHALL I DITCH IT?

1960
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,000
NO. TAKE IT. THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC.

1961
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,900
YEAH, AND FIND OUT WHAT HIS
LITTLE FRIENDS ARE DOING.

1962
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,600
OKAY.

1963
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,200
HELLO?

1964
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,600
WHERE IS YVONNE?

1965
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
I ALWAYS DITCH THEM
ALL EVERY SIX MONTHS.

1966
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
IT'S VERY LIBERATING.

1967
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,400
ALL EXCEPT THE ONE YOU LOVED.

1968
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,400
COME ON, DUDE, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT, MAN.

1969
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,100
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

1970
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,400
( crying )

1971
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,000
THEY'RE PARTYING!

1972
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,300
ONE IS EXCITED BECAUSE HE
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A KID,

1973
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,100
AND THE OTHER ONE HAS A
BUNCH OF DATES LINED UP,

1974
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,300
AND AARON WANTS TO MAKE
THINGS "LESS FORMAL."

1975
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,700
OHH... OHH...

1976
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,400
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEETHEART?

1977
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,200
SHOW THEM.

1978
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,300
( sniffling )

1979
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,500
( crying )

1980
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,100
( women gasping )

1981
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,200
OHH! WHAT?! OH, MY GOD!

1982
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:49,300
HE SAID THAT ONE OF
THE IMPLANTS WAS CRACKED

1983
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,500
AND THAT THEY DIDN'T NOTICE
UNTIL THEY WERE GONNA IMPLANT IT.

1984
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,200
DICK. ASSHOLE!

1985
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,300
WHEN IS HE GONNA DO THE OTHER ONE?

1986
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,800
HE SAID BOOKED ALL MONTH,

1987
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,800
BUT HE WANTS TO TAKE
ME TO VEGAS NEXT WEEK!

1988
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,100
SNEAKY LITTLE BASTARD!

1989
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,500
AND LOOK WHAT HE GAVE
HER FOR HER SCAR TISSUE.

1990
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,600
LOOK WHAT HE GAVE ME
FOR THE SCAR TISSUE.

1991
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,400
KELOCOTE.

1992
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,700
KELOCOTE.

1993
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,200
JOHNNY EYELASH.

1994
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,500
WAIT. AARON HAS A FRIEND NAMED JOHNNY.

1995
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,300
SO DOES MAX.

1996
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,800
SO DOES GLEN, AND HE'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT HOW COOL HE IS.

1997
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,500
WHO IS THIS JOHNNY EYELASHES?

1998
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HIS
FAGGY LITTLE FINGERPRINTS

1999
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,600
WERE ALL OVER THIS.

2000
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,800
HE WAS PULLING THE STRINGS ALL ALONG.

2001
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,500
WHO IS THIS JOHNNY EYELASH,
AND WHY IS HE RUINING MY LIFE?

2002
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:39,500
HE'S A BOY THAT I... WE USED TO DATE.

2003
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
Max: SHE WAS AMAZING.

2004
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,600
I WAS IN NEW YORK.

2005
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,700
WE WERE YOUNG, WE WERE LIVING TOGETHER,

2006
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,900
AND I WAS REALLY IN LOVE
WITH HER. I WAS REALLY HAPPY.

2007
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,400
Little Wendy: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
I COULD LOVE SOMEONE SO MUCH.

2008
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,700
Big Wendy: I KNEW HIM,
TOO. THAT'S HOW WE MET.

2009
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,500
HE HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH THIS GANG.

2010
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,900
HE'S THE REASON WHY
WE STARTED THE T.O.B.

2011
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,800
YEAH, WHAT DOES T.O.B. STAND FOR?

2012
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,300
I WAS REALLY INTO HER,

2013
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,600
BUT SHE WAS A FUCKING PSYCHO NIGHTMARE.

2014
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,700
I MEAN, THIS CHICK WAS BATS.

2015
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,600
Little Wendy: I'D BEEN DATING
HIM FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

2016
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,400
I WAS YOUNG AND IN LOVE. WE
HAD JUST MOVED IN TOGETHER.

2017
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,800
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS IN SPRING

2018
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,200
WHERE YOU JUST WANT TO
STAY OUTSIDE ALL DAY.

2019
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,700
Johnny: I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU EVER LIVED IN NEW YORK,

2020
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,700
BUT THERE'S THAT ONE DAY IN SPRING

2021
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,500
WHEN YOU LEAVE
THE HOUSE, BAM--

2022
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,000
TITTIES AND MIDRIFFS EVERYWHERE.

2023
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,600
Little Wendy: SO WE'RE
HAVING A NICE WALK

2024
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,800
WHEN THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL WALKS PAST.

2025
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,000
IT WAS WENDY.

2026
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,900
I WAS YOUNG AND UNPREPARED FOR IT,

2027
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,700
THEN THIS SMOKING CHICK WALKED PAST,

2028
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,800
WITH TITTIES FROM HELL.

2029
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,800
I MEAN, BIG ONES,
BRAND-NEW, OUT ON DISPLAY,

2030
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,500
SO I CATCH HER OUT THE CORNER OF MY EYE.

2031
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,000
TIG OLD BITTIES!

2032
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,900
Little Wendy: AND THIS
WAS BEFORE I HAD MY BOOBS,

2033
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,600
SO I WAS LITTLE BIT MORE
SENSITIVE ABOUT IT BACK THEN.

2034
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,100
Johnny: SHE JUST WENT FUCKING CRAZY.

2035
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,100
SO LATER THAT NIGHT WE
WERE AT THIS CLUB, RIGHT?

2036
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:55,700
AND I SEE THIS CHICK AGAIN.

2037
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,100
SO WE WENT INTO ONE OF
THOSE UNISEX BATHROOMS.

2038
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,600
ANYWAYS, I'M IN THE STALL,

2039
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,100
AND I'M GETTING A BLOWJOB, RIGHT?

2040
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,600
AND SHE JUST BUST RIGHT IN.

2041
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,500
Little Wendy: I SAW WENDY IN THERE,

2042
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,000
AND I DIDN'T KNOW HER
NAME, SO I JUST SCREAMED,

2043
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
"TIG OLD BITTIES! THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND."

2044
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,600
Johnny: AND THE OTHER
ONE, SHE SPAT ON ME--

2045
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,900
MY OWN JIZZ!

2046
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:14,500
YEAH, AND IT DOES BURN, BY THE WAY.

2047
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,700
BUT WENDY WAS NICE. SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

2048
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,800
SHE SAID SHE WAS SORRY,
AND WE BECAME FRIENDS.

2049
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,600
AND WE ENDED UP MEETING FABIO

2050
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,400
AND HAVING THIS CRAZY
THREEWAY BACK AT THE HOTEL.

2051
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,100
( women laughing )

2052
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,600
FABIO!

2053
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,100
FABIO!

2054
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,100
OH, WENDY, DON'T WORRY.

2055
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,500
THERE'S PLENTY OF FABIO TO GO AROUND.

2056
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,200
FUNNY THING, THEY
WERE BOTH CALLED WENDY.

2057
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,600
WENDY? THAT CHICK THAT CAME OVER

2058
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,700
AND NEARLY GOT ME
BUSTED WAS NAMED WENDY.

2059
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,100
YEAH, YVONNE'S ALWAYS
GOING ON ABOUT THE WENDYS.

2060
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,200
WENDYS! OF COURSE.

2061
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:54,600
IT WAS THEM ALL ALONG.
THOSE LITTLE BITCHES.

2062
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,700
JOHNNY EYELASH.

2063
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,800
WE'RE GONNA TAKE HIM
DOWN ONCE AND FOR ALL.

2064
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,000
HE STARTED ALL THIS, AND
WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT.

2065
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,200
BUT TO DO IT, WE NEED TO MOVE
TO A NEW STAGE OF OUR LIVES.

2066
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,600
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, WENDY.

2067
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,600
YES, I DO. THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

2068
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,800
JOHNNY! HOW ARE YOU DOING?

2069
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,300
WHAT'S UP, BRO?

2070
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,300
THANK YOU. YOU GOT IT.

2071
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,300
JOHNNY EYELASH. COME OVER HERE.

2072
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,200
OKAY, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU TWO WANT?

2073
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,200
OH, JOHNNY EYELASH. ALWAYS
THE CHARMER, AREN'T YA?

2074
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,000
EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE
CHEATING ON YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

2075
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,400
WHAT IS THIS, ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE SCHEMES

2076
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,700
TO PULL OVER ON ME AND MY BOYS?

2077
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,600
NO. CALM DOWN.

2078
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,100
WE'RE JUST EXTENDING AN
OLIVE BRANCH. OH, REALLY?

2079
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,300
COME AND SIT OVER HERE, JOHNNY.

2080
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,700
I'M OKAY RIGHT HERE, THANKS.

2081
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,400
OUCH. OUCH.

2082
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,800
VODKA GIMLET, RIGHT?

2083
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,400
THANK YOU.

2084
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,300
SO HOW IS THE BOOB CREAM BUSINESS?

2085
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:59,700
IT'S GOING WELL, ACTUALLY.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

2086
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,800
AND HOW IS YOUR "WORK" GOING?

2087
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,900
GOOD. YEAH?

2088
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
WE HAVE A HOUSE. SERIOUSLY?

2089
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,800
YEAH. AND A COMMITTEE.

2090
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,300
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THE
COMMITTEE. AND A BUNCH OF GIRLS.

2091
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,000
SO WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS DRINKING,
TOO? OR AM I ON MY OWN?

2092
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,700
COME ON, COME SIT OVER HERE. OKAY.

2093
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,100
UHH.

2094
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,000
SO, JOHNNY, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE FIRST MET, RIGHT?

2095
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,100
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

2096
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,400
LET'S DO A TOAST.

2097
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,400
OF COURSE I REMEMBER. YOU WERE SO HOT.

2098
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,900
ALL RIGHT, A TOAST.

2099
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,000
( all speaking at once )

2100
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,700
TO NEW TIMES. AND OLD TIMES.

2101
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,900
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

2102
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,500
IT WASN'T MY FINEST MOMENT, SORRY.

2103
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,300
YOU WANNA GET COZY, PLEASE? ALL RIGHT.

2104
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,300
WENDY, TELL HIM.

2105
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,300
YEAH, WENDY, TELL HIM.

2106
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,300
WE WANT A BABY.

2107
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,500
( laughs )

2108
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,000
SERIOUSLY?

2109
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,100
YEAH. WE'RE SICK OF ALL THE PARTIES

2110
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,100
AND TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT GUY.

2111
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,100
YOU WANT ME TO GET ONE
OF YOU TWO PREGNANT?

2112
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,900
WENDY AND I LIKE EACH OTHER.

2113
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:50,600
A LOT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

2114
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,500
BUT WE BOTH STILL LIKE DICK.

2115
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,200
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.

2116
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,600
WHY DON'T WE POOL OUR RESOURCES,

2117
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,200
AND THE THREE OF US MOVE IN TOGETHER?

2118
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,200
THE THREE OF US LIVE TOGETHER?

2119
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,100
UH-HUH. OH, MY GOD.

2120
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,800
WE ALL SLEEP TOGETHER,

2121
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,200
BUT THE DEAL IS NONE OF US THREE

2122
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,500
CAN SLEEP WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

2123
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,300
AND TO KEEP THE BOND STRONG,

2124
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,900
YOU HAVE TO MARRY ONE OF US,
AND GET THE OTHER ONE PREGNANT.

2125
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,600
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE... MARRY?

2126
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,300
UH-HUH. DON'T YOU WANT A SON?

2127
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:19,100
AND YOU GET TO SHOW US
BOTH OFF, ONE ON EACH ARM.

2128
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,400
AND YOU GET YOUR CHOICE OF SIX HOLES.

2129
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,100
EVERY NIGHT. EVERY NIGHT.

2130
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,000
WE WILL FUCK YOU INTO LITTLE PIECES.

2131
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,600
IN HALF.

2132
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,700
UPSIDE-DOWN.

2133
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,700
THIS IS BULLSHIT. I WANNA
GO FIRST. HE LIKES ME BETTER.

2134
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,400
I WANT TO SUCK IT.
NO, I WANT TO SUCK IT.

2135
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,400
HEY, HEY, HEY, LADIES!

2136
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,300
BULLSHIT, YOU WENT LAST NIGHT.

2137
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,000
YOU SUCKED IT FIRST THIS
MORNING. IT'S MY TURN.

2138
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,200
OKAY, OKAY, LADIES, DON'T BE GREEDY.

2139
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,500
YOU CAN SHARE, ALL RIGHT?

2140
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,100
YOU GET THE LEFT SIDE,
YOU GET THE RIGHT SIDE.

2141
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,300
ONE BALL EACH.

2142
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,700
AND, GO.

2143
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,300
( women giggling )

2144
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:58,100
OKAY. WHOA, SLOW IT DOWN.

2145
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,400
BUT YOU CAN'T CHEAT. NEVER.

2146
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,500
OR YOU'LL PAY. NO WAY.

2147
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,500
LOOK, I COULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
THIS KIND OF AN ARRANGEMENT.

2148
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,300
AND I WOULD NEVER CHEAT.

2149
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,000
NEVER. NO WAY.

2150
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,500
Max: WITHIN THREE MONTHS,

2151
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,500
THE FIRST PART OF
THEIR PLAN WAS COMPLETE.

2152
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,100
HE WAS MARRIED TO ONE,
GOT THE OTHER ONE PREGNANT,

2153
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,600
AND THEY ALL LIVED UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

2154
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,700
AND FOR A WHILE, JOHNNY WAS FAITHFUL

2155
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,100
AND HAPPY WITH HIS
SIX-HOLE ARRANGEMENT.

2156
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,700
BUT THESE GIRLS WERE SNEAKY.

2157
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,500
IT WAS ALL JUST A SETUP

2158
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,600
FOR THE FINAL PHASE
OF THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

2159
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,100
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

2160
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,400
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

2161
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,200
I KNOW. THIS IS A GREAT THING!

2162
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,100
OHH. VERONICA?

2163
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,800
YEAH, OPERATION CHEATING HEART IS A GO.

2164
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,400
TELL HER TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

2165
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,900
NOT THAT HE'S GONNA TAKE IT, BUT...

2166
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,500
GO EASY ON HIM, OKAY?

2167
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,300
ALL RIGHT, VERONICA, SO BASICALLY YOU'RE
GOING TO APPLY IT TO THE WHOLE SCAR

2168
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,800
AND JUST WAIT FOR IT TO
DRY BEFORE YOU GET DRESSED.

2169
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,500
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. HERE, LET ME.

2170
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,900
UM, WHICH ONE SHOULD I PUT IT ON?

2171
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,600
BOTH.

2172
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,500
I THINK I PUT TOO MUCH.

2173
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,800
THAT'S FINE. JUST APPLY A THIN LAYER.

2174
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,800
NOT SURE I'M DOING IT PROPERLY. JOHNNY?

2175
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,600
OKAY.

2176
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,600
( moaning, laughs )

2177
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,200
NOW I GET IT. OH, SO GOOD.

2178
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,500
IT'LL FORM A PROTECTIVE
SEAL OVER THE EPIDERMIS.

2179
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,600
YOU'RE SO CLEVER, JOHNNY.

2180
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,900
VERONICA, I DON'T SEE A SCAR.

2181
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,000
WHAT?

2182
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,100
THERE'S NO SCAR.

2183
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,600
THERE'S A LITTLE SLIT.

2184
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,400
THERE'S A SLIT? WHERE?

2185
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,000

01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:50,500
Max: THOSE BITCHES GOT JOHNNY GOOD.

2189
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,600
THEY HAD HIM CHEATING ON VIDEO,

2190
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,500
AND WHEN THE JUDGE SAW THE TAPE,

2191
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
HE GAVE HALF HIS SHIT TO
LITTLE WENDY FOR ALIMONY,

2192
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,900
AND THE OTHER HALF TO BIG
WENDY FOR CHILD SUPPORT.

2193
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,800
AND NOW THEY LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY.

2194
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,100
AND DAMN...THAT WAS
ONE WELL-DRESSED BABY!

2195
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,800
BUT JOHNNY MADE THE BEST OF IT.

2196
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,400
HE PIMPED THE SHIT OUT OF THAT KID.

2197
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,100
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

2198
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,000
MY PLEASURE. YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY.

2199
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,400
Max: GLEN TRIED TO FOLLOW
IN JOHNNY'S FOOTSTEPS...

2200
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,000
...HOW MUCH YOU'VE SPENT ON IT...

2201
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,800
BUT NOT EVERYONE'S GOT THE TOUCH.

2202
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,100
IT'S JUST A SERVICE
I PROVIDE MY CLIENTS.

2203
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,400
ARE YOU KIDDING?

2204
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,800
EW, APPLY THEM ON YOUR OWN TITS!

2205
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,400
WELL, BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A BOOB JOB.

2206
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,800
Max: YVONNE FINALLY GOT HER OTHER TITTY.

2207
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,700
IT'S ALREADY PAID FOR ITSELF.

2208
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:38,600
LOOK AT THEM TITTIES!

2209
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,000
WHAT THE FUCK!

2210
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,800
Max: HOLLYWOOD SEX WARS STILL RAGE.

2211
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,800

2212
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,800

2214
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:51,900
WELL, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT
BETTER THAT YOU'RE SORRY...

2215
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,200
THE WENDYS EVENTUALLY CAME
CLEAN ABOUT THE FRAME JOB,

2216
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,500
AND COURTNEY QUIT THE T.O.B.

2217
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,700
I JUST FOUND THEM. EW.

AGAINST JOHNNY'S ADVICE,

2219
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,100
