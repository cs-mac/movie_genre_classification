1
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,231
Corny, who do you think you're talking to?

2
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,234
If the Semple attorneys don't know
who the heir is, who does?

3
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,139
Come on, Corny. I've done you a lot of
favors. Who's getting the Semple dough?

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,142
You're asking the wrong guy, Mac.
I'm only a press agent.

5
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,311
Newspaperman?
- Wants to know who the heir is.

6
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,646
Hang up.
- Sorry, Mac, l can't--...

7
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,182
Yeah, sure, but I ain't the attorney.
- Hang up.

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,185
Mr. Cedar is,
and l haven't seen him in two days.

9
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,689
Cedar, we gotta deal with the papers.
- I'm not interested in the newspapers.

10
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,060
But it's a great story. Somewhere
a guy is walking into 20 million bucks.

11
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,496
My first concern is to locate the lucky man.

12
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,598
When l do, you keep
the newspapers away from him.

13
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,434
Okay, as long as that weekly stipend
keeps coming in.

14
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,436
We located him, Mr. Cedar.

15
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,438
Yes, John, we got him.
- Here's the report.

16
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,707
Longfellow Deeds, single, 28,
lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,709
Thank heaven.
- Better wire him.

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,845
I'll do no such thing. I'm going
there myself. You too, Anderson.

19
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,180
You too, Cobb.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,983
Make three train reservations
to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,083
Where?
- Mandrake Falls.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,020
'Welcome to Mandrake Falls...

23
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,922
...where the scenery enthrals...

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,655
...where no hardship e'er befalls.

25
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,664
Welcome to Mandrake Falls.'

26
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,133
That's pretty.

27
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,470
You're sure he lives in this town?
- This is the town, all right.

28
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,239
Well, I hope it's not a wild goose chase.

29
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,743
No, sir, we checked it thoroughly.
He lives here, all right.

30
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,335
l spy a native.
Let's ask him.

31
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:09,040
Good morning.
- Morning, neighbors, morning.

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,460
That's an excellent start.
At least we've broken the ice.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,296
Do you know a fellow
by the name of Longfellow Deeds?

34
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,861
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy.

35
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,924
Everyone knows Deeds.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,380
Must be a game he's playing.

37
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,673
We'd like to get in touch with him.

38
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,175
Who's that?
- Deeds. Who do you think?

39
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,545
Oh, yes, Deeds.
Fine fellow. Very democratic.

40
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,895
You won't have no trouble at all.
Talks to anybody.

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,985
We'd better try somebody else.
- No.

42
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,156
Next time he comes out, I'll straddle
him while you ask him your questions.

43
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,256
Morning, neighbors.

44
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,962
Remember us, the fellows
who were here a minute ago?

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,198
Oh, yes, indeedy.
l never forget a face.

46
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,926
Listen, pop.

47
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,238
We've come all the way from New York
to look up a fellow named Deeds.

48
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,773
It's important.
It's very important.

49
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,276
Don't get rough, neighbor.
Just ask.

50
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,280
Then please pretend, for just one
fleeting moment, that I'm asking.

51
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,281
Where does he reside?
- Who?

52
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,420
Longfellow Deeds.
Where does he live?

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,992
Oh, that's what you want. Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,263
Those fellows don't know what they're
talking about. I'll take you there.

55
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:29,143
If they'd only explained to me
what they want, there'd be no trouble.

56
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,307
Oh. Will you come in,
please, gentlemen?

57
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,942
Is Mr. Deeds in?
- No.

58
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:40,113
He's over to the park arranging a bazaar
to raise money for the fire engine.

59
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,315
Mal, you should've knowed
he was in the park.

60
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,784
Knowed it all the time,
but they wanted to see the house.

61
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,987
Can't read their minds
if they don't say what they want.

62
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,556
Come in, please.

63
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,058
Can l get you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

64
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,562
Sit down. Sure l couldn't get you
a glass of lemonade or something?

65
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,564
No.
That's very kind of you.

66
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,500
Are you related to him?
- No, I'm his housekeeper.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,503
We'd like to find out something
about him. What does he do for a living?

68
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,840
He and Jim Mason own the tailor works,
but that's not how he makes his money.

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,411
He makes most of it from his poetry.
- He writes poetry?

70
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,247
Oh, my goodness, yes.
Longfellow's famous.

71
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,416
He writes all those things on postcards.

72
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,186
You know, for Christmas
and Easter and birthdays.

73
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,688
Sit down, please.

74
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,451
Here's one.
He got 25 dollars for this one.

75
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,828
'When you've nowhere to turn
and you're filled with doubt...

76
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,598
...don't stand in midstream hesitating...

77
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,734
...for you know that your mother's heart
cries out--...

78
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,235
'I'm waiting, my boy, I'm waiting.''

79
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,174
Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't it a lovely sentiment?

80
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,274
Yeah.

81
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,077
Here he is now.

82
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,686
l suggest you break it to him gently.
He's liable to keel over from the shock.

83
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,022
They've been waiting a long while.

84
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,556
Who are they?
- I don't know.

85
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,362
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
- Yes.

86
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,966
How do you do?

87
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:13,271
I'm John Cedar, of the New York firm
of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

88
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,398
Budington must feel like an awful stranger.

89
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,950
Mr. Cornelius Cobb. Mr. Anderson.
- How do you do?

90
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,619
You gentlemen
make yourselves comfortable.

91
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,719
Thank you.

92
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,288
Thanks.

93
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,686
New mouthpiece.
Been waitin' two weeks for this.

94
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:41,000
Kids keep swiping them all the time.
They use 'em for bean shooters.

95
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,237
What can l do for you gentlemen?
- You gentlemen going to stay to lunch?

96
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,040
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,009
Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds' son?
- Yes.

98
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,011
Your parents living?
- Why, no.

99
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,015
Well, Mr. Deeds, does the name of
Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,351
Not much.
He's an uncle of mine, l think.

101
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,187
l never saw him.
My mother's name was Semple.

102
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,524
Well, he passed on. He was killed
in a motor accident in Italy.

103
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,559
He was? Gee, that's too bad.

104
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:12,165
If there's anything l can do--
- l have good news for you, sir.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,001
Mr. Semple left a large fortune
when he died.

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,101
He left it all to you.

107
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,805
Deducting the taxes...

108
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:23,576
...it amounts to something in
the neighborhood of 20 million dollars.

109
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,079
How about lunch?
Are the gentlemen staying?

110
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,847
Of course.

111
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,617
She's got some fresh orange layer cake
with that thick stuff on the top.

112
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,202
Sure. They don't want to go to the hotel.

113
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,660
Perhaps you didn't hear
what l said, Mr. Deeds.

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,297
The whole Semple fortune goes to you--
20 million dollars.

115
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,167
Oh, yes, l heard you, all right.
Twenty million is quite a lot, isn't it?

116
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,168
It'll do in a pinch.
- Yes, indeed.

117
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,912
l wonder why he left me all that money.
l don't need it.

118
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,090
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman.

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,293
Associated with your uncle
for many years, as a sort of buffer.

120
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,095
Buffer?

121
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,358
Yeah.
A glorified doormat.

122
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,869
Rich people need someone to keep the
crowds away. The world's full of pests.

123
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,370
Then there's the newspapers.

124
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,474
One must know when to seek publicity
and when to avoid it.

125
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,600
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

126
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,679
l can't think of a rhyme for 'Budington.'

127
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,415
Why should you?

128
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,885
Whenever l run across a funny name,
l like to poke around for a rhyme.

129
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,985
Don't you?
- No.

130
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,350
I've got one for Cobb.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:49,529
There once was a man named Cobb
who kept Semple away from the mob.

132
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,031
Came the turn of the tide
and Semple, he died.

133
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,596
Now poor Cobb's out of a job.

134
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,338
Sounds like two weeks' notice to me.
- Huh?

135
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,142
I've gotten the sackeroo in many ways,
but never in rhyme.

136
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,411
I don't mean that.
I'll need your help.

137
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,513
That's different,
if it's just poetry.

138
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,015
Are you married?

139
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,716
Who, me? No.

140
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,352
He's too fussy for that.
That's what's the matter with him.

141
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,756
There's lots of nice girls
right here in Mandrake Falls--

142
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,758
Don't pay any attention to her.

143
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:23,296
He's got a lot of foolish notions
about saving a lady in distress.

144
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,694
Now, you keep out of this.

145
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,570
Saving a lady in distress, eh? We all
have dreams like that when we're young.

146
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,240
Incidentally, we'd better get started.
You'll have to pack.

147
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,742
What for?
- You're going to New York with us.

148
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,911
When?
- This afternoon, 4:00.

149
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,913
l don't think we've got any suitcases.

150
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,250
Well, we could borrow a couple
from Mrs. Simpson.

151
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,945
She went to Niagara Falls last year.

152
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,491
I'm kinda nervous. I've never been
away from Mandrake Falls in my life.

153
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,494
Like to see Grant's tomb, though.
- I can understand that.

154
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,996
We'll meet you at the train at 4:00.

155
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,166
Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one
of the richest men in the country.

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,168
See you later.
Good-bye. Thank you.

157
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,243
See you later, kid.
- Good day, sir.

158
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,715
Did you hear what he said?
Do you know how much 20 million is?

159
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:22,190
I don't care. You sit there and eat
your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

160
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,160
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

161
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,363
For he's a jolly good fellow

162
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,503
Which nobody can deny...

163
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,106
...l can't find him. l looked everywhere.
His house is locked up.

164
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,109
Probably had a change of heart.
- He wasn't anxious to come.

165
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,404
Here comes the train.

166
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,850
Look.
- What?

167
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,950
That tuba player.

168
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,055
Well...

169
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,124
...now I've seen everything.

170
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,415
Good-bye, Mrs. Meredith.

171
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,412
Good-bye, Jim.

172
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,819
Bye, Buddy.

173
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,556
Gosh, l got a lot of friends.

174
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,363
Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

175
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,676
Cigar?

176
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,244
No, thank you.

177
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,246
l wouldn't worry if l were you.

178
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:32,184
A large portion like this entails great
responsibility, but you'll have help.

179
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,654
So don't worry.
Leave everything to me.

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,223
l wasn't worried about that.
- No?

181
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:43,443
l was wondering where they're gonna
get another tuba player for the band.

182
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,816
Hello, John. Where you been?
- I've been fishing.

183
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,956
Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

184
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,045
Good morning.
Where are they?

185
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,125
Waiting for you.
- Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

186
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,225
Good morning.

187
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,031
Hello, boys.
- Well, what's he like?

188
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,635
We've nothing to worry about.
He's as naive as a child.

189
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,136
Close that door.

190
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,972
Get Mrs. Cedar on the phone.
- John, what happened?

191
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,642
The smartest thing l ever did
was to make that trip.

192
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,243
John, did you get--
- No, Budington.

193
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,746
l didn't get the power of attorney,
but I will.

194
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,583
l asked him what he was going to do with
the money. What do you suppose he said?

195
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,951
Give it away.

196
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,722
The boy must be a nitwit.
- John, you had the right hunch.

197
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,224
John, we can't afford--
- l know, Budington.

198
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,027
We can't afford to have the books
investigated right now.

199
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,029
You've said that a thousand times.

200
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,031
What if they fall
into somebody else's hands?

201
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,532
It hasn't happened yet.

202
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,701
But half-a-million dollars,
my goodness--

203
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,636
Will you stop worrying.

204
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:02,108
l got Semple to turn it all over to us.
And who got power of attorney from him?

205
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,310
All right, then I'll get it again.

206
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,379
Now, take it easy. Those books
will never leave this office.

207
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,970
Yokel.
Nothing but a yokel.

208
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,952
Your uncle must've been mad
to leave all that money to him.

209
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:18,407
You're as closely related to him
as he is, and what did you get?

210
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,994
I say, what did you get?
- Stop yelling.

211
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,997
Can l help it if Uncle didn't like me?
- l told you to be nice to him.

212
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,000
Ten years we've waited
for that old man to kick off.

213
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,470
Then we were gonna be on Easy Street.
Yeah, on Easy Street.

214
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,107
It's too late now. You're a nuisance.
- That's just what I'm gonna be.

215
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,477
I'm gonna be a nuisance
until I get ahold of some of that money.

216
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,577
He's news.

217
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,082
Every time he blows his nose,
it's news.

218
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,485
A corn-fed bohunk like that falling
into the Semple fortune is hot copy.

219
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,988
It's gotta be personal.
It's gotta have an angle.

220
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,224
What does he think about?
How does it feel to be a millionaire?

221
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,060
What does he think of New York?
Is he smart? Dumb? A million angles.

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,030
He's been here three days,
and what have you numbskulls brought in?

223
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,633
A half-wit novice could've done better.
- We tried--

224
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,235
Am I talking too loud or annoying anybody?

225
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,572
You know Corny Cobb.
He's keeping him under lock and key.

226
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,008
Never mind.
Use what little brains you've got.

227
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,412
Find out something for yourselves,
you imbecilic stupes.

228
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:18,952
Now get out of here before
l really tell you what l think of you.

229
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,346
What was that?
- l said you had dirty plaster.

230
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,763
You too.

231
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:35,501
Thought l could depend on you,
but you're as bad as the rest.

232
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,836
Look. l can do it.

233
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,737
What's gotten into you, Babe?

234
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,741
Normally you'd blast this town wide open
before letting Cobb get away with this.

235
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,743
He's not getting away with anything.

236
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,479
Babe, get me some stuff on this guy
and you can have--...

237
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,064
Can I have a month's vacation?
- With pay.

238
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,788
With pay? Leave four columns open
on the front page tomorrow.

239
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,525
I'll keep the whole front page open.
What are you gonna do?

240
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,625
Have lunch.

241
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,216
The first time l ever
had a suit made on purpose.

242
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,343
It's merely a suggestion, Mr. Deeds...

243
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,316
...but if you'll give me power of attorney,
we'll take care of everything.

244
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,153
It'll save you a lot of annoyances.
Everyone will try to sell you something.

245
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,323
There have been a lot of them already.
Strangest kind of people.

246
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,626
Salesmen, politicians, moochers.
All want something.

247
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,428
Haven't had a minute to myself.
Haven't seen Grant's tomb yet.

248
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,531
Your uncle didn't bother with that sort
of thing. He left everything to us.

249
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,533
He traveled, enjoyed himself.

250
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,903
You should do the same thing.

251
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,739
Besides wanting to be my lawyer...

252
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,741
...you want to handle my investments too?

253
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,278
Yes. That is to say--
- How much extra would it cost?

254
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,248
No extra charge.
- That's a lot of extra work.

255
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,986
But that's a service Cedar, Cedar,
Cedar and Budington usually donates.

256
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,384
Budington.

257
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,858
l can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.

258
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,561
The gentlemen from the opera are
still waiting in the board room, sir.

259
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,563
They're getting a trifle impatient.

260
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,666
l forgot about them.
What do you think they want?

261
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,735
Your uncle was chairman of the board.
They probably expect you to carry on.

262
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,406
I'll tell those mugs to keep their
shirts on and that you'll be right down.

263
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,475
Oh, did you send that telegram
to Jim Mason yet?

264
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,477
Jim Mason?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

265
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,248
No, l didn't send it. I've got it
written out, though. Here it is.

266
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,984
'Arthur's been with the tailor works
too long. Stop.

267
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,987
Don't think we should fire him.
Longfellow.'

268
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,523
Send it right away.
l don't want him to fire Arthur.

269
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,625
Sure, we don't want to fire Arthur.

270
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,628
He was the last baby
my father delivered, Arthur was.

271
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,130
You ought to give this matter
some thought.

272
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,466
l mean about the power of attorney.

273
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,502
Oh, yes, l will.
I'll give it a lot of thought.

274
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,505
There was a fellow named Winslow
here a while ago...

275
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,208
...wanted to handle my business
for nothing too.

276
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,812
Puzzles me why these people want
to work for nothing. It isn't natural.

277
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,181
l guess I'd better think about it some more.

278
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,875
That's that.

279
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,853
You go to an awful lot of work
to keep a fella warm.

280
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,921
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,090
A Mr. Hallor to see you, sir.

282
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,784
Hallor?
Don't let him in.

283
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,160
Why not? Who's he?

284
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,630
A lawyer representing a woman.
Some claim against the estate.

285
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,468
If he has a claim, we'd better see him.
Send him in.

286
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,937
He'll cause you a lot of trouble.

287
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,273
How can he make trouble for me?
I haven't done anything.

288
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,844
l told you to take this up with me.
- I'm tired of being pushed around.

289
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,846
I don't care how important you are.

290
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,682
Mr. Deeds, l represent Mrs. Semple.
- Mrs. Semple?

291
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,685
Your uncle's common-law wife.
She has a legal claim on the estate.

292
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,789
Suppose we let the courts decide--
- You wouldn't dare take this to court.

293
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,457
I'll leave it to you.

294
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,028
Would any court not be in sympathy with
a woman who gave up her best years...

295
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,030
...for an old man like your uncle?

296
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,033
What kind of wife did you say?
- Common-law wife.

297
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,369
On top of that, there's a child.
- Child? My uncle?

298
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,528
Yes, sir.
- That's awful.

299
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,507
The poor woman should be
taken care of immediately.

300
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,009
I'm glad to see you're
willing to be reasonable.

301
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,413
If she was his wife, she should have
the money. l don't want a penny.

302
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,081
Don't make any rash promises.

303
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,151
Better go. That opera mob is about to
break into the mad song from Lucia.

304
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,220
l don't wanna keep them waiting.
They're important people.

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,624
Very good, sir.
- l can't go down like this.

306
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,627
l wish you'd go along with me, Cobb.
They're all strangers to me.

307
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,096
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- Huh?

308
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:28,531
Oh. You'll excuse me, won't you?
I'll be right back.

309
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,876
Gee, I'm busy. Do the opera people
always come here for their meetings?

310
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,878
Uh-huh.
- That's funny. Why's that?

311
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,038
Why do mice go where there's cheese?

312
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,085
I'm led to believe
the young man's quite childish.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,088
We won't have any difficulty
getting him to put up the entire amount.

314
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,858
After all, it's only $180,000.
- Excellent idea.

315
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,662
We're very fortunate the young man
is so sympathetic toward music.

316
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,737
He plays the tuba in the town band.

317
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,832
Here he comes.
- Good.

318
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,942
The first order of business will be
electing a new chairman of the board.

319
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,745
As a sentimental gesture toward
the best friend that opera ever had--...

320
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,247
...the late Mr. Semple--...

321
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,283
...l think it only fitting that his nephew,
Mr. Longfellow Deeds...

322
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,985
...should be made our next chairman.

323
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,688
l therefore nominate him.
- Seconded.

324
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,120
All those in favor?
- Aye.

325
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,190
Carried.

326
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,528
Our congratulations, Mr. Deeds.

327
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,531
I'm chairman?
- Yes. You've just been elected.

328
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,566
I'm chairman.
- Happy voyage.

329
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,634
Right here, Mr. Deeds.

330
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,642
Now, the next order of business--
the reading of the secretary's minutes.

331
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,644
Move we dispense with it.
- Seconded.

332
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,146
All in favor?
- Aye.

333
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,148
l think they can be dispensed with.

334
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,151
We're ready for the treasurer's report.
- Move we dispense with it.

335
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,291
Seconded.
- All in favor.

336
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,656
Quite right. Now, gentlemen,
the next order of business--

337
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,192
Just a minute.
What does the chairman do?

338
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,662
Well, the chairman presides the meeting.

339
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,230
That's what l thought.

340
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,365
But, if you don't mind, I'm rather
interested in the treasurer's report.

341
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,711
The treasurer reports a deficit
of $180,000 for the current year.

342
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,548
A deficit?
You mean we lost that much?

343
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,051
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera
is not conducted for profit.

344
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,287
It isn't?
What is it conducted for?

345
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,852
It's an artistic institution.

346
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,859
We own an opera house, don't we?
- We do.

347
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,104
And we give shows?
- We provide opera.

348
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,398
But you charge-- l mean, you sell tickets?

349
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,400
Of course.
- And it doesn't pay?

350
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,268
Impossible.
The opera has never paid.

351
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,405
Well, then, we must give
the wrong kind of shows.

352
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,942
There isn't any wrong or right kind.
Opera is opera.

353
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:55,214
l guess, but I wouldn't care to be head
of a business that kept losing money.

354
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,882
That wouldn't be common sense.

355
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,652
Incidentally, where is
the $180,000 coming from?

356
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,556
Well, we were rather expecting it
to come from you.

357
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,656
Me?
- Naturally.

358
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:12,219
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There's nothing natural about that.

359
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,034
Fire engine.

360
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,378
Gee, that was a pip.

361
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,916
We're gonna have one like that in
Mandrake Falls soon, with a siren too.

362
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,351
Uh, where were we?

363
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,654
You see, the opera is not conducted
like any ordinary business.

364
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,790
Why not?
- Because it just isn't a business.

365
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,627
Maybe it isn't to you,
but it certainly is to me...

366
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,963
...if l have to make up a loss of $180,000.

367
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,799
If it's losing that much money,
there must be something wrong.

368
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,003
Maybe you charge too much.
Maybe you're selling bad merchandise.

369
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,005
A lot of things.
l don't know.

370
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,008
You see, I expect to do
a lot of good with that money...

371
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,611
...and I can't afford to put it into
anything that l don't look into.

372
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,148
That's my decision
for the time being, gentlemen.

373
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,318
Good-bye, and thank you
for making me chairman.

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:11,773
Gentlemen, you'll find the
smelling salts in the medicine chest.

375
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,204
Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,276
Those opera people are funny.
They wanted me to put up $180,000.

377
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,279
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- l turned them down, naturally.

378
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,948
No, l mean about my client.
- Oh.

379
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,451
We'll have to do something
about the common wife.

380
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,145
Tails tonight, sir?
- Tails?

381
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,789
Why, that's a monkey suit.

382
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,025
You want people to laugh at me?
I've never worn one of those in my life.

383
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,027
Good-bye, and thank you, sir.

384
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,530
Good-bye.
Wants me to wear a monkey suit.

385
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,533
We don't want to appear greedy.
- Huh?

386
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,236
l say, we don't want to appear greedy.
- Oh, that.

387
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,772
What are you doing?
- Assisting you, sir.

388
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:06,652
l don't want anybody holding
the ends of my pants. Get up from there.

389
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,915
Imagine that.
Holding the ends of my pants.

390
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,651
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law
to one-third of the estate.

391
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,954
Don't ever get on your knees again.
- No, sir.

392
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,189
What'd you say?

393
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,958
Mrs. Semple is entitled
to one-third of the estate.

394
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,094
One-third.
That's about seven million dollars.

395
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,129
Well, we didn't expect that much.

396
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,866
I'm sure I can get her
to settle quietly for one million.

397
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,402
Take up any settlement talk
with me in the office.

398
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,104
I'll do no such thing.

399
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:36,274
That's right. There's only one place
you're going, and that's out the door.

400
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,710
You're making a mistake.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

401
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,078
l don't like your face.

402
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,915
Besides, there's something fishy about
a person who'd settle for a million...

403
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,984
...when they can get seven million.

404
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,121
I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar,
who's supposed to be a smart man...

405
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,622
...couldn't see through that.

406
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,457
Now, wait a minute, buddy--

407
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,094
One nice thing about being rich--
you ring a bell and things happen.

408
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,897
When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor,
I'll ask him to show you to the door.

409
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,565
Many people don't know where it is.

410
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,369
No use in getting tough. That'll
get you nowhere. We've got letters.

411
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,305
Show Mr. Hallor to the front door.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,576
There isn't any wife, there aren't any
letters, and I think you're a crook...

413
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,651
...so you'd better watch your step.

414
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,795
I can't hold out any longer.

415
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,218
Lamb bites wolf.
Beautiful.

416
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,089
It's only common sense.

417
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,425
I can't hold out any longer either,
Mr. Deeds.

418
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,827
Being an attorney for you
will be a very simple affair.

419
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,731
You're not my attorney yet, not
until l find out what's on your mind.

420
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,435
Suppose you get the books straightened
out so I can have a look at 'em.

421
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,103
Yes, of course, if you wish.

422
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,573
But you must be prepared. This sort
of thing will be daily routine.

423
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,576
If it becomes annoying,
you let me know.

424
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,411
Good-bye, Mr. Deeds.

425
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,511
Good-bye, sir.

426
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,289
Even his hands are oily.

427
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,562
Well, how about tonight? What would you
like in the way of entertainment?

428
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,896
Entertainment?

429
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,467
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones.
Tall and stately.

430
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,036
How would you like yours?
Dark or fair?

431
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,905
Tall or short? Fat or thin?
Tough or tender?

432
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,641
What are you talking about?
- Women.

433
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,143
Ever heard of 'em?

434
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,778
Oh.

435
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,915
Name your poison, and I'll supply it.
- Some other time, Cobb.

436
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,015
Okay. You're the boss.

437
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,119
When your blood begins to boil,
yell out.

438
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,219
I'll be seeing you.

439
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,360
He talks about women
as if they were cattle.

440
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,020
Every man to his taste, sir.

441
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,233
Tell me, Walter, are all these stories
l hear about my uncle true?

442
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,337
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many
as 20 in the house at the same time.

443
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:51,217
Twenty? What'd he do with 'em?
- That is something l never found out.

444
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,932
Hey. You going out?

445
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,975
Yes. Isn't that all right?
- No.

446
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,411
You never go out without telling us.
- Who are you?

447
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,313
We're your bodyguards.

448
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,814
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,250
Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail.

450
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,921
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb, but l
don't want anybody sticking to my tail.

451
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,989
Sorry, mister.
Orders is orders.

452
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,992
We gotta get you up in the morning,
put you to bed at night.

453
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,995
Only it's all right. No matter
what we see, we don't see nothin', see?

454
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,064
That's gonna be fun.
- Some people like it.

455
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,167
Will you do something for me first?
- Sure.

456
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,703
Put that away, slug.
At your service.

457
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,506
Would you get my trunk out for me?
- Certainly.

458
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,606
With pleasure.

459
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,107
We're your bodyguards.
You can't do this.

460
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
There he is.

461
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,967
That's him.
- That's who?

462
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,970
Get your cameras ready and follow me.
- What are you gonna do?

463
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,973
Never mind. Follow me
and grab whatever you can get.

464
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,175
It's gonna be the same old thing.

465
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,485
That dame is nuts.
- Right.

466
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,105
You fainted.

467
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,205
Oh, did l? I'm sorry.

468
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,457
Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

469
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,946
This is my house.

470
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,211
I'd like to--
- Oh, no, really, I'll be all right.

471
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,486
What happened?

472
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,454
Well, l-- I guess l walked too much.

473
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,825
I've been looking for a job all day.

474
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,952
l found one too.
l start tomorrow.

475
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,854
You've been awfully kind.
Thank you very much.

476
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,546
Hey. Taxi.

477
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,586
Hey, Stu, follow that cab
they just got into, will ya.

478
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:52,171
Hurry up. Step on it.
- Come on, let's go.

479
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,248
Feel better now?

480
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,919
This tastes so good.

481
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,857
Mr. Deeds, l don't know
how l can ever thank you.

482
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,653
Tell me more about yourself.

483
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,231
Well, l guess I've told you
almost everything there is to tell.

484
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,067
My folks live in a small town near Hartford.

485
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,907
I'm down here alone trying to make a living.

486
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,202
I'm really just a nobody.

487
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh, that was so lovely.
Thank you.

488
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,277
You were a lady in distress,
weren't you?

489
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,017
What?

490
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,117
Nothing.

491
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,954
Waiter.

492
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,524
Has anybody come in yet?
- Uh, no. Nobody important.

493
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,027
Be sure and point them out to me.

494
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,952
I'm a writer myself, you know.
l write poetry.

495
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,571
Well...

496
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,574
...you've been having quite
an exciting time, haven't you?

497
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,144
With all these meetings,
business deals, society people...

498
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,679
...haven't you been having fun?

499
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,547
No.

500
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,418
That is, I didn't until I met you.
l like talking to you though.

501
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,421
Imagine my finding you
right on my doorstep.

502
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,924
Brookfield's just come in.
- Who? The poet? Where?

503
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:45,294
Over at that big round table.
The one that looks like a poodle.

504
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,066
Look, there's Brookfield,
the poet.

505
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,166
Really?

506
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,937
Pardon.

507
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:57,041
Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited
the Semple fortune, wants to meet you.

508
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,144
Oh, yes. l read about him.
He writes poetry on postcards.

509
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,147
Let's invite him over.
Might get a couple of laughs.

510
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,916
Getting rather dull around here.

511
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,584
It's always dull here.

512
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,684
I'll get him.
- Good.

513
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,692
Mr. Henneberry.
Mr. Morrow. Bill.

514
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,096
This is Mr. Deeds and his fiancee
from Mandrake Falls.

515
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,321
How do you do, Mr. Deeds?

516
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,570
Nice of you to ask us
to come and sit with you.

517
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,439
Back home we never get a chance
to meet famous people.

518
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,543
Waiter, a little service here.
- Yes, a drink for Mr. Deeds.

519
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,113
l don't want it, thank you.
- You must. All poets drink.

520
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,149
Tell me, Mr. Deeds,
how do you go about writing your poems?

521
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,319
We craftsmen are very interested
in one another's methods.

522
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,123
Do you have to wait for an inspiration,
or do you just dash it off?

523
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,259
Well, I--
- Morrow just dashes them off.

524
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,374
Yeah. That's what my publishers
have been complaining about.

525
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,968
Well, your readers don't complain,
Mr. Morrow.

526
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,303
Oh. Thanks.

527
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,528
How about you, Mr. Deeds?

528
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,807
Well, I write mine on order.

529
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,644
The people l work for tell me
what they want, and then l write it.

530
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,346
Amazing.

531
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,081
Why, that's true genius.

532
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:15,111
Have you any peculiar characteristics
when you're creating?

533
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,849
Well, I-- l play the tuba.

534
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,791
How original.

535
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,794
Well, I've been playing the harmonica
for 40 years.

536
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,189
Didn't do me a bit of good.

537
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,467
You wouldn't have one
in your pocket, would you?

538
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,092
What, a tuba?

539
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,073
No, a postcard
with one of your poems on it.

540
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,509
Oh, no.
- You don't carry a pocketful with you?

541
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,579
Oh, too bad. l was hoping
you'd autograph one for me.

542
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,048
l was too.
- Now wait a minute, boys.

543
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,951
Perhaps Mr. Deeds would recite one for us.

544
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,953
That's a very good idea.

545
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,422
Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff.

546
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,524
How about a Mother's Day poem?

547
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,862
Exactly. Give us one that rings
the great American heart.

548
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,962
Yes. Go ahead.

549
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:04,869
l get the idea. l know why
l was invited here-- to make fun of me.

550
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,305
Oh, not at all.
- Don't be ridiculous.

551
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,806
Look, he's temperamental.

552
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,711
Yeah? What if I am?
What about it?

553
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,647
It's easy to make fun of somebody
if you don't care how much you hurt 'em.

554
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,983
I think your poems are swell,
Mr. Brookfield...

555
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,985
...but I'm disappointed in you.

556
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,121
l must look funny to you...

557
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,257
...but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls
you'd look just as funny to us...

558
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,260
...only nobody would laugh at you
and make you feel ridiculous...

559
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,096
...because that wouldn't be good manners.

560
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,134
Maybe writing postcard poems is comical,
but a lot of people think they're good.

561
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,136
Anyway, it's the best l can do.

562
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,139
So if you'll excuse me,
we'll be leaving.

563
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:46,339
l guess l found out that
all famous people aren't big people.

564
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,847
Just one thing more.

565
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,850
If it weren't for Miss Dawson being
here, I'd bump your heads together.

566
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,585
Oh, l don't mind.

567
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,895
Then l guess maybe l will.

568
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,193
Waiter.

569
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,795
Eureka.

570
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,433
Stop it.
Go away, go away.

571
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,969
Step aside.

572
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,306
Say, fella, you neglected me
and I feel very put out.

573
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,509
Look, sock it right there, will ya?
Sock it hard.

574
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,212
I've got it off my chest.
- Oh, listen.

575
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,849
The difference between them and me is,
I know when I've been a skunk.

576
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,520
You take me to the nearest newsstand and
I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw.

577
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,988
Raw.

578
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,922
Oh, what a magnificent deflation
of smugness.

579
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,962
Pal, you've added ten years to my life.

580
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:42,533
A poet with a straight left
and a right hook? Delicious. Delicious.

581
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:47,105
You're my guest from now on,
forever and a day, even unto eternity.

582
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,842
Thanks, but we're going sightseeing.
- Fine. Fine. Swell.

583
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,979
You've just shown me a sight lovely
to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate.

584
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,982
Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet--
Thanks--...

585
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,852
...and I'll show you sights
that you've never seen before.

586
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,488
I'd like to see Grant's tomb
and the Statue of Liberty.

587
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,958
You'll not only see those,
but before the evening's half through...

588
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,393
...you'll be leaning against
the Leaning Tower of Pisa...

589
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,895
...you'll mount Mount Everest.

590
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,397
I'll show you the pyramids
and all the little pyramidees...

591
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,399
...leaping from sphinx to sphinx.

592
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,403
Pal, how would you like to go on
a real old-fashioned binge?

593
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,772
Binge?
- Yeah, l mean the regain McCoy.

594
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,774
You play saloon with me...

595
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,578
...and I'll introduce you to every wit,
nitwit and half-wit in New York.

596
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,649
We'll go on a twister that'll make
Omar the soused philosopher of Persia...

597
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,652
...look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.

598
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,846
That oughta be fun, huh?
- Fun? Say--

599
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,691
Listen, I'll take you on a bender...

600
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:45,062
...that will live in your memory
as a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

601
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,596
Boy? Boy, my headpiece.

602
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,964
O Tempora. O Mores. O Bacchus.

603
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,095
Oh, you're drunk.
- Oh, you're right.

604
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:59,295
If we go with him, we'll see things.
- I guess we will.

605
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,716
''I play the tuba to help me think.'

606
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,719
This is one of the many startling
statements made by Longfellow Deeds...

607
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,321
New York's new Cinderella Man...

608
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,391
...who went out last night to prove
that his uncle, the late M.W. Semple...

609
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,426
...from whom he inherited
20 million dollars...

610
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,398
...was an amateur in the art of standing
the town on its cauliflower ear.'

611
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,068
'Cinderella Man.'
That's sensational, Babe, sensational.

612
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,170
Took some high-powered acting,
believe me.

613
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,739
Did it?
- I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

614
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,942
Is he really that big a sap?

615
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,278
He's the original.
There are no carbon copies of that one.

616
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:38,416
'Cinderella Man.' That'll stick to him
for the rest of his life.

617
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,019
Can you imagine Cobb's face
when he reads this?

618
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,255
If we could sell tickets,
we'd make a fortune.

619
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,258
How'd you get the picture?
- Had the boys follow us.

620
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,459
Marvelous.

621
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,761
'At 2:00 a.m.
Mr. Deeds tied up traffic...

622
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,771
...while he fed a bagful of donuts to a horse.

623
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,201
When asked why he was doing it
he replied...

624
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:03,846
'To see how many donuts the horse would
eat before he asked for some coffee.''

625
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,546
Beautiful.
What happened after that?

626
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,283
l don't know. l had to write the story.
He was so drunk he never even missed me.

627
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,188
When are you gonna see him again?

628
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,787
Tonight, maybe.

629
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,624
I'll phone him at noon-- my lunch hour.

630
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,626
I'm a stenographer, you know.
Mary Dawson.

631
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,128
You're a genius, Babe, a genius.

632
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,130
I even moved into
MabeI Dawson's apartment...

633
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,699
...in case old snoopy Cobb
might start looking around.

634
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,702
Good. Stay there.
Don't show your face down here.

635
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,339
I'll say you're on vacation. No one will
know where the stories are coming from.

636
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:39,443
Stick close to him. You can get
an exclusive out of him every day.

637
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,545
We'll have the other papers crazy.

638
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,081
Babe, l could kiss ya.
- Oh, no. No.

639
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,518
Our deal was for a month's vacation.
- Sure.

640
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,348
With pay.
- You'll get it, Babe.

641
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,425
Mr. Deeds, sir.

642
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,358
You really must get up.
It's late.

643
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,897
You're Walter, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,599
Just wanted to make sure.

645
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:06,771
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you
were out on quite a bender last night.

646
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,806
Bender?
You're wrong, Walter.

647
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,844
We started out to a binge,
but we never got to it.

648
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,944
Yes, sir.

649
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,684
What's that?
- A prairie oyster, sir.

650
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,352
Prairie oyster?

651
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,888
Yes, sir.
It makes the head feel smaller.

652
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,731
Oh.

653
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:43,307
Has Miss Dawson called yet?
- No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

654
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,309
She was the lady in distress.

655
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,145
She wouldn't let me help her.
Had a lot of pride. I like that.

656
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,509
Oh, l do too, sir.

657
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,785
I'd better call her up and apologize.
l don't remember taking her home.

658
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,823
I'd venture to say you don't remember
much of what happened last night, sir.

659
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,258
What do you mean?
l remember everything.

660
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,762
Hand me my pants. l wrote
her phone number on a piece of paper.

661
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,057
You have no pants, sir.

662
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,101
You came home last night without them.

663
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,571
I did what?
- You came home without any clothes.

664
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,162
You were in your shorts.

665
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Yes, sir.

666
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:24,949
l couldn't walk around on the streets
without any clothes. I'd be arrested.

667
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,284
That's what the two policemen said, sir.

668
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,887
What two policemen?
- The ones who brought you home, sir.

669
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,591
They said you and another gentleman kept
going up and down the street shouting...

670
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:39,641
'Back to nature. Clothes are a blight
on civilization. Back to nature.'

671
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,567
Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow
calls up, tell him I'm not in.

672
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,636
He may be a great author, but...

673
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,332
...l think he's crazy, Walter.

674
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,541
Yes, sir.

675
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,178
Oh, by the way, did you--...

676
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,285
The knee.
- But how will l put on the slipper, sir?

677
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,385
Yes, sir.

678
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,863
l beg pardon, sir, but did you ever
find what you were looking for, sir?

679
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,365
Looking for?

680
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,401
You kept searching me last night, sir,
going through all my pockets.

681
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:22,006
You said you were looking
for a rhyme for 'Budington.'

682
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,342
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
- Very good, sir.

683
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,352
Oh, I beg pardon.
A telegram came for you, sir.

684
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,640
I'll get you some black coffee, sir.

685
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,029
Did you see all this stuff in the paper?

686
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,499
Arthur wants to quit.
- Arthur? Who's Arthur?

687
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,068
He's the shipping clerk at the tailor works.

688
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,337
Wants a two-dollar raise,
or he'll quit.

689
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,340
What do I care about Arthur?
Did you see this stuff in the paper?

690
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,977
How did it get in there? What did you
do last night? Who were you talking to?

691
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,979
And what did you do to those bodyguards?

692
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,181
They quit this morning.
Said you locked them up.

693
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,183
They insisted on following me.

694
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,353
What do you think bodyguards are for?
- What do they mean by this?

695
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,756
'Cinderella Man.'
- Are those stories true?

696
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,592
'Cinderella Man'?

697
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:19,029
They'd call you anything if you gave 'em
a chance. They got you down as a sap.

698
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,733
I'll punch this editor in the nose.
- No, you don't. Get this clear.

699
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,070
Socking people in the nose
is no solution for anything.

700
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,007
Sometimes it's the only solution.
- Not editors. Take my word for it.

701
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,277
If they're gonna poke fun at me, I'm--
- Listen, Longfellow.

702
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,812
You got brains, kid.

703
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,882
You'll get along swell if you'll only
curb your homicidal instincts.

704
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:42,086
And keep your trap shut.
These newshounds are gunning for you.

705
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,089
What about this 'Cinderella Man'?
- I'll take care of that.

706
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,092
I'll keep that stuff out of the papers,
if you'll help me.

707
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,462
But l can't do anything
if you go around talking to people.

708
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:55,589
Will you promise me
to be careful from now on?

709
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,568
Yes, l guess I'll have to.

710
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,236
Thank you.

711
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:05,201
If you feel the building rock,
it'll be me, blasting into this editor.

712
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,683
Cobb's right.
l mustn't talk to anybody.

713
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,686
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
- Who? Miss Dawson?

714
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,688
Yes, sir.
- Fine. I'll talk to her.

715
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,557
Give me the phone, quick.

716
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,802
She's the only one I'm gonna talk to.

717
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,106
Awfully nice of you to show me around.
- l enjoy it.

718
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,209
The aquarium was swell. If l lived
in New York, I'd go every day.

719
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,878
l bet you do.

720
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:44,348
I'd like to,
but l have a job to think of.

721
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,784
You'd better keep following that bus.

722
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,884
Keep your shirt on.

723
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:53,190
Looks like no pictures tonight.
- Maybe l oughta get him drunk again.

724
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,528
Got any news? l mean, has anything
exciting been happening lately?

725
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,628
Sure. l met you.

726
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,601
What's happening about the opera?

727
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,504
Oh, that. We had another meeting.
l told 'em I'd go on being chairman if--...

728
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,506
I'm chairman, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

729
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,509
l told 'em I'd play along
if they lowered prices...

730
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,511
...cut down expenses and broadcast.

731
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,546
Oh. What'd they say?

732
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,516
Gee, you look pretty tonight.

733
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,846
What'd they say?
- Huh? Oh.

734
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:26,056
They said l was crazy. They said
l wanted to run it like a grocery store.

735
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,366
What are they going to do?

736
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,395
Do you always wear your hair like that?

737
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,698
Isn't it a scream?
'Cinderella Man.' The dope.

738
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,767
Like to get my hooks into that guy.

739
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:41,372
Don't worry. Someone's
probably taking him for plenty.

740
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,736
If they were men
I'd knock their heads together.

741
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,668
Have you seen the papers?
- Uh-huh.

742
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:54,018
That's what I like about you.
You think about a man's feelings.

743
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:59,643
I'd like to punch the fella in the nose
that's writing that stuff.

744
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,725
'Cinderella Man.'

745
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:06,330
Pretty soon everybody'll
be calling me Cinderella Man.

746
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:14,138
Would you like to walk the rest
of the way? It's so nice out.

747
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,238
Yes.
- Yeah, let's.

748
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,081
Hey, wise guys, he's getting off.

749
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,641
Come on, pull up to the curb.

750
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,066
Oh, come on.
Don't you want to see it?

751
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,201
Well, feast your eyes.
Grant's tomb.

752
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,831
Is that it?

753
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,368
Hey, beetle puss.

754
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,435
The tomb.

755
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,644
Well, there you are. Grant's tomb.
l hope you're not disappointed.

756
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,481
It's wonderful.
- To most people it's an awful letdown.

757
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,283
Huh?

758
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,286
I say, to most people it's a washout.

759
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,946
That depends on what they see.

760
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,456
And what do you see?
- Me?

761
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,394
Oh, l see a small Ohio farm boy...

762
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,732
...becoming a great soldier.

763
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,734
I see thousands of marching men.

764
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:22,204
I see General Lee,
with a broken heart, surrendering.

765
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:27,344
I can see the beginning of a new nation,
like Abraham Lincoln said.

766
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:32,374
And l can see that Ohio boy
being inaugurated as president.

767
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:38,347
Things like that can only happen
in a country like America.

768
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,455
Excuse me.

769
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,464
Sorry, Mr. Hopper.
Mr. Cedar won't answer his phone.

770
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,867
What's going on in the boss's office?
- Search me.

771
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,870
The three C's and little 'B'
have been in there over an hour.

772
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,872
l don't want to be critical, but--

773
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,875
Yes, l know. A week's gone by and
we haven't got power of attorney yet.

774
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,410
Yes, but you said--
- l can't strangle him, can I?

775
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,180
It's ridiculous for us
to have to worry about a boy like that.

776
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,482
Look at these articles.
'Cinderella Man.'

777
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,819
He's carrying on like a idiot.
- Exactly what l was saying--

778
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,080
Who cares?

779
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,691
Yeah?
- Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting.

780
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,026
Let 'em wait.

781
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,128
They've been in every day this week.

782
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,130
Who are they?
- Relatives of old man Semple.

783
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,667
They keep insisting
they should have some nuisance value.

784
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:28,017
Nuisance value?
- If not for Deeds, they'd be rich.

785
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,873
Nuisance value.

786
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,973
Maybe they have.

787
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,680
Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please.

788
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,484
How do you do?
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

789
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:45,556
What was my secretary thinking,
keeping you waiting this long?

790
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,591
Will you have a cigar,
Mr. Semple?

791
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,360
Thanks.

792
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,297
There's Times Square.
- You can almost spit on it, can't you?

793
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,397
Why don't you try?

794
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
It's breezy up here.

795
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,310
You're worried about those articles
they're writing about you, aren't you?

796
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,312
Oh, I'm not worrying anymore.

797
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,315
They'll go on writing 'em
until they get tired.

798
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,817
You don't believe all that stuff,
do you?

799
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,820
Oh, they just do it
to sell the newspapers, you know.

800
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,322
Yeah, l guess so.

801
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,892
What puzzles me is why people
seem to get so much pleasure...

802
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,294
...out of hurting each other.

803
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:28,814
Why don't they try liking each other
once in a while?

804
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,601
Shall we go?

805
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,102
Here's a nice place.

806
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,511
Yeah. Anyway,
there aren't any photographers around.

807
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:52,322
You said something to me when you first
met me I've thought about a great deal.

808
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,959
What's that?
- You said l was a lady in distress.

809
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,461
Oh. That.

810
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,621
What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.

811
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,498
Have you got a--

812
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,003
Are you engaged or anything?

813
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,130
No. Are you?
- No.

814
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,445
You don't go out
with girls very much, do you?

815
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,347
l haven't.
- Why not?

816
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,216
Oh, I don't know.

817
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,553
You must've met a lot of society girls.
Don't you like them?

818
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,657
I haven't met anybody here
that l like particularly.

819
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,894
They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance.
Except you, of course.

820
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,696
People here are funny.

821
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,366
They work so hard at living,
they forget how to live.

822
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,003
Last night, after I left you,
l was walking along...

823
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,239
...and looking at the tall buildings...

824
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,509
...and I got to thinkin'
about what Thoreau said--...

825
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,011
'They created a lot of grand palaces here...

826
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,882
...but they forgot to create
the noblemen to put in them.'

827
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,617
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

828
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,256
I'm from a small town too, you know.
- Really?

829
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:03,026
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
- What do you know about that.

830
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,595
It's a beautiful little town too.

831
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,065
Grove poplar trees right along main street.

832
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,068
Always smells as if it just had a bath.

833
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,337
I've often thought about going back.
- You have?

834
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,038
Oh, yes.

835
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:20,911
I used to have a lot of fun there.
l loved going fishing with my father.

836
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,481
You know, that's funny.
He was a lot like you, my father was.

837
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,581
He talked like you too.

838
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,121
Sometimes he let me hold the line
while he smoked.

839
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,123
We'd just sit there for hours.

840
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:38,228
After a while, for no reason,
I'd go over, kiss him, sit in his lap.

841
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:42,566
He never said very much,
but once l remember him saying...

842
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,069
'No matter what happens, honey,
don't complain.'

843
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,206
He sounds like a person
well worth knowing.

844
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,942
He played in the town band too.
- He did?

845
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,944
I play the tuba.
- Yeah, l know.

846
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,947
What did he play?
- Drums. He taught me to play some.

847
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,316
He did?
- Mm-hmm. l can do 'Swanee River.'

848
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,221
Would you like to hear me?
- Sure.

849
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,088
Let's see, now.

850
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,829
Way down

851
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,830
Upon the Swanee River

852
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,766
Far, far away

853
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,297
There's where my heart is going ever

854
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,935
There's where the old folks stay

855
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,450
Oh, l suppose you could do better.

856
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,819
Sure.
l can sing 'Humoresque.'

857
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,288
l bet you don't even know how it goes.

858
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,892
Sure. You sing it over again,
and I'll do 'Humoresque' with it.

859
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,060
You better be good.

860
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,196
l wonder if they want to make it a quartet.

861
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,457
Ready?
- Yeah.

862
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,628
Way down upon the Swanee River

863
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,637
Far, far away

864
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,741
There's where my heart is going ever

865
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,746
There's where the old folks stay

866
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,841
All the world is sad and dreary

867
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:13,322
Everywhere l go

868
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,390
Fire engines.

869
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,997
Fire engine. l wanna see how they do it.
Wait for me, will you?

870
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,837
Looks like the evening's
not gonna be wasted.

871
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,962
Hello. What do you want?

872
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,041
Captain Deeds, fire volunteer,
Mandrake Falls.

873
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,803
Hi, Cap.
Boys, meet the captain.

874
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,639
What's the matter, hon?
- Nothing.

875
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,242
What's up, Babe?
Something's eatin' you.

876
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,833
No, it's nothing.

877
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,847
My unfailing instinct tells me
something's gone wrong with the stew.

878
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,780
Don't be ridiculous.

879
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,888
You haven't gotten very far, have you?
That's where you were an hour ago.

880
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,524
Let's knock off and go down to Joe's.
The gang's waitin' for us.

881
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,860
I can't write it, Mabel.
l don't know what's the matter with me.

882
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Uh-uh.

883
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,336
Yeah, she's here.
Who wants her?

884
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,804
Who?

885
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,600
Oh, yes.
Yes, just a moment.

886
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,533
It's him. Whatchamacallit.
The Cinderella Man.

887
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,513
The Cinderella Man.

888
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,191
Couldn't sleep. Kind of wanted
to talk to you. Do you mind?

889
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,194
No, not at all.
I couldn't sleep either.

890
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,164
l wanted to thank you again
for going out with me.

891
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,933
Huh?

892
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,435
l don't know what I'd do without you.

893
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,105
You've made up for all the fakes I've met.

894
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,578
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

895
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,615
You know what I've been doin'
since l got home?

896
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,741
I've been workin' on a poem.

897
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,979
It's about you.

898
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:28,458
Sometimes it's kind of hard for me
to say things, so I write 'em.

899
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,126
I'd like to read it sometime.

900
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,696
Maybe I'll have it finished
next time I see you.

901
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,026
Will I see you soon?

902
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,192
Gosh, that's swell, Mary.
Good night.

903
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,268
Good night.

904
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,412
MabeI, that guy's either the dumbest,
most imbecilic idiot in the world...

905
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,081
...or the grandest thing alive.

906
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,731
l can't make him out.
- Uh-huh.

907
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,686
I'm crucifying him.
- People have been crucified before.

908
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,688
Why do we have to do it?

909
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,690
You started out to be
a successful newspaperwoman.

910
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,627
And then what?
- Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

911
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,096
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh.

912
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,131
To us he looks like a freak.

913
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,701
Do you know what he told me tonight?

914
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:15,839
When he gets married he wants to
carry his bride over the threshold.

915
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,305
The guy's balmy.

916
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,277
Is he?
Yeah, l thought so too.

917
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,280
I tried to laugh,
but it stuck in my throat.

918
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,735
Cut it out, will ya? You'll get me
thinking about Charlie again.

919
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,946
He's got goodness, Mabel.

920
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,146
Do you know what that is?

921
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:38,328
Of course you don't. We've forgotten.
We're too busy being smart alecks.

922
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:42,083
Too busy in a crazy
competition for nothing.

923
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,904
l beg pardon, sir.

924
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,643
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone.
- Who?

925
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,646
Madame Pomponi. She says that everything
is all set for the reception.

926
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,649
Don't come in here when I'm playing.
- But she's on the telephone, sir.

927
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,252
Get out.
The evil finger's on you.

928
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,786
The finger, sir?
- Get out.

929
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,594
Stop.

930
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,651
Did you hear that?
- What, sir?

931
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,043
Why, that's an echo, sir.

932
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,577
You try it.
- Me, sir?

933
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,182
Louder.

934
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,455
You try it.
- Me, sir?

935
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,059
Louder.

936
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,364
You try it.

937
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,102
All together.

938
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,941
Again.

939
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,081
Let that be a lesson to you.

940
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,720
Go back to your rooms,
both of you.
