1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,217
Thought I told you not to run
them sheep on my land!

2
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,118
It's my land, Garrett.

3
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,056
It became mine when
we signed that lease.

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,564
He's right, Mr. Garrett.

5
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:36,524
I'm paying you off when we get back,
and I'm breaking that goddamn lease.

6
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,532
- I don't allow the law would agree to that.
- What law is that?

7
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,542
Santa Fe Ring law?

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,041
Shit.

9
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:49,748
- Goddamn law is ruining the country.
- Ain't you still a part of that law?

10
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,344
Something wrong with that harness.

11
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,852
I believe they elected you and paid you
good wages for killing the Kid, huh?

12
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,929
You rotten son of a bitch.

13
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,779
- You try your luck, Eno.
- You miss more than anybody else does.

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,585
I'll bet on it.

15
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,350
You want the breast or the thigh?

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,482
What he always gets.

17
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,662
I want a breast and a thigh.

18
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,563
Jesus Christ!

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,404
- Who is it?
- Get down!

20
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,368
Goddamn, that's Garrett.

21
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,179
Hello, Bill.

22
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:39,055
- It's fair shooting for an old married man.
- Lucky, I guess. How are you, Kid?

23
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,022
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

24
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,992
- Hey, Billy!
- Who's this you got with you?

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,622
- Looking good.
- Having some kind of fiesta? Hello, Black.

26
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,936
We always live like this.
You ought to visit us more often.

27
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,064
I reckon the whole damn territory’s
gonna be one big open jug for us now.

28
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,904
- Is that right, Pat?
- Ain’t that right, Pat?

29
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:04,106
Take a two-day ride from Lincoln just to pay
me back the 2 dollars you owe me, Pat?

30
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,886
You'd better collect it now, Black.

31
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,348
We ain't gonna be seeing much
of Pat these days.

32
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,589
<i>Say, I understand those Mexican señoritas
are still pretty as ever down there.</i>

33
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,526
Yeah?

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,064
I know one's waiting on you, hoss,
with a knife.

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,932
- Remember them sisters?
- No. Which ones were they?

36
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,629
That one you got up and asked
how much you owed.

37
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,334
And she said,
"Whatever you think it's worth."

38
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,309
You threw a dime on her pillow.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,881
Girl said, " If that's all it's worth,
I might as well sew it up."

40
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,381
Son of a bitch.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

41
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,118
You don't figure he's too good
to drink with us, do you?

42
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,092
Maybe it's the other way around.

43
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,472
Jesus, don't you get stale
around here, Bill?

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,134
Maybe a year or so down in Mexico
will do you some good.

45
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,946
I didn't figure you'd bother
to make a ride out here.

46
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,779
Shit, you know me better than that.

47
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,248
You heard about Eben?

48
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,248
He drowned in the Rio Grande.

49
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,822
Trying to get to that old Mex
you're talking about.

50
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,625
He took two of the posse with him.

51
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,655
I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,329
I always liked old Eben.

53
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,938
At least he knew when it was
the right time to leave.

54
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,676
We did have some times, didn’t we?

55
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,946
It's gotta be pretty hard
to turn your back on all that.

56
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,285
You want it straight?

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,085
If that's what you're here for.

58
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,255
The electorate...

59
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,060
...wants you gone.

60
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,038
Out of the country.

61
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,475
But are they telling me,
or are they asking me?

62
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,914
I'm asking you.

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,354
But in five days, I'm making you.

64
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,330
Because I might take over sheriff
of Lincoln County.

65
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,090
Old Pat.

66
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,966
Sheriff Pat Garrett.

67
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,236
Sold out to the Santa Fe Ring.

68
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,703
How does it feel?

69
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,981
It...

70
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,388
...feels like times have changed.

71
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,321
Times maybe.

72
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,084
Not me.

73
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,635
Hey, why don't you stick around.

74
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,706
We got a few days left, ain’t we?

75
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,542
No, I gotta get back.

76
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,814
<i>Adiós, Pat.</i>

77
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,984
<i>Adiós, Bill.</i>

78
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,321
Don't press your luck.

79
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,186
I ain’t worried about my luck.

80
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,366
Why don't you kill him.

81
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,034
Why?

82
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,538
He's my friend.

83
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,588
Get on up, Billy.
You hear what I'm saying?

84
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,494
I ain't making no money
watching you boys sleep.

85
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,328
You like to waste the best part
of the damn day.

86
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,431
Let that squirrel loose!
You'll shake it to death.

87
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,506
- I'm just scratching.
- Chisum's cattle is waiting.

88
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,905
Oh, let them wait.

89
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,110
I hate a son of a bitch that gets up
noisy and full of himself.

90
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,519
I ain’t in this for my health, hateful.

91
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,752
That's awful.

92
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,035
- Pat ain’t gonna like this.
- What?

93
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:40,002
Coming down hard on him
the day after he got his new badge.

94
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,306
Hell, there ain’t no way
he's gonna know.

95
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,944
I ain’t afraid of Pat Garrett.

96
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,449
Well, all right, a little bit.

97
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,422
Bastards.

98
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,822
I'd best go get them horses watered.

99
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,223
Goddamn Chisum.

100
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,724
How'd he know we was here?

101
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,268
- Hell, that's Garrett.
- Goddamn him too.

102
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,270
Now he's got Bell and half the town
of Lincoln out there with him.

103
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,140
Help me up.

104
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,186
Sweet Mary's ass!

105
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,216
Don't let me go down.

106
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,094
They killed me. I'm gut-shot for sure.

107
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,590
Hold your fire!

108
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,236
Hold your fire!

109
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,866
Hold it!

110
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,903
Bill!

111
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,975
Come on out!
You don't have a chance!

112
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,441
What are you taking me in for?

113
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,705
Which one was that?

114
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,648
Buckshot Roberts.

115
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,787
For the killing of Buckshot Roberts!

116
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,321
Hell, that was a year ago.

117
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,127
I shot him straight up.

118
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,465
Come on in, Pat!

119
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,557
I'll warm your breakfast!

120
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,633
Guess he ate.

121
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,407
They're closing down
the store on us for sure.

122
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,519
Maybe it's time you took a walk.

123
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,962
Hell, yes.

124
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,230
Why not?

125
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,263
I can still hold a gun.

126
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,046
We gotta move. I'm going fast.

127
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,948
Kid.

128
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,051
Sweet Mary's ass!

129
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,794
I'm going now, so, by God,
let's get on with it.

130
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,593
Hey.

131
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,760
I ain’t afraid of him now.

132
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,133
Hold your fire! We're coming out!

133
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,506
Hold it!

134
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,171
- You go left. I'll go right.
- Might be they ain’t circled us.

135
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,875
Might be the dog would've caught
the rabbit if he hadn't thought to shit.

136
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,683
Where are the goddamn horses?

137
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,016
- That's enough!
- Hold it! Hold it!

138
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,019
All right, Kid!

139
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,214
Come on out if you're still alive!

140
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,355
Game's over!

141
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,387
Coming out, Pat!

142
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,971
You're in poor company, Pat.

143
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,008
Yeah, I'm alive, though.

144
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,349
So am I.

145
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,685
I never figured to hear you brag
on being a working man.

146
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,558
Well, I never figured you
for the law either.

147
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,257
It's just a way of staying alive.

148
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,629
No matter what side you're on,
you're always right.

149
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,067
And I aim to live to be rich,
old and gray.

150
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,373
That's a fine ambition, Pat.

151
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,713
You keep thinking like that.
I'll think on how I'll spend your money.

152
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,911
Only thing you've got
to think about...

153
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,719
...Is when you stand before
the highest court there is.

154
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,224
May it sit in judgment
on your rotten soul.

155
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,229
Now, you listen. Listen to me good.

156
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,026
Before that rope snaps,
it'll hit you like a bolt of lightning...

157
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,829
...that what I've been telling you
is the truth!

158
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,434
You'll learn to believe
before I'm finished.

159
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,105
That's 3 to you.

160
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,371
What do you believe in, Bell?

161
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,253
I do believe I'm gonna
have to see that bet...

162
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,850
...and raise you 5.
- Billy...

163
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,860
...somewhere in the Good Book,
it says there's a time for everything.

164
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,760
A time to love, a time to hate...

165
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,128
...a time to kill.

166
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,871
But now it's time
you got close to God, boy.

167
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,735
I heard God's fast...

168
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,505
...but I have to go up in front of him
myself before I'd bet on it.

169
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,311
You will.

170
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,511
Well, that puts me on my way.

171
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,453
I got to go collect a few more taxes.
He's all yours.

172
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,154
Two days, boys.

173
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,795
I count eight days till dawn, Billy.

174
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:15,366
You'd best be on your knees and making
the acquaintance of your Lord and master.

175
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,435
Pat, keep that mule's asshole away from me
before I have to break him.

176
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,873
I surely wish you'd try, son.

177
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,034
I got my shotgun full of 16 thin dimes.

178
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,246
Enough to spread you out
like a crazy woman's quilt.

179
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,849
- Bob.
- Why don't you sing a song of Jesus...

180
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,418
...while there's still a way.
- Bob. Bob.

181
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,884
Damn it.

182
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,593
You mess around with him one more time,
I'll send your ass back to Texas.

183
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,955
Don't.

184
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,193
I think I'd like to keep him here a while.

185
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,960
I fold, Billy.

186
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,070
Folding three queens, now, are you?

187
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,346
You must be afraid
I'll go out a loser, Bell.

188
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,216
- I guess I just ain’t seeing them.
- Well, I'll tell you what...

189
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,716
...as long as I'm breathing,
let's play it straight.

190
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,722
I ain’t sold my saddle like you
and the rest of the town boys, Bell.

191
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,722
Or it's just Bob that smells
like street shit over there.

192
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,703
On your knees!

193
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,601
Kiss my ass.

194
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,367
Bob!

195
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,143
Repent, you son of a bitch!

196
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,580
Sweet Jesus, I repent.

197
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,083
Leave off, Bob! You've gone loco!

198
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,859
I'm going across the street
and have a drink.

199
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,902
I'm thirsty as hell.

200
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,042
I wanna tell you one last thing
personal, Kid.

201
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,176
It's gonna be a loose rope
and a long drop.

202
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,023
That last thump got my guts going.

203
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,124
I need to go to the outhouse.

204
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,308
My horse locoed on me once
coming back from Pacheco.

205
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,238
I cut the second bar in his mouth
and bleed him.

206
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,385
He died on me,
and I ended up walking 40 miles.

207
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,786
I never was much for walking.

208
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,289
Well, I ain’t never walked a mile since.

209
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,855
Fell in with a bunch of Mescaleros.

210
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,172
They was just off the reservation,
and I was "suspicioned" of them.

211
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,408
But I had some biscuit on me.
I give it to them, and they just rode off.

212
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,179
That's a hell of a story, Bell.

213
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,952
You know, I believe old Pat's
lost his sand.

214
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,256
He won't come on a man.

215
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,027
You ought not to talk about him that way.
You and him used to be pretty close.

216
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,899
He ain’t the same man.

217
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,307
He signed himself over to Chisum
and every other landowner...

218
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,646
...that's trying to put a fence
around this country.

219
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,484
That's what you been doing, ain’t it?

220
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,250
Selling us out and getting fat.

221
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,791
Ain't that easy, Billy.

222
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,571
You was a friend of Carlyle's,
wasn't you, Bell?

223
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,873
You know I was.

224
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,546
I don't mean to be contrary,
but did I ever tell you how he died?

225
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,383
I shot him three times in the back,
blew his goddamn head off.

226
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,329
I don't wanna kill you, Bell.

227
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,299
Well, I sure hope you don't, Billy.

228
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,157
Then just move toward me.

229
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,537
Don't. Don't do it, please.

230
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,836
You wouldn't shoot me in the back, Billy.

231
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,351
- What the hell was that?
- There's been a shooting.

232
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,222
Get in the house!

233
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,972
- My God, he's got a shotgun.
- Somebody get the sheriff!

234
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,369
How does Jesus look to you now, Bob?

235
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,377
Bonney's killed Bell!

236
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,615
Yeah, and he's killed me too.

237
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,125
Keep the change, Bob.

238
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,041
Bring me an ax.

239
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,503
Get back, I don't wanna kill you.

240
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,490
Go over to that livery stable,
get me the best horse you've got.

241
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,507
Caught your horse, Billy.

242
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,243
Try him again.

243
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:10,360
By God, I think I'm just gonna trade you
that fine brown horse for your buckskin.

244
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,928
What the hell, Billy?

245
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:23,965
I'll thrown in about $1.60 worth of change
if you can dig it out of old Bob there.

246
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,896
Would some of you people
get him up off the ground and into it?

247
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,102
Anything you say, sheriff.

248
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,078
Hell of a mess, Pat.

249
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,113
Shot Bell and Ollinger and rode on out.

250
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,623
Yeah. Do me up good this time, Zeppy.

251
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,625
And leave the mustache on it.

252
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,998
- Is the boy around?
- Boy.

253
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,303
Speak to Mr. Garrett.

254
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,312
Yes, sir?

255
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,252
I want you to run all the way down
to my house.

256
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,821
Tell Mrs. Garrett that I'm gonna
be home for dinner.

257
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,982
And then I want you to stampede
over to the courthouse...

258
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,459
...find John Neully and the others
standing around there...

259
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,293
...and tell them to come over here
and pay me a visit. Got that?

260
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,635
John Neully, courthouse. Yes, sir.

261
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,188
Who are you?

262
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,584
That's a good question.

263
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,532
I believe you know of me.

264
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,129
Bill Kermit.

265
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:20,004
Wanted for horse-thieving
down in Seven Rivers, ain’t you?

266
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,408
That'd be me, sheriff.

267
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,611
Killed old C.B. Denning last year
at Silver City...

268
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,878
...for calling you at cheating at monte.

269
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,820
That'd be me. Alamosa Bill.

270
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,061
Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you
my deputy.

271
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,136
Listen, Bill, why don't you go out back...

272
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,110
...tingfind us a couple of steaks
and a mess of eggs.

273
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:58,777
And get one of them good bottles
they got behind the bar there.

274
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,209
I wanna have me a bath.

275
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,496
It should take you about two weeks
to make the circle.

276
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,294
Yeah.

277
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,203
- They say William Bonney's escaped.
- He has.

278
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,181
And he's in Mexico, I hope.

279
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,684
Where we should be If I had any sense.

280
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,215
If not...

281
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,661
...I'll go after him.
Got too much riding on it not to.

282
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,792
I figure that's why they elected me.

283
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,434
Anyways, I don't give a damn.

284
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,400
Brought him in once, I can do it again...

285
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,405
...lf I have to.

286
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,037
You might say that
you are glad to see me.

287
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,644
It's been over a week you've been gone.

288
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,286
I'm sorry.

289
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,888
I gotta go down to the saloon,
there's a...

290
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,362
...drunk down there causing a lot of trouble.
Goes by the name of Alamosa Bill.

291
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,200
Said he rode with the Kid
down in west Texas.

292
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,806
Will you be blessing this house
with your presence for dinner?

293
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,981
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

294
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,915
- It's been a long year.
- Not now.

295
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,455
My people don't talk to me.

296
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,818
They say you are getting to be too much
of a gringo since you've been sheriff.

297
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,827
That you make deals with Chisum.

298
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,130
You don't touch me.

299
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,232
You are dead inside.

300
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,263
- I wish you'd never put on that badge.
- Not now.

301
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,133
Or I won't be here when you get back!

302
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,052
We'll deal with this...

303
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,422
...when it's over.

304
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,761
I hope he gets away.

305
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,926
Well, he won't.

306
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,269
There's too much play in him.

307
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,034
And not enough in you.

308
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,307
You're late, Pat.

309
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,643
More cognac, please.

310
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,369
- Good of you to come, sheriff.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

311
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,099
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Thank you, sir.

312
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,709
May I offer you some supper?

313
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,841
Oh, no. No, I think I might have
a little of that brandy, though.

314
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,484
Of course. Some brandy.

315
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,349
I do hope you enjoy
these rainy New Mexican evenings.

316
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,357
They have a fabulous melancholy
to them.

317
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:14,059
They bring us closer
to some greater design.

318
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,367
At least I hope so.

319
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,971
Allow me to introduce
Mr. Lewellyn Howland.

320
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:32,081
And this man is Norris.

321
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,685
These gentlemen are very concerned
about the escape of William Bonney.

322
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,986
- A concern I'm sure you also share.
- He escaped from my jail.

323
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,253
Exactly.

324
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,728
This territory is vast and primitive.

325
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:02,206
There is money here, growing investments
and political interests.

326
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,314
We must protect these investments...

327
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,246
...so that the area can continue
to prosper and grow.

328
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,581
- I believe you rode with the Kid, didn’t you?
- I did.

329
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,748
- Then you must be aware of his moves.
- Well, I know Billy.

330
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,861
- And he ain’t exactly predictable.
- Oh, come now, sheriff.

331
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,828
For a man who's half outlaw himself
and still smart enough...

332
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:26,402
...to be elected sheriff by Chisum and
the big ranchers, I expect better than that.

333
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,137
Can you bring him in,
or should we look elsewhere?

334
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,534
Oh, I can bring him in.

335
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:36,078
If you and the big peckerheads don't mess
things up by startling another cattle war.

336
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:41,207
I assure you, Chisum and the others have
been advised to recognize their position.

337
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,889
And in this particular game,
there are only a few plays left.

338
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:51,218
I'd advise you to grab on to a winning hand
while you have a chance.

339
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,464
We're offering a reward of $1000
for the Kid's capture.

340
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,639
You can have 500 now.

341
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,235
Well, I aim to bring the Kid in.

342
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,078
But until I do...

343
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,685
...better take your $500
and shove it up your ass and set fire to it.

344
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,705
Commendable notion, sheriff.

345
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,131
Eno.

346
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,269
Well, now.

347
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,422
I'm gonna blow the top of your
cow-humping head off, you son of a bitch.

348
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,923
How's it going, Luke?

349
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,096
You are a son of a bitch.

350
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,596
I thought they's getting ready
to trim you.

351
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,667
There's a whole bunch of us
just fixing to ride in.

352
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,498
Well, I saved you all a trip.

353
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,034
Or somebody did.

354
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,579
I figured I'd lay back a few days.
Maybe more.

355
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,885
Well, it sure is pleasurable
seeing you back again, Kid.

356
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,568
- You glad I'm back?
- Welcome home, Billy.

357
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,002
And did you miss me?

358
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:28,508
So much you had to take up
with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.

359
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,895
<i>Cómo estás, Silva?</i>

360
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,194
<i>Buenos dias, Billy.</i>

361
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,631
Now, you're uglier than me.
How's it going, Beaver?

362
00:42:55,172 --> 00:43:00,371
Eno, I thought you boys would be out
In the Nueces or Colorado by now.

363
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:05,811
Well, I figured to watch you get stretched
but might have knowed you'd show up.

364
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,315
Good thing somebody did.

365
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,684
These four rode in here this morning.

366
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,907
What's your name, boy?

367
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,910
- Alias.
- Alias what?

368
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,281
Alias anything you please.

369
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,753
What do we call you?

370
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,085
Alias.

371
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,218
- Hell, let's call him Alias.
- That's what I'd do.

372
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,830
Alias it is.

373
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,138
Thank you.

374
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,047
My, my.

375
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,427
You boys hungry?

376
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,703
- I didn’t catch your name.
- I didn’t give it out.

377
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,377
Well, I guess that's why I didn’t catch it.

378
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,245
But I know yours.

379
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,508
And that's enough.

380
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,113
Hey, Silva. Do you remember that meeting
with John Jones...

381
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,055
...and that old man they called
U.S. Christmas, down near El Rito?

382
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,957
- That old man they called U.S. Christmas?
- Right. See?

383
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:07,570
Seems John stepped on one of U.S.'s
boots one night they was both in town.

384
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:12,636
Old U.S., he'd been out hunting buffalo
for six months.

385
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:18,214
Now, he was mean and testy
and damn near blind drunk.

386
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:23,985
He had on a pair of these flat-heeled,
about half-length Wellington boots.

387
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,856
Them boots was the only thing he owned
he put any store in.

388
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,185
And John stepped on one of them.

389
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,661
That old man just stepped back and said:

390
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,964
"Let's get to it."

391
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,944
So John said to U. S:

392
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,709
"If you're gonna get that riled...

393
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,547
...over a pair of foreign,
lady-looking boots...

394
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,915
...we just might as well
get the ball rolling."

395
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,120
So they went in the middle
of the street.

396
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,597
And they took the 10 steps.

397
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,493
And John put three holes
right through that old man's chest.

398
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,153
I must have known them
from somewhere.

399
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,890
It's too soon for bounty hunters.

400
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,268
Alias?

401
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,018
What the hell?

402
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,557
Garrett?

403
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,957
I thought you was in Lincoln.

404
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,195
- What the hell you doing?
- You get your ass over there, Gate.

405
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,307
Howdy, Cullen.

406
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,647
How do you do, yourself?

407
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,916
What are you doing
with that piece of sheep dip?

408
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:47,056
I'd like to blow his thieving head off
just for riding through my town.

409
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,599
I ain’t paid nobody no never mind.
Been staying in my own good hole.

410
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,938
Fact is, I'm thinking about
going to Texas.

411
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,012
Kid broke out.

412
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,680
Killed Ollinger and Bell.

413
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:11,381
I thought maybe Gate and some of the boys
might have a sign on him.

414
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:16,083
Well, I still want him for that train robbery
up at Springer.

415
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:22,924
Gate's been holed up outside of town here
with Black Harris and Sut Cole, that bunch.

416
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,933
Been meaning to roust them
out of here...

417
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,936
...but somehow or other
I just can't get around to it.

418
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,974
I don't know nothing about the boys,
I don't know nothing about the Kid.

419
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:38,915
Understand you've been riding for Chisum.

420
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,848
I'd rather be on the outside of the law...

421
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:49,254
...than packing a badge for that town of
Lincoln and them that's a-running it.

422
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,827
It's a job.

423
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,564
Comes an age in a man's life when...

424
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,672
...he don't wanna spend time
figuring what comes next.

425
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,037
Well, it's gonna cost you some change.

426
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,714
I got to the point where
I don't do nothing for nobody...

427
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,578
...unless there's a piece of gold
attached to it.

428
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,905
One of these days,
when I get my boat built...

429
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,601
...I'm gonna drift out of
this damn territory.

430
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,646
This town's got no hat size nohow.

431
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,923
Mama?

432
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,321
Where'd you put my badge?

433
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,014
I don't like it, Cullen.

434
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,813
This town is not worth it.

435
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:32,085
Tell you the truth, Mama,
I don't take a shine to it myself.

436
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,241
Anytime you're ready.

437
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,601
Company's coming.

438
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,263
Sheriff Baker.

439
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,576
Hey, Black Harris!

440
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,581
I wanna talk to you!

441
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,515
Whoa, boys.

442
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,115
Black.

443
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:13,556
I ain’t seen the Kid,
If that's what you're sniffling after.

444
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:19,735
But if it's straight-up one-to-one you want,
then I'm your man.

445
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,600
I'm looking for sign, Black.

446
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,707
Us old boys ought not to be doing this
to each other.

447
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,014
Ain’t that many of us left.

448
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:38,018
Remember?
You and me rode into this county together.

449
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,850
How long ago was that, Pat?

450
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,594
Oh, hell, about 15 years ago.

451
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:57,370
Pat, I know where the Kid’s at.

452
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,842
I'll tell you...

453
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,436
...when you're lying proper
on the ground.

454
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,991
It'll be the last words you ever hear.
