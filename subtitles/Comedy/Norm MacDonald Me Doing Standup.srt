1
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,711
<i>Don't listen to
the haters, norm.</i>

2
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,114
<i>You're a polar bear.
You got this.</i>

3
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,749
<i>I mean, look at those paws.</i>

4
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,452
<i>You're an animal...
Literally.</i>

5
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,421
<i>It's all-you-can-eat
seal buffet.</i>

6
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,856
<i>Go fill your plate.</i>

7
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,363
Read 'em and weep, boys.

8
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,200
Cari-boo-yah!
Full house.

9
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,337
I'd bet antlers he fails again.

10
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,272
Ah, he looks hungry.

11
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,374
I'm giving ten-to-one odds
he catches the poor Pinniped.

12
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,276
They say I can't hunt.

13
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,214
Huh?

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,761
Oy, phooey! How can I be
king if I can't hunt?

15
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,464
Ooh-ooh!

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,632
Uh-uh-uh!

17
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,716
This is gonna hurt.

18
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,917
Oh!

19
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,154
That wasn't so bad.

20
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,157
- Oy, that was bad.

21
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,760
They say he doesn't
have any focus.

22
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,863
Huh?
Hi, Elizabeth.

23
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,865
Hi.

24
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,801
Ugh!

25
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,804
Jeez, it's like
pure ice up here.

26
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,740
An accident waiting
to happen, you know?

27
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,642
I mean, somebody should really
do something about this, huh?

28
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,177
Ahem.
Lemmings.

29
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,289
Anyway, I really
should get goin' now.

30
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,791
I've got a seal to go
catch and eat and I...

31
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,495
Anyway, I uh...
See ya, gotta go.

32
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,198
Bye now. Catch ya
later, Elizabeth.

33
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,442
Babe, look!
A hunt!

34
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,411
This trip is finally payin' off.

35
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,886
Any last words before I eat you?

36
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,794
Oh, come on.
Don't say that.

37
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,630
You always know exactly
what to say to get to me.

38
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,665
Eat him. Eat him!

39
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,400
- Yeah! Eat him.
- Eat him!

40
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,870
You wanna know why I'm
not gonna eat you?

41
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,940
You got a minute?
Well, maybe an hour.

42
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,711
It all started when I turned 13.

43
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,380
<i>In health class they told us
how our growl would change,</i>

44
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,649
<i>how we'd start getting
more fur on our bodies.</i>

45
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,019
<i>But they didn't say anything
about speaking to humans.</i>

46
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,890
I want one! I want one!
I want one! I want one!

47
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,328
Aren't they supposed to stay
50 yards away?

48
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,266
If this little brat takes one
more step, I'm gonna pounce.

49
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,569
Keep it up, kid.

50
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,838
The only thing you're
gonna get is a mauling.

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,874
Can't ya see we're
wild animals here?

52
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,677
Did you just talk to me?

53
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,879
Wait.
You can speak bear?

54
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,750
No, dummy, you're
speaking human.

55
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,756
I didn't know what to do.

56
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:54,026
No other bear seemed to
be able to speak human.

57
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,996
And certainly no other bear had
these weird feelings that I had.

58
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,033
So I went to go see the
wisest bear in the world.

59
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,968
The king of the arctic,

60
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,370
who conveniently
was also my grandpa.

61
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,577
- I don't know what to do.
- I didn't ask for this.

62
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,513
What is wrong with me?

63
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,549
Nothing is wrong with you, norm.
You're special.

64
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,018
Yeah, a real one of a kind.

65
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,888
Actually, more like
two of a kind.

66
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,723
I share the same trait.

67
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,626
I, too, can speak
to our human visitors.

68
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,861
You can talk to them, too?

69
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,697
I can.

70
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,466
Polar bears are icons
of the arctic, norm.

71
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:38,637
And an icon with a voice
can be very powerful indeed.

72
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,739
Our land is vulnerable

73
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,809
and we're responsible.

74
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:48,113
For now, just know
that what you and I have

75
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,948
is a great gift.

76
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,086
One day you'll truly understand.

77
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,488
But when will I understand?

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,956
<i>But if didn't end there.</i>

79
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,059
<i>Human tendencies
had taken over my body.</i>

80
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,964
<i>That's when I started doing
the arctic shake.</i>

81
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,005
<i>I put the "soul"
in winter solstice.</i>

82
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,718
These days, I'm pretty glad
I have these feelings,

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,587
but I just don't know
what to do with them.

84
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,021
And that brings me
to the other day.

85
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,868
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

86
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,970
I knew he wouldn't
kill the seal.

87
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,739
- Pay up.
- Fine, here.

88
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,409
You're lucky these
things grow back.

89
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,190
I'm a bear who can't hunt.
I'm soft and frozen yogurt.

90
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,626
Who needs a bear
with too much care

91
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,027
and not enough scare?

92
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,830
Norm! What is that, a haiku?

93
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,499
What did dad tell you
about writing poetry?

94
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,836
I know, I know. "Leave the
poetry to the panda bears."

95
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,571
What's up, Sam?

96
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,540
I only caught
the tail end of it...

97
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,142
But I made some money off your
failed hunt today, big bro.

98
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,113
I wish I'd caught
the tail end of my hunt.

99
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,681
Let me give you
some advice, bro.

100
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,783
Act with your stomach
and not your heart.

101
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,452
- - Huh?

102
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, my 5:00 is here.
Excuse me, Normie.

103
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,628
I don't know why you spend
so much time and energy

104
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,465
on these tourists.
They're ruining it up here.

105
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,900
<i>Au contraire, Mon frère.</i>

106
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,837
As dad always said, "if humans
come to our land and clap,

107
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,939
they can't come
to our land and crap."

108
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,907
"Give them a scene..."

109
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,943
"The arctic
stays clean."

110
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,612
Thanks, Stan, I got it.
But grandpa always said...

111
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,915
Enough about grandpa, norm.
He left us, remember?

112
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,017
He's not here.
We are.

113
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,221
The humans won't destroy
something they love.

114
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,856
And they love...

115
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,792
Us.

116
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,128
Let's give these people what they
came a thousand miles to see.

117
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,563
A show!

118
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,132
And go!

119
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,785
Whoa!

120
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,792
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

121
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,028
Whales, I need whales.

122
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,276
How many times do I have to tell you?
This ain't Orlando.

123
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,777
Act real.

124
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,320
Oh, not that real.

125
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,322
Oh, that's the fourth
time this month.

126
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,758
Norm, I need you for the finale.

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,127
I'm desperate. A whale
just ate my actor.

128
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,029
This is my nightmare.

129
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,698
Oh, please.

130
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,601
No, the arctic shake was
for your bachelor party.

131
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,803
I'd never do that
for the human tourists.

132
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,672
Never, never, never.

133
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:07,105
He doesn't belong in the arctic,
he belongs on Broadway.

134
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,374
<i>Right?</i>

135
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,281
<i>Can you do the Charleston?</i>

136
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,898
Socrates!
Oh, wisest of the winged.

137
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,967
Brainiest of the beaked.

138
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,738
Norm, grab a seat.

139
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,906
Be with you in a minute.
Just finishing up.

140
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,710
And the next thing
you know, I'm twerking

141
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,812
in front of a boatload
of human tourists.

142
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,749
Twerking! Have some
self-respect, norm.

143
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,150
I just don't know why
everyone wants to be

144
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,052
so nice to these intruders.

145
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,687
They've never done
anything for us

146
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,256
except to come to
our land uninvited.

147
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,892
Ah, your grandfather
had a saying...

148
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,696
<i>"Panem et circenses."</i>
"Bread and circuses."

149
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,798
He meant it's easier
to distract ourselves

150
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,233
with food and entertainment,

151
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,835
than think about
the real problems.

152
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,771
What happened
to grandpa, Socrates?

153
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,439
Did he really just disappear?

154
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,907
The theories are plentiful.

155
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,209
Some believe he is on
a vision quest.

156
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,845
Some people think he simply
went to search for fish.

157
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,281
While others think he went
to follow the band...

158
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,216
Phish.

159
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,020
Me, I think your grandpa knew
something was happening,

160
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,455
and tried to fight it.

161
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,258
And it looks like that
something<i> is</i> happening.

162
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,842
Holy icicle.
Is that a human house?

163
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,178
It's a model home.

164
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,181
A sales tool.

165
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,851
Just arrived, literally,
fresh on the boat.

166
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,353
It means more of these
houses are gonna be coming.

167
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,757
Humans are moving here?
To live?

168
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,759
It starts with the tourists,

169
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,261
then someone says,
"I could do this year round."

170
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,831
It happened to my buddy,
Freddy the flamingo.

171
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,499
He was in Florida, minding
his own business.

172
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,434
A couple of tourists show up.

173
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,738
Next thing you know, there are
plastic statues of Freddy

174
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,872
on everyone's lawn!

175
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,517
We gotta talk to the king.

176
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,455
<i>Norm, that house
has nothing to do</i>

177
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,891
with why grandpa vanished.

178
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,796
Dad, you're not listening,
there's more.

179
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,799
There's a human house
right here on grandpa's land.

180
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,768
<i>Humans are moving here now.</i>

181
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,007
Ah, norm, you always did have

182
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,942
such an imagination,
now, didn't you?

183
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,045
- First with the poetry...
- I swear it's true.

184
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,349
Socrates and I snuck in.
And look...

185
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,317
From Florida.

186
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,164
Norm, you are not to go
anywhere near there.

187
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,965
Do you hear me?

188
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,068
Grandpa's land is off limits.
Understood?

189
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,137
"Snuck in."

190
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,973
Norm, you shouldn't
go onto property

191
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,476
that doesn't belong to you.
You should know better.

192
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,945
Besides, I'm sure the
house you're referring to

193
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,881
is simply a research hut.

194
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,550
<i>Look, son, you wanna be king?</i>

195
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,886
A future king isn't supposed
to get so emotional.

196
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,155
We hunt, we lead, and we sleep.
Simple!

197
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,257
Now there is plenty
of ice to go around.

198
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,860
Just stay away from<i> there!</i>
Far away.

199
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,830
And for the love of salmon,
no more talking human!

200
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,099
- You got me?
- Yes, dad.

201
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,419
Did you see that? He wants
to give away the arctic.

202
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,987
That's it.
We're done.

203
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,590
Norm, it all points
to the same thing.

204
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,625
Humans are invading our land.

205
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,328
And you are a polar bear
who can speak to humans.

206
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,197
You're the only one who can
do something about this.

207
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,900
Socrates, I can't even hunt.

208
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,105
Norm, your grandpa once told me,

209
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,374
"norm's the only bear
that has the potential

210
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,911
to be king of the arctic.

211
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,947
<i>He feels the arctic's pain.</i>

212
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,016
And if he feels it enough,

213
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,585
he'll stand
for us."

214
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,891
I can't even stand for myself.

215
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,926
<i>Norm, don't listen to them.</i>

216
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,295
They're just furry robots
sitting in their ice cubicles

217
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,030
obeying the rules,

218
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,900
pretending nothing bad's
ever gonna happen.

219
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,469
But<i> you</i> can change the rules.

220
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,906
You're seeing the future. They're
just living in the past.

221
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,241
You can find a new way.

222
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,243
Don't just dance for the humans.

223
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,345
Fight for our home instead.

224
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,985
Okay.
I won't let you down.

225
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,629
- Socrates!
- - Cranberries!

226
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,332
Surprise is the
number-one cause of death

227
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,100
in the elderly, you know.

228
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,037
We have to do something.

229
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,105
I have to do something.

230
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,441
Ah, number one or number two?

231
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,277
- We gotta take some...
- Man:<i> Action!</i>

232
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,253
<i>What the heck is that?</i> - Caw.

233
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,522
That is proof of why you
should stay in school.

234
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,425
First you're cutting class, next
you're dressing up in a bear suit

235
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,393
<i>doing twirls
for a real estate commercial.</i>

236
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,662
The seals would kill<i> him.</i> Cut!

237
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,231
Who said that?

238
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,666
I'm the only one
who yells, "cut!"

239
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,735
I'm the director.

240
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,173
I'm not just going to be
a furry robot

241
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,041
sitting in an ice cubicle.

242
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,010
We have to point that
director in a new direction.

243
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,086
Oh, great. A suit
coming to give me

244
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,588
creative notes
on my masterpiece!

245
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,642
Hmm.

246
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,183
But I'll need soldiers
on the ground.

247
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,121
- Invisible soldiers.

248
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,158
Those little guys?
They'll get crushed.

249
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,293
Trust me,
they're indestructible.

250
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,164
Ayah, ayah, ah-ah-ah!

251
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,233
What's he doing?
- He wants you to stomp on him.

252
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,768
He wants to prove
how tough he is.

253
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,139
Could he sign a release first?

254
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,573
I'm gonna get, like,
lemming juice everywhere.

255
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,109
- Do it.

256
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,078
- Ow.
- I killed him.

257
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,647
If I go down, Socrates, I'm
taking you down with me!

258
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,716
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

259
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,654
- Ta-da!
- You're invincible.

260
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,289
You guys got Springs for bones.

261
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,093
Hmm.

262
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,731
Can you see this, honey?
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

263
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,567
It's beautiful, mom,
but what will it look like

264
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,736
when you and Mr. Greene
build all those houses there?

265
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,073
You're changing the arctic.
Change isn't always good.

266
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,142
Olympia, if this campaign
works, and the houses sell,

267
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,478
<i>that means great things for us.</i>

268
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>But it really is
amazing up here.</i>

269
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,515
<i>Oh...!</i>

270
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,285
Olympia, I'll
call you right back.

271
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,253
Hi. Vera brightly,

272
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,155
head of marketing
for Mr. Greene.

273
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,724
The commercial is a masterpiece!
I deserve an Oscar!

274
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,128
Wow, you can't win an
Oscar for a commercial,

275
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,230
but as long as
it can sell condos,

276
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,632
we've done our job.

277
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,835
Ah. Can you
smell that?

278
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,837
The air is so fresh here.

279
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,573
It's completely unpolluted.

280
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,442
Caw! Whoa, whoa!

281
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,679
Holy Hitchcock!
That bird just pooped on me.

282
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,215
I think that's good luck,
isn't it?

283
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,197
Wagh-hh!

284
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,199
Who forgot to secure the lights?

285
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,702
I swear I secured them.

286
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:58,769
Wah-hh!

287
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,805
Caw!

288
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,473
Is that bird aiming for us?

289
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,477
Oh, poop.

290
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,361
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

291
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,595
Vera, we're fine.

292
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,697
I still have
the background lights.

293
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,443
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

294
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,228
Don't tell me those were
the background lights.

295
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,729
Don't worry, Vera.

296
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,598
I've already shot
most of the commercial,

297
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,466
and it's on this reel.

298
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,543
We'll fix the rest in post.

299
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,978
Anything can be fixed in post.

300
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,747
In one of my movies,
I wrote the plot in post.

301
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,916
Uh excuse me, Nigel.

302
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:23,254
Vera, a director always
delivers and never quits.

303
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,256
There goes the footage.

304
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,225
Agh!
I quit! I quit!

305
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,560
You can't quit. We have
a one-day film permit,

306
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,662
and the house goes back
to New York tonight.

307
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,798
Au revoir, as they say in France

308
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,267
and some parts of Canada!

309
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,850
Ah...

310
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,519
Good job today, lemmings, but
let's not get too comfortable.

311
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,557
Yup, there's one more down there.
Oh, sorry about that.

312
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,292
You guys gotta
speak up, seriously.

313
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,694
If you're gonna go to the
bottom, tell somebody.

314
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,632
Let's not completely relax

315
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,700
<i>until "pretty in pink"
heads back to America.</i>

316
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,303
Okay, Vera, you're
a problem solver.

317
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,671
When you're faced
with a problem,

318
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,839
what do you usually do?

319
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,907
You solve it!

320
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,945
If only I had some seals
and ice, and...

321
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,748
- Are there penguins up here?

322
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,691
Sea lion! Hi!
Please come back.

323
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,860
<i>I need your help
with this shot. Please?</i>

324
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,396
It's a seal, you generalist.

325
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,431
Humans think all animals
look the same.

326
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,371
Ouch!
Cracked driveway.

327
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,973
Not a good selling point.

328
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,342
Hey, the arctic comes as is.

329
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,977
Who said that?

330
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,448
Mommy.

331
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,417
Sorry, honey. Mommy
couldn't call you back.

332
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,419
I was busy putting out a fire.

333
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,020
The arctic is on fire?!

334
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,790
Wait, so you're melting it now?

335
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,526
No, no, not real fires.
Everything is fine, sweetie.

336
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,094
I'm totally fine.

337
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,533
Whoa! Oh, no!

338
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,967
Move it, lady!

339
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,870
Oh, no.
A polar bear!

340
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,774
Really? Oh, they're amazing.
<i>Ursus maritimus.</i>

341
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,576
I think he's charging me.
Is that bad?

342
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,011
Look it up on the Internet.

343
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,047
It says, "when confronted
with a polar bear,

344
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,683
assert dominance
and stand your ground."

345
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,122
I don't think it's working.

346
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,027
Let me call you back, honey.

347
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,696
Mommy has an idea.
Love you.

348
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,698
<i>Tired of suburbia?</i>

349
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,701
Come to the arctic, where every
day is a safari in the snow.

350
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,541
<i>All you need to do is step outside
your front door, literally.</i>

351
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,805
Waterfront property
now available.

352
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:28,939
Hmm.

353
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,610
You're welcome.

354
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,626
Mr. Greene, we've had
some problems up here.

355
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,162
Oh, Vera, my dear-a,
there are no problems,

356
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,464
only messages from the universe.

357
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,166
Om...

358
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,735
Say it with me, Vera.
Om...

359
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,936
Om...

360
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,538
Mr. Greene,
the director quit!

361
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,206
What!

362
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,211
I knew you shouldn't have hired
that overpaid, pretentious...

363
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,780
Okay, how are you
gonna fix this?

364
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,216
How are you gonna fix
your fault? Hmm?

365
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,018
Well, I've been filming all day,

366
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,953
and I got some really great
footage of a polar bear

367
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,521
that almost attacked me.

368
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,491
You've been filming?
That is so cute.

369
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,960
I'm sure you think you're
a regular Scorsese.

370
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,062
All right, I need something
people might actually

371
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,232
wanna watch.

372
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:31,535
Wait a tick.
I love it.

373
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,637
<i>I love it. I love it!</i>

374
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,940
<i>This bear is a star.</i>

375
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,042
"Safari
in the snow."

376
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,110
Genius of me.

377
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,814
This will definitely get me
approval from the polar council.

378
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,549
I can't believe it.

379
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,084
Oh, I'm gonna be so rich.

380
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,120
Condos, shopping malls,
Volvo dealerships.

381
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,957
Oh, god, you name it.
It's going to be Dubai on ice.

382
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,026
- <i>( Bell rings )</i>

383
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,662
Bring the commercial and the
model back home to New York

384
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,631
and I'll see you
tomorrow, mañana.

385
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,500
That means "morning," I think.

386
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,836
<i>Remember, we have one week
to get this approved.</i>

387
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,005
Actually, Mr. Greene,
while I have you,

388
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,607
any word back
from your Alma mater,

389
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,542
the Magister Mundi academy?

390
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,943
It's Olympia's dream
to go there,

391
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,678
but as you know,
it's impossible to get in

392
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
without an alumni
recommendation.

393
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,016
Yeah, but she ain't gettin' in

394
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,584
until the condos get in.

395
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,087
I won't let you down, I promise.

396
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,788
<i>Vera, scrap the campaign.</i>

397
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,724
We need a real
symbol of the arctic

398
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,692
who can talk to these people

399
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,228
and convince these
morons to buy my homes.

400
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,031
<i>Find an actor who looks
just like that bear.</i>

401
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,868
Let's use the arctic
to sell the arctic.

402
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,304
- Boo-yah!

403
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,975
An actor that looks
just like that bear?

404
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,144
Oh, brother.

405
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,018
You heard them, norm.

406
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,320
They want an actor
who can use the arctic

407
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,855
to sell the arctic.

408
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,590
If that actor is you,

409
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,860
we can use the arctic
to<i> save</i> the arctic.

410
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,162
You need to go to New York,

411
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:09,133
and stop these houses
from ever getting here.

412
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,335
I hear they have good pizza
in New York.

413
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,669
- Come on.

414
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:54,004
Wow, what can a bear like me
do in a city like this?

415
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,182
Lemmings, I have a feeling
this journey

416
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,217
might not be as smooth
as we hoped.

417
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,220
Just got to remember
to stay... oh...!

418
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,388
Grounded.

419
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,068
Whoa!

420
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,131
This place is so amazing, mom.

421
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,767
Did you know that their Latin
department is so good,

422
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,336
they single-handedly
resuscitated the language?

423
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,339
- It's no longer dead. Well,
it's a school for only

424
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,510
the gifted and talented geniuses, like you.
It really is perfect.

425
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,847
But try not to fall
in love just yet, okay?

426
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,281
This is only a tour.

427
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,083
We still need
Mr. Greene's help and...

428
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,018
Mom, you're putting too
much pressure on yourself.

429
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,854
We don't need Greene's help.

430
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,021
I can get in on my own.

431
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,923
I know it.

432
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,027
Just have fun in
there, sweetheart.

433
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,528
It's the most amazing thing.

434
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,129
I gotta tell
all my seal buddies.

435
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,998
You press the lever,
the water goes up.

436
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:05,435
Ooh! Whoo!

437
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,070
Huh?

438
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,373
Um, oh, hey, guys.
Come on in.

439
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,843
Um, help yourself to some
fur balls in the fridge.

440
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,115
Another talking bear?

441
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,850
We gotta tell
Mr. Greene.

442
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,886
Wait. What do you mean,
"another talking bear"?

443
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,221
Oh!

444
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,356
Bring the tranquilizer guns.
Over.

445
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,894
Yah!

446
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,107
Whoa!

447
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,921
Greene house company,
where art thou?

448
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,625
The king of the arctic
has come to greet you.

449
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,194
Well, it's not MacBeth,
but it's a job.

450
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,866
Okay, bad costume, but he
knows the way to Greene.

451
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,068
There he is!

452
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,170
Come on, lemmings.

453
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,247
Hey! Hah-ha-hah!

454
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,517
Yes, I am the king
of the arctic,

455
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,653
and the king is hungry!

456
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,088
Sustenance!

457
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,924
Hark! Seal,
hark, I say!

458
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,093
Hey, you!

459
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,128
- Huh?
- Huh?

460
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,230
Mmm.

461
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,300
Hey!

462
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,473
- There he is!
- I think we can take him.

463
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,149
A real polar bear
always does his own stunts.

464
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:02,986
Come here and feel
my arctic wrath.

465
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,255
Jenga!

466
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,458
Jeez, they don't call this place
a "concrete jungle" for nothing.

467
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:17,968
Whoa, yes!

468
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,970
Ya!

469
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,471
Hi-ya!

470
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,711
Yee-ee... ah!

471
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,115
It was just a misunderstanding.

472
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,685
We thought you was
a<i> real</i> talking bear.

473
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,988
Thank you. That's a
fantastic compliment.

474
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:54,304
Mad rats! Mad rats!

475
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,041
Yes! Run, cowards!

476
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:02,245
Get back here, lemmings!

477
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,214
So you're here for the
Greene homes audition?

478
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,749
"King of the arctic," I take it.

479
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,485
Yeah. Use the arctic
to sell the arctic.

480
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,753
It makes sense.

481
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,356
Well, you certainly look
the part of a bear.

482
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,725
That costume is exquisite.

483
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:17,127
Just a little something
I threw together.

484
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,098
Yes. I thought I had
this role locked up,

485
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,333
but now my bear suit is ruined.

486
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,669
Oh, I'll never get this one.

487
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,404
Look, when you were
attacking those men,

488
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,040
you really had me convinced
you were a bear.

489
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:33,043
Yes, I<i> am</i> a phenomenal actor,

490
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,045
but I can't compete with you.

491
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,413
Such authenticity.

492
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:40,150
You even smell
like a polar bear.

493
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:45,122
Me, I smell like macaroni
and sweet vermouth.

494
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:48,525
Now go and get that part!

495
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,467
Mr. Greene,
let me be frank.

496
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:00,670
Condos in the arctic
is a ludicrous idea.

497
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:05,208
Now, condos in the Bahamas,
that people can understand.

498
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,211
Until we can see public support,
we will not approve this.

499
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,780
Polar council, please.

500
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,314
I do this all over the world.

501
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,583
I know where people want
to live before they do.

502
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,086
Our homes are very deluxe,

503
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:19,089
and you would love
them, councilwoman.

504
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,491
People aren't interested
in living in the arctic.

505
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,461
Know how I know?
Because that graph shows

506
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:28,298
you're currently at a
3% approval rating.

507
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,468
<i>Until that number
gets above 85%,</i>

508
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,836
not approved.

509
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,711
Hi, everyone.

510
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,747
Sign in and wait
over there, Travolta.

511
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,755
Hey, guys. Toilet's right there.
Help yourselves.

512
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,793
Ugh!

513
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,636
Whatever.

514
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:19,449
Oh, yeah. Looks like we're
real close to approval, Vera.

515
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,818
Great work. We need
to get to 85%,

516
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,887
and we're at what,
2.8?

517
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,622
Vera, where is my bear?

518
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,624
Mr. Greene, I've got
bear actors from Broadway

519
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,526
and the big screen
coming right now.

520
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,695
Well, I hope so.
Because if you fail,

521
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,463
<i>you can kiss
your daughter's chances</i>

522
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,898
<i>of getting into
my Alma mater goodbye.</i>

523
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,534
Know what else you can kiss goodbye?
Yo' job!

524
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,436
'Cause I promise you,
it will vanish,

525
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,671
just like those condos we built
in the Bermuda triangle.

526
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,841
<i>Mr. Greene, I have the
investors on Skype for you.</i>

527
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:48,178
Oh, great. The arctic
condo investors.

528
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,580
And no approval
for arctic condos!

529
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,488
Thank you all for coming.
Okay, we're looking for real.

530
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,827
- Let me have it!

531
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,463
Okay, I'm not quite getting
"king of the arctic."

532
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,899
It's more like
"queen of the prom."

533
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:12,435
Bear, bear, bear, bear.

534
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,539
I need real. I need
something to save my...

535
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,787
You, come with me.

536
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,455
Only if I can bring my lemmings.

537
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,191
We're with the same agency.

538
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:37,360
Cute. And very marketable.
Bring 'em.

539
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:49,673
Mr. Greene, meet
norm of the north.

540
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,647
Hmm.

541
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,216
Yeah, he's pretty.

542
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,351
And I feel scared.
Ooh, ah.

543
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,486
But can Norma play
"king of the arctic"?

544
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,556
It's norm.

545
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,259
Help! Help!
I'm being mugged!

546
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,627
Just take the watch,
take my wallet.

547
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,562
Just don't touch my ponytail.

548
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,524
That's where... that's where
I keep all my powers.

549
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,802
Vera, Vera, throw me my mace!
And my wet wipes!

550
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,940
Sorry, Mr. Greene. I was just...
Keepin' it real.

551
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:27,510
You know, trying to use the arctic
to sell the arctic, you know.

552
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:30,247
Norm is just a consummate actor.
He certainly looks the part.

553
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,749
And he even brought
arctic lemmings.

554
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,857
Janet! The rats are back!
Call pest control,

555
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,959
because the fire department
doesn't show up on time!

556
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,731
Huh?

557
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:52,535
Om... gonna die.

558
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,704
Mr. Greene, you said
authentic sells,

559
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,840
and no one does authentic
better than norm of the north.

560
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,508
Well, he's too authentic.

561
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,810
I mean, we need a
bear that is happy,

562
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,612
that makes people
feel warm and safe.

563
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,748
You know, fake!

564
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,951
You're fired, norm. Get
out of my office. Om...

565
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,887
You want happy bear?
You got happy bear.

566
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,333
This is great.

567
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,535
Add three more dancers
and we got a boy band.

568
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,414
Norm, I take it back.
You're hired.

569
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,016
Vera, take our newest
star out to lunch.

570
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,752
Come on, norm. We'll go to
Kozawa Sushi just upstairs.

571
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,621
It's the freshest fish in town.

572
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,623
Kozawa's pricey.

573
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,959
Uh, okay... Vera, can you
come here for a second?

574
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,829
Just no lobster, Kobe,
or tipping, okay?

575
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,664
By the way, norm, if
you like mixed drinks,

576
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,735
you must try the flat
and sparkling water.

577
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,672
Wow, that actor
actually smells like a bear.

578
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,674
I haven't smelled anything
that foul since...

579
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,811
Wait a minute.

580
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,567
Has he spoken again?

581
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,705
Uh, nope.

582
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,441
Something felt a little
too real with that bear.

583
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,678
The only thing that looks like
a bear, sounds like a bear,

584
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,615
and smells as bad
as a bear is a bear.

585
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,518
I knew it!

586
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,487
You think you're real
slick, don't you, old bear?

587
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,522
You thought you could send
one of your bear operatives

588
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,656
to take me out?

589
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,662
Well, I got news
for you, gramps.

590
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,631
- No way I'm goin'
down that easy.

591
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,867
Norm of the north is finished.

592
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,736
I've got a bear assassin
to get rid of.

593
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,638
Norm?

594
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:29,058
He's an actor.
Never takes off his costume.

595
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,027
Huh?

596
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,638
Are you okay?

597
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,972
I'm fine.

598
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:46,543
I usually sit on the
ground at home anyway.

599
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:50,747
Um... for an entrée,
you want to do chef's choice.

600
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,016
He can always read
what his guests want.

601
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,451
Sure.

602
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,919
This should be interesting.

603
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,687
Sorry we couldn't
bring the lemmings.

604
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,756
A little health code thing.

605
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,492
Do you think they're okay down
in the office by themselves?

606
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,862
Uh, I needed this.
You have no idea.

607
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,730
This day has been
something else.

608
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,732
Both the bridge and the tunnel
were closed this morning

609
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,836
so traffic, was a nightmare,
and Tony was yellin' at me

610
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,170
like it was my fault
or something.

611
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,906
He's just mad
because he's short.

612
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,775
No offense.

613
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,544
So... Greene homes
up in the arctic?

614
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:22,879
Crazy, huh?

615
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,814
I'll take you to see
an exact mock-up of one.

616
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,916
It's actually a few floors
down from our offices.

617
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:30,520
You'll see, they practically
sell themselves.

618
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,689
If that's even a good thing.

619
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,757
What's...
What's that?

620
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,893
Nothing, nothing. Just, after
having been up in the arctic myself

621
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,028
and seeing how beautiful it is,

622
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,631
I wonder if it's even good
to have houses up there.

623
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,234
That sounds silly, doesn't it?

624
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,602
Not at all.

625
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:46,970
I know exactly what you mean.

626
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,875
Oh, I gotta take this.
It's my daughter.

627
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,177
Hi, Olympia.
How did the tour go?

628
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,779
Are you loving the new school?

629
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,782
Well, it was just a tour,
but I'm happy you love it.

630
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,818
I'll talk to Mr. Greene
again and...

631
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
No. Okay, honey.
I have to go.

632
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:06,823
See you tonight.
Love you.

633
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,692
- A lot goin' on?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

634
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,794
Olympia is, well, brilliant,

635
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,064
- but it's... it's complicated.
- Good schools are important.

636
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:18,868
Yes. Really, really,
really important.

637
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,138
Mmm.

638
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,175
Oh, thanks, chef Kozawa.
That certainly looks<i> fresh.</i>

639
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,752
- - Do you want to play rough?

640
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,854
- Okay.

641
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:41,591
Don't worry patrons,
it's just a tranquilizer gun.

642
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,693
It's only sometimes
lethal on humans.

643
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:49,232
I don't know who sent you,
but the party's over, pal.

644
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,734
Mr. Greene,
what are you doing?

645
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,237
You smell like
a wild animal, norm.

646
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,974
Mr. Greene, just because I haven't
bathed, you're gonna shoot me?

647
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:01,678
Jeez, I heard new yorkers could be
hostile, but this is a little much.

648
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,980
I'm warning you!

649
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:24,033
Ah, is there a sharp pain

650
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,902
in everyone's bottom?

651
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,705
<i>Or is it just me?</i>

652
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,940
I'm feeling it.

653
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,314
Norm-San, you are
my guest anytime.

654
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,850
<i>- Arigato.</i>
- <i>Do Itashi,</i> bro.

655
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:45,722
Norm of the north, everyone.

656
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:54,030
<i>- Where am I?
- What happened?</i>

657
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,700
Somebody shoot that bear!

658
00:43:57,702 --> 00:43:59,002
Mr. Greene,
please relax.

659
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,371
I think you might
want to see this.

660
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:05,208
<i>And in other news...</i>
- The local news caught your outburst

661
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,678
at Kozawa's today
and norm's heroism.

662
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,146
Everyone's talking about norm,

663
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,816
and look at
our approval ratings.

664
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:18,655
Hah! Oh, my goodness. We are
rising faster than the oceans.

665
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,860
- Norm, uh, buddy. I...

666
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:26,396
I thought he was a real bear.

667
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:28,331
I mean, I was confused
because he smells

668
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,899
just like that other polar...

669
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,168
Huh?

670
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,404
Vortex.
That storm brought

671
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:37,173
all the smells of winter
right to our doorsteps.

672
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,109
"Real bear," huh?

673
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,245
You know what? Just
forget the whole thing.

674
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:45,014
Some guy from a cola company
approached me at Kozawa's.

675
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,883
Said they needed a bear
for a holiday thing.

676
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,686
Because of me, your
ratings just jumped 20%.

677
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,455
Imagine what I could do
for a real company.

678
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:54,424
Norm, wait.

679
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:58,161
If you let him walk out that
door, we are back to square one.

680
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:02,432
Norm, norm, norm. Um, I am
so sorry I shot at you.

681
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,467
Hug?

682
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:07,103
- Awkward.

683
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:10,840
Well, Normie has to look for a
new job and a place to live.

684
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,242
Not all of us can afford
a fancy Greene condo,

685
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:16,212
which I hear is fully
furnished and uninhabited,

686
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,849
and I will probably
sleep in the park<i> alone.</i>

687
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,919
Norm, wait.

688
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:28,024
Vera, he can stay
in the model home.

689
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:31,094
Ah! I<i> am</i> brilliant!

690
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,311
Hmm.
Perfect.

691
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,980
So close to work,
no commute and so homey.

692
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,049
- Right, lemmings?

693
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:54,884
Hey hey-hey-hey,
careful.

694
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,686
Those are the finest
leather hides from Italy.

695
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:02,058
- Are they house trained?
- Oh, definitely.

696
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,860
They've peed in tons of houses.

697
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:13,369
Well, I guess we'll settle in.

698
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,538
Okay, we'll work on getting
you out on the campaign trail

699
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,473
for Greene homes.

700
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:21,043
Get some rest, and there's a
minibar with some food in it.

701
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,412
I'll give you a 3% discount.

702
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,281
Vera, you work on settin'
up the marketing.

703
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,283
I'll take care of the rest.

704
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,856
Okay, boys, we gotta
find grandpa,

705
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,159
stop these condos from gettin'
built and get home.

706
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:38,127
And on top of all that,
Mr. Greene is watching us,

707
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,329
so act natural.

708
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,533
Not that natural.

709
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:45,034
- Okay...

710
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:48,805
- okay, look...

711
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:54,377
Okay, look, we need someone
to provide cover

712
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:57,513
while I go investigate that shelf
that smelled like grandpa.

713
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:59,448
I think I know just the guy.

714
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,220
Look, all you have to do

715
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,055
is go up there
and pretend to be me.

716
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,090
The lemmings will let you in.

717
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:11,227
There's plenty of salmon in the
minibar, so help yourself.

718
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:13,996
Brilliant.
Thank you, kind bear.

719
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,199
We'll leave
the lights on for you.

720
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,603
Okay, it's just
like an iceberg...

721
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:25,241
An iceberg with hundreds of
witnesses to watch me climb.

722
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,000
- Hmm.

723
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:54,503
I just got it.
That's our norm, huh?

724
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,906
I'll start booking talk shows
first thing in the morning.

725
00:47:56,908 --> 00:48:00,443
Eh...?

726
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,043
I have councilwoman Klubeck
ready for the call.

727
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,345
Janet, you're the best
at being the worst.

728
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,914
Knock next time.

729
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,982
Whatever.

730
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:48,190
You just woke me up,
so this better be good.

731
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,359
Sorry to wake you,
but I found an actor

732
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,161
who plays a polar bear
perfectly.

733
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,163
He even smells like a bear.

734
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,365
The public will fall
for him for sure.

735
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,634
Smart.
They'll love him,

736
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,436
especially
all those extra tourists

737
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:04,340
we let in the arctic.
Just for you, Greene.

738
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,943
On that note, the floor plans
for your condo in the Bahamas

739
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,078
are already on the way.

740
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,113
It's so gigantic it's bigger
than my ego.

741
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,615
And we got those deluxe
showerheads...

742
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,284
Oh, it'll wash
that guilt right off.

743
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,554
I don't have any guilt.
You want 10 miles of ice,

744
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,990
we still have five million more.

745
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,591
<i>Just get the people behind this.</i>

746
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,961
I need that to push
this through.

747
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,597
Well done, Greene.
As usual.

748
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,501
Oh!

749
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,581
That smells like my grandpa.

750
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:25,454
Okay, think. If you
were a slightly creepy,

751
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,757
one-note villain, where would
you keep stuff hidden?

752
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:43,773
Right. This guy's got
security cameras everywhere.

753
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:45,207
I'll be too obvious.

754
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,176
You guys go check it out first.

755
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:48,411
If grandpa's actually in there,

756
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:51,213
tell him norm
has come to the rescue.

757
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:54,750
Ooh!

758
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,122
If you guys had bones,
I'd be worried about ya.

759
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,726
<i>Can't you see I'm busy?</i>

760
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,377
Lemmings!
Is norm with you?

761
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:51,307
So he was down there?

762
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,609
Well, we need to
get him out right now.

763
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,780
Grandpa says it'll blow my
cover if I break him out?

764
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,483
He wants me to build an ark?

765
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,351
Oh, no, no.

766
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:05,387
He wants me to focus on the
arctic, saving the arctic.

767
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,356
I got it.
It all makes sense.

768
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,292
I'll save the arctic first,
and then I'll save grandpa.

769
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,728
And then, if I have time,
I'll build an ark.

770
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,239
<i>Makeup!</i>

771
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,815
Hey, norm. Norm, this is
my daughter, Olympia.

772
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,618
Olympia, this is the great
actor I was telling you about.

773
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,822
Great to meet you, norm.

774
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,458
Quite a costume
you found yourself.

775
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,661
Yes, hi, Mr. Greene. Sorry
I didn't pick up before.

776
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,664
Your mom is very good
at her job, Olympia.

777
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,300
- You must be proud.
- I know.

778
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,469
Sometimes I wish she
wasn't so good at her job,

779
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:56,305
if it meant she got to
spend more time with me.

780
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,474
- Oh! You have lemmings.
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,442
The smallest animals
in the arctic.

782
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,478
- Can I?

783
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:09,518
They're very instinctive.
They know a good person.

784
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,459
Hmm, so let's see.

785
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:20,796
You're approximately
500 kilograms,

786
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,332
exact skull
and nose proportions.

787
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,900
I don't know what
you're talking about.

788
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,902
I only weigh 194 pounds,

789
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,637
just like the average
American male.

790
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,507
Please, I know exactly
what you're doing, norm.

791
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:35,511
You're saving
the arctic, your home.

792
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,913
So I'm thinking,
maybe we can work together.

793
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:40,382
And you can save<i> my</i>
home in the process.

794
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,351
He can't talk like you and me.
I tell ya!

795
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,453
There's nothing to...

796
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,956
Be honest.
What's your plan here?

797
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:50,392
Well, Mr. Greene wants to
use me to sell the arctic,

798
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,428
and I'm gonna use
the arctic to save it.

799
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,897
Exactly. You have
to rally the public

800
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,832
so that they love you,
wait for your moment

801
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,901
and turn them against Greene.

802
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,370
<i>Use his own plan to defeat him.</i>

803
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:03,439
But the key is to make sure

804
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,307
you time your moment just right,

805
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,443
when the public
loves you the most.

806
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:10,613
The approval rating! I'll
get it as high as possible,

807
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,949
and then I'll strike. Olympia,
you really are a genius.

808
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,785
My mom's not the only one
who studied marketing.

809
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:22,391
- - So ladies and gentlemen,

810
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,460
we have an unusual
guest today who is here

811
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,829
to tell us about
his home, the arctic,

812
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,465
and how you can make it
your home, too.

813
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:33,769
Without further ado,
norm of the north!

814
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,307
Ooh!

815
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,317
Whoo!
So, norm,

816
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,986
you're here for
a very special mission.

817
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,755
Would you like to
tell us what it is?

818
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:56,492
I... I, uh...

819
00:54:56,494 --> 00:55:00,062
Ladies and gentlemen, I think our
furry friend's a little nervous.

820
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,897
Well, let's loosen him up

821
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:05,601
with a clip of some of
his most recent heroics.

822
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:09,405
I'm warning you.

823
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,884
- - You know, if we're
not helping each other,

824
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:23,919
I mean, what are
we here for, you know?

825
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,023
"What are we here for?"
We're here to sell condos!

826
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,459
Talk about Greene homes!

827
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,394
<i>- What a jerk.</i>
- Ahem.

828
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:35,964
<i>- What can I say?
- Norm, the public loves you.</i>

829
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:42,071
Hey, Tamecia. What do you say we
take this party to a bigger stage?

830
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,764
- Now?
- Not yet.

831
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,408
Norm! Norm! Norm!

832
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,710
<i>85%!</i>

833
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,912
Look at norm!
He's famous!

834
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,014
Norm's fame has
helped our cause,

835
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,883
but it isn't enough, Greene.

836
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:03,452
I can't get this through
until norm publically says,

837
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,889
"norm of the north supports
Greene homes in the arctic."

838
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:09,725
Make sure he does it
or you're done.

839
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:24,573
This is it, norm.
You did it.

840
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,476
The public loves you. And
you know what that means?

841
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,479
You're right, Olympia.
It's time to save our homes.

842
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,241
How long can it take
to get into a costume?

843
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:00,909
I don't think
he liked the outfit.

844
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,611
Norm, can you please come out?

845
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:11,854
- I think I just did.

846
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,565
Okay, lemmings.
We got one shot at this.

847
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:27,836
It's showtime. We do this,
and then we go get grandpa.

848
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,566
Yay, norm!

849
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,672
Ahem. So someone somewhere
thought it was a good idea

850
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,207
to build in the arctic.

851
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:09,711
That someone is our "friend," Mr.
Greene.

852
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,780
I just wanted to let you
all know the truth

853
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:13,882
about what this would mean
for my home.

854
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,622
<i>Norm of the north supports</i>

855
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:23,258
<i>- Greene homes in the arctic.</i>

856
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,038
Norm! Norm! Norm!

857
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:48,317
Norm, we did it.

858
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,985
I'm on with my architect.

859
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,286
We're figuring out
where to put the first

860
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:53,722
arctic frozen yogurt shop.

861
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:57,593
Your announcement has been
reposted a million times!

862
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,762
No,<i> your</i> announcement was
reposted a million times.

863
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,966
- I had something I needed to say.
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

864
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:06,768
Four homes pre-sold,
and already built.

865
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,870
Mr. Greene, you can't
sell the homes yet.

866
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,306
We don't have approval from the council.
It's illegal.

867
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:15,844
Aw, "I'm Wittle Vee-wa.
I'm scared of the Po-weece."

868
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:19,748
Guess what, toots,
I'm above the law.

869
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,052
Welcome to the cold, hard
world of big bid-ness.

870
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,988
You sound just like
the investors.

871
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,257
"Uh, duh, it has to be
done correctly, Greene,

872
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,360
with integrity."

873
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:34,029
Please, wake up
and smell the profits.

874
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,732
Not to mention that after norm of
the north's announcement today,

875
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:40,102
- approval is a guarantee.

876
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,373
Norm, come back!
Don't be a diva.

877
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,749
Ahem.

878
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,817
Vera, get my lawyer.

879
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,754
We're gonna copyright that
roar and make it a ringtone.

880
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:07,929
Hey, it's norm of the north!

881
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,731
You're the king!

882
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:14,403
I'm norm of the north,
king of nothing.

883
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:18,240
I came to save my home.
I ended up destroying it.

884
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,211
Norm, your grandpa once told me,

885
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,380
"norm's the only bear
that has the potential

886
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,383
to be king
of the arctic."

887
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:52,307
Hey, norm. Norm. Why don't
you come over for dinner?

888
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,776
I'd rather be alone
right now, Vera.

889
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:56,445
Please, just leave me be.

890
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,448
Norm, why are you so down?
You were great!

891
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,150
The campaign was a success.

892
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,020
- Everyone loves you.
- Don't you get it, Vera?

893
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:08,990
Because of me, Mr. Greene
is gonna destroy my home.

894
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:12,194
I think you're taking this polar
bear act a little too far, norm.

895
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:15,430
Come on. Olympia would
love it if you came over.

896
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:19,167
Olympia...? Dinner with a genius?
Mmm, I'm in.

897
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,840
You wouldn't happen to know where
I can get some ice water, huh?

898
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:28,076
You know, so I can freshen
up a little bit? For dinner.

899
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:39,287
Ugh.
You okay?

900
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:44,793
Ah...!

901
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,135
Ah...!

902
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:55,871
It's humble, but it's home.

903
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:58,206
You should see my place.
No furniture,

904
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,442
but I do get year-round
air conditioning.

905
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:09,551
<i>Thanks, Mrs. Soo.</i>

906
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,854
Mommy, you're home early.

907
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,356
How was school today?

908
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:16,892
Scintillating, as usual.

909
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,561
Olympia's just not really
challenged at her current school.

910
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:23,265
That's why Magister Mundi
will be so great.

911
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,567
All the students
are like Olympia.

912
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,936
I actually think Olympia and
myself are a lot alike.

913
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:30,338
We're both special.
We have great gifts.

914
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,507
Two peas in a pod.

915
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,242
Besties.

916
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,847
Anyway, mommy, I was
researching the effects

917
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,248
of human activity in the arctic,

918
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,484
and the research is irrefutable.

919
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,252
It will destroy the
arctic and possibly

920
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,488
the rest of the earth
as we know it.

921
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,057
Olympia, Greene homes will
bring awareness to the arctic.

922
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:53,328
Olympia, let's
you and I go hang out

923
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,397
on that
comfortable-looking sofa.

924
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,082
<i>- Vera, it's official.
- Just got word.</i>

925
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:16,484
<i>The polar council is a yes!</i>

926
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,286
Oh, okay.

927
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,889
<i>Make the announcement tomorrow.
Time to go public.</i>

928
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:25,527
We're in.
We got approval.

929
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,597
Well, don't all scream at once.

930
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,967
It's not over yet, norm.
You can still do something.

931
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,169
Shake it up. Hit Mr.
Greene where it hurts...

932
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,004
His wallet.

933
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,873
Hmm.

934
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,975
Where do you think the
investors are right now?

935
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:47,482
<i>Great job, everyone.
Great job.</i>

936
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:49,517
Amazing day.

937
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,395
Oh, thanks, guys!

938
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,366
I've got to get Pablo and the
investors to uninvest in Greene.

939
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,534
- Norm!

940
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,066
Hi, guys.

941
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,001
I'm sorry for just dropping
in on you like this, but...

942
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:43,138
You're a real bear?
Uh-huh.

943
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,674
- Who can speak?
- Yeah, who would have thought?

944
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:48,176
But I need to come clean
about who I really am

945
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,312
and what I'm really doing here.

946
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,547
We know exactly who you are.

947
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,482
You're norm of the north.

948
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:58,687
I am Pablo, and this
is my investment group.

949
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:02,123
Pablo, building in the
arctic will destroy my home.

950
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,559
- That's where I live
- but the polar council,

951
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:07,529
well, they are very
aware of the impact.

952
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,698
You mean<i> this</i> council?

953
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,400
On that note, the floor plans
for your condo in the Bahamas

954
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,002
are already on the way.

955
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:15,470
<i>And we got those deluxe
showerheads...</i>

956
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,106
Oh, it'll wash
that guilt right off.

957
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,208
How did you get this?

958
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,410
I had some very small
hairy associates

959
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,145
relieve Mr. Greene
of this flash drive.

960
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:32,988
You're corrupt! You took our
money under false pretense,

961
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,324
and you're as fake
as that ponytail clip-on.

962
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,564
It doesn't matter
if I'm corrupt,

963
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,700
because a deal's a deal. The
first four homes are built,

964
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,502
and once they land
in the arctic,

965
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,438
you're contractually
obligated to fund the rest.

966
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:55,010
If I know Greene,

967
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:58,113
he'll have the homes
transported tonight.

968
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,248
Yeah, and if I know Mr. Greene,
he'll dispose of anything

969
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,283
that reminds him of the arctic.

970
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:07,255
You promise to take care
of Vera and Olympia?

971
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,524
I never got a chance
to say goodbye.

972
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,559
Norm, you have my word.

973
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,294
Now get me out of this deal.

974
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:22,037
We need to get the homes
down to the river.

975
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,805
That old bear? No!

976
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:26,174
We need to get rid of him before
he can cause any trouble.

977
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:29,811
Commence
"operation kill that bear."

978
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,057
<i>Just as Pablo predicted.</i>

979
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:47,195
<i>And just like I predicted.</i>

980
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,697
I bet grandpa
is in that last one.

981
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:55,270
- Whoa!

982
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:58,373
- Ow!

983
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,589
Grandpa!

984
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,661
- What now?

985
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,538
- Norm!
- Grandpa!

986
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,108
Everyone back home
thought you abandoned us,

987
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,277
but Socrates and I always
knew that something happened.

988
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,113
Oh, it's good to see you.

989
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,715
You know, sometimes when
you stick up to "the man,"

990
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:42,750
you get stuck with
a tranquilizer dart.

991
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,186
- Were you able to stop Greene?
- Not yet.

992
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:47,255
The houses are being
transported tonight.

993
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:50,291
If we can stop them, maybe we
can stop this whole operation.

994
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,694
Then what the heck
are you doing<i> here?</i>

995
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:58,500
Norm, don't worry about me.
It's your time now.

996
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:02,303
Leave me. Go! Save the arctic!
Save our homes.

997
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,440
You<i> are</i> the arctic, grandpa.

998
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:11,279
Hmm. I must have
weakened them for you.

999
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,214
What do you say
we go save our home?

1000
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,802
What?

1001
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,474
The arctic rats?

1002
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,815
What?

1003
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,717
What do you mean the bear
broke out of the cage?

1004
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,920
It's impossible.
He's like, 80.

1005
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:53,855
It would have taken
two bears to...

1006
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:58,860
<i>What?
That isn't norm!</i>

1007
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:01,696
Get the chopper
and find two polar bears!

1008
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,801
How long until the ship leaves?

1009
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:09,237
I don't care if they're
predicting a storm.

1010
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,606
- Leave now!

1011
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:14,509
The houses are on
the way to the arctic!

1012
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,844
We gotta get to them!

1013
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,497
Where are we headed?

1014
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,765
Same place where I came in.

1015
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,946
Huh?

1016
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,948
<i>There they are!</i>

1017
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,552
Get ready, grandpa.
There's our ride home.

1018
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,300
Agh-hh!

1019
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:15,603
- Ow!

1020
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,472
No!

1021
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,743
Eh...?

1022
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:40,395
<i>If we don't get down there,
it's gonna be</i>

1023
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,730
a long swim to the arctic.

1024
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:55,743
Oh-hh. Hey!

1025
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:07,855
Just shoot those bears.

1026
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,657
Greene said to put them
out of their misery

1027
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,593
- and dump 'em in the ocean.
- Wait! Wait!

1028
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,462
You guys think we're bears?

1029
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,030
You hear that, grandpa?

1030
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:20,868
Talking polar bears in Manhattan?
Now, come on, guys.

1031
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,504
Yeah, maybe our friend the
Easter bunny's around here, too.

1032
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,641
Are you sure they're bears?

1033
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:28,710
<i>They sound like humans to me.</i>

1034
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,812
<i>- I didn't sign up
to shoot real people.</i>

1035
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,011
Hmm.

1036
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,575
Norm, no matter what happens,

1037
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:09,744
just know that I'm proud of you.

1038
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:11,913
You've come a long way.

1039
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:15,650
You might think you're not
a hunter, but you are.

1040
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:18,586
<i>Your way of hunting is just
different than everyone else.</i>

1041
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:22,089
You're going to make
a great king one day.

1042
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,659
I know it.

1043
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:26,160
What's wrong?

1044
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,795
We're gonna get this, norm.

1045
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,697
No, sorry.
It's not about that.

1046
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,667
I... I'm just worried.
In saving our own home,

1047
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:35,203
I may have ruined
someone else's.

1048
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:38,773
I'm just hoping Vera and
Olympia will be okay.

1049
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
<i>It's beautiful, mom,</i>

1050
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:07,902
<i>but what will it look like
when you and Mr. Greene</i>

1051
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:09,871
<i>build all those houses there?</i>

1052
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,545
"Mr. Greene, I'm sorry,

1053
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,580
but I cannot help you
destroy somebody's home

1054
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,983
in order to build
houses no one needs.

1055
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:23,851
I quit."

1056
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,663
Okay, every office
around the world

1057
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,832
is ready to feed this.
Are you sure, Pablo?

1058
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:40,968
Yes.
Send it now.

1059
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:51,178
We have to dislodge this barge

1060
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,147
so we can flip these houses.

1061
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:56,050
These condos must never
reach the arctic.

1062
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,024
Buckle up, guys.
This could get bumpy.

1063
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:11,132
We have to do this, now.

1064
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,708
It won't dislodge,
it's too rough.

1065
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,044
The swells keep pushing it back.

1066
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:58,879
Welcome to the real north shore!

1067
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:05,686
See you on the other side...
whichever one we get to.

1068
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:08,189
But remember, whatever happens,

1069
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:12,159
a king always fights
for his home!

1070
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,664
Come on, lemmings!

1071
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:05,046
<i>A king always fights

Lemmings! Grandpa!

1074
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:37,445
Talk to me.

1075
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:40,114
What the...
They never got there?

1076
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:42,216
Then where are my condos?

1077
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,485
The bottom of the ocean?

1078
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:46,454
Is that some kinda joke?

1079
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:49,490
Two polar bears?

1080
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,064
<i>"Greene homes and polar

1081

<i>Beloved norm helps reveal sham"?</i>

1083
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:07,875
These condos weren't for any
of you peasants anyway.

1084
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,811
They were for the one percent.
The one percent!

1085
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:21,188
Huh, would you look at that?
I'm late for yoga.

1086
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,890
Namaste, everybody.

1087
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:24,525
- Janet?
- Whatever.

1088
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,128
- <i>Janet!</i>

1089
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,263
<i>Help me, you peasants!
Help me!</i>

01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,899
<i>Don't you know
who I am? Huh?</i>

1091
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:35,936
<i>Rats! They're crawling on me!
This is Italian!</i>

1092
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,815
Look who's out of hibernation.

1093
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:49,817
Son.

1094
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:55,189
Every time I see you,
you've fallen on your butt.

1095
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:57,324
I march to the beat of my own drum.
You know that.

1096
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:59,527
When everyone else
stands, I sit.

1100
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:09,303
We've searched everywhere, norm.

1101
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,407
No.

1102
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,254
Norm, you saved our home.

1103
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:29,223
I'm sorry I didn't
realize until now,

1104
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:32,026
but we are so proud of you.

1105
01:20:32,028 --> 01:20:34,128
The lemmings told us
what you've done.

1106
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:37,031
You used your gift
and you risked your life

1107
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:39,099
to protect ours.

1108
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:42,903
And on behalf of all of us...

1109
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:44,405
Thank you.

1110
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:52,479
Ahem. Remember
what we discussed?

1111
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,450
<i>A new day dawns upon us.</i>

1112
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:58,986
We need a leader who feels
for the arctic,

1113
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:03,591
speaks for the arctic,
and always fights for our home.

1114
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:06,060
<i>Norm, I crown you...</i>

1115
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:09,196
Now just a New York minute.

1116
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,599
You can't do this without me.

1117
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,968
Grandpa!

1118
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:21,876
They all said you drowned.

1119
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:24,078
I was 80% sure
you were gonna make it.

1120
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:29,617
Now<i> that's</i> what I call
a grand entrance.

1121
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:31,952
The tide took me all
the way to Greenland,

1122
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:33,587
but I hitched a ride
with an Orca.

1123
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:37,958
He said he was coming back
to audition for Stan.

1124
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,195
You need therapy.

1125
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:44,298
I have an opening tomorrow afternoon.
Book yourself in.

1126
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,567
Son, please continue.

1127
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:49,570
Norm, I crown you king.

1128
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:02,917
- That's my brother! Yeah!

1129
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:22,403
If the clouds clear
and the barometric pressure

1130
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:24,638
is just right...

1131
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,274
Wow. I see Magister
Mundi is teaching you

1132
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:30,277
all these fancy
new terms already.

1133
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,714
I told you I could do it
on my own, without Greene.

1134
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:36,450
Aren't you liking it without Mr.
Greene in your life, too?

1135
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,453
Pablo seems like
a much better boss.

1136
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,456
Well, norm gave me
a great recommendation.

1137
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,558
Oh, my gosh!
I can see it.

1138
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,527
I can finally see it.

1139
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:53,968
He even looks like norm.
I miss him, mom.

1140
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,570
Me, too. But I know
he made it home.

1141
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:59,139
I bet he has his own family now.

1142
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,598
Isn't it pretty?

1143
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:30,137
Yeah. I wonder if Vera and
Olympia can see this, too.

1144
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:32,172
<i>- Whoa!
- They're beautiful!</i>

1145
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,394
<i>Wait for it. Wait for it...</i>

1146
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,300
Yah!
Ta-da!
