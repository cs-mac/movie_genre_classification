1
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:08,272
Alex!

2
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,214
Alexia Wheaton!

3
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,217
Let's get a move on!

4
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,420
Man, oh, man.

5
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,066
Chill, you vagrant. I'm coming!

6
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,168
Ben, Nan, later.

7
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,386
We can't let her go out
in public like that, Ben. Alex!

8
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:27,887
Stop!

9
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,191
Whoa!

10
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,013
What's wrong with you,
besides the obvious?

11
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,448
- We're gonna be late again.
- Oh, pop a Midol.

12
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:59,042
Who said anything about being late?

13
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:01,387
<i>I've had it.</i>

14
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,321
I am going to clean out her closet.

15
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,020
And from now on, it's cardigan sweaters
and monogrammed blouses.

16
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:10,087
And I don't think that it's healthy
that she call me Nan.

17
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:13,793
It shows a total disregard
for our family hierarchy.

18
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:15,392
Nan, listen.

19
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,166
Have you noticed that when you insist
that Alex calls you Mom...

20
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,503
the greater pleasure she gets
from calling you Nan?

21
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,339
And when we object
to her provocative clothing...

22
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,403
she just finds something
more provocative to wear the next day.

23
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,177
And when we encourage the girls
to get along...

24
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,241
the more out of hand
their sibling rivalry gets.

25
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,282
What have our patients
been telling us all these years?

26
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,387
That their parents
have ruined their lives.

27
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:44,022
Exactly. Now...

28
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,965
I think the only way
these girls are gonna get along...

29
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:50,800
show us some respect
and bring harmony to this household...

30
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:54,638
is for you and I
to stop interfering.

31
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,940
There'll be no reason for them to rebel
against our rules and demands...

32
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,776
because...

33
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:03,408
there won't be any.

34
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,660
- Morning, Hayley.
- Hi.

35
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:27,606
Oh, excellent shirt, Aly. Wow.

36
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,296
That's three days in a row, Hayley.

37
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:53,492
If it happens again, I'm going
to start deducting from your grade.

38
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,533
It won't.

39
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,908
All right.
Now tomorrow's quiz will require...

40
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,468
slide identification
of the following constellations...

41
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,475
Canis Majorus, Leo...

42
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:10,210
Taurus...

43
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:11,979
That rhymes.

44
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,333
Cool shorts, guys.

45
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:36,709
Doctor's orders.
He said I had to sit out again.

46
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,522
What do you think
they're talking about right now?

47
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,029
Etruscan art.

48
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,528
- How should I know?
- It's your sister.

49
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:05,231
Sabrina, is that stubble?

50
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,442
I swear, I shaved this morning.
I must have just missed a spot.

51
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:16,347
So, Alex,
what's the limit on the festival again?

52
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,152
No limit.

53
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:23,016
Hello, beautiful.
How you doing?

54
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,150
All right. Test scores are in.
Time to face the music.

55
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:30,163
Mr. Gerard.
You need to make that up with me.

56
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,290
Very nice.

57
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:33,958
Barely adequate.

58
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,373
But Hayley here. Very nice.

59
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,970
It's nice to see someone coming out
smelling like a rose.

60
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,107
Lose the gum, if you would.

61
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:54,211
So, any questions
about grades, homework?

62
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,949
Life, in general?

63
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,548
- Mr. Watson?
- Yes, Alexia.

64
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,787
Can I go to the ladies' room, please?

65
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,421
What difference does it make?

66
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,037
Oh, I think it's so admirable
that you attended the police academy.

67
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,516
You see, it's always been a dream
of mine to go into law enforcement.

68
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:29,249
But my parents, whom, by the way, think
you're a wonderful administrator...

69
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,656
want me to get a degree first,
like you.

70
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:35,927
I never knew anyone looked to me
as a role model.

71
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,760
Oh, since the ninth grade!

72
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,398
But in order for me
to follow in your path...

73
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,960
I have to start
by getting into Felder first...

74
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,336
and, well,
I was thinking that you...

75
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:48,841
being a distinguished principal
and all...

76
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,605
might like to write
a recommendation for me.

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,454
And what might the recommendation say?

78
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,784
Dear Admissions Committee...

79
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,692
though Alexia Wheaton is in...

80
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:10,424
the bottom half of her class...

81
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:13,729
she dresses well.

82
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:16,167
Oh! So you'll consider it.

83
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:25,403
Where's the dirt?
She hasn't written in two weeks.

84
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,244
Think she's onto us?

85
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,066
Do you think they do it?

86
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:57,636
Well, I don't have
any documented evidence, but...

87
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,271
Man, they are so in love.

88
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,253
We better evacuate.

89
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:17,255
- There you are, Kyle.
- Thanks, Mrs. Wheaton.

90
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,458
And do you have
enough salad there, Caitlin?

91
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,966
Yes, thanks.

92
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,340
You've got to be kidding.

93
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,513
- We have guests.
- I don't mind.

94
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:42,818
- I don't mind.
- Part of her experiment.

95
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,155
You know, I made the fuel
from an apple you threw away.

96
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:48,024
It was mealy.

97
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,159
What?

98
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,830
Kyle, would you mind serving me?
My nails are still wet.

99
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:58,837
Sure.

100
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,476
- Small portions, please.
- Sorry.

101
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,377
Well, everyone. I found it.

102
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,545
- Found what?
- The most outrageous dress...

103
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,142
for Winter Festival.

104
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,312
- And how low is it cut?
- And how much?

105
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:17,016
It's 200 and something.

106
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,892
298.

107
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:25,891
As in over $300
with tax for a dress?

108
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,227
Your limit was 200.

109
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,238
I know, but...

110
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:35,173
what's an extra hundred
over the course of a lifetime?

111
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:38,040
My children will see me in these photos,
and I want them to think I look nice.

112
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:42,913
But there must be another nice dress
for a more reasonable price.

113
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:51,056
But this one sounds so very special.

114
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,724
So, here. Here's the credit card.

115
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,230
Wear it in good health.

116
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,994
Why don't you take Hayley with you...

117
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,298
so that she can pick out a dress
for the Winter Festival too?

118
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,339
- That's a great idea. Can I come?
- Wait.

119
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,807
We're sisters. We're not friends.

120
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,707
And we don't shop together.

121
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,712
- Alex, that's terrible.
- Honey.

122
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:16,580
I'm not going anyway.

123
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,141
But, Muffin!

124
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:24,753
This is your first Winter Festival,
and it would be such fun.

125
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,663
And don't you want to be there
to see if your sister gets crowned...

126
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,426
queen?

127
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,667
You probably know
what you want to do.

128
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,735
Stay at home.
Watch the Discovery Channel, huh?

129
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,747
Amen.

130
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:56,252
- Go ahead.
- Oh, no. It's yours.

131
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,587
Well, here. We'll share it.

132
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,058
There you go.

133
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:15,442
Canis Majorus.

134
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,070
Canis Majorus.

135
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,875
And Leo.

136
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,111
Arcturus, where are you?

137
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,913
There you are. Okay.

138
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,910
I wish I were Alexia Wheaton.

139
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,335
Man, oh, man! It worked!

140
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,776
What? What worked?

141
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:34,006
- I...
- You did this?

142
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,450
I made a wish
when I saw a shooting star.

143
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,079
You made a wish to be me?

144
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,555
I didn't think it would work.

145
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,454
I don't like it in here!

146
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:53,466
Wish us back!

147
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:57,629
I don't think that's possible, Hayley.

148
00:14:57,704 --> 00:15:02,107
I think it is, Hayley! Do it now!

149
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,872
I can't. It's daytime.

150
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,379
Well, I hate to spoil your fun...

151
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,440
but I have a lot of personal stuff
to deal with today.

152
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:14,248
And we are not leaving this house
till things are back in order.

153
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,255
I'll handle this.

154
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,293
Me? I'm Alexia.

155
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:24,796
Alexia Wheaton.

156
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,237
Personally, I like it best...

157
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,801
when my boyfriend Kyle
calls me Aly.

158
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:45,276
<i>Happy birthday</i>

159
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,343
<i>Happy birthday</i>
<i>Yadda, yadda, yadda</i>

160
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:50,015
Now reverse the wish.

161
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,718
All right. I wish I were Hayley.

162
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:54,852
Don't you know
the birthday candle rule?

163
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:58,659
You have to say the wish to yourself,
otherwise, it can't come true.

164
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,359
On to plan B.

165
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,758
- It's a wishing well.
- Got it.

166
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:46,711
Would you try it
with a little more "umph"?

167
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,829
I can't do this.
I can't be you.

168
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,805
And you obviously lack
the social grace to be me.

169
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,636
I don't believe this.
I have split ends.

170
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:25,652
- I have an astronomy test today.
- Don't stress.

171
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:29,052
I had Frauenfleder
when I was a sophomore. I'll just cheat.

172
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:31,090
But you can't. Ow!

173
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:35,060
I mean, I... You...
You can't do that.

174
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:39,763
When he passes out the test,
just faint or something.

175
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,597
Get sent home sick.
I can make up the test tomorrow.

176
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,036
You can spend the day watching TV
and eating.

177
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,267
Deal. Close your eyes.

178
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:51,709
No one finds out about this.
Especially Caitlin.

179
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,076
Undoubtedly, she'd leak it
to the <i>National Enquirer.</i>

180
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,605
I don't want any rumors going on
about me the week of the festival.

181
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,716
Ouch! What about Mom and Dad?

182
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,653
They'd have us committed.

183
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,827
So wait. We have a secret?

184
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:11,830
You and me?

185
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:23,301
So, is there anything
I need to know about you...

186
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:28,144
other than being a grungy
social outcast?

187
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm not grungy.
I just have my own style.

188
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,247
Dirt under the fingernails is in?

189
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,380
You won't mind if I remove it,
will you?

190
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,926
So, how do I look?

191
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,731
Today is definitely day one.

192
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,860
- Day one of what?
- My diet.

193
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:53,201
Excuse me.
I mean, your diet.

194
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:55,537
A fruit and veggie fast.
You're bloated.

195
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,874
What are you talking about?
I'm a knockout.

196
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:02,847
The makeup may be a bit heavy.
Not me.

197
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,077
Whatever. Lose the gum.

198
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,017
Today, you're mine.

199
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:34,243
Good morning, Daddy.

200
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,747
Mom.

201
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,082
You're looking particularly
adorable today.

202
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,624
And, as usual, Alex...

203
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,160
you are looking quite stylish yourself.

204
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,594
Sis, allow me.

205
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,075
How about a little cereal?

206
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:08,872
That's okay.
I'm on a fruits and veggies fast only.

207
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:12,117
Actually, we should get going.

208
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,915
I wouldn't want Hayley to be late
for her big test.

209
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,385
Nan, Ben.

210
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:36,098
- Hi.
- Grow up!

211
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,638
Excuse me.

212
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,649
- What are you doing?
- Driving.

213
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,345
You don't know how to drive.
Give me my keys.

214
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,889
Give me my keys now.

215
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:55,794
Thank you.

216
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,328
You should know better.

217
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:32,695
If I still had my badge,
I'd have to write you up.

218
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,728
What are you, drunk?

219
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:44,733
She was up late, studying,
so she could raise her GPA.

220
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,608
Isn't that right, Alex?

221
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,515
And I was just giving her, Hayley,
my little sis, a driving lesson.

222
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,519
It won't happen again.

223
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,656
Hayley, I wouldn't want anything
to harm your chances...

224
00:21:57,724 --> 00:22:00,921
of representing Hunter
in the science fair in D.C.

225
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:04,259
- I certainly wouldn't.
- Thank you for being so understanding.

226
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:07,494
You are a wonderful administrator
and an asset to this school.

227
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,502
At least,
that's what Alex keeps telling me.

228
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,868
You're my hero, Mrs. Mitter Mon...

229
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,373
I won't tolerate
being called that name.

230
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:19,839
Now get to class.

231
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:39,788
You'll have approximately two and a half
minutes to answer each question...

232
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:43,063
after the corresponding slide
has been shown.

233
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:47,129
And I do suggest that you keep your eyes
on your own paper...

234
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:51,234
because if you don't, I will pluck them
out and keep them in a jar on my desk.

235
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:00,313
In the Ptolemaic Universe,
is it the Earth in the middle...

236
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:02,855
with the stars and stuff
rotating around...

237
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,357
or is it the sun in the middle...

238
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:12,957
Mr. Frauenfleder?

239
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,501
I'm... I'm not feeling very...

240
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,845
Eleven serving six.

241
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,609
Ow!

242
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,917
- Are you okay, Alex?
- I'm fine.

243
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,039
Muffin.

244
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:56,599
I'm her mother.

245
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,444
Let's get you home.

246
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:04,814
I'd feel much better
if we could get some ice cream...

247
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:07,614
and maybe stop
at Blockbuster on the way.

248
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:31,336
- Hi.
- What did I do?

249
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:33,936
Can't I just say hi?

250
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,175
Of course you can. Hi.

251
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:39,116
Oh, I guess you heard
that Hayley went home sick.

252
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,710
I'm so worried.
I'm going over after school.

253
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:47,249
- I mean, what if there's brain damage?
- Oh, trust me, she'll be fine.

254
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,852
Why don't you come and eat lunch
with me and my gang?

255
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,695
I mean, Hayley would hate for you
to seem like a loner.

256
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,758
Really? Okay.

257
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,238
Talley... Thanks. Talley, Sabrina,
Kazumi, this is Caitlin Scheinbaum.

258
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:08,212
- She's eating lunch with us today.
- Why?

259
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:12,684
Because she's Hayley's very best friend
in the entire world.

260
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:15,152
- So?
- So...

261
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,089
So be nice to her.
Hayley went home sick.

262
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,153
Hayley and I always wondered what
it would be like to eat with you guys.

263
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,164
She'll be bummed she missed it.

264
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:29,463
Oh, well, you can both eat with us
tomorrow. We'd be happy to have you.

265
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:32,529
Right, guys?

266
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:38,605
Oh, but don't bring
another tuna fish sandwich.

267
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:40,043
It's one of our rules.

268
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,975
- Sorry.
- Rules?

269
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,813
Duh. They're supposed to be secrets.

270
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,786
Your secrets are safe with me.
You can tell me anything.

271
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:53,315
Well, we alternate
bringing diet sodas for everyone.

272
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,553
Tomorrow can be your turn.

273
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:56,925
- Okay.
- Tic Tac, anyone?

274
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,268
Oh, Alex. What happened?

275
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:07,461
Oh. Volleyball. You know.

276
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,407
- Looks gruesome.
- That no makeup thing.

277
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:13,776
That's actually very in.
<i>Self,</i> March issue.

278
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,975
Anyway, Alex, tell us what happened
last night. How did you do it?

279
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,950
- Do what?
- Dump Kyle.

280
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:24,250
Why would I do
a stupid thing like that?

281
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:25,985
Kyle's perfect.

282
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,422
- Alex, hello.
- You hit the limit.

283
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,296
- What limit?
- The three-month max.

284
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:37,495
Rule three, designed to maximize
our experience with different men.

285
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,539
As of midnight last night,
the clock was up on Kyle.

286
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,370
We reminded you yesterday.

287
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,176
I thought the plan...

288
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:48,146
was to ask him over for dinner,
do a little hot tub...

289
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:51,809
call him a sick puppy
and then send him on his way.

290
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,714
How could I have?

291
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,399
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,834
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- What could there be left to say?

293
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:15,841
Just give me a second, please?

294
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:18,309
All right. Fine.

295
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:19,811
Geez.

296
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:26,375
Okay. Kyle, whatever I said last night,
I didn't mean.

297
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,386
I wasn't being myself.

298
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,581
Let's go for a walk this afternoon
like old times.

299
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:34,526
Listen, Alexia,
I have practice after school.

300
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:40,031
I'm not interested in going with someone
who calls me a sick puppy.

301
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:45,804
I can understand why you'd be angry...

302
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,373
but...

303
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,105
how can you resist me?

304
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,054
I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself lately.

305
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:06,751
Can't we just get together
after practice and talk?

306
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,193
I could give you a ride home.

307
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:15,290
Well, I guess I could use a ride.
I'll be through at 4:00.

308
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,106
Yes!

309
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,767
Mr. Frauenfleder?

310
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:55,265
Do you remember me,
Alexia Wheaton, Hayley's sister?

311
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:57,275
Yes, you're the one
who ignited the counter...

312
00:28:57,343 --> 00:29:01,177
after neglecting to follow my directions
during chemistry section.

313
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,807
I still can't get the funding
to replace it.

314
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,011
Hayley just wanted me to stop by...

315
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:09,213
and find out
when she can make up for the test.

316
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,223
She can take it orally
when she's better.

317
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,556
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine tomorrow.

318
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,060
Mr. Frauenfleder...

319
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,956
out of all your students,
is Hayley, perhaps, your favorite?

320
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:27,039
You, of all people, should be thankful
I don't rank my students, Alexia.

321
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,338
Well, between you and me...

322
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,675
do you think she has a shot at winning
the science fair and going to nationals?

323
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,141
Well, she's not very comfortable
at public speaking...

324
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,150
but I expect she'll get it right.

325
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:40,879
Hayley's very tenacious.

326
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,182
Thank you.

327
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:14,519
I'm coming!

328
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:19,557
Oh, we don't want any.

329
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:23,083
Oh, no. They're for you, Hayley.
A get-well thing.

330
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:26,393
I heard about your episode,
and I was worried.

331
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:30,095
Thanks, bud.
These are delish.

332
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,694
I'd ask you in, but I'm ill.

333
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:34,706
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow
at school or something.

334
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:37,072
You don't wanna know who I am?

335
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,372
I don't know you?

336
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:45,907
It's weird. Sometimes it's hard
for me to keep things straight.

337
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,545
People, places, nouns, in general.

338
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:51,181
That is weird.

339
00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:53,691
I'm Simon Smalley.
I just moved in next door.

340
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,558
- I've been wanting to meet you.
- Thanks for the cookies.

341
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:08,399
So are we gonna get in the car?

342
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:10,408
We could do that.

343
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,737
Whoa!

344
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,441
Geez!

345
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,255
Hey, the curb!

346
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,362
Wait!
Don't you remember where I live?

347
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,456
Whoa!

348
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,467
Maybe I should drive.

349
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:16,238
Oh, this is great.

350
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,243
- Thanks.
- Sure.

351
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:24,182
Since when do you listen to this?

352
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:28,182
Oh, that reminds me. We better
do our thing before Alex gets home.

353
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:30,188
- What thing?
- You know...

354
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:32,190
see if she made a new entry
in her diary.

355
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:34,783
I'm dying to figure out
what happened between her and Kyle.

356
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,989
Oh, and I have to try on
that killer top she wore on Monday.

357
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,383
Kyle, I just want you to know,
that, no matter what happens...

358
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,318
I think you're the nicest, smartest...

359
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:05,619
most gorgeous guy I've ever met
in my entire life.

360
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,322
I hope this doesn't sound lame...

361
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:17,532
but I've never seen you look
as beautiful as you do right now, Aly.

362
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:20,299
And I mean that.

363
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,865
Without all that makeup
and hairspray and stuff...

364
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,877
I can see you.

365
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,576
Kyle, tell me you love me.

366
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:04,941
Well, I...

367
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:06,382
Don't you?

368
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:12,120
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean, I really like you a lot.

369
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,624
I just...

370
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:19,661
Let's just be together, okay?

371
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,961
All right. Come here.

372
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,195
Hello, dear family.

373
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,142
You look like
you're craving a salad.

374
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,342
Your nails!

375
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,277
So where have you been
all afternoon?

376
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:16,447
So, how is everyone?

377
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:20,788
Alex, why don't you
come with me to the kitchen...

378
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,385
and I'll show you
how to liven up that salad?

379
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:25,396
It's not that bad.

380
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:33,102
- What?
- What is that?

381
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,833
- What?
- This.

382
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,932
- That!
- Ow. I don't know.

383
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,876
That's a hickey, you tramp.

384
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:42,743
This? This is a hickey?

385
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,009
Yes!

386
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:47,177
It sounds like Alex got a hickey
and Hayley finds it distasteful.

387
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,653
Who did this to you?
I mean, me.

388
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:52,520
I mean...
Who the hell did this?

389
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,424
Well, Kyle.
We were kissing...

390
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:57,485
and I guess things got
a little out of control.

391
00:35:57,563 --> 00:35:59,793
You don't know how to kiss.

392
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,095
I'm a natural.

393
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,830
Wait a second.

394
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:07,702
I broke up with Kyle last night.

395
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:13,443
Well, you got back together with him
this afternoon.

396
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,379
This is unethical, Hayley!

397
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,217
- How could you?
- I couldn't resist, Alex.

398
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,348
He told me I never looked prettier.

399
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:28,188
He was talking to me.

400
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,387
No, he was talking to me.

401
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:33,398
You weren't there. Besides...

402
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:36,401
he doesn't like
all that makeup you wear.

403
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,705
That's it.

404
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:44,300
Outside! Thanks a lot for ruining
the most relaxing day of my life.

405
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:50,304
Well, I have never seen Hayley
express her emotions so openly.

406
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,850
Do it! Do it now!

407
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,577
It's overcast. I can't.

408
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:00,217
You mean to tell me that I'm stuck...

409
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,056
in this measly little body
for another day...

410
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:06,690
while you just parade around...

411
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,827
ruining my reputation
and destroying my beautiful nails?

412
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:14,105
Looks that way, doesn't it?

413
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:19,008
That it is. This is war!

414
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:20,739
I'm gonna get you back.

415
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:23,304
Fine. Be that way.
It was worth it.

416
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,482
I'm on to you, Hayley.

417
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:33,047
I know all about you and Caitlin
invading my privacy.

418
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,616
Reading my diary,
trying on my clothes. Excuse me!

419
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:38,595
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ow! My room.

420
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:40,996
Let's get something straight, Hayley.

421
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:45,696
You might have my body, breasts
and boyfriend, but you are not me.

422
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,705
Go to your own room.

423
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,139
Fine. But what would
Mom and Dad think?

424
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:57,346
Fine, but if you touch anything...

425
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,646
you'll wish you had never been born.

426
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:01,413
- Fine.
- Fine.

427
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:48,732
Good morning, Alex.

428
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:54,705
This would be day two
of your diet, right?

429
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,703
What diet?

430
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,348
How about some juice with that?

431
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:14,858
What are you doing?

432
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:20,262
You want to fit into
your festival gown, don't you?

433
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:22,596
Screw the festival.

434
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:27,367
You're not... You're not gonna let her
go out like that, are you?

435
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:32,308
- I don't see why not?
- You don't think it's flattering?

436
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:35,814
You'll make a fool of me.
I mean, her.

437
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:39,578
Well, I really don't care
what you think.

438
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:44,112
Now, I recall you going out in public
in the same outfit not so long ago.

439
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:46,752
That was Halloween!

440
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:50,659
Mom, you've gotta lock her in her room
so she can't get in any trouble.

441
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:53,459
- Ben, she's got a point.
- Uh, uh, uh.

442
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:55,625
Hayley can wear whatever she wants.

443
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,670
It's an expression of her individuality.
And, Alex...

444
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,434
the same goes for you.

445
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:23,918
- Isn't that what you wore yesterday?
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:27,659
But the dance photos are today.
Did you at least shower?

447
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,061
- What about my ride?
- Heard of walking?

448
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,916
I'm your new neighbor Simon.
Could I have a ride?

449
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,919
Oh, sure, but hurry and get in...

450
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,921
'cause I'm trying to make a quick exit.

451
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,516
My sister and I are in a fight,
and, well, she's a little crazy.

452
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,078
All right. Hold it there. Good.

453
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:48,579
Good.

454
00:41:49,948 --> 00:41:52,940
Hold it and say "queen."

455
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:54,918
Queen!

456
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:58,218
Okay. Let's try that again.

457
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,919
And say "queen"!

458
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:04,087
Queen!

459
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:10,157
- And say "queen."
- Queen.

460
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,504
That'll have to do.

461
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,247
No way!

462
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:42,099
What do you want?

463
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:46,601
Are you up for that oral exam?

464
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:49,766
Whatever.

465
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,697
<i>Slide one.</i>
<i>Omega Nebula in Sagittarius.</i>

466
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,830
<i>Slide two. Omega Nebula.</i>

467
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:23,841
Define the Ptolemaic Universe.

468
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,507
You're the teacher.
You should know.

469
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,549
Hayley, that's enough.
Please define it.

470
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:36,079
I am drawing a blank.

471
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,089
How about another question?

472
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:42,686
All right.
Tell me what a comet is.

473
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:45,628
Now you're speaking my language.

474
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:50,894
It's an abrasive product used
to scrub away sink residue.

475
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:59,071
<i>Attention, all students.</i>
<i>All club dues must be paid by Friday...</i>

00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:01,942
<i>except chess club,</i>
<i>which has been canceled this year...</i>

477
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,642
<i>due to lack of interest.</i>

478
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:07,514
Aly, hey.

479
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:09,019
Hi.

480
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,289
You are so pretty, Aly.

481
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:14,621
Thanks.

482
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,786
I brought you something.

483
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,889
- You wrapped it yourself.
- I know it's not the best...

484
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,126
It's great.

485
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:32,076
Oh, I love it.

486
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:34,078
Why don't you blow off your friends
and come sit with me?

487
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:39,080
I just have to make an appearance.
I'll be there in a sec.

488
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:54,094
Smell much?

489
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,724
Ew!

490
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:58,736
Same ensemble, two days in a row?

491
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,999
Alex, that's violation
of rule number four.

492
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:06,010
- Don't tell me it's from Kyle.
- It's from Kyle.

493
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,138
Alex, that is totally unacceptable.

494
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,273
We signed these rules in blood.

495
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:16,117
Some of these rules are a little hard
for me to abide by. Sorry.

496
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:18,782
But they were your idea.

497
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:21,587
Well, my newest idea
is that we abolish them.

498
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:24,658
Very funny.

499
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:31,863
- Where is she going?
- What is she doing?

500
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:36,805
- It's so good to see you.
- Likewise.

501
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:40,675
But what's with your sister,
or should I say Madonna?

502
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,680
She's just trying to prove a point,
you know...

503
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:44,682
that she doesn't care
what people think of her.

504
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,308
Although I know she really does.

505
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:48,717
- Hi.
- I can't relate to her anymore.

506
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,848
I thought about it, and realized I fit
in better with you and your friends.

507
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:56,121
You got it all wrong, Caitlin.
Stay away from them.

508
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,873
<i>You walk the walk</i>

509
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,147
<i>You talk the talk</i>

510
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,847
<i>It makes me feel</i>

511
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:26,982
<i>So real</i>

512
00:46:27,926 --> 00:46:29,484
<i>The way you move</i>

513
00:46:30,796 --> 00:46:33,196
<i>The way you smile</i>

514
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:36,359
<i>It touches me</i>

515
00:46:36,435 --> 00:46:39,563
<i>Deep inside</i>

516
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:43,335
<i>You got me</i>

517
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,639
Oh, Kyle, you're such a good kisser.

518
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:49,943
Give me another hickey, baby!

519
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,781
<i>The things that you do</i>

520
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,514
- Check it out.
- Oh, my God!

521
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:59,921
<i>The things you do</i>

522
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,952
What do you think
your parents will do...

523
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,318
when they find out what a disgrace
the two of you are?

524
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,123
You can rest assured they'll be
in tomorrow to hear all about it.

525
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:42,831
I should have blown the whistle on you
when I caught you driving.

526
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:47,336
But this... such disrespect.

527
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:51,767
This is grounds for disqualification
from the science fair.

528
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:54,903
Who wants to be in a geek fest anyway?

529
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,848
Wait. It means everything
in the world to you.

530
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,080
Just give her another chance,
Ms. Mittermiller, please?

531
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:06,022
As for you, Alexia,
one more scene of misconduct...

532
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:09,521
and I'm going to suspend you.

533
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:11,528
How would that look
to the Felder panel?

534
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:15,157
Or for that matter,
to the festival voters?

535
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:18,298
Do it, and we'll find out.

536
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,362
But I've... I mean...

537
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,240
She's worked her entire life
on becoming queen.

538
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,471
And I've admired it so.

539
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:29,480
Don't do it, Ms. Mittermiller.

540
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,018
So who's gonna vote for you anyway?

541
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,715
The student body's opinion
of you both...

542
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,883
is on display
in the ladies' bathroom.

543
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,788
Follow me.

544
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,945
Clean it off if you want
to be admitted back to class.

545
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,548
I can't believe you would do that.

546
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:15,525
I've been working a year
on that project.

547
00:49:15,594 --> 00:49:18,392
If I could have,
I would have had you expelled too.

548
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,091
I mean, at first you come home
with a hickey on your neck.

549
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,260
Next, you're practically mauling
my boyfriend at the cafeteria.

550
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,860
What next, Hayley?

551
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:29,031
What, are you gonna lose
my virginity too?

552
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:33,842
You... You're a virgin?

553
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:36,107
Yes, I'm a virgin!

554
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,649
I have morals, Hayley!

555
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:42,244
You obviously don't know
very much about me.

556
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:48,088
Wow. I mean, Caitlin and I were sure
that you and Kyle were...

557
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,721
Well, I didn't do anything like that,
except kiss.

558
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,098
- A lot.
- You didn't?

559
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:00,899
I can't believe you actually thought
I would do that.

560
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,634
What am I supposed to think?

561
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:08,741
I'm sorry, Alex.
I'm really sorry.

562
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:13,943
Look, we'd better cut this out...

563
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,544
before we just destroy
each other's lives.

564
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:20,421
Okay? There's nothing more important
to me than going to Felder.

565
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:23,655
I just want a chance.
Please don't take that away from me.

566
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:25,958
I won't.

567
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:29,626
But you gotta get me out of this
and into the science fair.

568
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:31,634
Deal.

569
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:44,247
You deserve a lot of credit
for my brilliant accomplishments.

570
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:46,910
You're the finest teacher I ever had.

571
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:52,589
Please give me my spot back.

572
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:03,099
Let me start over.

573
00:51:03,168 --> 00:51:09,038
I've worked a year conceiving and
putting this project into practice...

574
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,598
Mr. Frauenfleder.

575
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:15,744
And I had high hopes for you...

576
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:20,945
but you've brought back
the memory of your sister.

577
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:25,217
That was an accident. Besides,
Alex wasn't that bad, was she?

578
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,724
What do you expect
from a girl like that?

579
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,556
That's a little harsh.

580
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,931
- Who did you come here to defend?
- Hay... Me.

581
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,136
Winning the science fair
and going to nationals would be...

582
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:42,002
the highlight of a lifetime.

583
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:44,371
I know I've made some mistakes,
but...

584
00:51:44,442 --> 00:51:46,569
please don't
take that away from me.

585
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:55,777
Truce?

586
00:51:55,854 --> 00:51:58,652
I've got a couple more conditions.

587
00:51:58,723 --> 00:52:01,920
Stop chewing that gum.
You're giving me cavities.

588
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,590
Wait. Hold on. One more thing.

589
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,158
I can't bear
to look at this any longer.

590
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:15,897
You're coming to the mall with me
to pick up my dress.

591
00:52:15,974 --> 00:52:17,942
I don't wanna let you
out of my sight.

592
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:21,678
- Can Kyle come?
- Fine.

593
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:25,113
Look, you can put your arms around him,
or you can hold his hand.

594
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,448
But no kissing, okay?
It's just not right.

595
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,454
- Truce?
- Truce.

596
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,731
- See you.
- Bye.

597
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:45,235
Bye.

598
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,804
Let's go home and make that wish.

599
00:52:58,483 --> 00:52:59,916
Yeah.

600
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:05,249
So what did my friends say
when they saw you...

601
00:53:05,323 --> 00:53:07,382
in the same outfit
two days in a row?

602
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:10,587
"Violation of rule four."

603
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:14,894
So I guess you heard
about the rules.

604
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:17,434
Yeah, that one,
the three-month max...

605
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,436
and no tuna at lunch?

606
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:24,966
What other bizarre restrictions
do they put on your life?

607
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:27,637
Well, let's see.

608
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:30,579
You have to shave
your legs every day.

609
00:53:30,648 --> 00:53:33,014
You have to read <i>Self</i>
cover to cover.

610
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,110
And you have to weigh in
every Friday.

611
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:38,587
Do you know that Talley has a scale
in her locker?

612
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,590
- You kidding?
- No.

613
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,057
I kind of suggested
you abolish the three-month max.

614
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,065
Yeah, that rule
needs to be amended.

615
00:53:50,335 --> 00:53:52,394
I really want to be with him.

616
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:55,138
I noticed.

617
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:01,970
At least I got to see how it feels
for someone to really like you.

618
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,675
A lot of guys really like you.

619
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:09,151
I mean, you as you.

620
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,620
You can get a boyfriend.

621
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:13,281
I mean...

622
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:16,193
you're cute.

623
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,731
It's just a matter
of having confidence.

624
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,000
You know, Talley told me
there are 910 boys in the student body.

625
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,734
911, if you count our new neighbor.

626
00:54:31,976 --> 00:54:34,240
- Simon?
- Yes, Simon.

627
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,507
I think you should go for it.

628
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,344
I'd be all tongue-tied.

629
00:54:41,419 --> 00:54:44,320
So forget about talking.
Go in for the kill.

630
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:48,689
You're an experienced kisser now.

631
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,331
What if...

632
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,541
What if we spent one more day
as each other?

633
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,544
Why would you want to do that?

634
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:11,548
Well, you could help convince
a few of my teachers...

635
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:13,550
that I'm not really an airhead.

636
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:17,782
And I'll show you how easy it is
for Hayley Wheaton to get a guy.

637
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,847
They will be lining up.

638
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:23,655
So, you would sacrifice your life
for one more day?

639
00:55:23,728 --> 00:55:25,218
Yeah, it'll be fun.

640
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:28,629
Ben, you were right.

641
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:32,770
Alex was mauling a boy...

642
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,863
Alex was mauling a boy...

643
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:39,433
while the little one danced seductively
on the cafeteria table...

644
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,205
miming sexual lyrics.

645
00:55:42,347 --> 00:55:44,474
And she was
dressed like a hooker.

646
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:49,980
It was quite the getup,
wasn't it?

647
00:55:51,055 --> 00:55:54,252
You saw it and you let her
out of the house?

648
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:59,023
Well, honey, you better explain
to Ms. Mittermiller...

649
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:01,031
what we're trying to accomplish.

650
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:04,701
We're trying to change
our parental strategy...

651
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,101
to a more hands-off method.

652
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:12,905
You see, we... we believe that
a child will fare better...

653
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:15,741
in a home that shuns
traditional discipline...

654
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:18,577
and learns from
his own experiences.

655
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:21,546
It seems to be...

656
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,713
It's been shaky
the first few days, but...

657
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:28,816
we're looking for
long-term results.

658
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:31,521
It's pretty innovative,
don't you think?

659
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:35,628
Eventually,
we plan to write a book.

660
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,134
Now, we do realize there are rules
and regulations...

661
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:40,136
here at the school,
but that's separate.

662
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:43,696
So just feel free to discipline
them however you feel is appropriate.

663
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,539
Just so long as the discipline doesn't
come from the parents...

664
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,545
we should be just fine.

665
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:51,441
It sounds extreme, but...

666
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:53,711
it seems to be working.

667
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,589
Well...

668
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:04,358
Thank you for taking time out
from your work to see me.

669
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:06,920
- It's been enlightening.
- You're welcome.

670
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:20,538
Those poor girls.

671
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,976
No wonder.

672
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:28,944
Up a little bit.

673
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:33,023
A little to the right.

674
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,649
A little bit more.

675
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:43,259
Test tomorrow.
Let's review.

676
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,699
Any volunteers?

677
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,436
Yoo-hoo.

678
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:59,973
Alexia, you think you can
learn to use the ladies' room...

679
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:02,019
before you come to class?

680
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:04,350
No. I wanna try it.
Please?

681
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:06,720
Try the problem?

682
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,315
You heard her.

683
00:58:17,568 --> 00:58:18,694
Okay, let's see.

684
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:24,040
A cleaning solution is made up
of three chemicals...

685
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:28,067
"A," " B" and "C."

686
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:30,080
So far, so good.

687
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:33,914
There are equal amounts
of"A" and " B"...

688
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:37,853
and four times as much "C"
as there is "A."

689
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:43,693
What percentage of the bottle
is full of"C"?

690
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:47,219
You think you can walk us
through this, Alexia?

691
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:51,496
Okay. " B" equals "A"
and "C" equals 4A.

692
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:56,438
Therefore, "A" plus "A"
plus 4A equals 6A.

693
00:58:56,507 --> 00:59:00,944
For your percentage,
it's 4A over 6A. The A's cross off.

694
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:03,913
Four-sixths is
converted to two-thirds.

695
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:07,712
Therefore,
your percentage is 66.6%.

696
00:59:15,993 --> 00:59:18,393
Okay. Okay.

697
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:21,227
Yeah. Anyone...
Anyone agree?

698
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,796
I definitely agree.

699
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,070
Pick it up. Come on, guys.
Speed. Let's go!

700
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,070
Okay, let's bring everybody in!

701
00:59:42,286 --> 00:59:44,049
And team!

702
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:48,115
Kyle, hold up a second.
I'm gonna start you.

703
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:50,183
Thanks a lot, Coach.

704
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,861
I was just studying
for a math test.

705
01:00:00,938 --> 01:00:02,872
- It's tomorrow.
- Guess what I'm doing tomorrow.

706
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,670
- I give up.
- I'm starting!

707
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:08,541
Coach said my game is stronger.
It's gonna be amazing!

708
01:00:08,613 --> 01:00:10,843
I'm gonna lead my team to victory.
You're gonna be crowned queen.

709
01:00:10,915 --> 01:00:14,112
We'll dance all night.
How does that sound?

710
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,988
Like someone else.

711
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:23,224
I mean, there's no guarantee that
it's all gonna work out, but...

712
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:25,319
it's cool to think about.

713
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,830
Well, listen...

714
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:36,201
I was gonna wait until the dance to tell
you, but I want you to know something.

715
01:00:36,274 --> 01:00:38,504
I'm... I'm sure it can wait.

716
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:43,080
- I love you, Aly.
- What?

717
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,281
I said I love you.

718
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:48,045
You shouldn't have
said that to me.

719
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:56,485
There's no pressure or anything.
You don't have to say anything back.

720
01:00:57,562 --> 01:01:00,759
But I... It was just something
that happened this week.

721
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,860
I gotta go home.
I gotta study.

722
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,370
Wait a minute.
That's it?

723
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:14,037
Listen, the next time that you say it,
you know, the " L" word...

724
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,409
if you decide
you still feel that way...

725
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,643
pretend like
it's the first time, okay?

726
01:01:32,196 --> 01:01:34,756
That was the first time.

727
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:36,766
That wasn't so great.

728
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:56,811
I was just wondering if maybe I could...
if I could have a ride.

729
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:57,819
Sure. Get in.

730
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:01,649
Here.

731
01:02:01,726 --> 01:02:03,353
Oh, so sweet!

732
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:08,194
- To thank you for driving me.
- Oh, Simon, that's so thoughtful.

733
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,359
Really, it's a pleasure
driving you home.

734
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:29,118
- I couldn't stop myself, Alexia.
- Look, Simon, I think you're great.

735
01:02:29,186 --> 01:02:33,282
- I think you're great too.
- You're just attracted to my looks.

736
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:34,949
It's not your looks.

737
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:39,093
I mean...
Well, no offense.

738
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:42,496
It's just that, physically,
you're not really my type.

739
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:44,500
At first, I thought
I had a crush on Hayley...

740
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:46,433
but now that
I'm getting to know you...

741
01:02:46,504 --> 01:02:50,497
I realize our personalities
are much more compatible.

742
01:02:50,574 --> 01:02:52,838
Hayley's too wild for me.

743
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:56,572
Wait. Back up.
You're talking about Hayley?

744
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,980
You think Hayley's attractive?

745
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:02,884
Well, it's what's inside
that really matters.

746
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:07,618
Look, Simon, I think you need to
get to know Hayley better.

747
01:03:07,692 --> 01:03:11,150
We're sisters, you know.
We're a lot more alike than you think.

748
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:29,675
I checked the forecast.

749
01:03:29,747 --> 01:03:32,272
Clear skies.
Perfect for stargazing.

750
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,442
Great.

751
01:03:33,517 --> 01:03:35,883
Could you come over here a second?
I need your help.

752
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:39,320
I still don't understand
this paint-mixing problem.

753
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,857
Really? Why?

754
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:43,860
I keep thinking about
those skanky painters next door.

755
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:48,120
Okay, well,
pretend it's not paint.

756
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,396
Say, instead, it's perfume.

757
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:53,403
- Chanel?
- Okay.

758
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,903
So a perfume bottle is filled
with three different fragrances...

759
01:04:00,978 --> 01:04:04,106
"A," " B" and "C."

760
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:06,710
So...

761
01:04:06,784 --> 01:04:09,412
So "X" equals...

762
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:11,455
Three hundred?

763
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,952
- I got it right?
- You got it right!

764
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:17,516
I'm so excited! I got it!

765
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:24,329
We should do this more often.

766
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:29,572
Honey.

767
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:35,034
What should we do?
Should we take 'em to bed ourselves?

768
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:39,913
It's not as if we're telling them to go
to bed. We're just putting them there.

769
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:43,118
It's perfectly harmless, right?

770
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:44,984
Okay. Good idea.

771
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:48,354
There we are, baby.

772
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:53,154
Good night, sweetheart.

773
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:14,208
Come on.

774
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:17,620
Where's the star?

775
01:05:30,534 --> 01:05:33,002
I wish I were Hayley Wheaton.

776
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:11,197
Morning.

777
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:16,770
Man, we picked a really bad night
to fall asleep early.

778
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,111
I'm making a protein shake
'cause we're gonna need...

779
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,617
a lot of extra energy
to pull this one off.

780
01:06:21,685 --> 01:06:24,381
I laid out an outfit
for you on my bed.

781
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:27,947
Please don't forget to bring down the
gown. You'll be presented at halftime.

782
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:32,428
My moment of glory
and you will get to experience it.

783
01:06:32,496 --> 01:06:37,263
By the way, there is a lovely picture
of you and the court in the paper.

784
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,563
I've been working
on your presentation...

785
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,668
and still, I don't understand
that whole distillation process thing.

786
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,648
Don't you have
anything to say?

787
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:55,877
Man, oh, man.

788
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,508
This is your life.

789
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:34,449
Okay, Hayley.
Let's get to school.

790
01:07:34,525 --> 01:07:38,461
Morning, Mom. Don't forget to drop
my dress off at school, okay?

791
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,463
Girls, we know this is
a big day for you both.

792
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:44,433
We just want you to know
that whatever happens happens.

793
01:07:45,202 --> 01:07:46,794
We know that.

794
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:52,608
Ready to write that book?

795
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:58,982
The college guidelines say that
they like to hear original responses.

796
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,348
So, Alexia...

797
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:06,879
we've noticed that your
grade point average is a 2.07.

798
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:11,519
Why do you want to go to Felder and
what makes you think we would admit you?

799
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:14,926
I'm not who you think I am?

800
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,331
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

801
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:24,897
<i>Remember, today is the day</i>
<i>to get your votes in for queen.</i>

802
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,206
<i>The ballot box</i>
<i>will be closed by 5:00 p.m.</i>

803
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,974
<i>The winners will be announced</i>
<i>tonight at the dance.</i>

804
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:33,642
During the distillation
the alcohol vapors...

805
01:08:33,717 --> 01:08:36,083
run through the coils
and condense...

806
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:38,212
Within the container...

807
01:08:38,288 --> 01:08:40,984
and come out the other end
of the coils...

808
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:42,958
and into the bowl.

809
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:47,464
I get it!
I actually get it.

810
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:49,965
Okay, so here are the note cards
just in case you get stuck.

811
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,730
Oh, please!
I'm gonna totally kick butt.

812
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:56,732
Aren't you Miss Know-it-all.

813
01:08:58,809 --> 01:09:00,242
What's your problem?

814
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,575
Nothing.

815
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:06,909
It was my project.
I wanted to present it.

816
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:10,553
I'm just doing my best.

817
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:14,580
Okay, if you win, you get to present it
at the nationals in DC.

818
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,683
I'm not counting on it.

819
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,921
Hey, it's the place to be
before the dance.

820
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:24,925
- This is Caitlin's house.
- Way to go, Caitlin!

821
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:29,371
No. Her parents would never,
never ever let her have an open party.

822
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:34,211
I never said an open party.
My parents will slaughter me.

823
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:39,080
I never said an open party.
My parents will slaughter me.

824
01:09:39,983 --> 01:09:44,249
Small price to pay when you consider
what it'll do for your social life.

825
01:09:48,025 --> 01:09:50,755
Hayley, didn't you say you need
to talk to Caitlin for a minute?

826
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:54,320
Yeah. Caitlin, can I
talk to you for a minute?

827
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:03,463
Let me get this straight.
She invited you for dinner...

828
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,600
and you proceeded to include
the rest of the student body?

829
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:08,144
Pretty crafty, huh?

830
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:11,740
What makes you think
you can treat people like this?

831
01:10:11,815 --> 01:10:13,783
We learned it from you.

832
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:17,014
Remember our motto, "Act superior,"
our number one rule?

833
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:21,189
Don't you guys ever get tired
of acting like snobs?

834
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,784
We're seniors.
We're supposed to live it up.

835
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:27,729
We have parties.
We use little weaklings like Caitlin.

836
01:10:27,798 --> 01:10:29,390
If you think it's acceptable
to treat...

837
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:32,924
a kind and generous person
like Caitlin like that...

838
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:35,301
then we have no business
being friends.

839
01:10:35,372 --> 01:10:37,670
And who else are you gonna hang
out with for the rest of the year?

840
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:39,140
Who cares?

841
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:42,201
It's cancelled.

842
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,611
We'll party at The Point instead.

843
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:47,616
Good. Now apologize to Caitlin.

844
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:51,312
She's a sophomore!
What do you expect from us?

845
01:10:53,056 --> 01:10:54,318
Nothing.

846
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:57,451
A decent gesture would be far
too dignified for the three of you.

847
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:01,129
You know, you looked hideous
in the newspaper.

848
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:03,758
See if we vote for you
for queen.

849
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,632
Guys, we already did.

850
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,983
- What?
- We need to talk.

851
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:27,717
- Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait.
- Wait.

852
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,316
I saw you groveling with some
other guy at your car yesterday.

853
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,261
- Were you spying on me?
- What difference does it make?

854
01:11:34,565 --> 01:11:37,090
Look, I just wanna end this
once and for all.

855
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,431
You were right the first time.

856
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:43,462
Three months is more than enough.
You know what else?

857
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,839
I didn't mean
what I said yesterday.

858
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,935
Love is a reciprocal thing.

859
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:51,173
It's not just one-sided.

860
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:28,579
No, go back in!
Go back in!

861
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:30,085
Oh, gosh!

862
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:34,255
Note cards.

863
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:52,137
Any time, Hayley.

864
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,401
Do you have a role model, Alexia?

865
01:12:57,781 --> 01:13:01,012
My younger sister.

866
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:04,784
She believes in me.

867
01:13:10,627 --> 01:13:12,652
I don't know
what goes on at your homes...

868
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:16,165
but I have a sister
who is incredibly wasteful.

869
01:13:16,233 --> 01:13:20,533
If she bites into an apple that's
a little mealy, she throws it away.

870
01:13:22,372 --> 01:13:25,535
By combining things
like rejected apples along...

871
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,703
with sugar and yeast
and converting...

872
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,510
the substance into alcohol
with a homemade pressure cooker...

873
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:35,016
it produces a grade
of ethyl alcohol...

874
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:38,020
that meets many of
my household energy needs.

875
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:42,320
That is, if I could convince my parents
into reading by lantern light.

876
01:13:58,408 --> 01:14:02,003
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>if I could have your attention, please.</i>

877
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:04,013
<i>Hunter High School</i>
<i>is proud to present...</i>

878
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:07,744
<i>the finalists for</i>
<i>this year's Winter Festival.</i>

879
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,878
<i>And here they are,</i>
<i>the beautiful, the talented...</i>

880
01:14:10,954 --> 01:14:13,752
<i>Jennifer Hatfield,</i>
<i>Laura Simms...</i>

881
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,554
<i>Nikki Snow,</i>
<i>Danielle Swanson...</i>

882
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:18,355
<i>and Alexia Wheaton.</i>

883
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:38,677
Come on.
We've got things to do.

884
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:22,987
What are you doing in here?
I've been looking all over for you.

885
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,528
Wow. Look at you.

886
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:28,063
It's a thank-you present.
I knew you loved the dress.

887
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:30,099
But check these out.

888
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:33,900
Red shoes to match.

889
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,336
Caitlin talked me into them.
Megabucks.

890
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:38,670
So, what do you think?

891
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:43,977
Do you like it?

892
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:46,311
Of course I do.

893
01:15:46,383 --> 01:15:50,012
It's a reflection
of my fashion sense.

894
01:15:50,687 --> 01:15:52,621
Could you live
your life like that?

895
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:55,954
Sure, but that's irrelevant.
We're gonna switch back.

896
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:05,760
It's irreversible.
We can't switch back.

897
01:16:06,837 --> 01:16:09,271
Of course we can.

898
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:10,533
No, we can't.

899
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:12,473
Why?

900
01:16:14,711 --> 01:16:18,272
Last night when you were asleep,
I made the wish.

901
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:26,983
Look at me.

902
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,788
I'm still you...

903
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:32,795
and you're still me.

904
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,803
Hayley, come here.
Come sit down.

905
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,744
I saw the...

906
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,483
the same shooting star
when I was with Kyle.

907
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:03,423
I made a wish too.

908
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,524
A wish?

909
01:17:10,634 --> 01:17:12,568
I made a wish that I was you.

910
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,700
Why would you wish that?

911
01:17:21,244 --> 01:17:23,439
There I was...

912
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:26,243
this C-minus student...

913
01:17:26,316 --> 01:17:28,807
about to break up
with my boyfriend over...

914
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:31,183
over some self-imposed rule.

915
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,782
I felt totally bored with myself...

916
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,623
and my friends and everything.

917
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:43,428
I realized that I didn't have much
of a shot at getting into college...

918
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,762
and...

919
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:48,633
I look up on the balcony
and I see...

920
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,866
I see my brainy,
adventurous little sister...

921
01:17:52,642 --> 01:17:56,703
with all these interests,
like conserving energy...

922
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,214
and listening
to that awful music.

923
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:06,187
And I knew you would never
make the same mistakes I made.

924
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:10,317
And I just, I wondered what it would
be like to be Hayley Wheaton...

925
01:18:10,393 --> 01:18:12,520
and then I saw the star.

926
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,732
Why were you so mad
when we switched places?

927
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:26,231
First of all, I wasn't about to admit
that I wanted to be you.

928
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:30,837
And I mean, I panicked. I never actually
thought that it would happen.

929
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:36,085
I guess we made the same wish
at the very same time.

930
01:18:38,788 --> 01:18:40,551
That's why it didn't work.

931
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:44,117
What are we waiting for?

932
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:53,200
- I must have messed up my mascara.
- No, you're okay.

933
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,262
I'm just the person to fix it.
There you go.

934
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,137
You watch that half,
I'll watch this one.

935
01:19:01,211 --> 01:19:04,840
Oh, you must be dying
to know about the science fair.

936
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:06,973
The results won't be
posted till tomorrow...

937
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:10,611
but I gave
a spectacular presentation.

938
01:19:10,687 --> 01:19:13,781
Maybe I'll be a science major
if I get into Felder.

939
01:19:13,857 --> 01:19:15,791
You will, Alex.

940
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:19,192
That is, if you can pull off
the 3.0 I promised them this semester.

941
01:19:19,262 --> 01:19:21,127
Hayley, look.
Right there!

942
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,132
Ready?

943
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:29,802
- <i>I wish I were Hayley Wheaton.</i>
- <i>I wish I were Alexia Wheaton.</i>

944
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:00,060
It worked!

945
01:20:00,136 --> 01:20:03,264
Oh, my gosh! I'm home!

946
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,308
How do you feel?

947
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,808
Tall.

948
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:13,278
How am I ever gonna
keep this neat?

949
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,284
You'll get used to it.

950
01:20:16,753 --> 01:20:19,085
I'll help you.

951
01:20:19,155 --> 01:20:20,952
Come on!

952
01:20:42,846 --> 01:20:46,441
<i>On a train</i>
<i>headin'east of here</i>

953
01:20:46,516 --> 01:20:49,349
<i>Where I'll end up</i>
<i>I'm not quite clear</i>

954
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,744
<i>But I can't help myself</i>

955
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:53,789
<i>I must be settling down</i>

956
01:20:53,857 --> 01:20:56,849
<i>Until they stop this thing</i>
<i>I'll get around</i>

957
01:20:56,926 --> 01:21:00,418
<i>When I hear</i>
<i>it's been done before</i>

958
01:21:00,497 --> 01:21:03,796
<i>And I hear</i>
<i>it's a simple thing</i>

959
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:07,769
<i>Then I hear</i>
<i>it's quite difficult</i>

960
01:21:07,837 --> 01:21:10,704
<i>And I hear</i>

961
01:21:10,774 --> 01:21:12,571
<i>Almost everything</i>

962
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:24,846
<i>Pass through deserts</i>
<i>and mountain streams</i>

963
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:28,379
<i>Outside my window</i>
<i>the scene's serene</i>

964
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:32,053
<i>The day I find myself</i>
<i>I'll be so very proud</i>

965
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:34,995
<i>But I will not get</i>
<i>passed up in the crowd</i>

966
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:38,693
<i>When I hear</i>
<i>it's been done before</i>

967
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:42,067
<i>And I hear</i>
<i>it's a simple thing</i>

968
01:21:42,138 --> 01:21:44,868
I'm gonna go find Simon, okay?

969
01:21:49,746 --> 01:21:52,476
Hey, Hayley!
Hey, you wanna dance?

970
01:21:52,549 --> 01:21:54,642
Hayley, yeah! That's me!

971
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:57,208
- Maybe later.
- All right.

972
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:05,051
Killer dress!

973
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:08,120
Hey, look,
here's the deal, Alex.

974
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:11,167
We forget about all the rules,
except for number nine.

975
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:12,428
Number nine?

976
01:22:12,502 --> 01:22:15,062
The one that says that
we'll be friends forever.

977
01:22:16,406 --> 01:22:18,306
Thanks, you guys.

978
01:22:18,374 --> 01:22:20,069
I'll see you later, okay?

979
01:22:21,911 --> 01:22:23,936
<i>Now I'm not trying</i>
<i>to cut anyone down</i>

980
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:26,743
<i>But I know it's been</i>
<i>going on too long</i>

981
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:31,176
<i>Simply doin' what you feel</i>

982
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:34,553
<i>Is the best way</i>
<i>not to go wrong</i>

983
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,854
Just give me
one more chance, please?

984
01:22:38,061 --> 01:22:40,689
What about that other guy
I saw you with?

985
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:41,695
Other guy?

986
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:47,526
Kyle, you got it all wrong.
There's only one guy for me.

987
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:50,701
I love you.

988
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:08,984
I love you too, Aly.

989
01:23:16,799 --> 01:23:20,098
<i>And I hear</i>

990
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:22,000
<i>Almost everything</i>

991
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:27,910
<i>Almost every, every, every</i>
<i>every, every, every, every</i>

992
01:23:27,977 --> 01:23:32,437
<i>Every, every, everything</i>

993
01:23:40,356 --> 01:23:44,122
Hey, everybody, I'd like to congratulate
the Vikings on their victory.

994
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,125
All right!

995
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:51,524
Also, I would like
to take this time...

996
01:23:51,601 --> 01:23:56,038
to announce this year's
Winter Festival Queen of Hunter High.

997
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,875
And the winner is...

998
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:02,167
Alexia Wheaton!

999
01:24:08,885 --> 01:24:09,817
Not now.

1000
01:24:09,886 --> 01:24:12,446
But you've just won!
You've just won!

1001
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,025
Go!

1002
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:47,319
<i>I believe in heaven and know</i>

1003
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:54,152
Look, Simon, I know
you haven't gotten...

1004
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:56,698
the best impression
of me so far.

1005
01:24:56,766 --> 01:24:59,963
So, let's start over.

1006
01:25:01,704 --> 01:25:06,073
<i>Surely I should see it all</i>

1007
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,736
Alex did say I should
get to know you better.

1008
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:15,042
<i>So take care</i>
<i>and don't go too far</i>

1009
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:17,780
<i>I will miss your soul</i>

1010
01:25:18,621 --> 01:25:22,352
<i>And when the distance grows</i>
<i>and the nights are long</i>

1011
01:25:22,425 --> 01:25:27,055
<i>And you're scared at times</i>
<i>and you wonder why</i>

1012
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:30,065
<i>Take care and don't go too far</i>

1013
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:33,967
<i>I will miss your soul</i>

1014
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:51,720
<i>So take care</i>
<i>and don't go too far</i>

1015
01:25:51,788 --> 01:25:54,882
<i>I will miss your soul</i>

1016
01:25:54,957 --> 01:25:59,291
<i>And when the distance grows</i>
<i>and the nights are long</i>

1017
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:03,264
<i>And you're scared at times</i>
<i>and you wonder why</i>

1018
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:06,768
<i>Take care and don't go too far</i>

1019
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:11,000
<i>The road back home</i>
<i>is shorter than you know</i>

1020
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
