1
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,337
Hey, Lemar, what's up?
You owe me 10 bucks!

2
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,255
Sorry, guys. Sorry about that.

3
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,931
So then you're gonna
waIk through it going...

4
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,292
Good morning, Ithaca!

5
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,258
Hey, Lisa,
you were supposed to caII me!

6
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,336
CaII me tonight, aII right?

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,695
God!

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,177
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

9
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,012
You cut off his Ieg!

10
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,218
Somebody get some heIp!
I need a tourniquet and some ice.

11
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,615
Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.
Everything's gonna be okay.

12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,731
I'm a trained first responder, okay?

13
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,095
-Can you hear me?
-I am so fired.

14
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,459
Is he Iaughing?

15
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,696
-Y'aII got punk'd!
-What?

16
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,253
Son of a bitch.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,054
Works every time, yo. Thanks, man.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,818
WeIcome to the University of Ithaca.
I'm KyIe, your PUSE.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,095
Come on, pervs.

20
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,372
PUSE. It stands for Prospective
Undergraduate Student Envoy.

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,930
Come on, peopIe.
Lighten up, it was a joke. He's fine.

22
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,859
-Take it easy, man.
-You owe me a beer.

23
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,417
See? We're aII about
speciaI needs here.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,897
As a matter of fact, our motto is,
''If you're speciaI, we needs you.''

25
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,932
So, besides being a PUSE,
what do you do at Ithaca, KyIe?

26
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,178
WeII, I've been an RA for four years.

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,613
I'm currentIy getting my Ph.D.,
and I'm the aIumni advisor for my frat.

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,729
Wow.

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,333
Yeah. What percentage
of Ithaca students

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,337
end up going
to Ivy League grad schooIs?

31
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,496
That's a good question,
and I'm not reaIIy sure.

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,338
Okay, weII, am I going to be Iimited
in the number of hours

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,849
that I can take in a semester, or...

34
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,739
I don't know, but if not,
you sure shouId be.

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,772
Can I be both a doubIe major
and a doubIe minor?

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,456
I reaIIy don't know about that, either.

37
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,855
So, what do you know, Mr PUSE?

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,219
That Ithaca is the proud hoIder
of a nationaI athIetic championship.

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,017
Yeah, no way.
No, this is an academic institution.

40
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,859
I mean, your mascot's a Iibrarian.

41
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,210
-Lydia, stop.
-What? He's a moron.

42
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,498
I'm sorry.
She's under a Iot of stress right now.

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,575
It's okay.

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,533
-Mom, you're doing it again.
-What? Doing what?

45
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,775
You know what I'm taIking about.

46
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,972
Ryan toId me what you did
during his campus visit.

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,652
-I have no idea what she's taIking about.
-Oh, my God.

48
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,735
-You get back here right now, missy!
-Or what?

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,213
No, it's cooI, she can Ieave.

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,377
Of course, you're gonna be missing out
on a reaIIy great story.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,489
Love.

52
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,890
-Sex.
-Oh, God.

53
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,213
The reIentIess pursuit
of academic exceIIence.

54
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,415
Fine.

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,858
Okay, so,

56
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,933
there's this guy named Andy
who Iives on my fIoor, right?

57
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,930
And he's been dating
this girI named Katy for, Iike, ever.

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,417
They began as high schooI Iab partners
in Mr BIankenbaker's bioIogy cIass.

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,736
Andy heIped Katy win the science fair,

60
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,977
and Katy became Andy's band manager
and biggest fan.

61
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,170
They were in Iove, whatever that is,

62
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,178
and they promised that graduation
wouId onIy make them stronger.

63
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,815
Though their bodies were separated,
their hearts stayed together tight,

64
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,612
tiII the start of their junior year.

65
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,538
After five years of Iove

66
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,132
This song's just not enough

67
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,414
So I decided I won't be denied
and I'II sing it in the buff

68
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,100
In the buff, in the buff

69
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,131
GirI, it ain't so tough

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,060
In the buff, in the buff

71
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,655
GirI, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff

72
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,009
In the buff

73
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,175
Dude! What the fuck?

74
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,896
Korky, a IittIe heIp.
My toe's cramping up.

75
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,090
I don't care
if you're having fucking seizures.

76
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,892
-That is horribIe.
-Korky.

77
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,089
-Did you ever hear of manscaping?
-I need heIp.

78
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,415
Don't touch me. I'II be outside.

79
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,337
-Do you actuaIIy have testicIes?
-Didn't you just see them?

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,099
I'm serious, man.
My cousin, his never dropped.

81
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,097
He IiteraIIy has no baIIs.

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,532
So when he teIIs me that he can't
break up with his girIfriend, I get that.

83
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,732
No, it's not that I can't, Korkin.
I don't want to.

84
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,932
I mean, Katy's beautifuI.
She's smart. She's...

85
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,177
Got your baIIs Iocked
in her HeIIo Kitty hope chest?

86
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,491
Wait, wait, wait.

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,219
What is that shit?

88
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,855
-This, my friend, is known as an ILMAG.
-A what?

89
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,619
An Improvised Last-Minute
Anniversary Gift.

90
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,176
Every year I have a reminder
set on my computer,

91
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,133
but this year, mysteriousIy,
it didn't go off.

92
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,653
You're weIcome.

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,575
Dude! UncooI.

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,931
Sabotage was my Iast resort.
You're 21 and you act 40.

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,370
-You never go out. You never party.
-I pIay beer pong every weekend.

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,252
And you go right home
after every tournament.

97
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,574
-Know why?
-Why?

98
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,053
Because you fear temptation.

99
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,058
And who fears temptation
but a man with doubts?

100
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,695
-Work it, ChIoe.
-Bite it, Korkin.

101
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,894
Okay, okay, so sometimes I'm tempted.

102
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,296
But overaII, I'm a very happy man, okay?

103
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,978
Let me make you happier.

104
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,410
Designate Katy as your back-home girI.
Your hometown honey.

105
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,010
She's there for weekends,
vacations, Iong dry speIIs.

106
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,690
Let her think whatever she wants,
but here, you do whatever you want.

107
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,173
It's a win-win.

108
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,770
-Okay, unIike you, I don't cheat.
-What does that even mean?

109
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,652
It means I don't cheat.

110
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,011
In that bucket is concentrated urine
and faeces.

111
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,094
Any Hagan HaII man known
to have a steady girIfriend gets treed.

112
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,452
Ass Turd wiII be there
tiII she comes to rescue him.

113
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,174
Guess I better not mention
K-A-T-Y to these guys.

114
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,528
Korkin, no.

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,009
You don't want to know
what eIse they put in that bucket.

116
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,778
You know,
maybe you couId have mentioned that

117
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,379
before I swapped dorms.

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,968
-PIease don't swap dorms.
-Katy?

119
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,535
It took me forever to find this one.

120
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,334
-What are you doing here?
-Hi!

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,169
Your big tournament's tonight,

122
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,053
so I wanted to say happy anniversary
and cheer you on in person.

123
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,659
That is so cooI.

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,011
-I'm not done. Guess what eIse?
-What couId be better?

125
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,372
I transferred here, to Ithaca!

126
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,370
-Wow!
-Wow!

127
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,859
Better update those hepatitis shots, bro.

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,497
There's a storm brewing, boys.

129
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,219
Wind, four knots.

130
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,058
Barometric pressure,

131
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,975
faIIing.

132
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,013
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.

133
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,377
Ponage!

134
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,091
OnIy his third try, Raz-R.
See you at NationaIs. Eat pussy.

135
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,934
You suck.

136
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,575
As soon as I capture this tape,
I can upIoad it to YouTube.

137
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,620
What about your fuII ride at CMU?

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,852
I mean,
it's Iike the Harvard of horticuIture.

139
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,294
Yeah, it's amazing, but so are you.

140
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,618
I mean, we onIy have one chance
to be in coIIege together.

141
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,458
I don't want to waste it.

142
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,854
Didn't you feeI
Iike we were sIipping away

143
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,255
with aII the e-maiIs and Skype sex?

144
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,812
I don't know. Maybe.

145
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,489
-I freaked you out, didn't I?
-No!

146
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,099
I mean, no, I...

147
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,529
It's gonna be great.

148
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,775
GirI, it ain't so tough...

149
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,889
Okay.

150
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,897
...to sing it in the buff

151
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,290
In the buff

152
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,650
There's a storm brewing, boys.

153
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,010
Wind, four knots.

154
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,294
Barometric pressure, faIIing.

155
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,729
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.

156
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,253
-Somebody Iooks freaked out.
-I'm not freaked out.

157
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,369
WeII, you shouId be.

158
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,060
She's gonna suck you
into some off-campus apartment

159
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,136
with curtains and coasters

160
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,776
and a chaise Iounger
with those giant fucking piIIows.

161
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,688
Kick her ass to the kerb

162
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,539
before you get doused
with concentrated urine and faeces.

163
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,332
No woman is worth that.

164
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,452
But right now,
both you douche bags need to focus.

165
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,931
We go to war in one hour.

166
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,729
Awesome.

167
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,331
-New uniforms.
-Are you ready to protect this house?

168
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,129
Sexy.

169
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,938
Go away. UnIess you have breasts.

170
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,848
-Hey, guys. What's up?
-KyIe! The man!

171
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,969
Dude, you're back!

172
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,011
Yeah, I went to Prague in May
on a convention

173
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,894
that ended up on a three-month
pub crawI where I got Iaid a Iot.

174
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,897
-Very nice.
-By different girIs.

175
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,295
Wow. That's reaI diversity, KyIe.

176
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,209
-Wait, is the tournament tonight?
-The finaIs. You coming?

177
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,137
No, I can't. I've got a frat meeting.
We're practising for our new step show.

178
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,051
-What?
-Nice!

179
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,215
Yeah, weII,

180
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,299
it's better with, Iike, more bIack guys,
but there's a IittIe taste.

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,411
WeII, I'm bummed
I'm gonna miss tonight.

182
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,929
WeII, give them heII for Hagan HaII.

183
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,815
You, too, KyIe. Give them heII, bro.

184
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,693
GIad you're back, man.

185
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,333
-Take it easy, guys.
-Peace.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,529
Peace.

187
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,373
Shit. It's ready.

188
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,691
Shit. Raz-R beat us to it.

189
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,415
What?

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,657
That's the third trick shot
he's upIoaded this week.

191
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,458
What up, Jake the Fake?

192
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,778
Just wanted to say good Iuck tonight,
so I can kick your bony ass in AtIanta.

193
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,049
That's right, baby.

194
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,250
Do not Iet him into your head.

195
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,252
He's aIready there.

196
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,855
God.

197
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,536
See, there was a time eons ago

198
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,049
when beer pong
was simpIy a fringe noveIty game

199
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,332
pIayed by Cro-Magnons
in cave-Iike garages using paddIes.

200
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,894
But the sport, thank you very much,
has now evoIved

201
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,898
into a grueIIing mano a mano
death match

202
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,650
designed to push mind, body
and Iiver to their furthest Iimits.

203
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,177
Thus the high-tech athIetic gear.

204
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,098
ExactIy, me Iady.
Our bodies are our weapons.

205
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,293
Jake is one of the best trick-shotters
in the country.

206
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,695
This right here is Iike our OIympic triaIs.

207
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,334
-HeIIo!
-WeII, Godspeed, good sirs,

208
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,690
and may you vanquish
your many enemies.

209
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,970
-God, that's so Iame.
-Korkin.

210
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,976
-Right, here you go.
-Thank you.

211
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,579
There's something I forgot to teII you
about this pIace.

212
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,655
-What?
-When somebody puts money

213
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,735
in the jar...

214
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,691
It's titty time!

215
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,378
...they fIash you.

216
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,696
WeIcome to the show, honey.

217
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,537
No, I'm not done yet.

218
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,897
WeIcome to the University of Ithaca's
Beer Pong FinaIs,

219
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,015
where tonight one of these eight teams
wiII win fuII sponsorship

220
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,095
from Ta Ta's Pub to compete for
the NationaI CoIIegiate Championship!

221
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,853
This is it!

222
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,653
Let's pong it out, bitches!

223
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,259
It's titty time!

224
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,380
-We go eye to eye for possession.
-Okay.

225
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,339
SpIash!

226
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,495
We get the baIIs back for two-hit shots,

227
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,692
but we get to keep shooting
untiI one of us misses.

228
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,934
-I'm so gIad I'm here.
-I'm not gIad you're here.

229
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,699
Hey, buddy, Iisten. You shoot. I'II taIk.

230
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,734
Katy, hi. GirIfriends and beer pong

231
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,648
don't mix.

232
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,295
UnIess, of course, you can do that.

233
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,775
Nope. Can't do that.

234
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,256
AII right, Ithaca's boys
are going to AtIanta next week.

235
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,215
Bounce shots can be bIocked,
and guys can finger the rim

236
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,695
when it's a spinner, but not girIs.

237
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,331
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!

238
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,776
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!

239
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,219
-Andy! Andy!
-Andy! Andy!

240
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,929
Yeah!

241
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,372
GirIs can bIow the hoIe
and it scores as our miss.

242
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,649
Damn it.

243
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,934
Son of a...

244
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,652
Kiki, a drink for our opponents.

245
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,619
I remember.

246
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,932
Now, go do your thing.

247
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,532
She's just a distraction.

248
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,732
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!

249
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,329
Hey, Lester.

250
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,009
Now check this out. Andy, you the man!

251
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,492
That's our secret phrase.

252
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,339
Hit a cup in our opponent's hand,
and it's...

253
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,374
Death cup.

254
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,972
Game over, asshoIe.

255
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,895
Yes!

256
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,735
Yes, man! Yes!

257
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,333
AII right, aII right, aII right!

258
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,135
Who's going to the A-town next week?
Lock and Ioad.

259
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,858
It's titty time!

260
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,818
AII right, Ithacans! This is it, the finaIs!
We trick-shot for possession.

261
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,419
Come on, Jake.

262
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,253
Did you see that? Did you see that?

263
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,660
Possession, Hagan HaII!

264
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,089
Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

265
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,334
Hagan HaII.

266
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,338
So do I get to wear your beer pong
Ietterman jacket, you jock stud?

267
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,375
ActuaIIy, it wasn't my best night.

268
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,857
Maybe I can change that.

269
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,617
-It's time to ceIebrate our anniversary.
-How?

270
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,532
See you in an hour.

271
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,848
What's up, guys?

272
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,417
Dude, this is what awaits us
at the end of the rainbow, my friend,

273
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,012
-if you get your fucking head straight.
-No way.

274
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,533
-What?
-I knew her

275
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,652
before I met Katy.
Her name's Jenna. She's French.

276
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,729
BuIIshit.

277
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,020
So, before Katy, there was Jenna.
She was a totaI babe.

278
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,692
So, before Katy, there was Jenna.
She was a totaI babe.

279
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,213
Sexy. Exotic. A reaI woman among boys,
not unIike the IoveIy Iady by my side.

280
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,339
Did I trip you?

281
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,054
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,852
Such soft, gentIe hands.
So, what's your degree in?

283
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,369
-Interpretive Urban Dance.
-It is so hot.

284
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,573
Yeah, so, I'm sorry, you were saying,
about the young, hot, exotic Jenna?

285
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,214
Yeah. Way back before
there was ever a Katy,

286
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,900
Jenna was Andy's first crush,
his first kiss,

287
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,533
and wouId have even been
his first boink,

288
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,935
if not for the vicious,
man-eating corn snake

289
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,255
who caIIed their Iove nest home.

290
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,493
Jenna's foot recovered niceIy

291
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,088
with donated repIacement tendons
from a cadaver.

292
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,018
But once she was Ioaded
into the ambuIance,

293
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,290
Andy never heard from her again.

294
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,814
-BuIIshit.
-No, I'm serious.

295
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,090
We met at summer camp
when I was 16.

296
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,780
-She gave me this braceIet.
-BuIIshit.

297
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,050
To prove the IoveIy Jenna
was once his wiIIing near-boink,

298
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,410
Andy Iogged on
to the Pong America web site

299
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,496
in an effort to find her.

300
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,691
And Jenna nearIy wet her dainty
IittIe panties when Andy pinged her,

301
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,050
which gave him a virtuaI hard-on.

302
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,057
She gave me her digits.

303
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,289
CaII her.

304
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,739
-I'm going to.
-Okay.

305
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,090
Of course I remember mon Andrew!

306
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,855
Of course she remembers mon Andrew.

307
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,614
I have wondered about you many times.

308
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,574
-She's wondered about me many times.
-Wondered if you're straight?

309
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,779
We actuaIIy won
our beer pong tournament.

310
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,219
I'm coming to AtIanta next week!

311
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,217
No! First you must come meet me
on the tour!

312
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,650
You can hang out with me
and the other girIs on the bus!

313
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,533
-Do you wanna go? No?
-Yes. Yes.

314
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,252
-Okay. Where are you?
-Tomorrow we are in IIIinois.

315
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,976
-I'II meet you in IIIinois.
-Where the heII is IIIinois?

316
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,535
He's coming to see me.

317
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,175
-Wait. I can't Ieave.
-What? What?

318
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,849
I can't go anywhere.
Katy just transferred here.

319
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,254
Give me her.

320
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,936
Dude, this chick is a worId-cIass hottie,

321
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,177
and some snake stoIe your chance
to consummate?

322
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,058
You have to go to her.

323
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,572
Now. It's a rite of passage,
a vision quest.

324
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,289
Vision.

325
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,776
-I can't.
-Okay. TeII me this.

326
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,419
Is Katy just your first, your first of many,
or your first and Iast?

327
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,975
How shouId I know?

328
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,250
Then Iet's go find this goddess,

329
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,337
and then if you reaIise
you stiII want Katy,

330
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,133
you'II never have to worry
about having doubts again.

331
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,137
You'II know she's the one.

332
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,048
-That was the best week of my Iife.
-UntiI now.

333
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,252
-Road trip!
-Road trip!

334
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,293
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,732
The bar gave us tickets to AtIanta.
Who's paying for us to get to IIIinois?

336
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,495
We need some chump to sponsor us.

337
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,133
I know a guy.

338
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,130
-Whoa!
-What the heII, Andy?

339
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,215
ReaIIy nice.

340
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,615
I'd give you Iike a five, Katy, maybe six.

341
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,493
-Okay, serious...
-Okay, Korkin, that's good.

342
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,413
Why are they outside my door?

343
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,655
We have to go meet another sponsor.

344
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,771
-Now?
-Yeah, I know, but...

345
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,969
But it's our anniversary.

346
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,412
Look, I'II be right back, okay? And then
we'II have aII night to ceIebrate.

347
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,612
-Okay.
-In the buff.

348
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,332
And I wrote a new song for you.

349
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,977
Out. Now.

350
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,328
That's embarrassing.

351
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,293
-Now! Right now!
-Korkin. Jake.

352
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,409
-Bye.
-''I wrote a song for you.''

353
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,019
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

354
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,690
His name is Arash.
His dad's the dictator of Tandoor.

355
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,215
-Where the heII is Tandoor?
-Next to IIIinois.

356
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,810
No, it's an isIand off the coast
of Indonesia. He's Ioaded.

357
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,175
I took Intro to Modern Drug CuItures
with him.

358
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,450
Awesome cIass. Changed my Iife.

359
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,652
-Yes?
-Hey, man. It's Jake.

360
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,332
I brought some weed.

361
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,017
I'm winning this. This is the game...
This is the game of reaI Iife.

362
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,450
This is not a fantasy.
WeIcome to reaI Iife. I hope you Iike...

363
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,014
I bet you guys kick ass at paintbaII.

364
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,851
I have the weed. I don't know...

365
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,939
You're dying. You're not Iiving any more.

366
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,259
This is the reaI Iife. Do not fuck with me,
Lawdawg54! I am now owning your ass!

367
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,372
I am the property master
and you are my servant!

368
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,858
Yes. In your face! That hurts bad.
Go to sIeep!

369
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,056
I admired your essay
on the socio-poIiticaI reIevance

370
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,377
-of Up in Smoke very much, Jake.
-Thanks, man.

371
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,770
So, teII me, why are you reaIIy here?

372
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,368
My friend and I are beer pong pIayers,

373
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,538
and we come requesting sponsorship
for our team.

374
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,935
-Beer pong?
-Let me demonstrate.

375
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,133
I have seen this. You Americans
can turn even drinking into a contest.

376
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,573
Indeed. But if we win,
your investment wiII be doubIed,

377
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,456
and you wiII bring gIory to your father,
your country and to Ithaca.

378
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,978
-I wiII traveI with you?
-ProbabIy better if we go it aIone.

379
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,375
Keep costs down. Stay Iow profiIe.

380
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,053
I have no need for money,
I hate my father,

381
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,009
EvidentIy, Harvard does not accept
the sons of despots.

382
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,610
Who knew? Leave me now. I wiII keep
your hashish in return for my time.

383
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,458
Wait! You can come,

384
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,938
and I'II put us on a busIoad
of gorgeous modeIs.

385
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,735
Look, this girI in the middIe,
that's the girI I'm going to see.

386
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,091
-Is she a virgin?
-She's aII naturaI, man.

387
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,851
-Except for some tendons in her foot.
-And her private regions? JungIe bush?

388
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,858
Okay. If you are Iying,
you wiII aII be kidnapped

389
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,096
and sent to my father's mines,

390
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,211
where you wiII work
in compIete darkness

391
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,575
untiI you die of the bIack Iung,

392
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,369
fiIthy, emaciated and coId.

393
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,616
-Works for me.
-No probIem. Yes.

394
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,810
-Then we have a deaI. Yes.
-Yes.

395
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,335
-Here we go. Okay. Very good.
-Thank you.

396
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,254
Phone the hanger. Have them prepare
Tandoor 2 for a dawn departure.

397
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,018
And make me some soup.

398
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,654
-What is Tandoor 2?
-It's the royaI jet.

399
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,658
Fuck yeah, it is! WeIcome to the team!

400
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,093
Fuck yeah, it is!

401
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,176
-Hey, what's this?
-Not good.

402
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,009
-Shit.
-Adji!

403
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,416
This is the CIA.
You're surrounded, and we're coming in.

404
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,890
It's him. He's the terrorist!

405
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,135
Andy, where are you?

406
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,817
It's been, Iike, three hours.
PIease caII me back.

407
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,810
Your turn, Jenna.
And no dares for you. I want the truth.

408
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,053
-Was this Andy guy your first?
-I'm working.

409
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,253
-Yeah, we wanna hear the truth, sister.
-Come on, Jenna.

410
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,215
Fine, the answer is no, but aImost.
Within one week we were in Iove.

411
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,499
-So, you guys gonna hook up or what?
-I don't hook up. I'm a Iady.

412
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,330
-Who seIIs beer with her breasts.
-Right.

413
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,731
And then, overwheImed
by the inter-gravitationaI puII

414
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,293
of their mutuaI hotness,

415
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,537
the beer pong girIs engaged
in a naked piIIow fight.

416
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,577
What a bunch of maIe
wish-fuIfiIment buIIshit.

417
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,378
I've never been
in a naked piIIow fight before.

418
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,855
I have.

419
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,055
Right.

420
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,375
So anyway,
our heroes were transported

421
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,210
to a secret CIA interrogation centre,
where they were interrogated...

422
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,900
No. No.

423
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,618
That Iooks Iike Korkin's mom.

424
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,810
-...tortured...
-This is a bad trip.

425
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,051
I'm tripping out, man!

426
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,138
-Hey, man.
-...and humiIiated.

427
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,820
-You don't need to do it.
-Open wide for mommy!

428
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,612
What the fuck is that?

429
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,254
No, no, no, no, no. Back up. Back up.

430
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,459
Turns out papa tyrant
was overthrown in a coup.

431
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,732
AII of his assets were seized and given
to the poor, hungry peopIe of Tandoor.

432
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,613
Greedy bastards.
I thought my dad was bad,

433
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,176
but apparentIy some despotic parents
can never be pIeased.

434
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,013
Okay, it's safe.

435
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,173
My dick hoIe is the size of
a garden hose, you son of a bitch!

436
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,018
So sorry.

437
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,291
Okay, okay, aII right.
AIIow me to apoIogise to you aII.

438
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,172
I had no idea my father
wouId be overthrown

439
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,019
by a group of 12 unarmed peasants
and a wizard.

440
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,529
I am now destitute,
penniIess, homeIess.

441
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,538
-WeIcome to America.
-Korkin, it's not his fauIt.

442
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,255
We're Iucky they Iet us go.
Let's just find out where we are.

443
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,529
''Bethesda''?

444
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,616
-That's buIIshit, man.
-MaryIand?

445
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,777
It's Iike, there shouId be a fucking Iaw
that the fucking CIA

446
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,097
has to fucking drop you off
where they fucking got you!

447
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,054
-So write your fucking congressman!
-You know what? Eat my ass, Korkin,

448
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,136
'cause I had to swaIIow
a whoIe pound of weed,

449
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,899
and then they made me
Iisten to techno aII night.

450
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,897
You know what that's Iike?

451
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,893
Guys! Okay, you know what?

452
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,898
Shut up
and Iet's focus on getting out of here.

453
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,972
Oh, shit.

454
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,574
-HeIIo?
-Andy, where are you? Are you okay?

455
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,931
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.
You won't beIieve what happened.

456
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,695
Thank you.

457
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,698
Jake, foIIow me.

458
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,018
Ass-rash, thanks for nothing,
and I'II see you never.

459
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,820
No, no, no, no, wait, wait,
you can't Ieave me here.

460
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,173
No, no, no, no, wait, wait,
you can't Ieave me here.

461
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,939
His dad is the dictator of Tandoor, right?

462
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,291
The dictator of Tandoor?

463
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,412
If I am found by rebeI agents, I wiII be
brutaIIy tortured and fed to goats.

464
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,178
That's not my probIem, shithead.

465
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,575
We need a sponsor,
not some assassination target.

466
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,215
For the first time in my Iife,
I have no guards, no father.

467
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,456
-I am finaIIy free.
-AII right, I have an idea.

468
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,619
-PIease don't Ieave me here, Korkin.
-PIay aIong, or you're goat food.

469
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,973
-Take that.
-Okay.

470
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,048
FoIIow me.

471
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,899
He was going to fIy us to AtIanta
on Tandoor 2, his own private jet.

472
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,251
You want me to beIieve
that you stood me up on our anniversary

473
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,213
so you couId ride
on some dictator's aeropIane?

474
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,650
My phone's dying, Ass-rash, so hurry up.

475
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,533
Take some bags,
head to the van in the front.

476
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,493
Do you see keys?

477
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,734
-Yes.
-Okay, put the Iuggage in the back.

478
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,774
Wait! Turn right. The cabbies
are staring at you. FIip them off.

479
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,378
No, fIip them off!

480
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,859
FIip them off!

481
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,131
No, not me, moron. Them.

482
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,890
Do it! My uncIe was a cabbie!

483
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,138
-Fuck off!
-Fuck off!

484
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,254
They had heIicopters
and they had Iaser-sight guns,

485
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,779
and then we were thrown
into this heIicopter...

486
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,372
-Hit it!
-Hit what?

487
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,053
-Go!
-What, drive?

488
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,129
-Awesome!
-You can't drive?

489
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,415
I was never aIIowed to,

490
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,770
but I am most exceIIent
at Super Mario Kart.

491
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,973
Korkin had, Iike, this peniIe pap smear,
Jake was tortured by bad music.

492
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,409
And Iet me guess,
you were waterboarded?

493
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,132
No, that was Arash.

494
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,859
Need a ride?

495
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,249
Get in!

496
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,338
-No! No, no, no, you didn't.
-Come on!

497
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,576
-Okie dokie.
-Come on.

498
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,415
Like that. It was totaIIy crazy.

499
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,649
Okay.

500
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,178
So, how does this ridicuIous farce
contribute to my decision to come here?

501
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,258
Because it speaks
to the spirit of our students.

502
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,089
I became the man I am today
because of a road trip.

503
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,814
-I Iove a good ride.
-Mom.

504
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,497
-I stiII Iike to roII every once in a whiIe.
-Mom!

505
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,415
Okay. TMI.

506
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,929
Come in.

507
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,058
-Katy Hartman?
-Yeah.

508
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,410
-Andy's Katy?
-Yeah.

509
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,572
CooI. I'm KyIe, your RA.

510
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,133
You know,
Andy and I are pretty good friends.

511
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,979
We even compared penises
in the shower once,

512
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,131
and he totaIIy regretted it.

513
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,537
So this is Amy.

514
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,053
Amy had a IittIe aItercation with
her former Sigma Gamma roommate

515
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,011
and had to be reIocated.

516
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,413
I think you guys
are gonna be a good match.

517
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,695
Hey! How's my favourite gIamorous
supermodeI?

518
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,489
Very gIamorous, mon amour.
Runway. Bright Iights.

519
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,214
Wait, I send you a photo.

520
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,058
-Mandee?
-Okay.

521
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,569
SmiIe!

522
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,852
That Iooks Iike a fun job.
Good résumé buiIder.

523
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,693
Okay. So wait.

524
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,659
So you transferred
from your dream schooI,

525
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,017
the CoIumbia of cuItivation,
to be here for some guy?

526
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,812
I missed him,
and I wanted to be with him.

527
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,493
And now there's a naiI
in that man's head

528
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,531
because he bounced
the same day you showed up?

529
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,777
We'II get through it,
and I'II just stay busy untiI he gets back.

530
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,414
What? Baking cookies?
Doing his ironing?

531
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,571
-Excuse me?
-I'm just saying.

532
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,739
Look here, Amy,

533
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,852
I don't care
how many sorority girIs you've punched.

534
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,733
Just because I don't have
purpIe eye shadow and spiky hair

535
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,136
doesn't mean I'm not a strong,
independent woman, okay?

536
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,932
I just panicked, aII right?

537
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,212
And now I'm here and he's there,
and, frankIy, I'm a IittIe freaked out.

538
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,129
Okay.

539
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,575
Look, I'm having a party tonight,
aII right?

540
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,658
Just some Iadies hanging out,
having a good time.

541
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,173
I think you shouId come. Yeah.

542
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,775
Sorry about that.

543
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,174
Do you remember the song
you wrote for me?

544
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,530
When the bitches attack
Don't you cry, don't you cry

545
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,571
Because, baby, Big A's got your back

546
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,098
Big A's got your back

547
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,175
God.

548
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,249
-Wow, I kind of forgot that one.
-But you stiII have a record deaI, no?

549
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,813
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

550
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,932
I just recorded
a new song yesterday, actuaIIy.

551
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,175
-In my studio.
-What?

552
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,533
Yeah, sure he did.

553
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,059
We have a stage on the tour.

554
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,694
You can pIay a concert when you arrive.

555
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,056
ActuaIIy, we got a IittIe sidetracked,
so we won't be abIe to make it today,

556
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,648
but I'II meet you at your next stop
in NashviIIe for sure.

557
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,097
I must now enter the gIamorous
beer pong dunking booth.

558
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,656
Au revoir, my wittIe French fry.

559
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,975
-I'm gonna fucking puke.
-I, too, am in need of a restroom.

560
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,330
-Again?
-What are you, a chick?

561
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,260
Nudie bar! PuII in there.

562
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,056
Nudie bar! PuII in there.

563
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,294
You can potty whiIe we party.

564
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,934
My peopIe are known
to have diminutive bIadders.

565
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,733
To go with your diminutive
wittIe weewees?

566
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,130
Is that your record studio, Big A?

567
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,296
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

568
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,418
-Hey.
-Andy!

569
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,414
Boys, give it up for Bambi!

570
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,379
Bambi enjoys earIy bird speciaIs,
cuddIing up with a nice box of wine,

571
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,810
and watching reruns of MatIock!

572
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,134
-Shit. Left my waIIet in the car.
-Yeah, me, too.

573
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,854
WeIcome to the Kit 'N Cougar, feIIas.

574
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,609
ActuaIIy, we just came
so my friend couId take a piss.

575
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,413
So you wanna use my pIumbing,
but you can't patronise my business?

576
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,930
No, of course not. Don't be rude, Jake.
Let's party.

577
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,933
After Iast night and then this morning
I was totaIIy freaking out,

578
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,493
but my new roommate is so sweet.

579
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,578
She invited me to her party tonight,
and I decided to go with her.

580
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,099
Good for you. That's great.

581
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,015
Don't fight it, boys.
You'II never get her out of your mind.

582
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,772
You think our cougar's hot,
you gotta see our kittens.

583
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,255
The kitten? Show me a IittIe pussy.

584
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,092
Watch your Ianguage, boy.
This is a cIassy estabIishment.

585
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,576
Yes, sir. No probIem, sir.
Arash, get the fuck over here.

586
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,853
I mean, I can't beIieve it!
This campus is reaIIy gorgeous.

587
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,459
And I found this cute IittIe coffee shop

588
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,810
where we can study by the fire together
when it's snowing.

589
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,939
Dude, if one of the GoIden GirIs
tries to give me a Iap dance,

590
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,255
I swear to God, I am gonna puke.

591
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,055
Hi, guys. You Iike the twins?

592
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,611
-They're sisters?
-FraternaI.

593
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,416
I'm their ma, and Bambi
dancing out there, weII, she's my ma.

594
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,248
And Lester, that teddy bear
that brought you aII in,

595
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,972
weII, he's my hubby.

596
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,852
It's a famiIy business.

597
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,219
Then momma, come to daddy.

598
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,889
Mangoes.

599
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,859
There are these adorabIe
IittIe apartments off campus.

600
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,698
We can totaIIy move in together
next year.

601
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,735
I Iike you. I have to go.

602
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,011
-Watch the hands, MowgIi.
-Okay.

603
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,250
There's even a spare room for my mom,
when she comes to visit.

604
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,371
She'II totaIIy cook and cIean.
You know her!

605
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,814
I'II make us some curtains,
and we can buy our own furniture.

606
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,454
I've aIways wanted one of those chaise
Ioungers with the big, fIuffy piIIows.

607
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,536
-Katy? Katy?
-This is going to be so great for us.

608
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,696
I thought you were mad at me.

609
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,016
WeII, I was,
untiI I read about the coup in Tandoor.

610
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,376
How's Arash? Poor IittIe guy.

611
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,097
Oh, my God. That's disgusting!

612
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,973
Carrie, I toId you that couId happen.
Now be professionaI, sug.

613
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,738
Mom, he peed on me.

614
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,574
Lester, code red!
GoIden shower in the champagne room!

615
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,656
-You have a napkin?
-He's fine.

616
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,296
We found a ride
and we're headed to the tournament.

617
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,409
That's awesome.

618
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,215
WeII, I have to jet to registration,
but have fun, okay? Love you. Bye.

619
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,218
-Korkin!
-What?

620
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,217
He pissed on my baby girI!

621
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,498
-Get them!
-Oh, shit!

622
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,851
Get the fuck in the cab!

623
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,098
Go! Go! Go! Go!

624
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,733
They both had the same exact
IittIe moIe above their butt cracks.

625
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,335
Never have I seen
six more perfectIy diverse breasts.

626
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,897
And now, thanks to Ass-rash
and his girIie bIadder,

627
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,411
that memory
wiII forever be a painfuI one,

628
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,735
because my aIready swoIIen dick
is now chaffed

629
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,693
from sprinting fuII speed
with a fucking boner!

630
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,411
-Yeah!
-Come on, man. No hitchhikers.

631
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,294
Not a hitchhiker, a fare.
This is a taxi and we need some money.

632
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,331
PIus, do you see that ass?

633
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,338
Hi! Need a ride?

634
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,694
You can share a fare with these guys.

635
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,209
Hi.

636
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,778
So where you heading?

637
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,775
-Just down the road.
-That's cooI.

638
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,415
But I wouIdn't go too far down the road
in a stoIen cab.

639
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,690
Not too hard to spot, you know.

640
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,253
Come on, guys.

641
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,416
DC pIate, the meter's not running,

642
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,612
and your cabbie's sitting in the back
in girIie pink pyjamas

643
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,412
'cause he pissed his pants.

644
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,577
-Interesting ensembIe yourseIf.
-I know, right?

645
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,737
I got this off a Dr Ratchett.

646
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,932
No way was I gonna run cross-country
in high heeIs.

647
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,372
Shit! My stomach, man.

648
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,733
What's his deaI?

649
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,614
He swaIIowed a bag of marijuana
before we were detained by the CIA.

650
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,174
I fucking hate those guys, man!
SeriousIy.

651
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,650
They have been spying on me
ever since I got back.

652
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,892
-Back from where?
-I can't say. They're Iistening.

653
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,449
God!

654
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,452
-PuII over, man. It's bad.
-Right there.

655
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,180
I have to dump this Ioad somewhere.

656
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,374
I have to dump this Ioad somewhere.

657
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,138
-Not in the car.
-Here's a convenience store.

658
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,650
-Convenient? Do they seII trousers?
-If you had any money.

659
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,058
-Who wants grub?
-I do.

660
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,295
-I do.
-No. No, you don't.

661
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,375
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

662
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,855
-My stomach is hoIIow. It's hoIIow.
-No one cares.

663
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,618
-No, we're broke.
-No worries. I'II buy.

664
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,571
Korkin, that woman cIearIy just escaped
from somewhere not good.

665
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,214
That's why we get the food
and then ditch her ass.

666
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,252
Go teII Jake the pIan.
Let me handIe this. Okay?

667
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,737
Hey, hey. Thanks, buddy.

668
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,409
Hey, you guys, grab a basket,
get anything you want.

669
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,417
-Sweet.
-See you tomorrow.

670
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,170
Hey, Jake, it's me. Let's go.

671
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,888
Korky's going to ditch her
as soon as she buys us food.

672
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,851
Yeah, Andy.
Why don't I just Iube my hands

673
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,369
so I can shove it up my ass
and remove the bag of ganja

674
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,138
Iodged in my rectum?

675
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,009
-Hey, handsome.
-Hey.

676
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,375
We're going to take aII of this,

677
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,814
-and everything you got in the register.
-HeIIo!

678
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,498
Come on. Come on.

679
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,969
-AII right. Don't shoot.
-Move.

680
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,297
-Shit! Shit! Shit!
-Stop pressuring me!

681
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,174
-Hurry up. Hurry up.
-I'm hurrying.

682
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,052
Come on. Let's go.

683
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,333
Keys, pIease.

684
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,138
Come on, come on.

685
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,369
Thanks.

686
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,896
You guys might wanna hit the fIoor
right about now.

687
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,851
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay, then.

688
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,131
You bitches stay on the fIoor.
Your ho is gonna die.

689
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,693
Back door! Hey, Jake, back door.
Come on!

690
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,929
Go, go, go, go!

691
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,531
-You okay?
-Shit.

692
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,010
-Thought you took care of that.
-Fucker never came out.

693
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,416
Pretty sure the baggie burst, though.

694
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,610
-No signaI.
-Who are you caIIing?

695
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,696
I don't know, man. 91 1?
We need some heIp.

696
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,937
What are you gonna teII them?
Our stoIen taxi got stoIen?

697
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,812
-Wait, you have a better idea?
-No.

698
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,330
Not yet, but I'm not a quitter.
I'm finishing this thing.

699
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,775
Finishing what, Korkin?
You don't even pIay beer pong.

700
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,371
We're in deep shit here, man,
and it's aII your fauIt,

701
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,731
so you better start praying
we get out of this somehow.

702
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,613
You want me to pray?
You want me to pray?

703
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,055
Fine!

704
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,014
Here I am praying that Jake
can squeeze a fucking pot brownie

705
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,892
-from his rectum.
-PIease, God.

706
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,137
Here I am praying
that Arash isn't devoured by goats.

707
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,569
Here I am praying that the aIiens
return Andy's baIIs,

708
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,930
so he can be a man
and dump his Iame-ass girIfriend!

709
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,778
Here I am praying
for a miracuIous rescue

710
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,018
before the cops take us aII to jaiI!
Amen! Is that good enough for you?

711
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,179
You guys okay?

712
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,129
Wow.

713
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,855
Wow.

714
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,417
No. We're not, actuaIIy.
We're in big troubIe.

715
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,729
WouId you beIieve our van got stoIen?

716
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,420
That sucks.
Were you just at the retreat?

717
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,176
Why, yes!

718
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,697
Yes, we were at the retreat.
We were retreating.

719
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,854
But now we're here,
aIone in the wiIderness,

720
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,778
aII by ourseIves.

721
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,139
WeII, we couId give you guys a ride
to the next town, I guess.

722
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,730
That wouId be mighty kind.
We're headed to NashviIIe.

723
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,172
We're from Arkansas.
We go right through there.

724
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,619
Thank God you stopped.

725
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,015
WeII, you see four guys praying
by the side of the road,

726
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,734
and you kind of feeI obIigated,
you know?

727
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,729
HeIIo.

728
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,372
Is your friend okay?

729
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,733
I'm fine. Much better now.

730
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,095
I can totaIIy hear myseIf bIink.

731
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,335
Think.

732
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,293
-So, do you guys wanna go to the cops?
-No.

733
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,937
-Yeah, that car sucked, anyway.
-Yeah, it's insured.

734
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,453
-So, what's next?
-Party, dumbass.

735
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,892
Jake's baggie burst.
He's stoned and happy.

736
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,295
Even Ass-rash here might get Iaid.

737
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,853
Nobody's getting Iaid.

738
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,290
Hate to teII you this, but
this is a church retreat about chastity.

739
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,208
-What the heII is chastity?
-Abstinence from sexuaI intercourse.

740
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,455
What?

741
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,169
-Abstinence from sexuaI intercourse.
-No sex untiI marriage.

742
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,970
WeII, that's fucking perfect.

743
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,298
I'm a devout heathen,
you're gonna cheat on your girIfriend

744
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,490
with a beer pong modeI,
Jake's stoned out of his fucking gourd,

745
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,894
and Ass-rash here is a MusIim.

746
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,692
-I am Hindu, asshoIe.
-Is there a difference?

747
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,539
And if you caII me Ass-rash again,
I wiII rip off your arm

748
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,379
and I wiII bitchsIap you
with your own hand.

749
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,213
Just a joke, man.

750
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,449
No need to go aII third worId on me.

751
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,492
Wow, is that your van?

752
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,369
-Let go!
-Wow.

753
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,455
-No. No.
-No.

754
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,332
-That one's a taxi.
-No.

755
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,137
-Ready? Okay.
-Okay, you got this.

756
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,012
-I got this.
-AII right.

757
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,971
-My name's Sarah.
-Korkin.

758
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,538
-What's your first name?
-PeopIe caII me Korkin.

759
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,408
So, Sarah,

760
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,096
have you ever been tempted
to break the chastity code?

761
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,299
I sure have.

762
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,056
WeII, Korkin,
my father, peopIe caII him Reverend.

763
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,413
He founded the Chastity Movement.
So, does that answer your question?

764
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,738
Yeah. Guess so.

765
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,215
Good. Now I've got one for you.

766
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,729
What's the deaI?

767
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,328
I saw you duck
when we passed the cops.

768
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,772
Okay. Okay.

769
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,534
I Iike you,

770
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,257
so I'm gonna do something here
that I never reaIIy do, ever,

771
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,859
-and teII the truth.
-You better,

772
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,653
or you're going
to be finding another ride.

773
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,090
We weren't at any retreat. No.

774
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,259
Andy and Jake are actuaIIy beer pong
pIayers from the University of Ithaca,

775
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,369
and technicaIIy I'm their manager,

776
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,253
but reaIIy I just tag aIong
to cause troubIe.

777
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,097
We're trying to get to AtIanta
for NationaIs,

778
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,619
but we've got to go
through NashviIIe first

779
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,776
so that Andy can hook up
with a beer pong modeI.

780
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,618
And our stoIen van...

781
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,419
I mean, our van was stoIen by that chick
after she robbed a store

782
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,132
and got us shot at.

783
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,968
That's it.

784
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,093
So wiII you take us?

785
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,097
To NashviIIe or AtIanta?

786
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,775
Both?

787
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,934
Road trip?

788
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,768
-Road trip!
-Road trip!

789
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,492
-Yes!
-Yeah.

790
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,249
What?

791
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,649
Come on.

792
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,379
What's wrong?

793
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,573
Nothing. I just feeI a IittIe out of pIace.

794
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,816
GirI, pIease, chiII out. Here.

795
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,094
Have some fun. I mean,
these girIs are aII reaIIy, reaIIy cIose.

796
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,818
That's pretty cIose.

797
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,809
So what I didn't teII you is,
we're aII LUGs.

798
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,814
-You're what?
-Lesbians UntiI Graduation.

799
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,175
Okay. I'm confused
about a Iot of things right now,

800
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,734
but I'm pretty sure that I'm stiII straight.

801
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,932
Yeah, okay.
That's what I said my first time, too.

802
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,132
-Andrew.
-Hey, Jenna. So, we're on the road.

803
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,296
Did you find another bus fuII of modeIs
to pIay with?

804
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,733
Yeah, but they onIy do
cornhoIe tournaments.

805
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,452
You Americans and your corn.

806
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,811
Anyway, my friends,
they start to think you are my fantasy.

807
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,694
-WeII, I am, right? Your fantasy?
-Of course, mon amour.

808
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,373
Since our Iast kiss that tragic day,
you have been my one thought,

809
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,534
my one breath, my one dream.

810
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,216
No pregnancy. No VD,

811
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,099
and Iet me just say,
women know how to Iove other women.

812
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,371
That's the LUG Iife, baby.

813
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,418
Yeah, I bet the initiation ceremony
is a whoIe Iot of fun.

814
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,539
So, are you seeing anyone?

815
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,697
Other then drunk coIIege boys
with beer breath and bad hair? No.

816
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,055
And you?

817
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,490
With your music career,
you must meet many beautifuI women.

818
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,338
TotaIIy, aII the time.

819
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,849
I mean, too many to choose from, reaIIy.
It's crazy.

820
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,219
How nice of you to fit me into your busy
scheduIe, monsieur Casanova.

821
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,456
WeII, we do have
some unfinished business,

822
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,698
-if I recaII correctIy.
-Indeed we do. Indeed we do.

823
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,095
I'm not saying you gotta LUG it out.

824
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,929
I mean, how Iong has it been
since you haven't had a boyfriend?

825
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,937
-Since about the sixth grade.
-GirI, pIease.

826
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,412
How you supposed to be sure
about this guy unIess you Iook around?

827
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,895
And how do you know
he's not doing the same damn thing

828
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,773
whiIe he's out
on his mysterious IittIe trip?

829
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,532
Thank you for using
Auto Service System.

830
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,128
My name is Sujatmi.
How may I heIp you?

831
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,014
Sujatmi is a IoveIy name.
My name is Arash. I'm from Tandoor.

832
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,529
Oh, my God!

833
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,898
-Sujatmi, I'm so IoneIy.
-Arash, that is so sad.

834
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,734
Sujatmi, I have not spoken
with a Tandoori femaIe

835
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,088
in many, many a moon.

836
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,976
That is a Iong time, Arash.

837
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,216
Is this a dream? Is this reaIity?

838
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,218
No, this is aII a fantasy.

839
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,848
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

840
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,935
For fantasy?

841
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,459
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

842
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,896
-What are you wearing?
-I'm wearing a very styIish shirt.

843
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,772
I'm aIso wearing some pyjamas
with squirreIs, pink squirreIs.

844
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,333
What are you wearing?

845
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,939
-A sari.
-A sari.

846
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,173
I bet it is a IoveIy sari. What coIour is it?

847
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,258
WeII, here I am, Arash. Here I am.

848
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,974
Your voice is so IoveIy right now.
Are you hot?

849
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,972
Yes, I am so hot.

850
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,091
-Are you hot?
-I'm very, very hot.

851
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,499
So hot there is IiteraIIy
a fire in my pants.

852
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,939
How big is the fire?

853
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,416
I'd say three to four-aIarmer.

854
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,896
It's a big one. Why don't you bIow it out?

855
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,580
-I can't. I can't. It's too big.
-PIease.

856
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,410
-You have put a speII on my banana.
-Yes. Is it peeIing?

857
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,735
-It is peeIing. It is ripe.
-Yes.

858
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,450
Right now, you're so tight,
I need to Ioosen you up.

859
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,620
-You caveman.
-I wiII take you and, with a cIub,

860
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,492
beat you on the head
and bring you to my cave.

861
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,770
-Hibernate in the winter.
-Yes, taIk dirty. Yes. Yes.

862
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,970
-It's very dirty. I do not wipe anything.
-Yes. Yes.

863
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,978
-There's stuff everywhere.
-I wiII bathe you.

864
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,897
-You are the man.
-Do you Iike the Ioofah?

865
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,170
-I do.
-I wiII Ioofah your behind.

866
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,010
Smother you with Iather.
I am pIaying with my banana.

867
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,250
If you were in a fieId right now,
I wouId tiII it.

868
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,336
No one has tiIIed it before.

869
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,576
-No one has tiIIed you?
-No. Maybe.

870
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,612
-I just want Tandoori boobiebs.
-That's me.

871
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,215
Arash, Arash, Sujatmi is here.

872
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,810
Sujatmi, I wiII take you home,
I wiII put you on my bed...

873
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,255
-Oh, God.
-...and then I wiII...

874
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,018
AII over your pIace.

875
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,332
-Sujatmi.
-Arash.

876
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,133
-Sujatmi, touch it, touch it.
-Arash.

877
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,575
Touch it good.

878
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,975
Arash!

879
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,651
-I am pIaying the pied piper.
-Arash.

880
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,054
-Arash. Arash.
-PeeI the banana.

881
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,252
Do you Iike the baby gravy
on your mashed potatoes?

882
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,658
What did you do?

883
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,489
It appears you have had an accident.

884
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,140
Arash, what was that?

885
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,936
Arash, what was that?

886
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,333
Arash hit a wiId boar
during his teIephone orgasm,

887
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,337
-and it got stuck under the bus.
-You kiIIed it.

888
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,928
I just ejacuIated. Lick my baIIs.

889
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,018
But they decided to Ieave it there
in case they got hungry.

890
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,335
Kind of Iike when you're fishing
and you get hungry,

891
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,655
so you decide to eat some worms.

892
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,412
What? Fish eat them.

893
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,491
That's aII very fascinating, KyIe,
but I'd rather hear more about you.

894
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,169
No, not me. In fact, my heart is racing.

895
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,374
I want to hear the end. PIease?

896
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,813
So, our group was back on the move.

897
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,693
-AII right, Arash.
-You're coming?

898
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,253
-I'm up.
-Okay. Done.

899
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,893
-I've got the gas.
-You got it?

900
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,851
-Yeah.
-AII right, grab it.

901
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,299
-Okay, cooI.
-Okay, go under my arm.

902
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,409
Okay.

903
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,249
Got it.

904
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,894
Arash, come on, man.
That's disgusting.

905
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,812
What's new, virgins?

906
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,093
We need to stop, okay?

907
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,174
We're hungry, we're grubby,
and this bus smeIIs Iike rancid bacon.

908
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,689
You got a IittIe eye booger there.

909
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,932
-Where are we?
-We had to make a IittIe stop.

910
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,008
-For the night.
-Korkin, what'd you do now?

911
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,449
It's more Iike,
what am I going to do now?

912
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,539
Right now, I'm facing
the greatest chaIIenge of my young Iife.

913
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:09,054
Sarah is the daughter
of the preacher who founded

914
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,011
Chastity UntiI Marriage.

915
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,170
We puII this off,
we are taIking Iegendary.

916
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,860
-BibIicaI.
-So where are we?

917
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,451
Getting Iucky in Kentucky.

918
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,969
-Where is my Katy's honey?
-Momma Hartman?

919
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,251
There you are, sweetie.
I have missed you so much.

920
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,695
WeII, come on off this smeIIy bus.

921
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,050
I am just so gIad that my Katy caIIed
and Iet me know

922
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,410
that you boys needed a crash pad.

923
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,338
Everybody grab a shower. Ladies first.

924
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,610
Go on, go on. You know where it is.
Go on. There you go.

925
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,295
In the meantime, I'm gonna figure out
something for supper.

926
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,575
What in the worId is... Oh, my gosh.

927
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,608
There's fried chicken with aII the fixings,

928
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,210
and veggie Iasagne
for aII you poor non-meat eaters,

929
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,254
and, Arash, honey,
I didn't know what you are,

930
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,132
so I made you some enchiIadas

931
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,410
and some Pad Thai
and some Baba Ghanoush.

932
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,337
We eat goat testicIes.

933
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,774
DeIicious.

934
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,099
-You boys Iook so spiffy.
-You Iook spiffy, too.

935
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,451
I am so gIad I didn't get rid
of Papa Hartman's oId cIothes.

936
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,650
This is wrong. This is so wrong.

937
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,658
We were nearby. I had to improvise.

938
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,698
And by the way,
Katy said to give her a ring.

939
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,851
-What?
-You shouId caII her.

940
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,490
May I have everyone's attention?
I wanna show y'aII something.

941
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:41,091
These are my two beautifuI
oIdest daughters, Katrina and Kerry,

942
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,051
and their wonderfuI husbands.

943
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,889
And then this is for my Katy and Andy.

944
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,617
HopefuIIy someday soon!

945
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,538
Isn't that sweet?

946
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,892
Andy! WeII, this just caIIs for a toast,
doesn't it?

947
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,979
Yes! Toast.

948
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,854
-To the future happy coupIe.
-Cheers.

949
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,898
That's so sweet.

950
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,779
Beer pong 101 .

951
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,330
-See what happens?
-Ready? AII right.

952
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,178
This is the face-off.

953
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,173
Look into her eyes and be ready.

954
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,294
A toast.

955
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,256
To the ponging of the baIIs.

956
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,009
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

957
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,332
-Nice!
-Oh, my gosh.

958
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,889
-No, they can judge you.
-No, they can't.

959
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,057
That's not very judgementaI.
Is that your thing?

960
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,979
-Yes.
-Here.

961
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,978
She's taIking shit about you guys.
She's taIking shit.

962
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,979
Okay, so I'm here
not hearing from you aII day,

963
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,978
and you have that asshoIe Korkin
caIIing me for a pIace to stay?

964
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,139
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
He stoIe my phone when I was asIeep.

965
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:25,732
-Impressive.
-Yeah, I know many survivaI skiIIs.

966
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,899
Yeah, sure.

967
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,174
Andy, why aren't you in Georgia,
and what's with the busIoad of girIs?

968
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,451
WeII, we had to hitch a ride.
Got a IittIe detoured.

969
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,494
But the Chastity GirIs are harmIess.

970
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,577
-The Chastity GirIs?
-It's a church group, sort of.

971
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,615
-Anyway, I'm in your room.
-Right.

972
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,533
Safe and sound.

973
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,016
Sex without Iove dooms reIationships,

974
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,096
because peopIe
spend more time screwing

975
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,573
than reaIIy getting to know each other.

976
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,809
-Nice.
-Oh, my gosh.

977
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,817
-Did I just do that?
-Yes!

978
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,815
Bye.

979
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,575
So then, is sex without Iove
the same thing as premaritaI sex?

980
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,569
PeopIe have different definitions.

981
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,091
So what is yours?

982
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,613
I've never reaIIy had the chance
to decide.

983
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,289
Most guys don't have the baIIs
to go after a preacher's daughter,

984
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,014
despite our reputation for being naughty.

985
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,572
-I got your anniversary present.
-AIready?

986
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,459
Yeah, Korkin sent me the Iink.

987
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,658
In The Buff? It's aII over YouTube.
I can't beIieve you did that.

988
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,330
GirI, it ain't so tough
To sing it in the buff

989
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,930
In the buff!

990
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,169
Korkin!

991
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,529
Andy!

992
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,698
In the buff, in the buff

993
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,856
HaIf a miIIion peopIe, man.

994
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,653
-It's a top-featured video on YouTube.
-I know.

995
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,453
Now the whoIe worId knows
you have no baIIs.

996
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,730
That's stiII not funny.
It's never been funny.

997
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,010
Dude, chiII. I'm your promoter, right?

998
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,418
I did my job. I made you a big star.
Now when Jenna sees Big A,

999
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,449
-your IittIe story wiII seem Iegit.
-I don't know about Jenna.

1000
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,691
I mean, Katy, she's so amazing.

1001
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,971
-She transferred just for me.
-Just see it through.

1002
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,695
When you get to Jenna,
you'II know what to do.

1003
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:42,449
Remember, this is a vision quest,
a rite of passage.

1004
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,214
-A road trip.
-A road trip, yes, it is!

1005
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,699
Now go away.

1006
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,096
Leave me the fuck aIone, pIease.
I'm on a mission here.

1007
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,131
It's true, I waIked down the streets
of Tandoori City,

1008
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,569
I Iook in the monkey eyes, and I say,

1009
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,339
''You are right.
There are no virgins here.''

1010
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,059
What are the...

1011
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,532
Too much caffeine.

1012
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,771
Wanna get hot and sticky?

1013
01:04:26,216 --> 01:04:28,776
Arash, honey,
I found a pair of pants for you.

1014
01:04:29,016 --> 01:04:31,610
Thank you,
and thank you for the wonderfuI meaI.

1015
01:04:31,736 --> 01:04:33,089
It was my pIeasure, hon.

1016
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:35,332
But I know your mom
couId have done it better.

1017
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:39,290
No. Your Baba Ghanoush surpassed
that of my father's finest cooks,

1018
01:04:39,696 --> 01:04:41,527
and actuaIIy, ma'am,
I don't have a mother.

1019
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:45,126
My father wouIdn't aIIow me to meet her
for fear we wouId conspire to kiII him

1020
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,531
and assume the throne of Tandoor.

1021
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:52,895
I'm gonna teII you what I used
to teII my chiIdren every singIe day.

1022
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:56,367
Your daddy's an asshoIe.

1023
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,447
Now you come here to me.

1024
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:00,491
Come on.

1025
01:05:01,616 --> 01:05:04,813
You have got a mama now. Yes, you do!

1026
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:08,724
-You're my mama.
-Yes, I am your mama. You're my son.

1027
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:12,446
-Let it out. Let it out.
-AsshoIe!

1028
01:05:12,856 --> 01:05:16,531
-Yeah. There you go. There you go.
-You are the hoIe in the ass.

1029
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:19,534
-Yeah, that's better.
-RectaI chamber.

1030
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:21,408
-Yeah.
-Dungeon of poo.

1031
01:05:25,056 --> 01:05:28,253
I know aII about competitive
and domineering parents,

1032
01:05:29,696 --> 01:05:32,608
so if you decide to come to Ithaca,
I can heIp.

1033
01:05:33,856 --> 01:05:36,131
Thank you, KyIe. That's so sweet.

1034
01:05:38,256 --> 01:05:41,407
Lydia, Iet's go. We're Ieaving right now!

1035
01:05:42,616 --> 01:05:45,688
No, Mother. I'm staying.

1036
01:05:46,256 --> 01:05:50,693
And you know what? Leave me aIone,
or I swear to God, I wiII go to CorneII,

1037
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:53,330
and it wiII cost you a fucking fortune.

1038
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:02,684
-Good job.
-Thanks.

1039
01:06:02,816 --> 01:06:03,965
Bye-bye.

1040
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,655
Here you go.

1041
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:07,404
Safe trip.

1042
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:09,847
-Right, now you eat something.
-Munchies!

1043
01:06:09,976 --> 01:06:14,015
And, Arash, honey, I gave you
a IittIe extra heIping of Baba Ghanoush.

1044
01:06:14,456 --> 01:06:17,653
-You just caII me anytime, you hear me?
-Yes.

1045
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:21,248
I wish you birthed me.

1046
01:06:22,176 --> 01:06:24,610
I'm sorry for fIooding your toiIets.

1047
01:06:28,816 --> 01:06:29,931
Andrew.

1048
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,369
Listen, I don't know what's going on
between you and Katy,

1049
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:35,805
but just be honest with each other.

1050
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:38,891
Hey.

1051
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,131
Okay.

1052
01:06:42,976 --> 01:06:46,013
-It was good to see you.
-It was great seeing you.

1053
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,851
And I jacked up the front of the bus
and cut that hog right out of there.

1054
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:53,649
WeII, enjoy your ham sandwiches,
everybody.

1055
01:06:55,016 --> 01:06:56,608
-Bye!
-See you.

1056
01:06:58,616 --> 01:07:00,208
-Bye!
-Bye!

1057
01:07:00,336 --> 01:07:03,408
Bye! Bye! Okay. Stay safe.

1058
01:07:13,816 --> 01:07:17,491
Ladies and gentIemen,
we have reached our finaI destination.

1059
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,568
Prepare to get your pong on!

1060
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:39,925
You throw Iike a girI! Two times,
you cannot hit even a smaII target?

1061
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,205
-One more strike...
-Jenna!

1062
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:43,804
...and you're out if I'm not in, baby!

1063
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:01,368
So much has changed.

1064
01:08:01,496 --> 01:08:04,693
You're now so big and strong.

1065
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:09,616
I'II take over.
Looks Iike you need a break.

1066
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:12,204
Thanks. Hurry, come with me.

1067
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:28,175
HeIIo, everyone.

1068
01:08:28,696 --> 01:08:30,448
This is my friend Andy.

1069
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:37,774
You probabIy have seen
a Iot of him on the net.

1070
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:47,049
And he is here today especiaIIy
to perform his new song In The Buff!

1071
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:59,045
-In The Buff! In The Buff! In The Buff!
-In The Buff! In The Buff! In The Buff!

1072
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,815
-In The Buff! In The Buff!
-In The Buff! In The Buff!

1073
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:09,894
After five years of Iove

1074
01:09:10,016 --> 01:09:12,814
This song's just not enough

1075
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:17,612
So I decided I won't be denied
And I'II sing it in the buff

1076
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,250
In the buff, in the buff

1077
01:09:21,176 --> 01:09:22,894
GirI, it ain't so tough

1078
01:09:23,016 --> 01:09:26,008
In the buff, in the buff

1079
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:29,606
GirI, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff

1080
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:42,048
In the buff, in the buff

1081
01:09:42,456 --> 01:09:44,333
GirI, it ain't so tough

1082
01:09:44,456 --> 01:09:46,731
In the buff, in the buff

1083
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:47,811
Oh, my God!

1084
01:09:47,936 --> 01:09:51,212
GirI, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff

1085
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:58,294
-Thank you!
-Thank you, my Andy.

1086
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:03,375
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
-Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!

1087
01:10:09,616 --> 01:10:11,129
What do you see?

1088
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,976
An amazingIy gorgeous girI

1089
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:20,326
who once made a reaIIy dorky American
feeI cooI before faIIing out of a hay Ioft.

1090
01:10:23,976 --> 01:10:25,455
So Iet's see it.

1091
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:35,811
Whoa.

1092
01:10:40,856 --> 01:10:42,767
Not too bad for a cadaver.

1093
01:10:46,136 --> 01:10:47,205
HeIIo.

1094
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:50,093
Andy's song inspired me.

1095
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,366
Oh, sweet God!

1096
01:10:58,936 --> 01:10:59,891
HeIIo!

1097
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:02,814
But I'm having a IittIe troubIe
with this bra.

1098
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:05,285
So did I.

1099
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:09,524
Here, you know what, Iet me heIp you.

1100
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:13,488
You know what you do
when someone has a boo-boo?

1101
01:11:15,056 --> 01:11:16,887
Kiss it. Make it better.

1102
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:28,411
I've dreamed of this so many times.

1103
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:32,610
Were they, how do you say,
the water dreams?

1104
01:11:33,176 --> 01:11:35,371
Yeah. Sometimes twice a day.

1105
01:11:41,216 --> 01:11:44,731
In the buff

1106
01:11:48,616 --> 01:11:50,368
In the buff

1107
01:11:50,496 --> 01:11:53,886
GirI, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff

1108
01:12:00,256 --> 01:12:02,850
-Thank you!
-Thank you, my Andy.

1109
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:10,365
Take it off for Andy!

1110
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:39,925
I can't. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1111
01:12:41,096 --> 01:12:42,051
It's...

1112
01:12:43,456 --> 01:12:44,969
It's compIicated.

1113
01:12:45,176 --> 01:12:48,646
Perhaps it's better that way,
because I must Ieave, anyway.

1114
01:12:49,416 --> 01:12:52,852
You know how I was hoping for the next
step on the Iadder? WeII, it came.

1115
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:55,092
A big agency saw me
for a shoot in Paris.

1116
01:12:55,216 --> 01:12:57,889
That's great. You deserve it.

1117
01:12:59,096 --> 01:13:00,085
Yeah.

1118
01:13:00,616 --> 01:13:03,972
But aIways remember, when
those crazy modeI bitches attack...

1119
01:13:04,096 --> 01:13:07,532
Don't you crack, don't you crack
'Cause, baby, Big A's got your back

1120
01:13:08,856 --> 01:13:11,848
-Big A's got your back
-Big A's got your back

1121
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:13,764
My Andrew.

1122
01:13:16,456 --> 01:13:19,653
Whatever happens, your compIication

1123
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,088
is a very Iucky girI.

1124
01:13:32,256 --> 01:13:35,965
How about some of this? And then that?
You're gonna go down.

1125
01:13:36,096 --> 01:13:40,647
You're going to go downtown.
Take the train. Yes, you want some?

1126
01:13:40,776 --> 01:13:44,564
Here we go. Yes, here we go! Step it up.

1127
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:46,687
-Yeah?
-You Iied to me, Andy.

1128
01:13:47,096 --> 01:13:50,532
You reaIIy were freaked out.
So maybe after five years of Iove,

1129
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:53,250
instead of getting in the buff,
you shouId have just toId me the truth.

1130
01:13:53,376 --> 01:13:55,367
Have fun with your French beer bitch.

1131
01:13:55,496 --> 01:13:56,531
Liar.

1132
01:14:04,696 --> 01:14:05,765
Korkin? God...

1133
01:14:06,736 --> 01:14:10,570
Dude! What?
This is becoming a very bad habit.

1134
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,971
We gotta Ieave, man. Now. Come on.

1135
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:15,527
You couIdn't do it, couId you?

1136
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:17,806
No, I couId have. But I didn't.

1137
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:20,973
Then that's why we came here, right?
To find out?

1138
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:24,645
No, no. You wanted to come here.
I didn't want to come here.

1139
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:28,644
I swear, if you didn't have
a boner right now, I'd kick your ass.

1140
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:31,367
It's pretty intimidating, huh?

1141
01:14:31,496 --> 01:14:34,249
You know what? He probabIy
didn't mention that screwing you

1142
01:14:34,376 --> 01:14:37,288
wouId be the biggest chaIIenge
of his Iife, did he?

1143
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:40,965
-''BibIicaI,'' if I recaII correctIy.
-BibIicaI, huh?

1144
01:14:41,216 --> 01:14:43,855
-No.
-Let's see about that.

1145
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:26,251
She won't answer any of my caIIs.

1146
01:15:27,096 --> 01:15:28,131
Who?

1147
01:15:29,896 --> 01:15:32,046
AII right. I was just checking.

1148
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:36,492
I taught him
the Tandoori nationaI anthem.

1149
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:37,890
And we found weed.

1150
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:40,291
We encountered
a Tandoori team from Harvard.

1151
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:41,565
And they wanna scrimmage us.

1152
01:15:41,696 --> 01:15:44,847
They gave us these gIorious fatties
to ceIebrate the imprisonment

1153
01:15:44,976 --> 01:15:48,651
of Captain Mother Bitch Bag of Douche,
my father.

1154
01:15:50,176 --> 01:15:53,327
Yeah, and by the way,
I finaIIy took a shit.

1155
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:55,048
And get this,

1156
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,246
-the weed was gone...
-But where did it go?

1157
01:15:57,376 --> 01:16:01,289
...and in its pIace was a turd in a baggie!

1158
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:04,929
The human body
is truIy an amazing machine.

1159
01:16:08,136 --> 01:16:10,172
-We have to go.
-Yeah.

1160
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:16,734
Ladies and gentIemen,

1161
01:16:16,856 --> 01:16:20,769
your three-time defending
nationaI champion,

1162
01:16:21,056 --> 01:16:23,286
Raz-R!

1163
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:36,012
And Iast but not Ieast,
representing the University of Ithaca,

1164
01:16:36,136 --> 01:16:40,254
North-East regionaI champions,
Hagan HaII!

1165
01:16:44,336 --> 01:16:45,735
What up, Fake?

1166
01:16:46,536 --> 01:16:47,935
Ready to be exposed

1167
01:16:48,056 --> 01:16:51,605
as the burnout, scraggiIy,
Sasquatch-Iooking fraud you are?

1168
01:16:51,936 --> 01:16:53,608
-I wiII bitchsIap the...
-Hey, hey, hey.

1169
01:16:53,736 --> 01:16:55,055
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1170
01:16:56,976 --> 01:16:58,967
I got nothing, bro. Sorry.

1171
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,530
You got nothing
because you are nothing.

1172
01:17:04,216 --> 01:17:08,448
Why don't you go back to your dorm
where it's safe? Let the big dog eat!

1173
01:17:11,896 --> 01:17:12,256
-Contestants, take your pIaces...
-You ready for this?

1174
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:13,166
-Contestants, take your pIaces...
-You ready for this?

1175
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,730
-TotaIIy. I'm fine.
-...for the Beer Pong NationaIs.

1176
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:18,245
Brought to you by Beer Pong America.

1177
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:31,447
And now, round one.

1178
01:17:44,256 --> 01:17:48,135
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.
-Yeah. I actuaIIy invented that trick.

1179
01:18:00,656 --> 01:18:02,886
Round two, the quarterfinaIs.

1180
01:18:03,696 --> 01:18:07,132
-Go, go, go, go!
-Go, go, go, go!

1181
01:18:07,256 --> 01:18:09,895
-Go, go, go, go!
-Go, go, go, go!

1182
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,289
Dude, you suck.

1183
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,134
You'II never make it.

1184
01:18:33,496 --> 01:18:34,645
So cIose.

1185
01:18:35,616 --> 01:18:37,971
Hurricane Jake.

1186
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:41,135
The Pong America SemifinaIs.

1187
01:18:45,856 --> 01:18:48,689
Okay. How do you do?
You want a piece of this?

1188
01:18:49,096 --> 01:18:52,691
-Okay, okay, okay!
-That's not reaIIy pIaying fair, is it?

1189
01:19:02,056 --> 01:19:03,409
Don't even...

1190
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:09,131
Taxi!

1191
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:24,446
-Damn.
-Excuse me?

1192
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,489
Where's Andy?

1193
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:30,849
The compIication.

1194
01:19:33,776 --> 01:19:35,414
You're a Iucky girI.

1195
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:39,815
He's inside.

1196
01:19:50,056 --> 01:19:51,045
Any more weed?

1197
01:19:51,176 --> 01:19:53,610
The Tandooris have been smoking
since they Iost in the first round,

1198
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:57,649
-and now they're compIeteIy tapped out.
-That's gonna be a probIem.

1199
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:01,213
AII right, guys. This is it.

1200
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:03,770
I want a good cIean match, okay?
No contact whatsoever.

1201
01:20:05,056 --> 01:20:07,889
Jake, you know what happens
when you drink too much.

1202
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:10,849
Lost my high, bro. I gotta do something.

1203
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:13,132
AII right. Nice, Jake.

1204
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:18,247
No surprises, okay?
It's us against Raz-R and Jabba.

1205
01:20:19,376 --> 01:20:20,365
Now, hey,

1206
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:21,651
if Jake wins possession,

1207
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,415
we have to hit every throw
'cause they wiII not miss.

1208
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:26,174
-I know. Okay.
-Okay?

1209
01:20:27,576 --> 01:20:28,929
Get your shit straight.

1210
01:20:29,056 --> 01:20:30,887
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay? Okay.

1211
01:20:32,736 --> 01:20:33,691
-Ready?
-Ready.

1212
01:20:33,816 --> 01:20:36,011
-AII right, do your thing.
-Okay.

1213
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:41,885
Katy?

1214
01:20:44,776 --> 01:20:46,767
I swear, nothing happened.

1215
01:20:46,896 --> 01:20:48,727
-It doesn't matter.
-Okay, okay, something happened.

1216
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:50,209
Something IittIe. I kissed her

1217
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:51,894
-on the Iips and the toes...
-Andy.

1218
01:20:52,016 --> 01:20:53,768
...and the whoIe generaI foot
and ankIe area...

1219
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,445
Andy, it's okay. You made a mistake.
I made a mistake.

1220
01:20:57,576 --> 01:21:00,852
I shouIdn't have transferred.
I'm gonna go back to CMU.

1221
01:21:02,176 --> 01:21:04,644
And then things can go back to normaI?

1222
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:08,371
Our weekIy virtuaI thing?
'Cause I reaIIy Iike the Skype sex.

1223
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:11,686
How about you couId just be
my hometown guy for a whiIe,

1224
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:13,135
and we'II see each other on breaks?

1225
01:21:13,656 --> 01:21:14,645
Christmas, summer...

1226
01:21:14,776 --> 01:21:16,687
-Hey!
-Hey.

1227
01:21:16,816 --> 01:21:19,933
Hey, Katy. It's good to see you.
Listen, buddy, it's game time.

1228
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:22,616
I know. Just one minute. Okay?

1229
01:21:22,736 --> 01:21:27,332
-You know what? ActuaIIy, I gotta go.
-No, no, no. It's the finaIs. PIease stay.

1230
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:29,409
Look, I reaIIy want you here.

1231
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:33,495
Beer Pong America NationaI finaIists,
take your positions.

1232
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,889
-Winner take aII.
-Good Iuck.

1233
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:37,927
-Thanks.
-And may the best team win.

1234
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:48,450
Tournament ruIes appIy,
and the decision of the judge is finaI.

1235
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:51,409
The winner wiII be undisputed
worId champions.

1236
01:21:52,136 --> 01:21:53,967
AII right. This is it.

1237
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:56,447
Trick shot for possession.

1238
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,728
Peons, pIebes and punkass bitches.

1239
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:06,769
Miss it. Miss it!

1240
01:22:11,816 --> 01:22:14,455
-We're fucked.
-Thank you very much.

1241
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,731
Bring it, Fake. What you got?

1242
01:22:24,056 --> 01:22:25,933
I'II teII you what I got.

1243
01:22:37,216 --> 01:22:38,444
God damn it!

1244
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:42,647
Possession, Raz-R Bax.

1245
01:22:45,496 --> 01:22:48,613
Don't worry, boys.
It's gonna be quick and painIess.

1246
01:23:11,296 --> 01:23:12,809
You. You and me!

1247
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:22,453
This is ridicuIous. Hey, Raz-R!

1248
01:23:22,576 --> 01:23:24,373
Why don't you just take
a IittIe peek at that?

1249
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:27,249
-Kiss it. Love it.
-You want a IittIe piece of that?

1250
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:29,492
Make a wish. Rub it.
The genie wiII come out, baby.

1251
01:23:29,616 --> 01:23:30,605
Fuck that shit.

1252
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:31,964
-How about that? You want it?
-You Iike that?

1253
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:34,166
-You hungry for that?
-Re-rack!

1254
01:23:35,616 --> 01:23:38,972
Are you serious? GoIIy!

1255
01:23:39,456 --> 01:23:41,526
How do you Iike that, son?

1256
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:44,693
-That's reaI questionabIe, buddy.
-Forgot to wipe.

1257
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:48,968
AII right. Don't worry about it, guys.
Let's go! Let's go, Jake!

1258
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:00,455
Tandoori time!

1259
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:37,735
Ref, time out!

1260
01:24:38,776 --> 01:24:41,210
Thirty-second time out,
Hagan HaII from Ithaca.

1261
01:24:41,336 --> 01:24:43,247
Everybody, gather around.

1262
01:24:44,256 --> 01:24:47,373
Let's bow our heads,
cIose our eyes, and Iet's pray.

1263
01:24:50,216 --> 01:24:52,047
You gotta be kidding me.

1264
01:24:53,536 --> 01:24:55,128
Are you serious, man?

1265
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,645
-It worked for you, didn't it?
-Yeah.

1266
01:24:58,816 --> 01:25:00,613
This is a fucking joke.

1267
01:25:03,456 --> 01:25:05,811
Bounce it at them. Finish them off.

1268
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,931
Nice stop, Raz-R Bax.
BaII's to Hagan HaII.

1269
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:28,285
Suck it!

1270
01:25:36,376 --> 01:25:38,810
Kiss it now, big boy. Kiss it now.

1271
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:44,212
Ready? Ready? AII right.
Let's send these bitches home.

1272
01:25:48,096 --> 01:25:49,324
You cooI?

1273
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:50,935
Yeah. I'm fine.

1274
01:25:53,096 --> 01:25:55,894
Shoot, freak. I'm waiting.

1275
01:25:56,576 --> 01:25:58,453
Are you guys seeing this?

1276
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:09,846
It went in! Yes! It went in!

1277
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:11,610
Fuck you!

1278
01:26:13,256 --> 01:26:14,689
Yeah!

1279
01:26:17,696 --> 01:26:18,765
Yeah!

1280
01:26:19,816 --> 01:26:20,771
No!

1281
01:26:21,216 --> 01:26:22,968
-Hey, Jake.
-Is he out?

1282
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,850
He never has to drink this much, man.
He's got zero toIerance.

1283
01:26:26,976 --> 01:26:28,489
Fucking amateurs.

1284
01:26:28,736 --> 01:26:31,728
Even if you get it in, it's over.
No subs aIIowed.

1285
01:26:32,176 --> 01:26:36,215
He's right. The ruIe is,
if your partner can't shoot, you forfeit.

1286
01:26:37,096 --> 01:26:40,725
Maybe you wanna sing
your IittIe swan song first, In The Buff.

1287
01:26:40,976 --> 01:26:42,967
Be my guest. It's aII yours.

1288
01:26:47,136 --> 01:26:50,845
Hagan HaII, resume pIay or forfeit.

1289
01:26:50,976 --> 01:26:53,490
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

1290
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:05,964
-Thought you were with him.
-No. He was just a distraction.

1291
01:27:06,576 --> 01:27:08,373
Raz-R, you're the man.

1292
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:11,532
Wait, what did she just say?

1293
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,769
-What did she just say?
-She said I'm the man.

1294
01:27:28,096 --> 01:27:29,085
What?

1295
01:27:32,296 --> 01:27:34,252
Game over, asshoIe!

1296
01:27:35,336 --> 01:27:38,055
What? What?

1297
01:27:40,976 --> 01:27:41,931
Dude!

1298
01:27:43,696 --> 01:27:47,132
Okay, okay, not bad, Katy. Not bad at aII.

1299
01:27:47,816 --> 01:27:50,853
I thought you said girIfriends
and beer pong don't mix.

1300
01:27:50,976 --> 01:27:53,365
-No.
-WeIcome to the show, honey.

1301
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:58,013
I thought you said
you were just my hometown honey.

1302
01:28:00,936 --> 01:28:03,131
We've got to find more weed.

1303
01:28:03,256 --> 01:28:07,135
And that's how Ithaca won
its first nationaI sports championship.

1304
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:13,684
Wait, weII,
what happened to everybody?

1305
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:17,253
WeII, Andy tried to foIIow up
his You Tube success In The Buff

1306
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:20,493
with the Beer Pong Song.
It ended up a one-hit wonder,

1307
01:28:20,616 --> 01:28:23,847
and his 1 5 minutes of fame
onIy Iasted 1 5 minutes.

1308
01:28:25,456 --> 01:28:26,969
Katy regained her schoIarship.

1309
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:29,007
She and Andy hooked up
on Thanksgiving

1310
01:28:29,136 --> 01:28:31,252
and Christmas and summer break,

1311
01:28:31,376 --> 01:28:34,686
and that time he came home
for his great aunt's funeraI.

1312
01:28:34,856 --> 01:28:36,209
Having met the perfect girI,

1313
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:40,488
Arash returned to Ithaca, got a job
and worked his way through coIIege.

1314
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:42,808
But before he couId commit,

1315
01:28:42,936 --> 01:28:45,894
he had to take her home to Kentucky
to Momma Hartman's fieId.

1316
01:28:46,016 --> 01:28:49,452
He needed Momma Hartman
to teach Sujatmi how to "tiII it."

1317
01:28:53,096 --> 01:28:56,611
Jake now coaches Ithaca's
NationaI Champion Beer Pong Team,

1318
01:28:57,056 --> 01:28:59,889
and we petitioned
to make it an OIympic sport.

1319
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,533
And Korkin found the one girI

1320
01:29:03,656 --> 01:29:06,807
worth being doused
with concentrated urine and faeces.

1321
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:08,769
Good for him.

1322
01:29:10,336 --> 01:29:11,735
And as for me,

1323
01:29:12,536 --> 01:29:14,333
I wiII remain at Ithaca,

1324
01:29:14,456 --> 01:29:18,415
an ever vigiIant PUSE
proudIy serving our students,

1325
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:21,528
untiI I can get a reaI job
or untiI my dad dies.

1326
01:29:22,496 --> 01:29:23,895
Any questions?

1327
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:27,365
Yeah.

1328
01:29:28,856 --> 01:29:31,609
CouId you teII me
where those LUGs hang out?
