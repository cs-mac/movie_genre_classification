3
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,208
Gilbert, you'd better get up. They're here.

4
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,752
- I'm up.
- You OK?

5
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,087
- Yeah.
- You sure?

6
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,880
Sure I'm sure.

7
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,302
- You remember the first time you left home?
- Yes.

8
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,429
And I was just as scared as you are.

9
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:01,849
I'm not scared. I just don't like
the idea of leaving you here all alone.

10
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:05,769
Oh, I'll be fine. I was fine
when you went away to computer camp.

11
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,230
Mom, that was just for two weeks.

12
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:13,567
I can take care of myself.
I'm much more worried about you.

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,237
I'm gonna be just fine. Anyways,
I'm not gonna be alone. I got Lewis.

14
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:22,949
Gilbert? Come on, rise and shine.

15
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,826
Dad's waiting outside in the car.
It's all packed.

16
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,411
Hi, Flo. It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

17
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:33,123
It's gonna be a great year.
Now, I figure with lunch and two ARVs,

18
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:37,209
we should be on the road approximately
7 hours, 18 minutes and 7 seconds.

19
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:40,796
- ARVs?
- Average restroom visits.

21
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:44,799
Oh, I'm so proud of you two boys.

22
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,760
Come on, Gilbert. Let's go to college.

23
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:50,386
(braying laugh)

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,413
Hey, Lewis, what time you got?
I'm tryin' to work out our exact ETA.

25
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:28,708
I got two thirty-seven.
Dad, how fast are we going?

26
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:32,127
I've got the old cruise control set at 35.

27
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:07,029
Adams College, home of the Atoms.

28
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:10,073
Gilbert, this is gonna be really neat.

29
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,825
I sure hope so. What if it isn't, huh?

30
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,786
Don't be so negative.
We'll have the time of our lives.

31
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,371
I'm not being negative. I'm being nervous.

32
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:21,124
Don't be, cos everything's gonna be great.

33
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,167
- Just like high school, right?
- This is college.

34
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:28,838
Remember, there are
6,127 students at Adams.

35
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:31,548
- 58 per cent of which are girls.
- So?

36
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,967
So that's 7,107.32 boobs.

37

(braying laughter)

38

You college guys are all alike.
All you really care about is gettin' laid.

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,727
- I wish I was goin' with you.

41
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:59,028
(Lewis) Wow! This campus is awesome.

42
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:05,324
It's a lot bigger than I expected. Maybe
we should have just gone to City Tech, huh?

43
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:10,828
Tech's nothin'. You know Adams has got
the best computer department in the country.

44
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:14,497
Yeah, you're right. Adams is the best.

45
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,601
(Mr Skolnick) Well, boys...
I mean "men"...here we are.

46
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:50,734
What an opportunity for you guys.
You're both gonna do great.

47
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:55,321
I'm proud of you. Your father would
have been proud of you, too, Gilbert.

48
00:04:55,404 --> 00:05:00,784
I know, Mr Skolnick. Don't tell my mother
I was nervous. I wouldn't want her to worry.

49
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,327
- Of course not. Don't sweat it.
- Thanks.

51
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,580
Hey, Lewis, come here. Sit down.

52
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,751
I envy you, Lewis.

53
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:16,462
This is one of the finest institutions
in the country.

54
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,756
You're gonna do fantastic here.

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,218
Try not to break too many hearts.

56
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:26,512
That hasn't been a real problem yet.

57
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,722
Come on, you're gonna make
some lucky girl very happy.

58
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:32,849
You're smart, easy-going.

59
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,643
Got your father's good looks.

(braying laughter)

61
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:41,773
And you got a great sense of humour.
I really believe in you, son.

62
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:45,401
- Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down.
- I know.

63
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:48,445
Gilbert, help me with the trunk.

64
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,908
- Uh, Gilbert?
- Yes, sir?

65
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,869
College isn't like high school.

66
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:01,330
You'll be on your own.
I want you to take care of yourself.

67
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:05,166
I will. Anyway, I won't be alone. I got Lewis.

68
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,626
Besides, we're college men now, right?

69
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,045
- Right.
- Ow.

70

It's easier gettin' it down.

71

Hold it, guys. This is an historic moment.

72

All right, say "cheese".

73

74
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,852
Got it.

75
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,187
Bye, Dad.

76
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,648
Bye. Thanks for the ride.

- Yeah.

- Excuse us.

82
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,555
You know, Gilbert, I feel different already.

83
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,682
Like... more mature.

84
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,100
Looks like we're in for quite a change.

85
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:27,438
I'll say. Parties, meeting new people.
This is really gonna be great.

86

- Where are they?
- I think they're talking about us.

94
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,840
- No way.
- Nerds!

95

It's time for stair diving!

- Can't believe we finally made it.

Lewis, if you don't want
the bed by the window, I'll take it.

- Yep. Definite possibilities.

107

Do you think they'd let us put in
a little refrigerator for snacks?

108
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,818
Are you kiddin', Gilbert? We can put
a fridge and a microwave right there.

109
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,988
That'd be a good place
for an entertainment centre, too.

Great.

We'll have the best dorm room on campus.

I don't know about the best.
It'll be the messiest.

This'll be our warning device,
so we don't walk in on each other.

Wait a minute. We're allowed
to have girls in our dorm room?

Not girls, Gil. Women.
We're college men now.

All right, men. I want everybody to listen up.
We're movin' out, and I mean now!

154
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,855
Move it! Move it! Move, move, move!

155
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,776
(jock) Get outta here!

156
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,486
(whistle)

157
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,241
All right, listen up. I'm gonna see to it that
each and every one of you is taken care of.

158
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:05,245
You will be provided with the best possible
food, shelter and accommodation.

159
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:06,746
(laughter)

160
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,666
- We will try to provide you...
- Now let's move it out!

161
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,960
Move it! Move, move, move! Move it!

162
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,128
(jocks jeer)

163
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,965
Move it!

164
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,260
Get outta here!

165
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:28,638
(all chant) Nerds! Nerds!
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

166
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,435
(chanting continues)

167
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,693
(Dean) I know this move
has been sudden for all of you,

168
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:50,447
and you're probably all still very disoriented.

169
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:56,576
I do want to assure you that this move
is in no way permanent. It's only temporary.

170
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:02,915
As you see, we've provided accommodations
for you that are... quite acceptable.

171
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:05,792
It'll be a nice place
for you to enjoy your studies.

172
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,002
(boy) I don't even wanna go to college.

173
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:11,713
You have a special gift.
You need college to develop it.

174
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:13,839
I wanna be with people my own age.

175
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:17,009
You will be with people your own age
when you're older.

176
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:22,096
But you can't drop me off in a gymnasium.
It looks like we're refugees from a war.

177
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,474
We gotta go now, honey.
Your dad has an appointment.

178
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,642
Bye, son.

179
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:31,895
(Dean) It is really very comfortable here.

180
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,649
Is there anyone here with allergies?

181
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,819
Me too. Uh, for those of you
who do have allergies,

182
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:43,238
you can request a foam rubber pillow.

183
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,116
Also, there's a television
for your viewing pleasure.

184
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,993
It is a black and white television.

185
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:55,872
More good news.
Because of the housing situation,

186
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,792
we are allowing the freshman class
to join and live in fraternities.

187
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,918
(all) Yeah!

188
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,921
The fraternities will select
their members tomorrow.

189
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:06,380
(whistle)

190
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:10,216
All right! Enough of this
social bullshit. Grab a cot.

191
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,969
Move it or lose it!

192
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:17,264
(coach) Go, son.

193
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,889
Move!

194
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,517
Move, move, move, move, move!

195
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:32,900
(Dean on PA) And the Delta Kappa Gamma
fraternity has selected as its new members

196
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:36,445
Oliver Scott and Bill Daniels.

197
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,657
(Dean) For those of you
who weren't selected by any fraternities,

198
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,576
you won't be left out in the cold.

199
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:48,829
You can stay here in the gym
for as long as you like.

200
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:53,124
Or at least until basketball season.

201
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,420
Please answer when I call out your names.

202
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:00,922
Poindexter, Arnold.

203
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,259
Latrelle, Lamar.

204
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:07,844
(effeminately) Lamar Latrelle.

205
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,014
Wormser, Harold.

206
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,182
Present.

207
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,808
Takashi, Toshiro.

208
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,186
Ah, here, sir.

209
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,522
Dawson, Dudley.

210
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,565
Call me "Booger".

211
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,609
All right... Booger.

212
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,027
Rakhim, Raj.

213
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,363
Ah, excuse, please,
but why do they call you "Booger"?

214
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,783
I don't know.

215
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,868
Posquito, Lawrence.

216
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,246
Daniels, Paul.

217
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,040
I knew nobody'd pick us, Lewis.

218
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:50,335
Gilbert, it's probably not over yet.
There's a fraternity for us.

219
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:52,420
(Dean) Dooley, Edward.

220
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,922
Yozonski, Yosef.

221
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,637
- Wait a second. Are you sure about this?
- Gilbert, yes. Come on.

222
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,103
(Lewis) Hi, girls.

223
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,897
Are you guys looking to join a sorority?

224
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,815
A sorority?

225
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,400
No!

226
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:26,696
We need some help. We figured pretty girls
like you might be able to suggest a fraternity.

227
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,368
Choosing the right fraternity can be one of
the most important decisions in a man's life.

228
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:36,287
- For sure.
- Guys like you have to choose very carefully.

229
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:39,665
- Definitely.
- Tell us what frat do you think is us.

230
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:43,334
- You guys are Alpha Betas all the way.
- Totally. For sure.

231
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:47,754
What? Wait. Aren't Alpha Betas,
like, all jocks and face men?

232
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:53,050
Yes. But you guys have got that certain
something I know they'd be interested in.

233
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:57,345
- I'll tell 'em you're coming.
- Should we ask for a particular Alpha Beta?

234
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,097
- Stan Gable.
- And you're?

235
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,683
Betty Childs.

236
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,518
Thank you, Betty. Ms Childs.

237
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:10,272
Maybe if you're not busy sometime
we could have a cup of coffee or somethin'.

238
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,566
Come on, pal.

239
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,651
(Gilbert) I can't believe you asked her out.

240
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:20,405
(Lewis) You know, Gilbert, if we get in,
maybe we can have our old room back.

241
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:23,991
- (Gilbert) These guys will never accept us.
- Why wouldn't they?

242
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:28,244
These are the Alpha Betas.
They're the football players.

243
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,997
I don't think Ms Childs
would have sent us over here

244
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,332
if she didn't think we had
a decent chance of getting in.

245
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,377
(door creaks)

246
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,462
- (eerily) Yes?
- Hi.

247
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:45,007
Tell Stan Gable that we're the guys
that Betty Childs sent over.

248
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,634
Follow me, boys.

249
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,802
(door creaks)

250
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,721
Gilbert!

251
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,911
(solemnly) Welcome.

252
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:25,080
(both) Hi.

253
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,999
(Stan) Hey!

254
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:34,003
You guys seem pretty cool.
Take these for later.

255
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:39,424
Rubbers? What do we need rubbers for?

256
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,676
(sheep bleats)

257
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:47,097
(Stan) Let the initiation begin.

258
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:50,641
(jock) Have you ever made love to a woman?

259
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:51,684
- Yes.
- No.

260
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,601
- No.
- Yes.

261
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,604
(jocks) Liars!

262
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,523
(TV) All right, let's go for the burn.

263
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:02,191
(horrible tuneless scraping)

264
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:10,365
- OK, Takashi, whaddaya got?
- Oh, I think I have a frush.

265
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:13,325
- What the fuck is a "frush"?
- A frush.

266
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,369
I got two sevens,
and two sevens beats a frush.

267
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,829
Oh, thank you.

268
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:20,831
(tuneless violin playing continues)

269
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,966
- Oh!
- Jesus.

270
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,721
(violin stops)

271
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:49,645
So, getting into a fraternity can be the most
important thing in a man's life, huh?

272
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:53,189
You know, that cheerleader set us up, Lewis.

273
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:57,443
I really don't think Betty Childs
is that kind of person, Gilbert.

274
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,988
Hey, Lewis?

275
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,156
What is it, Gilbert?

276
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,452
I'm really sorry that I snapped at you.
This gym's really gettin' to me.

277
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,745
It's OK. I understand.

278
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:16,041
Tomorrow morning we'll find
a better place to live, OK?

279
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:19,043
- Good night, Gilbert.
- Good night, Lewis.

280
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,879
- Good night, Lamar.
- Good night, Wormser.

281
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:26,757
- Good night, Takashi.
- Good night, Poindexter.

282
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,925
- Good night, Booger.
- (loud belch)

283
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,345
(all laugh)

284
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:37,474
(thud)

285
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:48,273
Hey, take it easy. The computer's your friend.

286
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:50,734
I wasn't meant to interface with a machine.

287
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,569
Well, you're just beginning. Relax.

288
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:57,113
It's no use. It's inhuman.

289
00:22:57,197 --> 00:23:00,574
It's not inhuman.
Only humans can be inhuman.

290
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:03,327
Here, let me show you.

291
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,415
Working with a computer's great.

292
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,876
I mean, it's godlike, in a way,

293
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,796
cos you can have complete control.

294
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:21,508
- That's good.
- Thanks.

295
00:23:23,592 --> 00:23:27,845
You know, some people,
they can create with their hands.

296
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,141
But when you're working with a computer,
you gotta build something with your mind.

297
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,270
If you're good, you can do somethin'
no one's ever seen before.

298
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:41,314
It's a definite high.

299
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,364
Uh... what's your name?

300
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,991
- Judy.
- Hi, Judy. Gilbert.

301
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,994
- (Judy) Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

302
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,709
- Hello, Lewis.
- Hi, Gilbert.

303
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,670
- Did you find a house?
- No.

304
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,880
I met a girl.

305
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:15,173
Gilbert!

306
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:18,718
- Her name's Judy.
- Judy's a nice name, Gilbert.

307
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:22,721
- Yeah. She's a nice girl.
- Big deal. Did you get in her pants?

308
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:26,474
- She's not that kind of a girl.
- Why? Does she have a penis?

309
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:33,396
You gonna eat this?

310
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,819
- Smell this one, nerd.
- Oh, Coach, Coach.

311
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:45,280
I got to find a place to live.
Is OK I leave early?

312
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,782
No.

313
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,200
Oh, OK.

314
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:51,744
- You know karate?
- No.

315
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,703
Good.

316
00:24:56,956 --> 00:25:00,208
I've programmed him with
all the rental units in the area.

317
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:04,253
For optimum efficiency,
I've assigned each of you a part of the list.

318
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,882
This'll prevent doubling up.
We'll be able to blanket the area in no time.

319
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,091
Booger.

320
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,677
Wormser.

321
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,387
Toshiro.

322
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:24,977
(speaks Japanese)

323
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,980
(replies in Japanese)

324
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,483
Nerd!

325
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:45,118
- Hi.
- All right?

326
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:48,120
- Mr Wilson?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,165
Just checking.

328
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,250
(woman) Hi there, big boy.

329
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:59,045
Hi. I came about the room for rent.

330
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:03,298
It's right next to mine.
It'll be perfect for us.

331
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,594
(buzzer)

332
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,932
(man) Who's there? What do you want?

333
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:17,643
- Is this the Stewart residence?
- Why are you here? What do you want?

334
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:20,645
- I've come about the room.
- Go away.

335
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:22,939
- Do you have a room to rent?
- Not for rent.

336
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,482
- I thought it was for rent.
- Fuck off.

337
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:35,532
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Gilbert.

338
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:37,950
- How are you?
- Fine. Where are you going?

339
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,786
I gotta go find a place to live.

340
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,290
- It's horrible you having to live in the gym.
- Oh, yeah, well...

341
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:48,792
- What is that? Is that yours?
- It's my accordion.

342
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,003
- You play the accordion?
- Yeah.

343
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,254
- I love the accordion.
- Really?

344
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:56,881
- Are you very good, or?
- No, not really.

345
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,551
I'm on my way to class.
Do you wanna walk with me?

346
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:02,219
Yeah, sure. Oh, no. Here, let me get it.

347
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,019
- I think I found a house.
- (nerds cheer)

348
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:15,521
(Booger) About fuckin' time!

349
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,360
Isn't it fantastic?

350
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:26,654
(? "One Foot In Front Of The Other"
by Bone Symphony)

351
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:50,673
(imitates Dracula) Welcome.

352
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:13,149
- Are you feeling anything yet, Takashi?
- Oh, Booger, I feel nothing.

353
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:15,734
You better have another hit.

354
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,619
Oh, this counter. Could be good.

355
00:28:38,627 --> 00:28:40,503
Agh!

356
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:47,050
- Feeling anything now?
- Oh, no.

357
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:51,553
I feeling... nothing... at all.

358
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,515
How about now?

359
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:25,705
I can't believe what
they've done to that house.

360
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,623
That's amazing.

361
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:33,335
- Looks terrific, doesn't it, Stan?
- Yeah, well, it won't look terrific for long.

362
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:37,297
What are you lookin' at, nerd? Huh?

363
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:44,803
I thought I was looking at my mother's
old douche bag, but that's in Ohio.

364
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:48,097
Seven and eight. And stretch those arms.

365
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,683
Come on. Looks great. Come on, Wormser.

366
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,772
- Morning, Poindexter.
- Uh.

367
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:04,276
Agh! Excuse me.

368
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:11,032
Ah, thank you very much.

369
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,785
OK, Takashi, show me your cards.

370
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:18,495
OK. Two and four kings. That's good, yes?

371
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:22,040
No, you got too many kings.
So you gotta get rid of these here.

372
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:27,377
Take three of these kings out,
and replace them with... three fresh cards.

373
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:30,213
Oh, OK. Thank you.

374
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:34,090
- (Toshiro) When do I deal?
- (Booger) You gotta win a hand first.

375
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:37,177
I told you we'd find a better place.

376
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,471
Yeah. This is way better than the dorm.

377
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,766
(motorcycle drives away)

378
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:53,105
It says "Nerds get out."

379
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:55,233
What is a nerd?

380
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,400
We are.

381
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:02,947
I don't know what this world is comin' to.
You see that man over there?

382
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,823
We arrested him for mopery.

383
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:10,869
- What's mopery?
- Exposing yourself to a blind person.

384
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:16,624
I'm sorry about your windows, fellas.
It's out of my jurisdiction.

385
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:21,378
Sounds like a fraternity prank. There's only
one organisation that can handle this.

386
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:23,963
What organisation is that?

387
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:27,090
The Greek Council.

388
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:31,343
(Dean) Our next order of business:
New membership.

389
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:34,137
Earl, show the petitioners in, please.

390
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:45,312
(sniggering)

391
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,940
Shh!

392
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,069
Kneel, gentlemen.

393
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:03,869
You are the gentlemen
who wish to form a fraternity?

394
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:06,036
(nerds) Yes, sir.

395
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,042
Gentlemen,
as president of the Greek Council,

396
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:17,671
I'm sorry to inform you
that your membership has been denied.

397
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:20,047
Excuse me, but... why?

398
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:24,676
According to our charter, you must
have a national fraternity as your sponsor.

399
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,887
Do you have one?

400
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,596
(all) No.

401
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,017
- I'm afraid he's right.
- But with a national sponsor, we're in, right?

402
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,770
Right, right. So I guess
we'll see you in about, say... 20 years.

403
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:41,189
(laughter)

404
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:44,858
(tuneless scraping)

405
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:52,239
"Dear sirs, thank you for applying
to Delta Kappa Gamma."

406
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:56,492
"We have gone over your application,
and it wasn't even close."

407
00:32:57,327 --> 00:33:01,121
"In the future, we recommend
that you not include a group photo."

408
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:05,541
That's 29 rejections so far.
Did we send pictures to everybody?

409
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,878
Yeah. Everybody except for...
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

410
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:14,131
Here's one that will see us.

411
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,049
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda?

412
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:19,385
Yeah. They're gonna love us.

413
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:27,016
As you know, we have
no chapter at Adams College,

414
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,643
which is why we agreed to see you.

415
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:35,564
But I must tell you, gentlemen, you have
very little chance of becoming Tri-Lambdas.

416
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:38,900
I'm in a difficult situation here.

417
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,610
I mean, after all...

418
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,154
you're nerds.

419
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:51,409
According to your bylaws,
you have to take us on a 60-day trial basis.

420
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,537
- I beg your pardon?
- According to your bylaws...

421
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,875
He's right, UN. Any group that petitions
can become a probationary Tri-Lamb chapter.

422
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,044
May I see that, please?

423
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,047
Thank you.

424
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:17,471
Well, gentlemen...
you are now probationary Tri-Lambs.

425
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:20,974
- Hey.
- Great, UN. Why don't we have a party?

426
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:26,478
You can celebrate with us and observe us
to make sure we're Tri-Lamb material, OK?

427
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:28,522
- Great.
- We won't let you down.

428
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:32,400
We'll have the highest grade-point
average of any chapter you've got.

429
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:38,320
We certainly won't discriminate. Our chapter
will be open to people of all races and creeds.

430
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,739
And sexual orientation.

431
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,075
Wonderful.

432
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:47,119
(door bell)

433
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,208
Hi. Remember me?

434
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,335
- No.
- Well, we're having a party Saturday night.

435
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,588
Would you like to come?

436
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:02,173
- No.
- Oh, well...

437
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:04,841
(girls'laughter)

438
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:07,093
Come on, get it up! Get it up! C'mon!

439
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:10,429
You're shit! You're nothin'!
You're scum! You suck!

440
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:13,097
- You're nice!
- No, I'm not!

441
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,308
- Stan?
- Attaway, Ogre.

442
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:18,518
- What's up, Betty? Is somethin' wrong?
- Yeah.

443
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:21,896
- What?
- One of those nerds just asked me out.

444
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:25,316
- Which one?
- I don't know. They all look alike to me.

445
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:28,610
- Yeah.
- They can't get any dates for their party.

446
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:32,821
- Oh, yeah?
- I'll eat their ancestors. I'll kill their parents!

447
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:37,575
No, Ogre. Ogre! Don't worry about it.
Wait a second. Just wait a second.

448
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:42,329
Maybe we could help 'em out.

449
00:35:42,412 --> 00:35:44,246
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

450
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,708
And I know just what to do.

451
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,334
Come here.

452
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:59,509
We'll put the bar here, the hors d'oeuvres
over there, and we'll pass the cheese puffs.

453
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,593
- Oh, good.
- That sounds expensive.

454
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:06,263
This party's important. If we don't impress
the Tri-Lambs, we'll never get in.

455
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:10,683
- Maybe we can have robster craws.
- What the fuck are "robster craws"?

456
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:14,311
- Have any of you got dates, besides Gilbert?
- I do.

457
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:17,648
- Yeah, but that's with a guy.
- What about you, Booger?

458
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:21,025
I've been out combing
the high schools all day.

459
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:25,070
- Maybe we should cancel the party.
- No, we can't cancel the party.

460

00:51:27,098 --> 00:51:29,476
- You got other angles?
- Something else?

617
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:32,937
- Go to their room.
- Yeah.

618
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,274
- That's her.
- Go to the right. Go to the right.

619
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,652
Arnold, that's the girl we saw.

620
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:44,153
- (Lewis) Go up.
- (Lamar) Up?

621
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:47,782
Wait a second. Hold it there, Lamar.
Don't move the camera.

622
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:49,491
(Toshiro) Oh!

623
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,368
(nerds) Ah!

624
00:51:54,787 --> 00:51:57,580
I drink to that.

625
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:02,960
- (Booger) Oh, yes. I like that nightie.
- (Toshiro) Oh, that's very good.

626
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:06,712
- (Lewis) Can you go in that room?
- (Lamar) Yeah.

627
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:08,881
(nerds snigger)

628
00:52:09,715 --> 00:52:12,133
(Toshiro) Oh, here she comes.

629
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:15,386
God! Take your towel off, please.

630
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:19,097
(Lewis) Oh, yes!

631
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,391
Is she cold in there, or what?

632
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:23,642
(braying laugh)

633
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,940
(Gilbert) Focus!

634
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:39,655
This is bullshit. I want bush. Pan down.

635
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:42,865
(nerds cheer)

636
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:46,201
We've got bush. We've got bush.

637
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:48,120
Oh, hair pie!

638
00:52:48,203 --> 00:52:51,038
(all laugh)

639
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:53,374
Agh!

640
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:11,512
I'm tired of watching 'em brush their teeth.
See if Betty's up. Dooley, throw me a beer.

641
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:13,973
Thanks.

642
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,851
Oh, I getting tired of Betty.

643
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:20,060
Are you kidding? Zoom in.

644
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:26,274
I could never get tired of Betty. How could
you ever get tired of that ass, Takashi?

645
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:29,192
Oh, I see your point.

646
00:53:31,695 --> 00:53:33,988
Are you guys still watching the Pis?

647
00:53:34,071 --> 00:53:36,490
- (all) Yes.
- Have you been up all night?

648
00:53:36,574 --> 00:53:38,074
Yes.

649
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:42,202
- Wormser, haven't you had enough?
- No.

650
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:46,039
(Lewis) I think we got even with the Pis.

651
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,584
Now we got a little score to settle
with the Alpha Betas.

652
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,377
(braying laugh)

653
00:53:55,796 --> 00:53:59,049
- Shit! Hank, what is that stuff?
- Liquid Heat.

654
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:03,636
- It burns.
- You ought to feel it when I don't dilute it.

655
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,809
(Toshiro) Get them.

656
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:16,063
Make a pile here.

657
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:24,694
(Toshiro) OK. Here goes.

658
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:29,531
OK. Don't touch, now.

659
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:34,952
- (Gilbert) Here, hit this one.
- (Toshiro) OK. Looks like salad.

660
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:39,247
The key to each season is homecoming.

661
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:44,251
You win that one,
you got your alumni support.

662
00:54:44,334 --> 00:54:47,753
You got your alumni support,
you get that jock dorm,

663
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:50,965
you get the laundry money,
you get the new cars.

664
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:56,843
Now, this season started out fine -
we won some big ball games.

665
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,263
But we were lucky.

666
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:03,140
We can't get soft.
We can't sit back on our laurels.

667
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:06,476
We win homecoming, we take league.

668
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,603
We take league, we get a bowl bid.

669
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:12,147
It's as simple as that.

670
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:15,608
But, gentlemen, you have got to want it.

671
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:18,777
- Do you want it?
- (jocks yell) Yeah!

672
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:21,113
- I can't hear you.
- Yeah!

673
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:24,323
We can't let up. We gotta stay tough.

674
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:27,117
You can do it. You can do it.

675
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:29,953
You can do it. You can do it.

676
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,997
You gotta believe that you can do it!

677
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,667
- You gotta let them know that you want it!
- I want it!

678
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,626
- Good.
- (groans)

679
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,795
Shower up!

680
00:55:41,879 --> 00:55:44,463
(jocks groan in pain)

681
00:55:45,506 --> 00:55:48,009
Shit. We forgot to practise.

682
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:52,803
- You put what?
- (Gilbert) Liquid Heat.

683
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:56,015
- On their what?
- In their jocks.

684
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,766
- That's outrageous.
- Are you angry, UN?

685
00:56:00,185 --> 00:56:03,687
No. I'm not angry.

686
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:07,565
I'm glad to see you nerds...
you guys finally fought back.

687
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:11,484
You'd make a fine addition to Tri-Lambda.
I want to welcome you aboard.

688
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,029
- Congratulations.
- All right!

689
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:18,282
- You'll tell the guys?
- Oh, I will. (braying laugh)

690
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:21,367
OK, everybody ready?

691
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:23,911
OK, I focus now.

692
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,538
I set timer.

693
00:56:26,622 --> 00:56:29,957
- Now say "Hi, UN."
- (all) Hi, UN.

694
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:38,255
(Lewis) Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to UN Jefferson,

695
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:43,384
who, in his ultimate wisdom,
chose to accept us

696
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,720
into our new fraternity,
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

697
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,305
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda.

698
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:03,483
Before we take this matter to a vote,
I would like it clearly stated in the record...

699
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:05,443
Miss Childs...

700
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:10,364
that the evidence is
overwhelmingly against the Alpha Betas,

701
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,407
and I urge that they be found guilty.

702
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:15,575
Point of order.

703
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,579
Dean Ulich, I am an Alpha Beta,

704
00:57:20,663 --> 00:57:23,332
and I know that no member of my fraternity

705
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:28,044
could have perpetrated such
a callous, heinous act against the nerds...

706
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:30,337
or the Tri-Lambs.

707
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,174
Therefore, I feel a vote at this time
would be, shall we say, premature.

708
00:57:35,258 --> 00:57:37,509
- Premature?
- Yes.

709
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:39,761
You see, instead,

710
00:57:39,845 --> 00:57:44,557
I am going to organise a special,
blue-ribbon, fact-finding commission,

711
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,810
made up of myself and... Miss Betty Childs.

712
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:52,187
We will get to the bottom
of this dastardly deed.

713
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:56,482
- Wait a minute, you can't get away with this.
- Oh, no, I'm afraid I can.

714
00:57:56,566 --> 00:58:01,653
You see, only the president
of the Greek Council can call a vote.

715
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:04,697
- That's completely unfair.
- This is bullshit!

716
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,574
Meeting adjourned.

717
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:17,456
Guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake
as long as Stan Gable is president.

718
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,209
The only way to become president
is to win the homecoming carnival.

719
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:25,337
That's right, Arnold. And that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

720
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,548
(fanfare)

721
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:36,138
I take great pleasure in officially opening
this year's homecoming carnival.

722
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,598
(cheering)

723
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:49,899
(Dean) The overall winner
will be determined by total points from:

724
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:52,734
Number one - field events,

725
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:56,320
number two - the charity fund-raising booth,

726
00:58:56,403 --> 00:59:01,199
and number three -
the musical show and skit competition.

727
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:04,910
And now, let the games begin!

728
00:59:04,993 --> 00:59:08,330
(cheering and fanfare)

729
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:19,296
OK. The object of the race
is to complete 20 laps around the track,

730
00:59:19,379 --> 00:59:22,548
while stopping every lap
for a mandatory pit stop,

731
00:59:22,632 --> 00:59:25,510
at which time the driver will chug a beer.

732
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,845
You don't have a fucking chance, nerd.

733
00:59:28,929 --> 00:59:32,556
- Oh, thank you. Good luck to you, too, Burke.
- Fuck off.

734
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:35,767

You got 'em! Kick his ass!

742
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:25,639

Come on!

745
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:41,609
- One more lap.
- It's just you and the Alpha Betas.

746
01:00:41,693 --> 01:00:45,571
- Danny, let that nerd beat you, you're nothin'!
- No sweat.

747
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:48,907
- He no stand no chance now.
- Go, Takashi!

748

Go on! Let's go, Burke!

Oh, no!

750

755

Times are changin', Betty.
These nerds are a threat to our way of life.

756
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:31,690
If they win homecoming,
they'll take over the Greek Council.

757
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:34,442
And we'll be up to our necks in nerd shit!

01:03:46,335 --> 01:03:47,503
Ooh, ah...

772
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:50,172
(Coach) On your mark. Set.

773
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:52,840
(whistle)

774
01:03:55,926 --> 01:03:58,428
You win.

775
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:06,225
(Dean chuckles)

776
01:04:12,522 --> 01:04:18,152
I'm not too wild about this next event,
but it has become a tradition here at Adams.

777
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:19,861
The belching contest.

778
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:25,574
Our first of two finalists,
Frederick W Polowoski.

779
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,952
Ogre You Asshole.

780
01:04:30,745 --> 01:04:32,621
Ogre.

781
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:40,044
(belches loudly and long)

782
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,796
(cheering and applause)

783
01:04:53,887 --> 01:04:58,432
And, from the Lambda-Mu team,
Dudley Dawson.

784
01:04:58,516 --> 01:05:00,601
- Booger.
- Booger.

785
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:10,776
(belches louder and longer)

786
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:31,417
Our next event goes all the way back to
the Peloponnesian War - the javelin throw.

787
01:06:08,737 --> 01:06:11,448
- All right, baby!
- What did you expect?

788
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:14,074
You won it.

789
01:06:14,158 --> 01:06:16,243
(laughter)

790
01:06:19,662 --> 01:06:22,497
- (Gilbert) Wait for Lamar's throw.
- (Judy) How come?

791
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:26,292
Wormser's a master at aerodynamics.
He designed the javelin to fit

792
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,961
with Lamar's limp-wristed throwing style.

793
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:34,298
(? Parody of music from "Chariots of Fire")

794
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,401
Wormser, it worked!

795
01:07:00,485 --> 01:07:02,779
I can't believe it. Did you see that?

796
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,078
I love you all. I love you all.

797
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,245
Thank you. Thank you.

798
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:24,337
(Dean on PA) The Alpha Beta-Pi team leads.
The Lambda-Mus are a surprising second.

799
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:28,048
Now let's see what happens
at the charity fund-raising booths.

800
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,883
Eat a Pi for charity. C'mon, let's go!

801
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,349
Take a break, Chip.

802
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,186
Hi.

803
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,731
- Hi, Betty.
- A nerd.

804
01:07:51,274 --> 01:07:56,237
- I'm not kissing a nerd.
- You have to. I've paid my money.

805
01:07:57,821 --> 01:08:00,240
It's time for my break.

806
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,242
Kiss this, nerd.

807
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:06,494
- (Betty) Stan?
- Yeah?

808
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:11,915
I wanna do it.
All this kissing's made me horny.

809
01:08:11,998 --> 01:08:14,583
God, Betty. You're like a goat.

810
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,172
Next.

811
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:51,779
Stan!

812
01:08:55,157 --> 01:08:57,242
Changed your mind.

813
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:02,371
I'm glad. Come on.

814
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:11,794
(Lewis mimics Darth Vader's breathing)

815
01:09:23,429 --> 01:09:26,014
D'you wanna do it on the moon?

816
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,822
Take off your mask.

817
01:09:47,906 --> 01:09:49,991
Oh, Stan.

818
01:09:50,075 --> 01:09:52,368
You're so kinky.

819
01:09:57,246 --> 01:10:01,500
(Booger) Eat a Pi for charity.
C'mon, step right up. C'mon, step up.

820
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:05,294
Eat Pi for charity. Thank you very much.

821
01:10:05,378 --> 01:10:07,046
Eat a Pi for charity.

822
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:12,424
- Gable, how we doing?
- Great. 1258 bucks. Better than last year.

823
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:16,220
- The nerds are over 2,000.
- For selling pies?

824
01:10:16,303 --> 01:10:20,223
They got a line around the corner.
Guys are buying two, three pies apiece.

825
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:24,559
There's something fishy about these pies.
C'mon, let's go check it out.

826
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:36,652
This can't be. Ogre, go get a pie.
Find out what the hell's goin' on here.

827
01:10:40,196 --> 01:10:42,699
Thanks, wimp. Get yourself one.

828
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:47,451
- Well? How is it?
- Good.

829
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,246
- Is it good or is it great?
- It's good.

830
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,914
Just good?
Then what they sellin' so many for?

831
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,000
This why. Uh-oh.

832
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,339
That's my Pi.

833
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:14,347
Oh, Stan!

834
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,850
That was wonderful.

835
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:20,102
You did things to me
you've never done before.

836
01:11:20,185 --> 01:11:21,770
(gasps)

837
01:11:21,854 --> 01:11:24,439
- You're that nerd!
- Yeah.

838
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:28,483
God, you were wonderful.

839
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,444
Thanks.

840
01:11:31,944 --> 01:11:35,739
- Are all nerds as good as you?
- Yes.

841
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:37,574
How come?

842
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:40,242
Cos all jocks think about is sports.

843
01:11:41,201 --> 01:11:43,704
All we ever think about is sex.

844
01:11:45,496 --> 01:11:48,415
- What's your name?
- Lewis.

845
01:11:48,498 --> 01:11:54,629
Lewis... would you meet me
after the pep rally tonight?

846
01:11:54,712 --> 01:11:56,589
Sure.

847
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:06,554
(Dean on PA) It's all tied up. The musical
and skit competition will decide the winner.

848
01:12:06,638 --> 01:12:09,432
So, let the music begin!

849
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:13,852
? Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

850
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:16,145
? Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

851
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,814
? Life is but a dream

852
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:22,734
(cheering and applause)

853
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:28,279
What did the Pink Panther say
when he stepped on an ant?

854
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:31,990
(? "Pink Panther" tune) Dead ant. Dead ant.
Dead ant, dead ant, dead ant.

855
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:35,369
What is the dirtiest thing
ever said on television?

856
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:36,452
Tell me.

857
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:40,289
"Ward, I think you were
a little hard on the Beaver last night."

858
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:46,877
(all chant) Gable, Gable, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Burke can.

859
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:50,380
Burke, Burke, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Ogre can.

860
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:51,923
- Gimme an A!
- A!

861
01:12:52,006 --> 01:12:53,675
- Gimme a D!
- D!

862
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:55,550
- Gimme an A!
- A!

863
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:57,219
- Gimme an M!
- M!

864
01:12:57,302 --> 01:12:58,761
- Gimme an S!
- S!

865
01:12:58,844 --> 01:13:01,597
- What's that spell?
- Adams!

866
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:07,559
? They always call him Mr Touchdown

867
01:13:07,643 --> 01:13:11,146
? They always call him Mr T

868
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:14,565
? He can run and kick and throw

869
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:17,276
? Give him the ball and just look at him go

870
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,028
? Hip, hip, hooray for Mr Touchdown

871
01:13:21,112 --> 01:13:23,739
? He's gonna beat 'em today

872
01:13:23,823 --> 01:13:27,242
? So give a great big cheer
for the hero of the year

873
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:30,369
? Mr Touchdown USA

874
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:31,745
Hurrah!

875
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:34,956
(loud cheering and applause)

876
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,262
(? Electronic dance music)

877
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:02,102
(well-played violin riff)

878
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:54,643
? Clap your hands, everybody
And everybody clap your hands

879
01:14:54,726 --> 01:14:59,104
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

880
01:14:59,188 --> 01:15:03,691
? We come here on stage tonight
to do our show for you

881
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:05,984
? We got a rockin' rhythm and a hi-tech sound

882
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,237
? That'll make you move
your body down to the ground

883
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,823
? We got Poindexter on the violin
And Lewis and Gilbert will be joinin' in

884
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:17,410
? We got Booger Presley on a mean guitar
And a rap by little old me, Lamar

885
01:15:17,494 --> 01:15:20,037
? We got Takashi beating on his gong

886
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,247
? The boys and the Mus are clappin' along

887
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,582
? And just when you thought you'd seen it all

888
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,875
? Along comes a Lambda four foot tall

889
01:15:26,959 --> 01:15:29,086
? So, Wormser, come on out here on the floor

890
01:15:29,169 --> 01:15:31,504
? So we can work our bodies
like never before

891
01:15:31,587 --> 01:15:34,423
? Break

892
01:16:04,697 --> 01:16:07,282
(wild cheering and applause)

893
01:16:26,672 --> 01:16:31,050
I'd like to present the trophy
to this year's champions,

894
01:16:31,134 --> 01:16:34,052
Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu.

895
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:45,477
They will be able to select the president
of next year's Greek Council.

896
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,026
I'd like to announce we've made
our selection already. It's Gilbert Lowe!

897
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,782
This sucks! I gotta get rid of this anger.
C'mon, Betty, let's pump iron.

898
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:04,409
No, Stan. I don't think so.

899
01:17:04,492 --> 01:17:08,203
What d'you mean, you don't think so?
C'mon, let's go. Why not?

900
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:11,456
I've got a date with a Tri-Lamb.

901
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:14,125
- A Tri-Lamb!
- Here's your pin.

902
01:17:16,168 --> 01:17:18,170
Take it.

903
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,463
Wait. Betty...

904
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:22,173
C'mon.

905
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:25,717
God! I'm in love with a nerd!

906
01:17:27,427 --> 01:17:30,346
- Gable.
- Yeah, Coach.

907
01:17:30,429 --> 01:17:36,017
I wanna see you and the other girls
in the locker room now!

908
01:17:36,809 --> 01:17:38,310
Yes, sir.

909
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:49,027
You know, when you were
a baby in your crib,

910
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:53,322
your father looked down at you,
he had but one hope -

911
01:17:53,948 --> 01:17:56,699
"Someday my son will grow to be a man."

912
01:17:58,576 --> 01:18:01,119
Well, look at you now.

913
01:18:02,788 --> 01:18:09,251
You just got your asses whipped
by a bunch of goddamn nerds.

914
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,754
Nerds!

915
01:18:15,881 --> 01:18:19,008
Well, if I was you, I'd do something about it.

916
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,887
I would get up and redeem myself

917
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:29,183
in the eyes of my father,
my Maker and my coach!

918
01:18:29,267 --> 01:18:32,018
- Let's get those nerds!
- Nerds!

919
01:18:32,102 --> 01:18:33,603
Nerds!

920
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:36,105
What are we waitin' for?!

921
01:18:43,902 --> 01:18:48,698
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

922
01:18:48,781 --> 01:18:51,908
(chanting) Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

923
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,499
(Stan) Come on!

924
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,252
Come on!

925
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:34,066
I'm a nerd.

926
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:38,111
Welcome to the real world.

927
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:41,030
I never really wanted to believe that.

928
01:19:41,113 --> 01:19:43,824
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

929
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:46,492
We're nothing.

930
01:19:46,576 --> 01:19:48,952
We let them destroy our house.

931
01:19:49,036 --> 01:19:52,705
- We'll control the Greek Council next year.
- Big deal!

932
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,417
You'll be dead by then, Gilbert.

933
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:01,795
Nobody cares. Don't you understand that?
The university doesn't care.

934
01:20:01,879 --> 01:20:04,465
There's nothin' we can do about it.

935
01:20:04,548 --> 01:20:08,259
We got something good goin',
and I won't let 'em take it away from us.

936
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:12,554
Gilbert, don't be a fool.
You'll just get yourself hurt again.

937
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:15,264
- Big deal.
- Gilbert?

938
01:20:21,019 --> 01:20:23,604
(? Brass band plays marching tune)

939
01:20:36,572 --> 01:20:40,368
I'd like to introduce the men
that will bring you a homecoming victory

940
01:20:40,451 --> 01:20:42,994
against State tomorrow.

941
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:45,871
At defensive back,
number 38, Kevin O'Leary.

942
01:20:47,623 --> 01:20:51,167
Offensive guard,
number 64, Rich Valrow.

943
01:20:52,544 --> 01:20:56,046
At centre,
number 53, Harry Reagan.

944
01:20:58,048 --> 01:21:00,341
- Look who's comin'.
- Where you goin'?

945
01:21:00,424 --> 01:21:03,969
You went way too far this time,
and you're not gettin' away with it.

946
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:08,931
Oh, is that right? Well, let's see if shit floats.
What do you think of that idea?

947
01:21:09,014 --> 01:21:12,433
Come on! Put me down!
Goddamn! Put me down!

948
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:15,562
(Stan) Fire away!

949
01:21:15,644 --> 01:21:17,980
Now our tri-captains.

950
01:21:18,897 --> 01:21:24,110
Leading the conference in reception,
at wide receiver, number 84, Danny Burke.

951
01:21:24,484 --> 01:21:29,947
Our defensive captain,
number 79, Fred Polowoski - the Ogre.

952
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:37,245
Now our two-time all-American quarterback,
number ten, Stan Gable.

953
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:45,126
Hold it, son. Hold it, hold it!

954
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:47,836
Leave him alone.
Coach, I said leave him alone.

955
01:21:47,919 --> 01:21:51,005
What did you say?
I'll break his goddamn neck.

956
01:21:51,088 --> 01:21:54,675
You will do nothing of the sort.
Don't touch that boy.

957
01:21:58,595 --> 01:22:00,846
Says who?

958
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:05,975
Says me... you asshole.

959
01:22:07,018 --> 01:22:11,021
Hold it, Coach.
You just hold it right there.

960
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:48,966
OK, kid.

961
01:22:50,301 --> 01:22:52,928
Say what you gotta say.

962
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,888
Thanks.

963
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:07,147
Uh... I just wanted to say that...
that I'm a nerd.

964
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:12,443
And I'm here tonight to stand up
for the rights of other nerds.

965
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:16,947
I mean, all our lives we've been laughed at

966
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,907
and made to feel inferior.

967
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:26,037
And tonight those bastards,
they trashed our house.

968
01:23:27,037 --> 01:23:28,747
Why?

969
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:31,582
Because we're smart?

970
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:34,502
Because we look different?

971
01:23:34,585 --> 01:23:37,212
Well, we're not.

972
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,800
I'm a nerd, and... I'm pretty proud of it.

973
01:23:49,221 --> 01:23:51,098
Hi, Gilbert.

974
01:23:51,974 --> 01:23:54,183
I'm a nerd, too.

975
01:23:55,226 --> 01:23:58,019
I just found that out tonight.

976
01:23:58,103 --> 01:24:00,647
We have news for the beautiful people.

977
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:04,608
There's a lot more of us than there are of you.

978
01:24:05,151 --> 01:24:07,360
I know there's alumni here tonight.

979
01:24:07,444 --> 01:24:12,489
When you went to Adams,
you might have been called a spaz,

980
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:16,742
or a dork, or a geek.

981
01:24:16,826 --> 01:24:19,494
Any of you that have ever felt...

982
01:24:19,578 --> 01:24:23,873
stepped on, left out, picked on, put down,

983
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:28,626
whether you think you're a nerd or not,
why don't you come and join us?

984
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:30,211
Come on.

985
01:24:32,588 --> 01:24:36,507
(? "We are the Champions" by Queen)

986
01:24:36,591 --> 01:24:38,092
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

987
01:24:38,176 --> 01:24:40,802
Just join us, cos, uh...

988
01:24:40,886 --> 01:24:42,387
Hi.

989
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:47,266
(Gilbert) No one's really gonna be free
until nerd persecution ends.

990
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:24,128
You know, Coach, I think I'm gonna let
these boys live over at the Alpha Beta house,

991
01:25:24,212 --> 01:25:27,089
while you and your boys rebuild theirs.

992
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:30,716
- And where the hell are we gonna live?
- What about us, huh?

993
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:33,802
You're jocks, go live in the gym.

994
01:25:35,303 --> 01:25:38,138
(all, softly) Nerd. Nerd. Nerd.

995
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:40,808
(all chant loudly) Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

996
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:43,309
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!
