1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,993
Junior, this is kind
of a sentimental moment.

2
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,913
Cold River is where
I was born and raised.

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,275
Everyone I know is here.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,670
Got fond memories of this place.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,229
Fond memories? What
are you talking about?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,710
Everybody hated you.
Your father, your wife,

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,348
those horrible neighbours...

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,231
You're right. Let's blow this joint!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,434
Yah! Whoo-ha!

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,712
<i>When the pressure's
on and you're all alone</i>

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,358
<i>Take a little ride into the danger zone</i>

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,393
<i>When the moon is high
And the skies are clear</i>

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,032
<i>Just show me a sign
and we'll be outta here</i>

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>Take me up on a wing and a prayer...</i>

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,673
Look.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,753
<i>If you need a friend,
you know... I'll be there</i>

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,269
<i>Hound dogs howlin' all through the night</i>

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,994
<i>Eight miles high and I'm doin' all right</i>

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,673
<i>Better move over 'Cause
you're goin' too slow</i>

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,153
<i>I feel the need for
freedom Now it's time to go</i>

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,357
<i>It's a fine line
between pleasure and pain</i>

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,956
<i>Let your conscience be your
guide Till we meet again</i>

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,755
<i>Your time has come You
can stand or you can run</i>

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,072
<i>But don't keep it all inside</i>

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,197
<i>'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance</i>

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,032
<i>No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...</i>

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,071
We're finally here.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,073
<i>Take me up on a wing and a prayer</i>

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,678
<i>If you need someone,
you know... I'll be there</i>

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,038
<i>Your time has come You
can stand or you can run</i>

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,193
<i>But don't keep it all inside</i>

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,831
<i>'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance</i>

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,028
<i>No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...</i>

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,036
<i>Only the strong survive...</i>

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,760
- Is it the one with the yellow roof?
- No.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,433
- Is it the one with the purple flowers?
- No.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,194
The one with the
"Sold" sign in the yard?

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,952
Bingo!

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,793
<i>Only the strong survive</i>

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,595
Dad, come on. Let's go. Quick!

41
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,269
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
- Look at that hunk.
- Hubba hubba.

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,391
And the realtor says he's single.

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,471
Single?!

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,631
- What do you think, Junior?
- Great.

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,155
Come on! Quick, Dad!

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,199
Whoa! Totally awesome!

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,079
- Radical!
- You like it?

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
Wow! It's fantastic!

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,789
Wait till you see your bedroom.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,919
Yee-ha!

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,356
- Home, sweet home!
- Yeah, that's right!

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,192
This place is gigantic.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,874
You could play football in here.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,474
- Hit me, I'm open.
- Here's the bomb. OK...

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,598
<i>So here we are, starting our new life.</i>

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,228
<i>It's nice having a guy who loves me.</i>

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,234
<i>Usually, people take one look
and run screaming for the hills.</i>

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,520
<i>You know, I think me and Dad
are gonna do all right together.</i>

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,353
Should I spike you? No,
it's illegal to spike kids.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,511
Come here, buddy. It's
just you and me, Junior.

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,871
Hang on a second.
Somebody's at the door.

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,673
Hi, I wanted to welcome you
to our little neighbourhood

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,831
so I baked you a...

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,594
...cherry pie.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,594
That's so sweet. Look, Junior.
She baked us a cherry pie.

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,035
How thoughtful.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,754
All right! First and ten!

69
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,431
Junior! What are you doing?

70
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,558
I want you to apologise
to this kind lady.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,351
Oh! You're even
better-looking up close.

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,679
Excuse me.

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,713
What?!

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,874
- Dad, what about football?
- Thank you.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,555
We can play later. Don't you want
to meet these wonderful ladies?

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,917
Out of the way, girls!
Oh, thank God! Another man!

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,311
Another Joe I can talk to.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,357
I'm going crazy living here.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,593
You know, Mortville. The
divorcee capital of the world.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,470
Anyway, we're having a barbecue. So I thought
I'd be neighbourly and invite you over.

81
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,791
I'm Aron Burger, I live next door.

82
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,714
My name is Ben Healy and
this is my son, Junior.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,075
Funny-looking kid. Anyway,
we'll take this with us.

84
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,391
Well, neighbour, what do
you think of my cooker?

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,632
- Very... large.
- You bet.

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,395
Cost me a whole month's
paycheck, but it's worth it.

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,871
You're not impressed. I guess
your wife does the cooking.

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,190
No, I'm... not married, actually.

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,157
We... broke up.

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,437
And you got the kid? Bad deal!

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,716
Did you get screwed!

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,440
This neighbourhood has a move-in fee.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,398
You have to give each of us ten dollars.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,838
20 bucks?! I'm not
giving you diddly-squat.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,719
Pay us or leave!

96
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,637
And with a 50-1 chick to stud ratio
in this town, you gotta get started.

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,031
Dad, can we go? These
people are real dicks.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,909
Well, excuse me, Your Highness.

99
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,959
I didn't realise that simple little
me and my simple little family

100
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,396
weren't good enough for
your high and mighty tastes.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,997
Hey, I should go and
slip on my silk tuxedo

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,109
<i>and then we can trot out the
champagne and the escargots.</i>

103
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,670
Junior. Try to be
polite. We're his guests.

104
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,193
OK, Dad.

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,636
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,519
We've taken a long trip and
he's just a little tired.

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,717
My girls are the same way. Brats.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,991
Healy, go make yourself useful.

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,674
Get some more barbecue
sauce from the little woman.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,673
Barbecue sauce. Sure thing, neighbour.

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,436
Here's to the start of a beautiful meal.

112
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,758
Damn.

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,111
This one's not getting away.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,513
Gotcha!

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,673
- My first day of school.
- I'm so proud of you.

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,796
You're such a good girl.

117
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,110
Junior, get out of this
car. You are going to school!

118
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,316
No way! I'd rather eat a turd.

119
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,079
Junior,

120
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,028
third grade is the foundation
of a great education.

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,078
If you don't go, you'll
only hurt yourself.

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,515
I'll take a couple others down with me.

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,238
Junior,

124
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,915
I am your father and you'll do as I say!

125
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,877
Now, come on.

126
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,837
Now look what you've done.

127
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,678
Get over here.

128
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,435
Take this. Goodbye and good luck.

129
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,112
It's his first day,
he's a little nervous.

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,279
It's him.

131
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,670
Yes, changing careers was
the smartest thing I ever did.

132
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,150
Yes, oh, yeah! Because I
love being the principal.

133
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,118
Because I hate children. I hate them.

134
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,635
Being a principal's great,
'cause I hate children.

135
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,791
I bark, they do what I say.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,554
Anything. Crawl around on
all fours. They do that.

137
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,349
Would you mind jumping out
of the window? OK, sure.

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,317
<i>Out they go. Anything.</i>

139
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,790
<i>Principal Peabody, there's
a new student to see you.</i>

140
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,349
I'll have to call you back.

141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,718
I have to deal with one of
the little weenies right now.

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
OK, call you back.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,476
Send the little sweetheart in.

144
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,517
Hey, pea-brain. What
are you doing here?

145
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,955
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,510
I belong here. You belong in Cold River.

147
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,353
This is Mortville.
What are you doing here?

148
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,354
You're not here. That's it. That's
the only answer. You're not here.

149
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,593
You're not here. I'm imagining you.
You're a figment of my imagination.

150
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,231
If I was a figment of your
imagination, could I do this?

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,073
Oh!

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,479
Did something crawl in here and die?!

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,438
You disgusting kid!

154
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,717
You disgusting, flatulating kid!

155
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,112
Whoa! I just had a new paint
job, too. This is horrible.

156
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,396
- What grade are you in?
- Third.

157
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,279
Third. That means you're
here for another four years.

158
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,513
This is a mistake. This is a big
mistake, 'cause you are a genius.

159
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,796
You are so intelligent.

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,793
Anyone who can break wind
like that has to have a mind.

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,599
So I'm gonna pass you
on to the sixth grade.

162
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,433
In one year, you're gonna
be in another school.

163
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,798
My dad says third grade is
the foundation of my education.

164
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,714
Your dad says that. Your dad is a moron!

165
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,279
He's a moron!

166
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,273
Know what a moron is?
That's what your dad is.

167
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,638
Anyway, you don't belong here.
You belong in the sixth grade.

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,314
That's where you are,
because you're a genius, kid.

169
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,118
A genius.

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,233
<i>Sixth grade? I Wowl</i>

171
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,756
<i>I should fart in more people's offices.</i>

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,828
Oh, no, not another one. How many
kids are they gonna make me teach?

173
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,238
Get in there and find a
seat. Hustle, small fry.

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,109
I'm not gonna have you hold
up my class all year. Move it.

175
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,396
Let's start with a nice easy review

176
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,314
to see how much you under-achievers
remember from last year.

177
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,277
Polly, what's 17 times 8?

178
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,908
- 136.
- Good.

179
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,197
Richard, what's 72
divided by negative 9?

180
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,237
- Negative 8, sir.
- Fine.

181
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,958
Murph.

182
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,349
Murph. What's three plus two?

183
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,119
Four.

184
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,395
You've been in the sixth
grade since I started here.

185
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,438
I really want to get you out this year.

186
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,388
Please work with me.
What's three plus two?

187
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,959
Nine?

188
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,396
This is gonna be a long year.

189
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,312
Five, all right? The answer's five.

190
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,833
You!

191
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,439
- What are you saying?
- I said five.

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,116
I'm glad somebody's paying attention.
Polly, pass out the workbooks.

193
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,990
I'm gonna rummage in the storage closet,
see if I can find something for Murph.

194
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,838
Who let the baby into the sixth grade?

195
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,839
What's in your bag?

196
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,838
- Your diapers? - No,
my lunch, pin- head.

197
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,839
Little kid doesn't know
who he's talking to.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,831
I'm senior student in this school.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,878
No shit, you've been here since 1970.

200
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,190
Oh, you're gonna hurt!

201
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,830
This is your last day of school. Ever.

202
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,711
<i>Maybe Dad's right. Maybe Mortville
is gonna be a great place to live.</i>

203
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,559
Good morning, Miss Dumore.

204
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,234
They missed a payment?
Toss 'em in the street.

205
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,358
But, ma'am, that's a nursing
home. They're invalids.

206
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,556
Oh,
boo-hoo-hoo.

207
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,280
Are we all set for that charity ball?

208
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,230
Your tickets are confirmed, but Sergio
says he needs money for a new tux.

209
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,118
More money?

210
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,352
I gave him two grand yesterday.

211
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,670
These damned gigolos.

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,434
Every man in Mortville
wants to bleed me dry.

213
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,718
Why can't I just find
a good, decent man?

214
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,192
One with integrity, one
with compassion, one with...

215
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,432
Oh, my God! Who's that beefcake?

216
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,034
I'm Ben Healy, we spoke on the phone.

217
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,112
I don't know. I suppose
he's a customer at the bank.

218
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,350
Out of my way, fat boy.

219
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,640
That's why I wanna start my own business.
I wanna create something out of nothing.

220
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,109
I don't just wanna take. I wanna give.

221
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,078
I wanna put something
back into the community.

222
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,917
He's incredible. And he's just my type.

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,311
Smith, I want you to find
out everything about this guy.

224
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,916
Because I think I've found
myself hubby number seven!

225
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,319
Hi.

226
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,390
- Hey, Junior!
- Hey, Dad!

227
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,233
So, tell me, how was
your first day at school?

228
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,834
Pretty good, they
skipped me three grades.

229
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,278
They skipped you? That's
fantastic! I can't believe it!

230
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,749
I told you you'd hit if off here.

231
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,151
So, tell me. Did you
make any new friends?

232
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,632
Well, how would you
define the word "friend"?

233
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,272
- Aah!
- Uh!

234
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,431
Ow.

235
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,559
Who are you?

236
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,759
I'm Annie Young. I'm the nurse
here at Mortville Elementary.

237
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,831
The children are very lucky.

238
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,677
- I'm sorry. Let me...
- It's OK.

239
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,910
Oh, God. Excuse me. Here, I'll get...

240
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,073
If you two are done fooling
around, maybe we can go home?

241
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,878
Yeah...

242
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,875
Give me a few minutes, Junior. I
think the swelling's coming back.

243
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,996
I'll put a warm compress on that.

244
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,230
You're such a good little soldier.

245
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,516
"Give me a few minutes, Junior."
"Give me a few minutes, Junior."

246
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,399
I've been here for an hour!

247
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,994
Who does that nurse think she is?

248
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,998
Mm...

249
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,515
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

250
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh, it's you. Buzz off.

251
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,231
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

252
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,670
If I were you, I wouldn't do a lot
of things. Like go out in public.

253
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,071
Next time, you'll listen to me.

254
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,949
Oh, my God, he's an Adonis!

255
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,951
Look at these stats!

256
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,792
Six feet tall.

257
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,190
185 pounds.

258
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,319
In-seam, 35 inches.
Sweet Jesus, take me home!

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,433
What's this thing?

260
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,113
His son.

261
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,710
"Boy and convicted
killer go on joyride"?

262
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,070
"Little league team hospitalised"?

263
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,109
"Union Carbide plant explodes"?

264
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,712
This kid's a nightmare.

265
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,235
Do you want to forget the whole thing?

266
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,231
Smith...

267
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,950
When someone has a bum leg,

268
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,475
you don't shoot the patient.

269
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,200
You just cut off the leg.

270
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,793
<i>That's why you want a franchise. Big Ben is the fastest
- growing sports equipment empire.</i>

271
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,871
Hey, it's Big Ben.

272
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,917
<i>Pick up that phone and call now.</i>

273
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,356
<i>For just $399, you can
get one of my starter kits.</i>

274
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,911
<i>Then you'll be on your way to having
it all, just like me, Big Ben Healy.</i>

275
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,196
What's this?

276
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,598
Look at this. What sort of
idiot would send Grandpa money?

277
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,671
<i>That's my namel</i>

278
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,798
- The old man's finally
lost his mind. - Uh-huh.

279
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,159
- Come downstairs. I got a surprise for you.
- All right! A surprise?

280
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,958
- Where is it?
- Down the steps.

281
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,714
Now, where is that surprise?

282
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,996
- Surprise!
- Hi, Junior!

283
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,233
I'm Rhoda, your babysitter.
We're gonna be good friends.

284
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,039
Dad, let's slow this down a minute.

285
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,316
Now, what is going on here?

286
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,756
This is Rhoda, your babysitter.
You're gonna be good friends.

287
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,117
Yeah, I heard that part. But why?

288
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,157
Yoo-hoo!

289
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,231
Because I'm going out on a date.

290
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,991
Hi, Ben. I'm all ready.

291
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,755
Great. Junior, you
remember Debbie Claukinski?

292
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,595
How can I forget? Her
pie gave us the runs.

293
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,873
That's not true. He's thinking
about someone else's pie.

294
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,158
Anyway, we don't want to be late. I got
reservations at the Saint Pierre Club.

295
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,235
Oh, I'm so excited! My ex-husband
never took me to fancy places.

296
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,155
Not that I'm a gal who rattles on about her
last marriage. That guy is insanely jealous.

297
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,709
Dad, stay here and have fun with me.

298
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,871
Junior, you're gonna
have fun with Rhoda.

299
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,909
I'm sure you can think of a lot of fun games
to play with her, OK? I'll talk to you later.

300
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,031
<i>Welcome to the wonderful world of pigs.</i>

301
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,272
<i>Dirty, hungry and always horny,</i>

302
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,796
<i>they're Mother Nature's
clowns of the farm world.</i>

303
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,350
<i>Watching these charming
critters roll in the mud,</i>

304
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,638
<i>it's hard to believe they have an
intelligence as high as some humans.</i>

305
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>But it's true.</i>

306
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,633
<i>Goodnight, Dad.</i>

307
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,360
Hey, brat. Put that back. I'm watching.

308
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,870
<i>This babysitter sucks.</i>

309
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,873
<i>I gotta get Dad back on track here.</i>

310
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,828
<i>I wonder whatever
happened to Mr Claukinski?</i>

311
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,199
Hello?

312
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,751
<i>Are you the guy that was
married to Debbie Claukinski?</i>

313
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,388
Yeah, but then she left me.

314
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,151
She took my house,
my money and my pride.

315
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,999
<i>Well, I thought you'd like to know
that she found herself a new guy</i>

316
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,393
<i>and they're out at the Saint Pierre
Club, having fun at your expense.</i>

317
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,879
Who is this?

318
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,873
<i>Just call me a friend.</i>

319
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,352
Ben, this evening is perfect.

320
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,433
<i>I know why the Mortville Gazette gave
this restaurant three and a half forks.</i>

321
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,636
- Excuse me, we have a dress code.
- Let me in, you fool.

322
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,756
To us.

323
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,592
Tonight.

324
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,830
Ah-ha!

325
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,117
Debbie, you tramp!
What are you doing here?

326
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm a free woman. I can do what I want.

327
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,558
I show you.

328
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,949
Debbie, you leave with me.
Come, we take the bus home.

329
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,759
Like hell I will. I'm on a date.

330
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,117
You home-breaker!

331
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,991
Oh, my kidney!

332
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,230
You bully!

333
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,994
Ben, shame on you!

334
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,635
Laser cannon locked on.

335
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,949
Fire laser cannon.

336
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
Finally, Dad's home.

337
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,391
<i>- I thought you'd never get here.
- Who's that weirdo?</i>

338
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,758
- Gee, baby, you work fast.
- I got Russian hands and Roman fingers.

339
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,275
Now where's that master bedroom?

340
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,715
Here it is, darlin'!

341
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,439
- This ain't no motel.
- Mind your own beeswax, twerp. Go watch TV.

342
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,989
Yeah, what she said.

343
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,719
Voytek, you were always the best.

344
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,359
Yeah.

345
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,155
So much for my first date.

346
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,233
Now what?

347
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,435
All right!

348
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,239
Yeah... go!

349
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,109
Yes! That's great!

350
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,793
Look at that.

351
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,119
I didn't think people could do that.

352
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,669
She ain't no real blonde.

353
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,995
Come on!

354
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,118
Keep it up, my God!

355
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,754
- He's still going!
- Unbelievable.

356
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,073
Yeah, go for it!

357
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,800
Healy, that's hot stuff.

358
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,554
Junior, we're new
here in this community.

359
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,712
Can't we at least attempt to fit in?

360
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,555
Why are you getting angry at
me? I didn't do it, I watched it.

361
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,359
Yes, and so did the
entire neighbourhood.

362
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,351
I didn't hear any complaints.

363
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,676
Great. The evening that wouldn't die.

364
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,879
What?

365
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,231
There's two more outside.

366
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,154
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I thought I'd spend my vacation with you.

367
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,312
- Excuse me?
- How did he find us?

368
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,873
You rascal. I even brought Nippy.

369
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,112
Hey, boy. Come here, Nip.

370
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,271
Get this freak off me! Get!

371
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,752
Don't scare him, for God's sakes.
He's only trying to be friendly.

372
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,071
- You know this dog is unbalanced.
- Get him out of here.

373
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,958
Nippy, stay.

374
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,238
What is going on here?

375
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,996
You never take vacations, and if you
did you wouldn't spend them with me.

376
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,878
Little Ben.

377
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,918
Little Ben, you're my only son.

378
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,993
- Dad, you hate me.
- OK, you figured me out.

379
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,310
- I'm not on vacation, I'm broke.
- You're what?

380
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,916
Chapter 11, my S and L crashed,
my creditors are after me.

381
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,153
- I gotta find a place to hide out.
- Why don't you hide out somewhere else?

382
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,630
Why don't you mind your own
business? Nobody asked you.

383
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,598
Wait, you can't be
broke, we saw you on TV.

384
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,275
That was a big rip-off.
There were no franchises.

385
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,795
Hell, I only sold one starter kit.

386
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,988
I gotta find a place to lay low until
this whole godforsaken thing blows over.

387
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,357
Come on, Little Ben. Do
your old man a favour.

388
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,592
All those years I spent
putting a roof over your head.

389
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,469
I even bribed that dean to
keep you in college, remember?

390
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,871
You know something? You owe me.

391
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,750
This room is a little small.

392
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,674
Well, it's all we've got. You
can sleep in one of the bunk-beds.

393
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,273
Or you can leave.

394
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,556
No, it'll do.

395
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,950
But I get the top bunk.

396
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,116
Finally!

397
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,592
Some educators underestimate
the value of civics,

398
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,955
but I say, for the growing mind,

399
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,556
there's nothing more important
than pride in your city.

400
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,678
This is Highway 39.

401
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,115
This is the Mortville Steel Mill.

402
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,038
And this is Mortville's
very own Love Rock.

403
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,875
When the Dumore family settled this
region, they stole it from the Indians.

404
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,077
The Indians claim the
rock has magic powers.

405
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,753
What kind of magic?

406
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,956
I don't know. Love magic, I guess.

407
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,591
You make a wish and it comes true, at
least that's what they tell the tourists.

408
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,436
Can I get a drink of water?

409
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,397
Yes, you may, but hurry back.

410
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,109
I've got a great slide of the
Rotary Club coming straight up.

411
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,036
Hey, pumpkin-head.

412
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,316
You're gonna wish you never said that.

413
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,072
Oh, yeah?

414
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,271
So, what exactly happened?

415
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,351
I was using the fire hose.

416
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,830
Aha. And why were you doing this?

417
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,312
I told you, a fire had broken out
and I was trying to save the school.

418
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,916
Junior, what happened?

419
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,356
Your son saved the
school. He put out a fire.

420
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,395
Did anyone ask him how
it started? Because...

421
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,318
- I'm so sorry, that's very clumsy of me.
- That's OK.

422
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,559
Listen...

423
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,035
If Junior seems a little
troublesome lately,

424
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,758
I wouldn't worry about it.

425
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,357
He really hasn't made any friends here
yet so he's probably a little insecure.

426
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,919
Boy, you really know kids.

427
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,949
Junior and I were gonna get dinner later

428
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,434
and I thought maybe if you didn't have
any plans that you'd... care to join us.

429
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,750
No, I can't.

430
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,114
Oh, well...

431
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,153
Maybe you and I could do
something Friday night?

432
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,675
I'd like to, but no.

433
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,959
- Saturday?
- No, not any night.

434
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,549
- I've got a problem.
- Excuse me?

435
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,395
- I can't go out with anyone.
- What if we just had dinner...

436
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,313
Dad! Didn't you hear the
lady? She's got a problem.

437
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,349
- Quit buggin' her and let's get out of here.
- Well, I... We'd better go.

438
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,479
Anyway, it was nice
talking to you, Miss Young.

439
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,959
Annie.

440
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,669
It was nice talking to
you, too, Ben. And Junior.

441
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,392
"Can we go out on Friday
night? On Saturday night?"

442
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,312
"How about Sunday night?"

443
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,473
What's Dad's problem?
Doesn't he have any pride?

444
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,518
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

445
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,312
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

446
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,357
I'll have some lemonade.

447
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,273
Certainly, that'll be two dollars.

448
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,519
I've only got a quarter.

449
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,592
Then I guess you're
going thirsty, loser.

450
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,038
Dolly, there's no more
lemonade. Go back and fill it up.

451
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,351
I'm not gonna fill it up.
Why don't you fill it up?

452
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,512
I'm not gonna fill it up.
Why don't you fill it up?

453
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,593
Junior, why don't you
go back and fill it up?

454
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,833
If you do the work, we
might give you a free glass.

455
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,552
OK. I'll go fill it up.

456
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,799
There you go, friends.

457
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,235
You only filled it halfway.

458
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,913
I tried my best.

459
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,868
That's not good enough. For that,
you don't get your free glass.

460
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,270
That's OK by me.

461
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,631
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

462
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,553
Boy, oh, boy. It sure is hot.

463
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,837
I'm workin' up quite a sweat out here.

464
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,356
Dolly, Madison, how about
a glass of lemonade, huh?

465
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,829
Certainly. That'll be two dollars.

466
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,470
Two dollars? For a glass
of lemonade? For me?

467
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,110
Friggin' brats.

468
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,639
Two dollars.

469
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,471
All right, here you go.

470
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,557
Tangy.

471
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,157
Dad, what do you want for dinner?

472
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,871
- Macaroni and cheese or fish sticks?
- I'd love to have the fish sticks.

473
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,271
- But I got other plans.
- But I was making us dinner.

474
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,638
I can see that, but I'm going out
with Emily from down the street.

475
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,472
Am I gonna get another babysitter?

476
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,589
No, don't be silly. No more babysitters
for you. We got something better, Grandpa.

477
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,193
Stick him, stick him.

478
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,874
They don't make fighters
like they used to.

479
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,349
No more. Nobody's hungry any more.

480
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,556
See?

481
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,234
Dad, don't go out on another
date. You already had one.

482
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,393
It didn't work out. How can I find
us a new mom if I don't keep looking?

483
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,792
We don't need a new mom. Things were
great when it was just you and me.

484
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,474
I mean, we already got stuck with him.

485
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,713
Junior, I am going out
on a date tonight, OK?

486
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,395
I'm gonna get cleaned up. Let
me know if you hear the doorbell.

487
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,028
Don't worry. You'll hear it.

488
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,791
<i>I never met a girl who makes
me feel The way that you do</i>

489
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,678
<i>You're all right</i>

490
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,918
<i>Whenever I'm asked Who
makes my dreams real</i>

491
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,117
<i>I say that you do You're outta sight</i>

492
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,268
<i>So,
fee-fi-fo- fum</i>

493
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,194
<i>Look out, baby, 'cause here I come</i>

494
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,353
<i>And I'm bringing you a love
that's true So get ready</i>

495
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,351
<i>So get ready</i>

496
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,230
<i>I'm gonna try and make you
love me too So get ready</i>

497
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,198
<i>So get ready 'Cause here I come</i>

498
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,396
<i>Get ready 'Cause here I come</i>

499
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,949
<i>I'm on my way</i>

500
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,835
OK, girls.

501
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,876
We've got work to do.

502
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,270
- Argh!
- Ben.

503
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,309
I'm sorry, I'm suddenly
not feeling very well.

504
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,113
I think I just caught that
flu that's been going around.

505
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,872
OK?

506
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,836
So the little monster
screwed you over again, huh?

507
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,036
Maybe I was too strong with him.

508
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,397
Ever since I started dating these
women, he's become so insecure.

509
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,996
Insecure? Little Ben, he's
paranoid, he's jealous.

510
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,991
And he is dangerous.

511
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,957
What are you saying?

512
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,237
I'm saying leave him by the
side of the road and run.

513
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,392
That's a cop-out. The boy
wants to know he's loved.

514
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,473
I'm sure if I devote more
time to him, he'll be better.

515
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,111
<i>Finally, Dad gets the
point. Goodbye, ladiesl</i>

516
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,716
Hey, dog-face.

517
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,235
I knew you'd look!

518
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,436
No running in the hall!

519
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,319
Oh, darn!

520
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,118
Na- na- na- na- na.

521
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,748
You can't come in here!

522
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,957
<i>The bitch must diel</i>

523
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,077
Oh, shoot. She tricked me again.

524
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,710
I wish I had half the brains she does.

525
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,917
Well, there's always tomorrow.

526
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,509
That guy's pathetic.

527
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,713
You're gonna wish you'd never been born.

528
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,590
Ooh, I'm really scared! I'm being
threatened by the Ty-D-Bowl Girl.

529
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,672
Now, why have you been bugging me?

530
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,469
I'll bug whoever I
want. This is my school.

531
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,598
- Says who? -
Me and my M- 80.

532
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,438
You're insane.

533
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,231
Let's get out of here!

534
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,393
<i>Just outta school
Like I'm real real cool</i>

535
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,597
<i>Gotta dance like a fool Got
the message that I gotta be</i>

536
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,829
<i>A wild one...</i>

537
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,515
Out of my way! I can't
hold this one until recess.

538
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,030
This is gonna feel so good.

539
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,876
Clearance sale! Big clearance sale!

540
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,713
Well, well, well, what have we got here?

541
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,997
You girls selling your
daddy's old clothes?

542
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,718
Look at this!

543
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,474
A silk shirt for a dime.

544
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,870
And a suit for a quarter?

545
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,793
I had one like this. I
paid two grand for it.

546
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,875
Wait a minute. Wait a...

547
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,519
Nippy.

548
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,274
What the hell are you doing here?

549
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,271
They're selling you for a nickel?

550
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,589
You little crooks.
Where'd you get this stuff?

551
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,876
We have wholesalers.

552
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,600
The hell you do. This is all mine.

553
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,833
No, it's not. Junior sold us the
whole package for ten dollars.

554
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,798
He did, did he? Well,
we'll see about that.

555
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,880
Finally I get some room in here.

556
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,555
You little psycho. This
time you've gone too far.

557
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,996
- Shut your trap!
- You're an evil boy.

558
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,196
You've gotta learn to
respect your elders.

559
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,989
If your old man won't teach you
some manners, by God, I will.

560
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,312
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

561
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,869
My ass!

562
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,636
Hey, buddy, you ready to go?

563
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,279
Sure, but where?

564
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,238
It's a surprise. I
got a fun day planned.

565
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,913
All right, let's go!

566
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,188
Junior, have you seen
your grandfather lately?

567
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,113
Last time I saw him, he was going out.

568
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,239
Ben!

569
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,118
Little Ben!

570
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,670
Help, Little Ben! Help me!

571
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,637
Whoa...

572
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,672
Benjamin Healy.

573
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,796
Time to meet your future.

574
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,839
Help me!

575
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,560
- Help me!
- What is that man doing?

576
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,632
I'm Big Ben Healy. I live here.

577
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,758
You live in that tree?

578
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,117
- Maybe he's Ben Healy's father.
- Shut up. I knew that.

579
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,670
Now move it. Get him down from there.

580
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,072
<i>Hooray!</i>

581
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,638
- All right!
- Hey, Junior, this is for you.

582
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,518
- Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.

583
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,800
This is great. First it's a water park,
then a ball game, and now it's a carnival.

584
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,350
I just realised you and I haven't
been spending enough time together.

585
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,398
Dad, I'm glad it's just you and me.

586
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,552
Wow! Look at that cool ride!

587
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,472
- Can I go on it?
- Sure, that's why we're here.

588
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,909
<i>This ride is overl</i>

589
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,991
Whoa, slow down, dude.
You can't go on this ride.

590
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,277
- Why not?
- You gotta be as tall as the tentacle.

591
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,951
But it's only a millimetre.

592
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,873
Get outta here, you're
holding up my line.

593
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,233
Thanks a lot.

594
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,516
I'm sorry, Junior. Maybe next year.
Look. You wanna go on the Munchkin Ride?

595
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,954
No Munchkin Ride. OK.

596
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,873
A candy apple? Would
you like a candy apple?

597
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,871
I'll be right back.

598
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,676
The little baby
couldn't get on the ride?

599
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,358
What's the matter? They afraid
you'd go pee-pee in your diapers?

600
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,153
Hey, you little creep!

601
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,191
Hey, shrimp.

602
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,909
It must be tough being a little shrimpo.

603
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,513
Ticket.

604
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,279
<i>So, are you ready for fun?</i>

605
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,431
Yeah!

606
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,311
<i>You better hang on tight,</i>

607
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,793
<i>because you're about to
experience the Crazy Dancel</i>

608
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,472
This is pansy speed!

609
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,518
Come on, pump it up, pump it up!

610
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,675
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah!

611
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,271
I'm gonna puke!

612
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,035
I'm gonna barf!

613
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,313
Please, no.

614
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,990
Why do you do these things to me?

615
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,199
I thought we moved here to start over.
People told me you were a problem child.

616
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,115
I said they were wrong, I said you
just needed a chance to succeed.

617
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,874
We don't have a normal
life, especially me.

618
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,077
I can't go out on a date without
something terrible happening.

619
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,753
Maybe you shouldn't go out.

620
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,038
Junior, just because I interact
with another human being

621
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,555
doesn't mean that I love you any less.

622
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,472
Can't you see that?

623
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,235
- Well, I suppose.
- All right, that's a start.

624
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,992
We can build on that.

625
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,878
I'll make you a deal.

626
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,759
I promise you that I'll
always be there for you.

627
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,878
But you've gotta promise
to be good from now on.

628
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,635
- OK, I promise.
- That's a little too fast. Think about it.

629
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,237
It's not just an empty promise.
This is a pact between you and me

630
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,836
to regain some of the
trust we used to have, OK?

631
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,594
So what do you say?
Are you gonna improve

632
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,797
so I can be right when
I brag to my friends

633
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,157
and tell them I got the
greatest kid that ever was?

634
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,633
Sure.

635
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,916
I'll be better.

636
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,799
Thataboy.

637
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,350
What happened to our house?

638
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,073
Surprise!

639
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,231
- Dad, what have you done?
- Nothing.

640
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,109
The credit for this miracle
goes to one special lady.

641
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,037
Ta-raa...

642
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,589
- I don't understand.
- Is she a maid?

643
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,558
Yeah, made to order.

644
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,518
Benjamin, it's such a pleasure to
have new blood moving into our town.

645
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,194
On behalf of everyone at Dumore Bank,

646
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,238
Dumore Pharmaceuticals
and Dumore Strip Mining,

647
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,029
I just want to extend to
you this little ol' welcome.

648
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,270
I'm LaWanda Dumore.

649
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,591
You did all this because I
opened up a checking account?

650
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,479
You're a very special customer.

651
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,074
Oops!

652
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,914
- Oh, Junior...!
- That's all right, it's only dirt.

653
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,116
I'll have that up in a jiffy.

654
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,078
I'm sorry. Junior can be
a little clumsy at times.

655
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,071
That's all right.

656
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,519
Without compassion and understanding,
what kind of world would we be living in?

657
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,193
Right, sweetie?

658
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,396
Just try to pull one stunt

659
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,599
and I'll cut you off at the
knees and bury you alive.

660
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,188
- She's an incredible woman.
- You haven't heard the best part.

661
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,715
She's worth $50 million.

662
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,756
I am so sorry, I just completely
lost track of the time.

663
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,478
I gotta run.

664
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,519
I got a meeting with some cockamamie
shareholder grievance committee.

665
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,558
But we should get together
for dinner real soon.

666
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,109
I could cook us up something special.

667
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,350
Well, sure. That would
be nice, Miss Dumore.

668
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,637
Oh, no. LaWanda.

669
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,233
LaWanda.

670
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,079
Bye-bye!

671
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,396
Five oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh!

672
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,833
50 million!

673
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,595
LaWanda, it smells great in there.
Sure you don't need any help?

674
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,273
No, Benjamin.

675
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,752
You just stay down here and relax.
I'm taking care of everything.

676
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,239
OK.

677
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,796
<i>I know I promised Dad
I wouldn't hurt LaWanda,</i>

678
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,713
<i>but I never said the dog couldn't.</i>

679
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,755
You're falling into a trance.

680
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,198
Your eyes are getting heavy.
You can't move a muscle.

681
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,239
When you wake up, you'll
be thinking of one thing.

682
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,630
Destroy LaWanda.

683
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,552
She is your enemy.

684
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,598
She is like a cat, but uglier.

685
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,115
You want to bite her butt off

686
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,352
and scare her away, so
she'll never come back.

687
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,317
When I clap my hands,

688
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,632
you'll come out of the
trance and do whatever I say.

689
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,038
One,

690
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,315
two,

691
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,913
three.

692
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,629
One, two,

693
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,313
three.

694
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,473
Nippy?

695
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,596
Nippy? Hey, Nip, come on.

696
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,834
- Uh-oh!
Nippy. - Nippy!

697
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,318
Nippy, where are you?

698
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,034
- What have you been up to?
- None of your business.

699
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,113
- You're not my mother.
- You are a mean little boy.

700
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,308
Go up to your room and change your clothes.
I will not have an unkempt boy at my table.

701
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,993
Your table?

702
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,193
Get!

703
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,676
Clowns!

704
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,308
I hate clowns!

705
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,837
This woman is bustin' my balls!

706
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,273
Hey, guys, what are you
doing for dinner tonight?

707
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,989
I would like to make a
toast to a terrific lady

708
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,118
who has made us feel so
welcome in our new town,

709
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,398
who's fixed up our house, and
cooked us this incredible feast.

710
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,152
- Hear, hear.
- To LaWanda.

711
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,197
- To LaWanda.
- To LaWanda.

712
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,031
That is so sweet.

713
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,430
I hope y'all enjoy this.

714
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,433
I had my staff compile
their favourite recipes.

715
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,990
Well, I for one am
famished, so let's eat.

716
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,998
What in the hell is in this salad?

717
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,116
It's blue cheese.

718
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,878
Oh, my God.

719
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,110
All right, come on! Get LaWanda!

720
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,313
This salad is infested!

721
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,792
Get it! Get it!

722
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,917
This is a plague!

723
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,469
LaWanda, I'm coming.

724
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,639
Junior, you failed me.

725
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,473
But, Dad, I swear, she hates me.

726
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,952
- We had a deal and you let me down.
- She's different from all the others.

727
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,031
LaWanda is bad.

728
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,876
Junior, you think all women are bad. That
woman has nothing but good intentions.

729
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,112
She made us dinner and this
is how you pay her back?

730
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,350
I am really disappointed in you.

731
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,229
I don't think I'll ever
be able to trust you again.

732
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,599
Benjamin, I hope you
weren't too harsh on him.

733
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,878
- I think I've failed as a father.
- Oh, no, not at all.

734
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,713
There's only so much you can handle.

735
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,908
A father's good for some things, but
you need a mother for emotional guidance.

736
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,629
Values... Morality?

737
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,792
Perhaps I should talk to the boy?

738
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,111
- Well, yeah. That might be...
- Good.

739
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,397
Listen here, you little monster.

740
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,391
I am mightier than you are.

741
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,155
And I always get what
I want, so back off.

742
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,110
Because whether you like it or
not, I am gonna marry your daddy.

743
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,909
And when I do, you'll be on the
first plane to boarding school,

744
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,911
in Baghdad.

745
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,480
Dad, you gotta believe
me. She said Baghdad.

746
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,518
Forget it, you have no
credibility any more.

747
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,070
Let's see if we can get through
this evening like a normal family,

748
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,470
without anything bizarre happening. OK?

749
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,959
Come on.

750
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,796
Come here, look at the chart. I
got 15 gold stars this semester.

751
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,953
- Do you have anything nice to show me?
- Sure, just the usual stuff.

752
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,633
There's my desk.

753
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,115
Here's my science project.

754
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,032
<i>I'm innocentl I'm innocentl</i>

755
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,676
There's my teacher, Mr Thorn.

756
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,478
Mom, this is Mr Thorn.

757
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,835
She's doing very well. Awfully good.

758
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,710
<i>Attention, parents. Please take your
seats for tonight's special programme,</i>

759
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,279
<i>Salute to Democracy.</i>

760
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,716
<i>Because you know it's, like,
democracy and we're saluting it.</i>

761
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,309
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Baldy.

762
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,278
Sure is great to see all those
parents out there tonight.

763
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,000
- It sure is.
- It's so sweet!

764
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,037
You can't do that to me!

765
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,633
What are you...?

766
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,949
Sorry about the delay, folks. We're
experiencing technical difficulties.

767
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,829
Yeah, I had to scratch my balls.

768
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,117
- Hey, I didn't know eagles had balls.
- Yeah, I'm a bald eagle.

769
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,317
<i>Did you know I could fart The Star
- Spangled Banner?</i>

770
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,711
- Really? OK...
- Junior, no!

771
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,638
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

772
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,034
Trixie!

773
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,715
I can't leave you alone for 10
minutes. Why did you do this?

774
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,836
But, Mom...

775
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,959
Those kids wouldn't let me
be part of the puppet show.

776
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,671
That's no excuse for... Come
on, we are going right now!

777
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,515
Great show, huh, Dad?
I was saving you a seat.

778
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,198
Annie...

779
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,759
Annie!

780
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,558
Nurse!

781
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,877
Hang on! Wait!

782
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,156
Look, Annie, will you wait?!

783
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,030
- I understand what you're going through.
- You couldn't possibly.

784
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,636
- I do, believe me. We could help each other.
- Just forget it.

785
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,473
Trixie consumes my entire life.

786
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,074
I don't have room for anything else.

787
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,119
<i>Boy, that girl sure showed them.</i>

788
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,912
<i>Who would have thought that sweet
nurse would have such a crazy daughter?</i>

789
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,152
<i>What a mess. I have
to get Junior a mother.</i>

790
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,233
<i>Annie would be perfect, she's smart
and sweet and pretty and loving.</i>

791
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,313
<i>It would be great to have a
nurse on call 24 hours a day.</i>

792
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,430
<i>On the other hand, LaWanda
will go out with me.</i>

793
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,158
<i>Oh, God, please let him
marry that rich broad.</i>

794
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,278
<i>'Cause I really need the money.</i>

795
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,196
<i>I gotta get out of this house.</i>

796
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,069
<i>My son's a loser, my dog has vanished.</i>

797
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,835
<i>And that punk Junior's
the devil come to life.</i>

798
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,752
Nippy! You've come back!

799
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,595
And I thought you abandoned me.

800
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,990
I should have known better.

801
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,549
You'll always stand
by my side, won't you?

802
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,589
You're my one true friend.

803
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,759
Nippy...?

804
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,671
Nippy, what the hell happened to you?

805
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,269
I'm losing my mind.

806
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,831
Junior's getting worse. We can't even
figure out what he did to that dog.

807
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,833
Benjamin, I'm gonna be blunt.

808
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,436
- Your child is in a state of emergency.
- I'm doing my best.

809
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,319
Benjamin, it is not your fault.

810
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,914
You're a fine man.

811
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:41,154
But one lone individual
just cannot do this job.

812
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,359
Your child needs two parental figures.

813
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,596
- LaWanda...
- Yes?

814
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,750
I'd like to ask you a question.

815
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,988
- Junior...
- Hey, Dad, what's up?

816
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,037
I've got some family news for you.

817
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,794
- Is Big Ben moving out?
- No, I'm not talking...

818
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,633
Listen to me, this is important. I...

819
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,595
I've made a decision. I'm
going to marry LaWanda.

820
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,072
- But, Dad, she hates me!
- She doesn't hate... That's ridiculous.

821
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,028
She wants what's best for you.
She wants to make us a home.

822
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,714
But she's gonna destroy everything.

823
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,919
Three men living together in a
house is a mess. It's unnatural.

824
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,152
Plus, I feel she's a woman
of strong moral fibre.

825
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,834
She'll be a good influence
over us, especially you.

826
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,797
You're making a big mistake.

827
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,872
I am a grown-up and I will
do anything I wanna do.

828
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,237
And on Saturday I'm
going to marry LaWanda.

829
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,671
Benjamin, we got a jillion things to do.

830
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,470
Caterers, invitations and a one
o'clock appointment for a blood test.

831
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,959
I'll be right there.

832
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,671
Tell your grandpa I'll be back in a
couple of hours and then we'll talk.

833
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,638
We're from the animal control
unit. There's a local rabies scare.

834
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,396
- We're looking for any strange animals.
- Nippy's been acting a little funny lately.

835
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,757
- You better let us see him.
- OK.

836
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,309
- Not now.
- Come on.

837
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,870
- Here you go.
- What the hell happened here?

838
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,598
It sure ain't rabies.

839
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,991
Nippy's lost his spunk.
Can you do anything for him?

840
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,718
Maybe.

841
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:59,113
- What kind of diet's he been on?
- We just feed him table scraps.

842
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,390
Think we've found the problem.
Why don't you come with us?

843
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,996
A time like this, there's only
one thing you can count on.

844
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,797
- Chow Down.
- Chow Down?

845
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,632
That's right, sonny. Chow Down.

846
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,951
Now in three delicious flavours.
Beef, chicken and horse.

847
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,516
Rich, meaty flavour,

848
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,674
all simmered in a delicious
home- style gravy. Mmm...

849
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,479
What dog could resist?

850
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,517
Come and get it!

851
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,273
Wow! Look at him chow down.

852
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,318
You bet, and wait till you
see how shiny his coat gets.

853
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,192
Glad we could be of assistance.

854
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,999
Come on, pal. Let's get back to work.

855
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,436
What's in that little black box?

856
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,477
You don't wanna mess with that.

857
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,234
That's blood tests from a rabid dog.

858
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,388
Blood tests, huh?

859
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,876
Healy, Benjamin.

860
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,793
Looks fine to me.

861
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,555
And who's next? Dumore, LaWanda.

862
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,551
Again.

863
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,551
OK...

864
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,753
Wow!

865
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,957
Operator, give me the County Health
Department. This is an emergency.

866
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,997
- It's darling, LaWanda!
- My goodness!

867
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,596
Y'all are the best friends
a girl could ever have.

868
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,435
LaWanda, you're always
the most beautiful bride.

869
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,994
Excuse me, ma'am. Is Ms Dumore here?

870
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,153
Oh, my Lord! Somebody hired strippers.

871
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,311
You want me?

872
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,393
- Come and get me.
- She's already foaming at the mouth.

873
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,869
Better move fast.

874
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,316
- Here we go.
- You brutes are playing rough!

875
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,199
- What are you doing?
- We're from the County Board of Health.

876
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,510
- You have rabies.
- What?!

877
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,638
You cannot do this to me!

878
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,917
I am rich. I am powerful.

879
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,913
I do not have rabies!

880
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,709
LaWanda, how are you feeling?

881
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,438
How am I feeling?

882
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,955
How am I feeling? I'm tied to a bed!

883
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,918
Maybe this picture will cheer you up.

884
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,750
Maybe this is a little too much excitement
for LaWanda. Why don't we clear the room...

885
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,195
OK. Bye, LaWanda.
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

886
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,796
No, sonny. Your dad means we should go.

887
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,279
All of us.

888
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,276
Give the lovebirds a chance to be alone.

889
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,998
This might cheer you up.

890
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,276
I'll put this over here.

891
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,479
I talked to Father Flanagan, and he said
there's no need to rush into these things.

892
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,949
We can push back the ceremony.

893
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,318
Benjamin, I do not
like being patronised.

894
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,393
I don't care if we have to
roll this gurney down the aisle.

895
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,552
Tomorrow, we are getting married.

896
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,913
Big Ben's Sporting Goods is
embarking on a major expansion.

897
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,789
We're about to come into
a huge cash infusion.

898
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,830
I swear, you're important to me.

899
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,391
I've made my decision. When I
die, I want people to remember me.

900
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,553
And after tonight's plastic
surgery, I'm gonna be someone,

901
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,395
because I'm gonna have the
biggest nose in the world.

902
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,718
This place is awfully loud.
You sure you wanna eat here?

903
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,916
Of course. Pizza's my favourite food.

904
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,594
It is? Oh. Fine.

905
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,036
Hello. We'd like a table for...

906
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,115
- Annie?
- Ben?

907
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,032
<i>Maybe I'm gettin' soft, but
I just had the craziest idea.</i>

908
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,358
So then Dad dropped his pants on
live TV and he lost the election.

909
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,590
Here's a campaign picture.

910
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,038
What are you jerks doing here? I was
supposed to have dinner with my mom.

911
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,839
Quit yapping and let
'em have a good time.

912
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,230
Everybody smile for your
complimentary photograph.

913
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,960
Say "Pizzarrific!"

914
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,828
Smile for your complimentary photograph.

915
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,918
Oh, boy, baby! When you're with
me, it's first class all the way.

916
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,039
We went to the restaurant, they
let us in, we didn't have to wait.

917
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,510
It's not like the restaurants
where you talk into the clown face.

918
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:27,550
It's not like that at all. Later on, we'll
go home and I'll put on the Zorro outfit.

919
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,077
Well, here's to an
evening we'll never forget.

920
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,399
- It's them!
- Who?

921
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,790
It's him and it's her
and they're together.

922
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,430
He has this flatulence problem and
he's eating a pizza, and it's her...

923
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,238
Hey, it's Peabody.

924
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,870
I hate that guy. He's
got such a grating voice.

925
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,350
Yeah. I'll shut him up.

926
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,235
Here, let me. Terrible
kids, just terrible.

927
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,113
That's pretty good. Let me try.

928
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,833
You rotten kids, you
should be locked in cages!

929
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,711
You can't talk to them like that.

930
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,472
Screw you, pal!

931
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,110
I can talk about anybody however I want.

932
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,839
Yeah!

933
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,954
Two can play at this game!

934
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,713
- Let's get 'em!
- All right!

935
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,792
- Keep it moving, come on.
- Quit pushing, it wasn't our fault.

936
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,748
- I got hit on the head with an egg.
- You can never come back again.

937
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,229
- That's a big loss.
- Yeah, we said no olives.

938
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,039
Did everybody get enough to eat?

939
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,079
Annie, you look like you could use
some dessert. Right around here.

940
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,157
- Your dad's pretty funny.
- He takes after me.

941
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,517
Junior, I'm sorry I hit
you with the fire hose.

942
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,150
That's OK. I'm sorry I made
you barf on the Crazy Dance.

943
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,319
I couldn't believe it...

944
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,550
...right in your face!

945
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,280
You know, I think your dad likes my mom.

946
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,558
Normally when a guy does that, I
run him over or knock him downstairs.

947
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,517
I gotta look out for her.

948
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,070
But your dad, he
doesn't bug me that much.

949
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,038
You know, your mom doesn't
bother me that much either.

950
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,719
Pals?

951
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,393
Pals.

952
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,352
My arms.

953
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,237
My arms are free!

954
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,959
Oh, my Lord.

955
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,871
What's wrong with my face?

956
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,112
What is this?

957
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,072
Oh... Oh!

958
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,074
I'm Pinocchio!

959
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,950
Good, you made it.

960
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,680
Why did you want me
to come over so late?

961
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,752
- You know how you said you liked my dad?
- Yeah.

962
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,469
I have the weirdest idea. I think
our parents should get married.

963
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,589
What are you talking about?
Your dad's already taken.

964
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,594
Well, he might be having
a slight change of plans.

965
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,634
Oh, great. Big Ben's up.

966
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,150
Who are you? And you should be in bed,

967
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,992
resting up for tomorrow's wedding.

968
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,752
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

969
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,799
I made LaWanda so ugly, no
one's gonna wanna marry her.

970
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,428
LaWanda Dumore's the key
to my financial comeback.

971
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,513
And nobody, nobody, is
gonna stand in my way.

972
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,876
- Nippy, where'd you go?
- This guy's gonna be a problem.

973
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,952
No, he's not. Let's get him!

974
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,269
Yeah!

975
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,956
I'm really tired.

976
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,192
Come on, don't wuss out. This is the
only way to get our parents together.

977
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,157
Now come on!

978
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,472
Whoa! It's so much bigger than
it looked on Mr Thorn's slide.

979
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,675
So, how do you start this thing?

980
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,957
I don't know. Guess
you just make a wish.

981
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,033
Mighty Love Rock, we come to
you today to ask a big favour.

982
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,193
We got two parents and we want
them to fall in love and get married

983
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,635
so I don't get stuck
with that bitch LaWanda.

984
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,917
I hope this isn't asking too much,

985
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,119
but you're a magic rock so you're
probably used to these things.

986
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,589
Please help us.

987
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,553
Bye, Annie.

988
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,990
All right, Junior. Get up.

989
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,914
It's a big day. Today
you get yourself a mom.

990
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,954
Has Junior ever run away before?

991
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,636
No, it's this wedding thing. It's got him
upset. I'm sorry he dragged Trixie into this.

992
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,316
Don't let Trixie off the hook. She's usually
responsible for her share of the action.

993
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,278
Junior can be the biggest
menace who ever lived.

994
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,877
Well, maybe he was a nuisance
in that little town you're from.

995
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,793
You're in Mortville and around
here Trixie runs the show.

996
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,511
She's an amateur. Nobody has caused
the amount of destruction Junior has.

997
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,158
I guess it's a stupid
thing to argue about.

998
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,392
There they are.

999
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,194
Will you look at that?

1000
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,828
Hey, guys. Good morning.

1001
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,235
Hey, the Love Rock worked!

1002
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,517
Up and at 'em, Junior,
let's go. Attaboy.

1003
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,957
So, do you need a ride home?

1004
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,352
No, I think we're gonna take a
little walk and have a little talk.

1005
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,637
Besides, you've probably got
millions of things to do today.

1006
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,792
Yeah, I guess I do have plans.

1007
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,758
So, see ya.

1008
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,232
Typical, Little Ben. You always
wait till the last damn minute.

1009
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,073
Dad, don't you wanna go see LaWanda?

1010
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,755
There's a tradition. The groom can't
see the bride before the ceremony.

1011
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,514
- But... but...
- But... but, my ass.

1012
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,910
Beat it, we're busy.

1013
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,789
<i>Oh, nol If Dad doesn't
see LaWanda's big schnozz,</i>

1014
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,791
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

1015
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,313
Miss Dumore!

1016
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,992
- Are you all right?
- Dad, look at her face.

1017
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,716
Hey, what happened?

1018
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,996
Thought you had me licked, huh?

1019
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,879
It's amazing what $382,000 worth

1020
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,476
of last-minute double overtime
plastic surgery can do.

1021
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,636
Benjamin, what's the hold-up?

1022
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,239
Fine.

1023
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,918
Come on, sit down, kid.

1024
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,593
Hit it, padre.

1025
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,749
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
today, on this day of joy,

1026
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,070
to unite these two wonderful people.

1027
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,595
No! Dad, don't do it!

1028
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,320
Go for it, Little Ben. Make me proud!

1029
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,278
We are gathered together
on this day of joy,

1030
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,670
<i>to unite you two wonderful p...</i>

1031
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,392
Who the hell is that?

1032
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,516
That's my pal Trixie.

1033
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,116
I hate children!

1034
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,510
They ruin everything!

1035
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,515
If I had enough power, I'd wipe
them off the face of the earth.

1036
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,349
Junior!

1037
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,438
Nippy! No!

1038
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,877
No, Miss Dumore! No!

1039
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,632
I command you to stop.

1040
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,194
Trixie! You come down
here right this minute!

1041
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,749
How many times have I told you
not to operate heavy machinery?

1042
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,718
- Annie!
- Ben, I am so sorry.

1043
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,633
I couldn't stop her. We've
ruined your whole wedding.

1044
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,713
This wedding was meant to be
ruined. Annie, you're the one I want.

1045
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,239
What?

1046
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,475
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1047
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,790
What the hell are you doing? You gotta
scrape your lovely bride off the ground.

1048
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,509
Dad, I don't want to marry
LaWanda. I've found someone else.

1049
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,958
Who cares? LaWanda Dumore is a
gold- mine. She's worth millions.

1050
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,588
Dad, if you like her
so much, you marry her.

1051
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,669
Yeah. Why not?

1052
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,839
Thanks, buddy.

1053
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,072
Dad, I wouldn't have
done it for anyone else.

1054
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,919
Let me help you.

1055
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,833
One... two... three...

1056
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,638
Let me help you.

1057
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,791
Not you, dummy.

1058
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,358
Come on, there we go.

1059
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,511
Get your mitts off me.

1060
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,830
I hate your whole family.

1061
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,231
Honey, come here. I'm not like them.

1062
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,278
I'm different. I love you.

1063
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,228
You said you love me?

1064
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,199
Yeuch!

1065
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,635
Yeah!

1066
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,350
Nippy!

1067
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,432
Oh, my God.
