1
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:20,022
Greetings, gentlemen.

2
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:24,656
I assume your wives are not with you,
as the very title of our piece...

3
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,096
...is sufficient to strike terror
in their hearts...

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:31,330
...and cause them to remain at home
in their kitchens, where they belong!

5
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:37,336
In any case, gentlemen,
you have come here tonight to learn...

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,640
...and so you shall.

7
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:47,710
We will begin by considering
the case of Mr. Stanley Ford.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,721
Unlike you poor souls,
Mr. Ford has had the wisdom never to marry.

9
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:56,091
He is, therefore, a completely happy man.

10
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,726
This is Mr. Ford's town.

11
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:16,142
This is Mr. Ford's townhouse.

12
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:05,954
This is the terrace of Mr. Ford's townhouse.

13
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,435
Look at us!

14
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:22,847
The last stronghold of gracious living
in a world gone mad.

15
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:40,054
By the way, my name is Charles, Mr. Ford's man.

16
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,601
I flatter myself
that I’m also his confidant and friend.

17
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,437
Like everybody else in New York...

18
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:58,813
...Mr. Ford has a tiny bit
of construction going on next door.

19
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:06,921
Actually, it's not so bad, really.

20
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:10,758
We've almost come to like
the little cries of the workmen...

21
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,631
...and the gloppitta-gloppitta noises
which emanate from the machine.

22
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,169
Over there.

23
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:31,778
In any case, the interior of the house...

24
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:34,877
...is soundproof, and so life goes on.

25
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:48,058
This is Mr. Ford's living room.

26
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:53,502
Notice, if you will, the complete absence
of the so-called ''woman's touch.''

27
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:56,905
No gay little chintzes, no big gunky lamps.

28
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:01,345
In fact, everything is masculine and perfect.

29
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,174
In fact, the sort of place you could've had.

30
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:09,881
lf only you'd had the sense not to get married.

31
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,218
But you say, ''Poor, lonely man,
how does he spend his evenings?''

32
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,668
I should imagine the young lady...

33
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,935
...having danced all night...

34
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:32,875
...literally left here walking on air.

35
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:41,582
And this is the nerve center
of the entire establishment.

36
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:43,714
My quarters.

37
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:48,185
lf you were fortunate enough
to have a room such as this...

38
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,888
...your wife would undoubtedly
have taken it over...

39
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:55,593
...to house her aged and disagreeable mother.

40
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:09,909
This is Mr. Ford's martini glass.

41
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:15,049
It should be properly chilled
by 7:00 p.m. this evening.

42
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,410
This is Mr. Ford's shower.

43
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:22,317
Thermostatically controlled
at Mr. Ford's body temperature.

44
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:25,480
98.7.

45
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:34,394
Now, it is time to reveal Mr. Ford himself.

46
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:35,722
Olé.

47
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:46,972
Mr. Ford.

48
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:53,208
it’s 10:30 a.m. The sun is shining.

49
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:58,384
Please, never try to speak
until you've had your shower.

50
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,357
Upsy-daisy.

51
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,762
Very good.

52
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:12,998
160, right on the button.
I don't know how you do it!

53
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:17,270
I do know how you do it.
Your calories are counted very carefully.

54
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,810
Do you realize, sir...

55
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:22,608
...it's six months since an ounce of butter's
been used in this house?

56
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:31,951
-Charles, do you know what day this is?
-I do, sir. indeed I do.

57
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,920
At exactly 12:22,
the Fabergé Diamond will be ours!

58
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:39,327
it’s been an exciting adventure,
but I’ll be glad when it's over...

59
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,958
...so we can move on to the next caper.

60
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:06,792
Wait a minute.

61
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,395
Hold it!

62
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,574
Go!

63
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,332
Come in, Charles.

64
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,263
Pardon me, sir.

65
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:25,738
Mr. Lampson did indeed telephone.

66
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,471
The Port Authority is livid.

67
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:33,246
The freighter people are furious
and Mr. Lampson himself is terribly upset.

68
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,878
Of course he is. He's a lawyer.
He's paid to be upset.

69
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,014
At any rate, voilà!
In one dazzling burst of brilliance...

70
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:43,255
...Bash Brannigan has successfully
concluded The Case of the Fabergé Navel.

71
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,929
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant!

72
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,631
I especially care for the ''splunk.''

73
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,868
-What is to be our next caper, sir?
-I’ve got it practically all worked out.

74
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:02,470
it’s the story of a man who gets murdered...

75
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:06,308
...while staring at the top of
the Empire State Building.

76
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:11,010
I think I’ll call it The Skyscraper Gaper Caper.

77
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,455
Sounds really exciting, sir.

78
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:17,154
But you'll have to shoot most of it
from a helicopter.

79
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:21,222
And it will involve closing off 5th Avenue
from 34th to 59th street.

80
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,761
Wouldn't it be great if we could find a way...

81
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,702
...to blow up one of those glass office buildings?

82
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:29,539
Tinkle, tinkle.

83
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,135
What's the matter? You don't like it?

84
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,678
I love it, sir!

85
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,543
But I was thinking of Mr. Lampson.

86
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,576
Poor Mr. Lampson.

87
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
Stanley! Can't you stop for just a minute?

88
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,290
I’m speaking to you now,
not as a lawyer but as a friend.

89
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:50,817
Stan, you're a grown man,
and grown men simply can't...

90
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:56,095
...repeat, can't go spreading terror in New York
at the height of noon accompanied...

91
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:59,569
-Will you stop just a minute?
-...by naked women!

92
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:02,963
She wasn't naked!
She had a diamond in her navel.

93
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:06,800
All right, and those demented butlers
and criminals with knives.

94
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:11,577
You cannot continue comporting yourself
in the manner of an escaped lunatic!

95
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,177
Bash Brannigan, Secret Agent
is syndicated in 463 newspapers.

96
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,517
-You know why?
-Sure, I know.

97
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,422
Because of hardcore pornography...

98
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:25,429
...softened slightly, ever so slightly,
by excessive violence and sadism!

99
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:29,997
Bash Brannigan is enjoyed by millions
because my readers know it's authentic.

100
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,733
I never asked Bash to do anything
I hadn't already done myself.

101
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,173
Stan.

102
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:46,045
I wanna remind you, lad,
that you are now 37 years old.

103
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:49,553
And, quite frankly, it's time that you settle down.

104
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:53,057
Edna and I were discussing you last night,
and Edna feels...

105
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:56,491
...frankly, I agree with her,
that there's something almost immoral...

106
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,428
...about a man of your age who isn't married.

107
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:03,766
Doesn't go to an office,
sits around drawing an infantile comic strip...

108
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,429
...that appeals only to morons.

109
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:09,369
Stanley, are you listening?

110
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,443
I happen to mention to the kids...

111
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:18,813
...that I was gonna be meeting with you
this afternoon.

112
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,151
We kinda have...

113
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:26,455
...a little family argument
that we want you to settle. The point is that...

114
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:31,588
...Hal and Tommy both think that the microfilm...

115
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:34,632
...is hidden in the diamond in the girl's navel.

116
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:38,868
I told them that they were crazy.

117
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,096
In fact, I went a little bit out on a limb.

118
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,868
I told them that I was your lawyer
and I knew damn well...

119
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:47,935
...that the microfilm wasn't hidden
in the diamond in the girl's navel.

120
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,175
By the way, they were really quite impressed.

121
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:58,380
I must say, I made quite a little character there,
being your lawyer.

122
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:01,754
You know, knowing how the strip
was coming out and all.

123
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:05,487
For a moment there, they were actually...

124
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,030
...kinda proud of their old man.

125
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:20,541
The girl doesn't have the microfilm
in the diamond in her navel, does she?

126
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,481
Honest to God.

127
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:32,080
You ought to pull yourself together!
You've lost all touch with reality!

128
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,125
You know what you really should do...

129
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,786
...and we were discussing this the other night...

130
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:40,297
...what you should really do is settle down.

131
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,693
Find some nice girl and get married!

132
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:49,039
Then you'd know what it's all about.

133
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,214
-Charles, you seem upset.
-Not at all, sir.

134
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:02,109
I’m sorry, sir.

135
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,216
I seem to be overcome by a sense of foreboding.

136
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,314
Foreboding?

137
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,589
A feeling of.... How can I put it?
impending disaster.

138
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:13,187
-Disaster? What are you.... I’ll do that.
-Thank you.

139
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,357
I’m sure it's nothing. it’s just...

140
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:19,927
...my natural reaction to the unhappy
nature of the event you are attending.

141
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,165
I see.

142
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,972
To think of it.

143
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:26,372
A bachelor dinner for poor Mr. Rawlins.

144
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:30,211
-is he really getting married tomorrow, sir?
-I’m afraid so.

145
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:33,045
Poor old Tobey.
You know, I never thought they'd nail him.

146
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:36,548
I feel guilty about it. I introduced them, didn't I?

147
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,249
You mustn't blame yourself.
He's a fully-grown man.

148
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:40,313
That's true.

149
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:44,488
-And Miss James is, after all, a lovely lady.
-Yes, that's true.

150
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:48,396
Sir, do you think she might need her gold shoes
for the wedding journey?

151
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,794
I think not.

152
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:57,602
Would you be good enough to extend to
Mr. Rawlins my heartiest congratulations?

153
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:58,973
Of course.

154
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:01,342
Don't wait up. You know how these things are.

155
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:02,937
I do, sir.

156
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,941
I do indeed.

157
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,433
Good evening, Judge Blackstone.

158
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,332
-I’m afraid this is a mournful occasion.
-Not at all, my boy.

159
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:31,566
Been married 38 years myself.

160
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:34,902
I don't regret one day of it.

161
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:42,012
The one day of it I don't regret was...

162
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,616
...August 2, 1936.

163
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:51,092
She was off visiting her ailing mother at the time.

164
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,508
Gentlemen, your attention please.

165
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,646
Miss Valerie James....

166
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:19,012
-Wonderful girl, by the way.
-Hear, hear!

167
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,284
Thank you.

168
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,854
Miss Valerie James...

169
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,262
...has decided not to marry me, after all!

170
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,896
She gave me back the ring!

171
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:42,395
Your Honor....

172
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:52,744
You better....

173
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:01,656
You better sit down, Your Honor.
You're absolutely smashed.

174
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:04,092
Smashed? Nonsense, my boy.

175
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,564
I’m as sober as a judge.

176
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:09,994
Hence the origin of the phrase.

177
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:28,003
No! Don't do it, sir!

178
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,960
Good morning, Charles.

179
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,325
Good morning, sir.

180
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:07,836
Good morning.

181
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,633
Lady in the bedroom.

182
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:19,679
I don't know, frankly, how to...

183
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,718
...break this to you.

184
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,611
I met her last night.

185
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,687
She came out of a cake.

186
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,258
I seem to be married to her.

187
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:58,814
Charles!

188
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:15,232
You're awake. Now, that's fine, good.

189
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:20,103
Look, before anything else happens...

190
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,203
...we have to have a little talk.

191
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,038
A serious talk.

192
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:28,175
A very serious talk.

193
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:34,514
First of all, I would like to apologize for
last night. Obviously, a mistake has been made.

194
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:37,759
On my part. it’s nothing that can't be rectified.

195
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:41,559
It certainly can be rectified,
if we'll all just keep our heads.

196
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,129
Let's...

197
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:49,097
...begin by very calmly discussing the facts.

198
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,203
Last night, at old Tobey's bachelor dinner...

199
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:57,239
...you came out of a cake. That's quite natural.

200
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:00,375
Young ladies frequently come out of cakes
at bachelor dinners.

201
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,943
So far, so good.

202
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,421
You and I were attracted to each other.
That's also perfectly natural.

203
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,152
We happen to be two extremely attractive people.

204
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:13,430
At any rate, I followed you back
to your dressing room...

205
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,627
...and, on some insane impulse,
I asked you to marry me.

206
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,930
I was intoxicated, that's quite obvious.

207
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,764
Apparently, you accepted...

208
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:28,771
...at which point, we went back
to the dining room to announce our betrothal.

209
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:32,247
Which was greeted with some enthusiasm
by my friends.

210
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,476
Right away, the mayor gets on the phone.

211
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:38,886
He wakes up the license clerk,
and waives the blood tests....

212
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:41,049
Before I knew it, there's Judge Blackstone...

213
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,458
...two guys holdin' him up,
''now pronouncing you man and wife.''

214
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:50,533
Anyway, that's where things stand,
my dear, at the moment.

215
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:54,801
As I say, it's nothing
that can't be rectified, quite simply.

216
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:59,867
You'll get a handsome settlement.
I happen to be very well off.

217
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:02,011
Six weeks in Las Vegas.

218
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:05,242
All there is to it.

219
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,651
By God, you're Italian!

220
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:47,349
Vous ne parlez.... You don't....

221
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:50,492
No speak the English?

222
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:58,624
Italian.

223
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:00,463
Yes!

224
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,037
Oh, my God. Excuse me, I’ll be right back.

225
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:10,403
You get dressed.

226
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:14,049
Me go talk butler.

227
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,283
Stanley.

228
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,126
Charles!

229
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,305
You can't do this!

230
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:41,277
Sorry, sir, but I do not work for married couples.

231
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,371
You knew that before
you entered into this curious alliance.

232
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:48,475
Oh, now, please. Would you look at me?

233
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,057
Good God, sir. How did it happen?

234
00:30:56,127 --> 00:31:00,154
It wasn't my fault. I swear it wasn't!
You've got to believe me!

235
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,960
Of course I believe you, sir.

236
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:03,363
Poor sir.

237
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:04,924
Poor Charles.

238
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:08,401
Good heavens, what is to become of us now?

239
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,599
I don't know.

240
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:23,246
lf you can keep your head...

241
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,188
...when all around are losing theirs,
and blaming it on you....

242
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:33,856
As a matter of fact, you're right.
We have nothing to worry about.

243
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:36,491
I’ve explained the situation to the young lady.

244
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:40,435
I told her I expect her to be on an airplane
to Las Vegas this afternoon!

245
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:44,870
That's absolutely marvelous, sir.
What was the young lady's reaction?

246
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,042
it’s a little difficult to say. She doesn't seem to...

247
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:52,509
...speak English.

248
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,211
Good God.

249
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:25,512
Doesn't speak English?

250
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:32,646
On the other hand, if one will go around
marrying persons who pop out of cakes...

251
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:37,387
...it's bound to be
rather catch-as-catch-can, isn't it, sir?

252
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:45,597
Surely, you can realize
how ridiculous this whole thing is.

253
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:48,832
I’ll call Harold Lampson,
I’ll run down to see him...

254
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:51,466
...and it'll all be straightened out in five minutes.

255
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:55,940
I promise you, by 3:00 p.m.,
she'll be on a plane to Las Vegas.

256
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,913
-Hi, Bash.
-Hi. How are you?

257
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:00,272
-Really, sir?
-Really.

258
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:03,453
Now, look. Why don't you
just go back to your room?

259
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:07,821
Your beautiful room, where you've been
so happy with your books and music.

260
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,327
Unpack, Charles.
Nothing has changed, I promise you.

261
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,961
Dinner at the usual time?

262
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:21,971
-Dinner for one?
-Please.

263
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:34,477
There you are and you're all dressed. Good.

264
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:41,081
You wait outside while I get dressed.

265
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:45,023
You know, and then you, me, we go talking...

266
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,490
...lawyer, cinque minuti.

267
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:49,760
All right?

268
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:06,974
Harold. I’m in trouble.

269
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:10,276
I don't think it's anything you can't handle.

270
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:13,084
I’m in terrible trouble.

271
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,515
Worse than that Harold, I’m....

272
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,464
-I’m married.
-Married?

273
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:23,665
That's right, I’m married.

274
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:26,762
Married?

275
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:34,869
Okay.

276
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:36,344
Okay.

277
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:37,744
Not now.

278
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:42,018
There's lots to do.
Gotta go to the lawyer's office. Come on.

279
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:45,214
Work out a separation agreement,
get you a lawyer in Las Vegas...

280
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:48,019
...hotel reservations or maybe a little apartment.

281
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,222
Good morning, Mr. Ford! Congratulations!

282
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:57,759
And buongiorno, Mrs. Ford.

283
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:00,895
Mrs. Lampson will be here
from the country club any minute.

284
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:03,098
Mr. Lampson. They're here.

285
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:12,715
I want to see the little lady
that finally nailed old Stan.

286
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,577
You don't mind if I kiss the bride, do you?

287
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:19,416
Congratulations, Mrs. Ford.

288
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:25,325
My God, you're right! She is Italian.

289
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:27,897
You mean that she doesn't speak...

290
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:31,428
...A-N-Y E-N-G-I-I-S-H?

291
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:33,728
Not one word!

292
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:37,101
Not a word? You lucky devil!

293
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,742
Harold, will you please!

294
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:44,713
Now, we've got one million things to do.
Get her an airplane ticket.

295
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:48,650
-You've got to make out a new will.
-Then get her a lawyer in Las Vegas.

296
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,277
You've got to get your physical.

297
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:52,322
-My what?
-Your physical.

298
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:56,348
I’m gonna have a doctor come here
and check you out right here in the office.

299
00:35:56,427 --> 00:35:57,860
it’ll only take a moment.

300
00:35:57,928 --> 00:36:00,021
What the hell are you talking about?

301
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:03,589
I am talking to you about insurance.

302
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,259
insurance, Stan.

303
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:08,065
That'll be enough, thank you. You may go now.

304
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:11,574
You're a married man now, with responsibilities.

305
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:16,307
-What if you were to get hit by a truck?
-Not gonna get hit by a truck!

306
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,745
The point is this.

307
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:21,783
No matter what happens to you...

308
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:25,614
...you are going to want to know that Mrs. Ford...

309
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,148
Mrs. Ford.

310
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,949
I love the way that sounds.

311
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,785
...is being cared for.

312
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,231
All I want to know is that Mrs. Ford...

313
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,192
...is on an airplane to Las Vegas this afternoon!

314
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,567
-That's all that I want to....
-Stanley! Caro.

315
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:44,300
No, please. Will you, please?

316
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:48,436
An affectionate little thing you've got there, lad.

317
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,538
Look at them! Aren't they adorable together?

318
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:54,550
Never thought I’d live to see the day, but Edna...

319
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:57,416
...this is Stan's wife.

320
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,517
Italian.

321
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:04,288
Doesn't speak a W-O-R-D of English.

322
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:07,524
This my wife...

323
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:11,967
...but she speak mucho good Italian.
Go Berlitz. Take lessons.

324
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:14,333
Learn Italian. $300 worth.

325
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:16,201
$300 is many lira.

326
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:19,071
Shut up, Harold.
You sound like a feeble-minded Indian.

327
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:29,051
it’s very simple. I want an annulment.
I do not like being married.

328
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:33,252
How do you know you don't like it
if you haven't tried it?

329
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:34,813
I tried it.

330
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:37,861
lf you've tried it,
then it's too late to get an annulment.

331
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:43,998
Your wife has the cutest sense of humor.
You know what she just said?

332
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,400
She said she met you last night
when she came out of a cake.

333
00:37:48,172 --> 00:37:49,662
That's right, she did!

334
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,207
Sue her for divorce!

335
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:52,264
How?

336
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:53,905
Reason with her.

337
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:57,571
-How?
-You do sound like a feeble-minded Indian.

338
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:00,579
Ask her what she was doing
coming out of that cake.

339
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:11,786
What did she say?

340
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:13,022
What'd she say?

341
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:17,328
She said that was the only job she could get...

342
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:20,029
...because all her clothes were stolen.

343
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,227
-The good doctor.
-Harold.

344
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:26,072
You know Dr. Bentley here.
He's here to give you your physical.

345
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:27,906
One minute. Let me get this straight.

346
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:31,470
Who stole her.... Who stole your clothes?

347
00:38:31,982 --> 00:38:34,416
Miss Lapland.

348
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:35,473
What'd she say?

349
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:38,578
That her clothes were stolen by Miss Lapland,
whoever that is.

350
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:43,354
Stanley, if you'll just slip off your jacket,
start walking up and down these steps.

351
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:46,055
Forty times each way
should be enough for a man your age.

352
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,460
What is your age, anyway?

353
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:49,522
How old do you have to be to get a divorce?

354
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,692
Walk down, Stanley--

355
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,100
I’m not interested in his insurance.
I’m getting a divorce!

356
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:55,763
-Divorce?
-Yes!

357
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,206
Divorce? No. In Italia no divorce.

358
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:15,915
Will you please cut it out? Come on.
Ask her where did all this happen?

359
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:17,517
Where?

360
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,792
What did she say?

361
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,359
''Miss Galaxy contest.''
I think that's what she said.

362
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:28,802
Miss Galaxy contest?

363
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:07,707
What did she say?

364
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:20,449
She said, she would've won the contest
except for one thing.

365
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:22,185
That was the talent part.

366
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:26,025
And her talent was cooking. She made a....

367
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,229
Lasagna soufflé.

368
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:33,668
Lasagna soufflé.
My God, I’ve got to go back to Berlitz.

369
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:37,298
When she bent down
to take the soufflé out of the oven...

370
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,740
...all the men in the audience
started jumping, you know.

371
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,810
And yelling and screaming and....
Down went the soufflé!

372
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,280
Bravo! Bravissimo!

373
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:51,117
I’ll have to ask you a few questions now.

374
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:53,713
I suppose you've had all the children's diseases?

375
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:57,150
No, and I haven't been hit by a truck yet either.

376
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:01,292
How about the measles, mumps,
chickenpox, whooping cough?

377
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:02,389
Yes.

378
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:04,331
Roll up your left sleeve, please.

379
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:06,995
Why can't you get me a divorce? You can't?

380
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,300
Other clients get divorces from their lawyers!

381
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:13,036
Other clients give their attorneys
grounds to work on that get the divorce.

382
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,805
Think about that a little bit, lad.

383
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:17,711
Ever have dizziness, fainting spells,
headaches, asthma?

384
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:18,805
No.

385
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:21,949
-What grounds?
-Grounds like...

386
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,388
...adultery, mental cruelty, desertion, insanity.

387
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:29,425
How would you evaluate
your drinking habits? None at all?

388
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:33,122
Occasional social cocktail? Heavily? To excess?

389
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:34,694
Just once.

390
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:37,163
Just one. You're gonna need one now, boy!

391
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:45,838
Melancholia? Backaches?
Liver, kidney or intestinal ailments?

392
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:47,901
Crying spells?

393
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,780
Poor creature. You know what she just told me?

394
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:58,184
All she has left is what she's wearing,
a bathing suit and a raincoat.

395
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:09,232
I’m going to borrow your darling wife
for the next few hours...

396
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:13,668
...and we're going to buy her everything
from lingerie to a mink coat.

397
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:16,297
I can't get a reading under these conditions!

398
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:35,084
isn’t that darling? You know what she said?

399
00:42:35,158 --> 00:42:39,561
She said she has a coat
and she doesn't wear underwear.

400
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:43,262
Come with me, I’ll take care of everything.

401
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:51,402
You're a member of the club now.

402
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:54,867
A full-fledged member!

403
00:43:11,328 --> 00:43:12,989
-Yes?
-Delivery.

404
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:24,003
-is this the Ford residence?
-Yes. Who are you? What do you want?

405
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,975
Mrs. Ford told me to put this stuff in the kitchen.

406
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:36,212
-Yes?
-Delivery.

407
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,684
Pardon me. is this the Ford residence?

408
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,785
Yes, but....

409
00:43:48,598 --> 00:43:52,193
Mrs. Ford suggested we place these things
directly in her bedroom.

410
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:55,367
There must be some mistake.

411
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:02,135
Yes.

412
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:03,201
Signora Ford.

413
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:52,950
One at a time!
What the hell is going on, Charles?

414
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,789
I’m sorry, sir, but I’m afraid
this new arrangement isn't going to work.

415
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,794
Yes, well I....

416
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:03,195
This woman is mad. Stark, raving mad.

417
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:06,433
She is not only preparing a lasagna soufflé--

418
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:08,334
-A what?
-Lasagna soufflé.

419
00:46:08,405 --> 00:46:10,270
But look at the spaghetti sauce.

420
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,673
Green onions browning
in at least a pound of butter.

421
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,776
Eggplant swimming in oil!

422
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:18,814
Smells good, though, doesn't it?

423
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:25,048
Sir, I am not given to issuing ultimata...

424
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:27,612
...but it's simple, you'll have to choose.

425
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:29,591
Either she goes or I go!

426
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:32,719
I’ve been trying to settle it,
if you won't be so arbitrary.

427
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:35,657
it’s the kid's first day.
She doesn't know the ropes yet.

428
00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:37,859
Say no more. I quite understand.

429
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,060
In fact, I thought it might come to this.

430
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:43,333
Therefore, I took the precaution
of re-packing my bags.

431
00:46:43,406 --> 00:46:46,068
Wait just a minute. Will you stop this?

432
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:48,633
Where do you think you're gonna go?
What would you do?

433
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:52,443
Actually, sir, Mr. Rawlins phoned this afternoon.

434
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:54,107
What? Old Tobey?

435
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:58,985
Yes, sir. As he has decided not to marry,
and you have decided the reverse...

436
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:02,991
...it was his feeling that perhaps
I might feel happier working for him.

437
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,493
And I could not agree with him more, sir!

438
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:06,824
Charles.

439
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:10,664
-Charlie. That is a goodbye, no?
-What?

440
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:14,033
-Charles is a goodbye, no?
-is a goodbye, yes! lf I don't--

441
00:47:25,382 --> 00:47:29,842
-Your mother is coming?
-Yes!

442
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:32,319
Oh, my God!

443
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:38,059
No cocktail. Edna teach me say ''no cocktail.''

444
00:47:42,298 --> 00:47:43,458
Charles.

445
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:54,170
I’ll get rid of her, I promise you.

446
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:01,646
You won't like working for Tobey. He drinks!

447
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:04,145
Dames up there all the time.

448
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:06,415
He's a lumpy.

449
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,219
He leaves wet towels
lying all around the bathroom!

450
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,583
Arrivederci!

451
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:13,228
Look!

452
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,927
There's no sense getting hysterical
and everything. Are you all right in there?

453
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:48,188
Are you....

454
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,330
Look, please.

455
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:01,169
Hello! Will you please....

456
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:03,940
lf there's one thing I can't stand,
it's a woman crying.

457
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:05,878
I just go all....

458
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:12,746
You want a Kleenex?

459
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:33,506
Thank you.

460
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,180
No, please. Look, I’m sorry.

461
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,616
Please. Look. I’m sorry.

462
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:50,284
Sorry.

463
00:50:33,036 --> 00:50:34,697
Darling!

464
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:45,905
Lunch.

465
00:51:53,783 --> 00:51:56,251
Stanley. I again have forget.

466
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,152
The ones with the white hats...

467
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:01,782
...are they the good guys or the bad guys?

468
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:07,885
White hats, good guys.
Black hats, bad guys. Okay?

469
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:10,995
Okay. Thank you very much.

470
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:25,670
What's the matter with you, boy?
You look just awful.

471
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:28,012
I’m exhausted, that's what's the matter.

472
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:30,483
I haven't had two hours sleep in three weeks.

473
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:31,679
Newlyweds.

474
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:36,087
It isn't that at all.

475
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,919
Not entirely that.

476
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:41,091
The damned TV. She's got it going all night long.

477
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:42,322
I’ll bet!

478
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:45,332
She does.

479
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:47,536
Claims it helps her with her English.

480
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,637
Oh, brother!

481
00:53:13,896 --> 00:53:15,363
Damn!

482
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:26,368
I’m a delicate and highly complex mechanism...

483
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:28,740
...and I’m being over wound.

484
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:30,544
Over wound!

485
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,578
Poor darling!

486
00:53:35,651 --> 00:53:39,417
Work, pressure. The tension mounts.

487
00:53:39,522 --> 00:53:42,389
Before you know it, headache strikes.

488
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:43,581
What?

489
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:46,958
They talk always about this on TV.

490
00:53:53,903 --> 00:53:57,236
Darling, I have a three-way formula.

491
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:59,001
-What?
-How they say?

492
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:01,303
''Fast, fast, fast...

493
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:03,610
''...relief.''

494
00:54:30,306 --> 00:54:33,867
-Good morning, Signora Ford. Ciao.
-Ciao.

495
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,775
Good morning.

496
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:38,279
-Hi, Mrs. Ford.
-Ciao!

497
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,592
Anybody home?

498
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:32,387
Stanley.

499
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:34,995
The breakfast is almost ready.

500
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,765
My darling, good morning.

501
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:45,932
Look. Please, all I want
is some dry toast and black coffee.

502
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:50,104
I weigh 182 pounds
and my clothes don't fit anymore and....

503
00:56:50,713 --> 00:56:52,010
is very good.

504
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:53,943
is good?

505
00:56:55,985 --> 00:57:00,615
Stanley, look,
the light bulb is a goed out in the pantry.

506
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,158
I’ll get an electrician to fix.

507
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:07,491
No. I have light bulbs here. Just a moment.

508
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:10,361
-Why can't we get an electrician?
-No.

509
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:13,300
Look, they got a very strong union.
I don't want to....

510
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:16,236
The other husbands change
the light bulbs every day.

511
00:57:16,305 --> 00:57:19,399
is very good for you. is work with your hands.

512
00:57:19,475 --> 00:57:20,874
It make you relax.

513
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:24,936
Okay, all right.

514
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:29,342
You can get a shock from electricity...

515
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:31,852
...if you don't know what you're doing. I don't.

516
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:35,920
When I was 22,
I thought you had to cover all the outlets...

517
00:57:35,992 --> 00:57:38,426
...in the room, or the electricity would leak out.

518
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:40,422
Cover up all the....

519
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,799
I’ll do it. I know what'll happen. I’ll screw it in....

520
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:47,059
Mamma mia!

521
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,970
Poor darling.

522
00:58:19,135 --> 00:58:22,866
-it’s funny. it’s very funny!
-Very funny.

523
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,433
I have a good idea.

524
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:28,939
The Brannigans have the first guests for dinner.

525
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:31,878
Everything goes wrong. it’s funny, no?

526
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:35,781
I invite Edna and Harold. I go call them.

527
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,884
In a little while.

528
00:58:57,472 --> 00:58:59,303
Well? Open it!

529
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:03,410
-Hi, everybody!
-Hi!

530
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:05,469
Hello, Stan. Hello, Mrs. Ford.

531
00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:08,983
I’m sorry we're late,
but it's all Harold's fault, really.

532
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,848
He's dressed
an hour before we're supposed to leave.

533
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,821
Then he paces in front of my room
looking at his watch.

534
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,518
Makes me so nervous,
it's a wonder I’m dressed at all.

535
00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:22,086
You're looking mighty good in there, lad.

536
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:25,189
Don't you love those pajamas?
I picked them out for her myself.

537
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:28,202
Green. Putting on a little weight, too.

538
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:32,765
Must be the home cooking.

539
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:39,035
It is necessary you speak English...

540
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:41,175
...with me...

541
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,975
...because...

542
00:59:44,386 --> 00:59:45,648
...no learn!

543
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:49,288
-You're right. You're absolutely right.
-Thank you.

544
00:59:49,357 --> 00:59:52,554
You've married yourself a treasure,
you lucky man.

545
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:56,196
Look at transformation!

546
00:59:56,564 --> 00:59:58,429
-is beautiful?
-I love it.

547
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,297
I love it.

548
01:00:02,003 --> 01:00:05,734
I checked with Tiffany's
and your real present will be ready next week.

549
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:09,004
This is nothing I bought at Lord & Taylor's,
but it's so cute.

550
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:12,171
-We got one for our bar at home, too.
-Thank you.

551
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,246
Stanley, I love the place now, I really do.

552
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:19,752
It used to be attractive, in a way.

553
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,491
Well, I always thought
it was rather cold and austere.

554
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:26,220
Now, it's just marvelous, that's all.

555
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:32,264
''Danger. Men drinking.'' it’s very droll.

556
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:35,363
I know just where it should go, too!

557
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:39,940
''Danger. Men drinking.'' it’s cute, Stan.

558
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:44,842
it’s pretty cute.
Reminds me of a fellow at the office.

559
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:47,143
He has one of them up there that reads:

560
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:49,549
-''Think or--''
-''Or swim.''

561
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:51,311
How'd you know?

562
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:54,321
I’m getting to be an expert
on prefabricated American humor.

563
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:00,858
Live dangerously.

564
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:07,198
Yeah, that's the way it goes.

565
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:12,335
it’s wonderful to see Stanley so happy.

566
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:16,705
I can't tell you how grateful I am
that somebody finally nailed him.

567
01:01:16,778 --> 01:01:18,439
Nailed.

568
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,352
When one of them
is running around loose, nobody's safe.

569
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:28,513
Even old Harold used to come home...

570
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:32,287
...have three drinks
and start talking about his freedom.

571
01:01:32,394 --> 01:01:33,759
''Freedom.''

572
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:39,060
They're like children, you know?

573
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:44,333
But I think...

574
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,773
...they are...

575
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:49,503
...very sweet.

576
01:01:49,577 --> 01:01:52,910
-Sweet?
-I like very much.

577
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:56,745
Of course they are,
but you see with us it's different.

578
01:01:56,818 --> 01:02:00,549
A woman is never really free until she is married.

579
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:04,285
Now she's free to enjoy the good things in life,
she can spend money.

580
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:05,950
You know, money.

581
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:09,428
Have little affairs and still be taken care of.

582
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:13,767
That's why men have to be controlled.

583
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:17,299
Right, right!

584
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:20,432
For the good of the home,
the casa. Understand?

585
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:24,942
Actually, it's just a matter
of keeping them off balance, you know?

586
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:28,144
Look, I’ll show you something.

587
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,179
The door is closed?

588
01:02:31,086 --> 01:02:35,045
They can't hear us,
and we can't hear them, right?

589
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,989
Okay, watch.

590
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,120
Harold!

591
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:45,297
That's right. Yes, dear?

592
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:46,833
I heard that!

593
01:02:47,535 --> 01:02:49,127
Heard what, dear?

594
01:02:49,204 --> 01:02:50,933
You know very well what!

595
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,735
No, I don't, but if you wanted....

596
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:58,339
Look, let's not discuss it in front of strangers.

597
01:02:58,813 --> 01:03:00,610
But you were....

598
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:03,276
We'll talk about it when we get home.

599
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:14,653
You see? They're always guilty as hell
about something.

600
01:03:16,131 --> 01:03:17,223
Good!

601
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,031
Very good!

602
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:24,260
So he says, ''Sam, you can't...

603
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:27,966
''...but I, Sam, I can do it.

604
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:30,944
''Sam, you got, you know....''

605
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:32,906
That's the funny part of it.

606
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:34,209
Stanley!

607
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:36,482
Bring the soup, please.

608
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,712
But you must have help because....

609
01:03:38,786 --> 01:03:42,688
I know a marvelous woman.
She's Dutch and expensive!

610
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,587
-Good.
-She's expensive but....

611
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:49,586
You had another drink
when we were in the kitchen.

612
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:52,292
I can tell by that funny look in your eye.

613
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:56,167
What's the point of her cooking all day
if you're too drunk to enjoy it?

614
01:03:56,237 --> 01:03:57,636
She's right.

615
01:03:58,439 --> 01:03:59,838
Harold, this is your place.

616
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:01,306
Over there?

617
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,882
He.... He.... He....

618
01:04:58,466 --> 01:05:02,095
Hey, Bash! Very funny! What a boob!

619
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:04,231
My wife loved it!

620
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,604
Hi, this is Mr. Ford. Would you put Harold,
Mr. Lampson, on the phone, please?

621
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:17,770
What?

622
01:06:19,614 --> 01:06:20,808
You do?

623
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:23,412
You think it's cute?

624
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:26,009
And it's so typical?

625
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:30,524
You just loved it when I, when he, spilled the....

626
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,619
Look, could I remind you of something?

627
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:35,060
You're a secretary, and a very inefficient one!

628
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:36,391
Not only that, you're a woman!

629
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:38,864
As such, your opinions mean nothing to me!

630
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:41,333
Now put Mr. Lampson on the phone!

631
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,600
Harold, it's Stan.

632
01:06:46,874 --> 01:06:48,899
There's gonna be some changes around here.

633
01:06:48,976 --> 01:06:50,841
I want a full-scale meeting this morning.

634
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:54,404
You, me, the guys from the syndicate,
the accountants and everybody.

635
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:55,642
11:00!

636
01:06:56,217 --> 01:06:58,845
What? No, not here. I hate here!

637
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,286
I hate your office! At the club!

638
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,381
You hear me? At the club!

639
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:06,685
Club!

640
01:07:17,905 --> 01:07:19,839
-Hello?
-Hi, dear.

641
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:23,067
Listen, I’m sorry to wake you,
but I think this is an emergency.

642
01:07:23,144 --> 01:07:24,236
What?

643
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:27,913
I just called Harold's office,
and they told me he's in a meeting...

644
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:29,916
...with Stanley at the club.

645
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:33,579
I still not see. What is wrong with the club?

646
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:36,754
You can't keep track of them
when they're in the club.

647
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:40,123
That's what's wrong with it.
You can't even be sure they're there!

648
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:44,290
Of course he is there.
I will call him on the telephone.

649
01:07:44,365 --> 01:07:48,199
Oh, sure, go ahead.
Call him, I’ll tell you what you'll get.

650
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:51,033
You'll get, ''I’m very sorry...

651
01:07:51,105 --> 01:07:54,268
''...but Mr. Ford
cannot be reached at the moment.

652
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,343
''He's in the gymnasium.''

653
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,075
Gymnasium.

654
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:01,842
He's probably off handholding
with some movie starlet.

655
01:08:02,116 --> 01:08:04,209
I think maybe I call him.

656
01:08:04,886 --> 01:08:07,320
I think maybe I call him right now.

657
01:08:07,522 --> 01:08:08,750
Good luck.

658
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:09,949
Thank you.

659
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:11,286
Goodbye.

660
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,330
Hello?

661
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:30,274
Mr. Stanley Ford, please.

662
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:33,438
I’m sorry, I can't reach Mr. Ford
just at the moment.

663
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:34,845
He's in the gymnasium.

664
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,180
Thank you very much.

665
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:41,712
I’ll admit it, Stan.

666
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:44,690
At first, down at the shop,
we all thought you were crazy.

667
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,421
Marry Bash Brannigan off?
It just didn't seem right.

668
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:51,261
-It wasn't. That's the whole idea.
-But, Stan-boy, I was wrong!

669
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:52,390
We were all wrong.

670
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:55,061
Sure, America has taken
the Brannigans to its heart.

671
01:08:55,136 --> 01:08:57,468
For the first time, women are reading the strip.

672
01:08:57,538 --> 01:08:59,233
Why, my wife just loves it now.

673
01:08:59,307 --> 01:09:01,468
This morning, when he spilled the soup?

674
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:02,873
She says it reminds her of me.

675
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:06,175
Anyway, Stan-boy, the thing is,
we were all wrong.

676
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:10,274
No, you weren't all wrong.
It was a mistake, a tragic mistake.

677
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:14,218
-That's why I called the meeting.
-I still don't understand.

678
01:09:14,288 --> 01:09:17,621
Why did we have to have the meeting here?

679
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:21,492
Edna must've called me
at least 15 times at the office by now.

680
01:09:21,562 --> 01:09:24,053
You see, Edna doesn't like it
when I’m someplace...

681
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:26,725
...where she can't reach me by phone.

682
01:09:27,468 --> 01:09:31,029
That's the beautiful part about the club.
They can't reach us here.

683
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:33,130
it’s the one place left that's safe.

684
01:09:36,043 --> 01:09:37,374
Thank you.

685
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,670
Just a moment.

686
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:43,911
I’m sorry, but no ladies allowed inside the club.

687
01:09:44,785 --> 01:09:46,377
Well, thank you.

688
01:09:54,228 --> 01:09:57,220
I’m sorry, I can't reach Mr. Edwards just now.

689
01:09:57,365 --> 01:09:59,230
He's in the gymnasium.

690
01:10:03,437 --> 01:10:06,167
And, Stan, the big thing to remember now is...

691
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,333
...the Brannigans are a natural for TV.

692
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:12,311
Sure, all we need is some beautiful,
intelligent girl to play the wife.

693
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,008
And some drooling,
feeble-minded idiot to play Bash.

694
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:17,607
You've got yourself
a built-in audience of 80 million.

695
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:20,950
And not only that, but merchandise.

696
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:25,618
I think they've come up with
some sensational tie-ins.

697
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,784
Get this.

698
01:10:26,861 --> 01:10:29,421
Official Bash Brannigan...

699
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:32,898
...his-and-hers matching cooking aprons.

700
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:37,895
''The family that sautés together, stays together.''

701
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:40,531
I think that's the slogan.

702
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:45,612
Good morning.

703
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,086
Good morning.

704
01:10:53,387 --> 01:10:54,752
Stay, stay!

705
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,429
it’s all right.

706
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:23,711
Darling!

707
01:11:24,118 --> 01:11:26,985
All that, day and night, Stan.

708
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,917
Stanley, darling!

709
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:34,627
Forgive me for doubting you even one moment.

710
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:36,625
Mr. Ford!

711
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:42,224
In the 123 proud years of this club's existence...

712
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:44,026
...not once...

713
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:48,706
...has a female of any description
set foot on these premises.

714
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:53,010
We're an understanding bunch
here at the club, Mr. Ford.

715
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:56,038
A fellow has one too many at the bar...

716
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:59,416
...we see to it that he gets to his train all right.

717
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:03,249
A fellow has a little hokey-pokey
going in the afternoon...

718
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:05,018
...his wife calls...

719
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:06,719
...we say he's in the gym.

720
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:09,456
But this, Mr. Ford, is too much!

721
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:12,592
As Chairman of the Rules Committee...

722
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:17,468
...I suggest you spare yourself
the embarrassment of an open hearing...

723
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:21,137
...and submit your resignation at once.

724
01:12:27,314 --> 01:12:30,147
Darling, I do something bad?

725
01:12:48,903 --> 01:12:52,999
I may take this lying down,
like the drooling, feeble-minded idiot that I am.

726
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:57,240
But Bash Brannigan will not! I promise you that!

727
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:06,984
Charles, she's in love,
so she's never going to agree to a divorce.

728
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:09,545
So we're left with only one choice.

729
01:13:10,858 --> 01:13:12,052
Murder!

730
01:13:13,794 --> 01:13:14,988
Murder?

731
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,523
Murder.

732
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:20,090
I say, good show, sir.

733
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:22,736
Absolutely bang on!

734
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:25,135
Exactly six weeks from today....

735
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:29,008
Mrs. Brannigan is gone.

736
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,875
Bash can get back to being a secret agent.

737
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:36,276
What's the matter?

738
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,315
Let me understand, sir.

739
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:42,446
It is Mrs. Brannigan you're going to murder
in the comic strip?

740
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:43,854
Yes. Why?

741
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:45,752
I see.

742
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,918
What is it?

743
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:48,461
Nothing, sir.

744
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,623
Only, just for one moment...

745
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:54,758
...one mad, glorious moment...

746
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:56,929
...I thought....

747
01:13:57,438 --> 01:14:01,704
However, if Bash Brannigan...

748
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:05,269
...can murder his wife and get away with it....

749
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,977
Who knows, sir?

750
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,281
Who knows?

751
01:14:12,419 --> 01:14:13,681
Barman.

752
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:16,816
The same again, please...

753
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:20,588
...and this time,
see that the glasses are decently chilled.

754
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:06,537
Mr. Ford, this is the most powerful single...

755
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:10,839
...remote-control device
created by the Western World.

756
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:36,996
An excellent tranquilizer, Mr. Ford.

757
01:15:37,071 --> 01:15:41,974
Gentle, fast-acting, eliminates tension,
removes excessive inhibitions...

758
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:45,170
...and is almost completely without
harmful side effects.

759
01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:46,770
-Almost?
-Almost.

760
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:49,811
Alka-dexa-benza-thera-pota-zallimine...

761
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:51,678
...as your doctor calls it...

762
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:55,586
...in this case, as I happen to be your doctor,
that's what I call it...

763
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,648
...is dangerous only when taken
in conjunction with alcohol.

764
01:15:59,426 --> 01:16:02,486
Even a sip of alcohol
after taking one of these pills and....

765
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:03,552
And?

766
01:16:04,431 --> 01:16:06,592
-Right up the wall.
-As you doctors call it.

767
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,191
-And then....
-And then?

768
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:11,030
Right down again.

769
01:16:18,212 --> 01:16:21,238
-Thank you, Dr. Bentley.
-You're welcome.

770
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,925
Here.

771
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:22,999
Thank you.

772
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:40,384
Mrs. Ford, may I have the pleasure of this dance?

773
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,779
Yes.

774
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,186
Yup.

775
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:08,532
-Stanley, I’m really expert at handling--
-Can I be of any assistance?

776
01:21:08,635 --> 01:21:12,662
-Don't be silly, Your Honor, you're smashed.
-I’m as sober as a judge.

777
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,704
I had to do this for Harold last New Year's Eve...

778
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,266
...so I know exactly....

779
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:19,869
Poor baby! She looks so pale!

780
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:23,883
I think maybe put some cold water on her head
and I’ll make some coffee.

781
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:26,181
Okay, I’ll call you in a few minutes.

782
01:21:26,253 --> 01:21:28,118
-Yes, but--
-Bye, Edna.

783
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:33,448
Hi, Stan. I’ve been looking all over for these.

784
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:37,095
Mrs. Ford, Miss James.

785
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:29,678
Come on, you silly, drunken old bat!

786
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:37,258
it’s wonderful. She won't remember a thing.

787
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,855
I can say anything I want, actually.

788
01:26:46,273 --> 01:26:49,037
Come on, you silly,
drunken, meddlesome old bat!

789
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:53,307
Yes, ''old bat'' is what I said,
and ''old bat'' is what I meant!

790
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,079
You old bat!

791
01:30:58,758 --> 01:30:59,918
Hello?

792
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:05,122
Dear?

793
01:31:17,143 --> 01:31:18,610
Anybody home?

794
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:28,413
How could she have disappeared?

795
01:31:29,088 --> 01:31:33,855
Stan, wives don't just suddenly
up and disappear like that!

796
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:37,820
What I mean is, it's not that easy, boy.

797
01:31:37,897 --> 01:31:39,990
I mean, it's not that easy!

798
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:44,694
You and I both know what women are, Mr. Ford.

799
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:47,762
They're sensitive little creatures.

800
01:31:47,907 --> 01:31:52,037
They're masters, or should I say
mistresses, of the fancied slight.

801
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:56,376
Some little, teeny thing goes wrong, and...

802
01:31:56,749 --> 01:31:58,546
...off they go, home to mother.

803
01:31:58,618 --> 01:32:01,678
And that's probably where your wife is now.
With her mother.

804
01:32:01,788 --> 01:32:03,779
Somewhere in Italy!

805
01:32:04,057 --> 01:32:05,388
Thank you.

806
01:32:50,503 --> 01:32:53,233
...which concludes our report from Washington.

807
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:57,037
In a lighter vein, readers of 463 newspapers...

808
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,944
...from Bangor, Maine, to Honolulu
are asking this question:

809
01:33:02,081 --> 01:33:05,244
''Will Bash Brannigan,
hero of America's favorite comic strip...

810
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:07,581
''...The Brannigans, really murder his wife?''

811
01:33:07,654 --> 01:33:10,782
If the answer is yes,
is this, then, the beginning of a trend?

812
01:33:10,857 --> 01:33:15,021
Will Dagwood murder Blondie?
Will Li'I Abner knock off Daisy Mae?

813
01:33:16,496 --> 01:33:19,397
The answer remains the secret
of cartoonist Stanley Ford.

814
01:33:19,465 --> 01:33:23,162
And Mrs. Ford, said to be
the real-life prototype of Mrs. Brannigan...

815
01:33:23,236 --> 01:33:25,136
...is unavailable for comment.

816
01:33:25,204 --> 01:33:27,570
On the weather picture, in New York tonight....

817
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:40,101
it’s perfectly clear what happened.

818
01:34:40,246 --> 01:34:42,339
She saw the drawings of the murder...

819
01:34:42,415 --> 01:34:45,077
...and in a typically idiotic female way...

820
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:48,746
...she took it as some kind
of personal insult or something, I don't know.

821
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:50,550
Anyway, to make....

822
01:34:50,857 --> 01:34:53,257
lf we're pacing, let's work out a traffic pattern.

823
01:34:53,326 --> 01:34:56,318
You go this way, I’ll go that way, all right?

824
01:34:56,429 --> 01:34:59,762
Anyway, she just picked up her raincoat
and her bathing suit...

825
01:34:59,832 --> 01:35:01,459
...and our dog and she left!

826
01:35:01,534 --> 01:35:04,901
Look, I’m sure that's exactly the way it happened.

827
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:09,965
But there is an awful lot of evidence,
circumstantial I’ll admit...

828
01:35:10,777 --> 01:35:12,802
...a lot of evidence, lad.

829
01:35:13,346 --> 01:35:17,248
You can't try anybody for murder
unless you produce a body!

830
01:35:17,316 --> 01:35:21,810
Normally, that would be true, but in this case....

831
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:25,551
You see, you and I and Edna...

832
01:35:26,325 --> 01:35:27,815
...and the police...

833
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:32,422
...and 80 million readers of 463 newspapers...

834
01:35:32,498 --> 01:35:34,295
...from Maine to Honolulu, know it.

835
01:35:34,367 --> 01:35:36,995
Even my kids all know that you murdered her...

836
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:41,564
...and buried her in the goop
from the gloppitta-gloppitta machine!

837
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:44,340
What I mean is...

838
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:48,176
...I’m going to be doing my very best for you.

839
01:35:49,315 --> 01:35:53,012
But it's only fair to warn you that...

840
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:55,821
...it doesn't look good.

841
01:35:56,422 --> 01:35:59,858
It does not look good.

842
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,063
Murdered his wife...

843
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:12,905
...fiendishly and in cold blood.

844
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:17,108
But even beyond this...

845
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:22,379
...I ask you to consider the arrogance of the man.

846
01:36:23,316 --> 01:36:27,776
Not content with his crime,
he then proceeded to publish...

847
01:36:27,854 --> 01:36:31,221
...in 463 newspapers...

848
01:36:31,524 --> 01:36:34,254
...from Bangor, Maine, to Honolulu...

849
01:36:35,128 --> 01:36:39,497
...each shocking detail of his murder plan.

850
01:36:42,301 --> 01:36:44,394
It doesn't look good.

851
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:53,567
He regretted his marriage
from the very beginning...

852
01:36:53,646 --> 01:36:56,547
...and made every effort to worm his way out of it.

853
01:36:56,616 --> 01:36:58,243
I object, Your Honor!

854
01:36:58,317 --> 01:37:02,344
Harold, how many times have I told you
not to interrupt me when I’m talking?

855
01:37:02,922 --> 01:37:04,856
But, dear, you said you--

856
01:37:04,924 --> 01:37:06,892
Shut up! You know he killed her!

857
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:07,983
But, dear!

858
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,756
And let me tell you something else,
Harold Lampson.

859
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:15,028
lf you go on defending known murderers,
you're going to wake up one morning...

860
01:37:15,101 --> 01:37:17,399
...and find yourself disbarred!

861
01:37:20,139 --> 01:37:22,869
And it is your opinion that this drug....

862
01:37:23,676 --> 01:37:27,578
''Alka-dexa-benza-thera-pota-zallimine,''
as your doctor calls it.

863
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:31,313
In this case, of course,
as I don't happen to be your doctor...

864
01:37:31,384 --> 01:37:33,375
...you can just call them ''goof balls.''

865
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,851
Thank you.

866
01:37:36,222 --> 01:37:40,283
Anyway, Doctor,
it is your opinion that these ''goof balls...''

867
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:44,352
...can, under certain conditions,
be extremely dangerous?

868
01:37:45,865 --> 01:37:50,825
Only if taken in conjunction with alcohol.
Otherwise, harmless, absolutely harmless.

869
01:37:50,903 --> 01:37:53,963
You get a little high, you have a few laughs...

870
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,564
...an occasional burst into song--

871
01:37:55,641 --> 01:37:59,702
Would you be good enough
to describe the effect of these things...

872
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:01,804
...when taken with alcohol?

873
01:38:01,881 --> 01:38:03,212
Certainly.

874
01:38:04,483 --> 01:38:05,882
Right up the wall.

875
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,351
Then...

876
01:38:07,787 --> 01:38:08,981
...right down again.

877
01:38:25,004 --> 01:38:27,802
And you contend, Mr. Burbank...

878
01:38:27,873 --> 01:38:31,934
...that Mr. Ford was simply conducting a dry run?

879
01:38:32,511 --> 01:38:36,607
Merely testing a murder plan for his comic strip?

880
01:38:37,116 --> 01:38:38,640
Precisely, sir!

881
01:38:38,818 --> 01:38:42,219
You see, Mr. Ford would never ask
Bash Brannigan...

882
01:38:42,288 --> 01:38:45,724
...to do anything
that he hadn't already done himself.

883
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:49,522
including murder his wife?

884
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,824
Well....

885
01:38:52,865 --> 01:38:55,857
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Burbank...

886
01:38:55,935 --> 01:39:00,872
...that Mr. Ford perhaps wanted you to think
it was only a dry run?

887
01:39:02,074 --> 01:39:04,304
The night was dark, was it not?

888
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:06,334
Yes, sir, but you--

889
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:10,405
And by your own admission, you observed
and photographed the entire operation...

890
01:39:10,483 --> 01:39:14,249
...from a hotel window
no closer than a block away?

891
01:39:14,387 --> 01:39:15,411
Quite, sir, but--

892
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:19,515
Then for all you know, it was Mrs. Ford's body...

893
01:39:19,592 --> 01:39:21,924
...he buried in the wet cement?

894
01:39:29,068 --> 01:39:30,330
I say....

895
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:32,737
You don't....

896
01:39:33,205 --> 01:39:35,298
You don't actually mean....

897
01:39:35,975 --> 01:39:38,808
But of course! You're absolutely right!

898
01:39:38,878 --> 01:39:43,178
What a silly ninny I was
not to have seen through him before!

899
01:39:43,249 --> 01:39:45,012
Of course he did it!

900
01:39:46,852 --> 01:39:48,319
Congratulations, sir!

901
01:39:48,387 --> 01:39:51,288
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

902
01:39:51,357 --> 01:39:53,382
Do you know you had me completely fooled?

903
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:55,893
I thought it was a dummy! Even I!

904
01:39:56,896 --> 01:39:59,387
That makes me a bit of a dummy, doesn't it, sir?

905
01:39:59,465 --> 01:40:02,025
I can't tell you how happy I am.

906
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:06,094
I’ll give Mr. Rawlins my notice
and take up residence early next week.

907
01:40:06,172 --> 01:40:08,333
The prosecution rests.

908
01:40:18,117 --> 01:40:21,382
I don't think there's one chance in ten...

909
01:40:21,454 --> 01:40:24,787
...that they'll actually send you to the chair.

910
01:40:24,857 --> 01:40:26,290
Well, maybe one.

911
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:30,819
But, personally, I think it'll be somewhere
between, say, 20 years and life...

912
01:40:30,896 --> 01:40:34,855
...which isn't so terribly bad
when you come right down to think of it.

913
01:40:34,934 --> 01:40:38,199
I mean, you always liked simple food...

914
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:40,795
...and a regulated, well-ordered life.

915
01:40:40,873 --> 01:40:43,706
And looking at it from my point of view...

916
01:40:44,076 --> 01:40:46,135
...if I had gotten you off...

917
01:40:46,212 --> 01:40:48,203
...Edna would've been just furious.

918
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:50,748
She wouldn't have spoken to me
for a couple of months.

919
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:55,685
You know how she is when she gets into a mood.
She makes my life an absolute, living hell.

920
01:40:56,222 --> 01:40:57,849
No kidding, Stan.

921
01:40:57,990 --> 01:41:01,858
Losing this case tomorrow
may be a little tough on you.

922
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:06,861
But it's one of the best things
that's happened to my home life in years.

923
01:41:11,337 --> 01:41:12,964
Hear ye, hear ye.

924
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:16,633
The Court of General Sessions is now in session.

925
01:41:18,277 --> 01:41:20,302
lf it please the Court, may I call--

926
01:41:20,379 --> 01:41:22,540
Your Honor, from this point forward...

927
01:41:22,615 --> 01:41:25,914
...I would like to dispense with counsel
and conduct my own defense.

928
01:41:25,985 --> 01:41:27,748
For my first and only witness...

929
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:31,813
...I would like to call my friend
and former attorney, Mr. Harold Lampson.

930
01:41:31,891 --> 01:41:32,880
You must be--

931
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:34,983
Will you approach the bench, gentlemen?

932
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,961
Hey, wait a minute! Stan, you....

933
01:41:38,531 --> 01:41:40,931
Now, let me understand this, Mr. Ford.

934
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,797
You wish to be your own counsel...

935
01:41:42,868 --> 01:41:45,268
...and call him as a witness for the defense?

936
01:41:45,337 --> 01:41:46,668
I do, Your Honor.

937
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:48,832
I really don't know what to say.

938
01:41:48,908 --> 01:41:53,174
How about, ''This is most irregular,
but he may take the stand''?

939
01:41:54,013 --> 01:41:55,105
Thank you.

940
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:58,378
This is most irregular, but he may take the stand.

941
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:04,012
Now, wait a minute, Stan.

942
01:42:04,824 --> 01:42:06,553
This is ridiculous!

943
01:42:06,725 --> 01:42:09,387
You don't even know how to conduct a....

944
01:42:09,462 --> 01:42:11,692
I could have got you off from 20 years to life.

945
01:42:11,764 --> 01:42:14,858
But this way you're gonna wind up
in the electric chair!

946
01:42:14,934 --> 01:42:17,164
Raise your right hand, please.

947
01:42:19,839 --> 01:42:23,707
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but, so help you God?

948
01:42:23,776 --> 01:42:25,403
-I do.
-Be seated.

949
01:42:26,412 --> 01:42:28,607
State your full name, please.

950
01:42:29,148 --> 01:42:31,013
-Harold Lampson.
-Are you married, Harold?

951
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:33,677
You know damn well that I’ve been....

952
01:42:35,754 --> 01:42:37,085
Yes.

953
01:42:37,723 --> 01:42:41,090
-How many years you been married?
-Let's see.

954
01:42:41,494 --> 01:42:43,189
Hal Jr. is 10.

955
01:42:44,029 --> 01:42:46,623
We were living on West 11th Street at the time.

956
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:50,499
So that would make it in the neighborhood of--

957
01:42:50,569 --> 01:42:52,366
Eleven years, you idiot!

958
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,207
Eleven glorious, wonderful years.

959
01:42:59,645 --> 01:43:00,634
That's right.

960
01:43:00,713 --> 01:43:03,739
Eleven glorious, wonderful years.

961
01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:06,577
Your Honor, I fail to see what--

962
01:43:06,652 --> 01:43:09,450
I’m merely trying to establish
the witness's qualifications.

963
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:10,819
As what?

964
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:13,859
As a typical example of a happily married,
American male.

965
01:43:13,926 --> 01:43:17,157
That's what you are, isn't it?
A happily married, American male?

966
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:18,890
Yes, I suppose so.

967
01:43:18,998 --> 01:43:22,434
Stan, look, you're doing this all wrong.

968
01:43:23,035 --> 01:43:25,902
-You have two lovely children?
-Yes.

969
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:29,338
A house in Scarsdale,
a late-model station wagon, a Great Dane, right?

970
01:43:29,408 --> 01:43:30,397
Yes, that's right.

971
01:43:30,476 --> 01:43:33,639
Therefore, I submit
that the witness is eminently qualified.

972
01:43:33,712 --> 01:43:37,079
Now, I’m going to ask you a question.

973
01:43:37,149 --> 01:43:39,208
I want you to think it over very carefully...

974
01:43:39,285 --> 01:43:42,584
...and then answer me
as honestly as you possibly can, okay?

975
01:43:42,655 --> 01:43:43,644
Yeah.

976
01:43:43,722 --> 01:43:46,247
-Do you believe in marriage?
-What?

977
01:43:46,592 --> 01:43:50,551
Do you believe in marriage as an institution?
Do you believe in it?

978
01:43:52,164 --> 01:43:55,190
Hell, yes, sure, of course I believe in it!

979
01:43:55,267 --> 01:43:58,395
What kind of a question is that anyway?

980
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:01,735
From where I sit, which you said
may well be an electric chair...

981
01:44:01,807 --> 01:44:03,798
...it's rather a central one, I’d say.

982
01:44:03,876 --> 01:44:07,539
However, let me put it to you
a slightly different way.

983
01:44:08,681 --> 01:44:11,047
Let us assume for a moment...

984
01:44:12,084 --> 01:44:17,078
...that this dot I have just drawn is a button.

985
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,979
A button?

986
01:44:20,426 --> 01:44:21,688
A button.

987
01:44:22,494 --> 01:44:23,984
All right, it's a button.

988
01:44:24,063 --> 01:44:28,363
Let's further assume
that if you were to push that button...

989
01:44:28,434 --> 01:44:32,302
...your wife, Edna, to whom
you've been married for 11 wonderful years...

990
01:44:32,371 --> 01:44:34,771
...would suddenly and magically disappear.

991
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,705
-Disappear?
-Yes, as in vanish.

992
01:44:36,775 --> 01:44:38,174
Not be here.

993
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:40,505
No longer exist.

994
01:44:41,547 --> 01:44:42,809
I object!

995
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:43,973
Overruled!

996
01:44:44,049 --> 01:44:45,880
That's right, overruled!

997
01:44:45,951 --> 01:44:50,081
And will you please shut up?
This is beginning to get interesting.

998
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:52,321
Thank you, Your Honor.

999
01:44:52,391 --> 01:44:54,154
Let me add two important things.

1000
01:44:54,259 --> 01:44:56,693
Her disappearance
would be completely harmless.

1001
01:44:56,762 --> 01:45:01,495
But what's more important,
no one, repeat, no one...

1002
01:45:01,567 --> 01:45:05,196
...would ever know
that it was you who pushed that button.

1003
01:45:09,108 --> 01:45:12,271
-No one would ever know?
-No one would ever know.

1004
01:45:14,113 --> 01:45:17,571
-No one would ever know?
-No one would ever know.

1005
01:45:19,218 --> 01:45:20,810
How old are you?

1006
01:45:21,186 --> 01:45:22,210
52.

1007
01:45:23,856 --> 01:45:25,824
I don't believe it! You don't look over 40.

1008
01:45:25,891 --> 01:45:29,292
You wouldn't look over 40
if you lost weight, sat up straight.

1009
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:32,023
There you are.
Here you are, in the prime of life...

1010
01:45:32,097 --> 01:45:34,497
...a handsome man, successful in business...

1011
01:45:34,566 --> 01:45:35,726
...adored by one and all.

1012
01:45:35,801 --> 01:45:39,737
In fact, it could be said
that you had it made, except for one thing.

1013
01:45:39,805 --> 01:45:43,036
-I’m a lousy lawyer?
-No, you're married.

1014
01:45:43,709 --> 01:45:47,611
Yeah, but being married is the normal way to live!

1015
01:45:48,247 --> 01:45:50,181
-isn’t it?
-Who says so?

1016
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:53,909
Edna.

1017
01:45:53,986 --> 01:45:56,921
I think you've been brainwashed!

1018
01:45:57,322 --> 01:45:59,756
You're missing a very important point!

1019
01:45:59,825 --> 01:46:03,488
Marriage is not a basic fact of nature!
it’s an invention!

1020
01:46:04,363 --> 01:46:05,728
it’s like the infield fly rule.

1021
01:46:05,798 --> 01:46:08,358
It exists only because the women say so...

1022
01:46:08,434 --> 01:46:11,062
...and like idiots, we just go following right along.

1023
01:46:11,136 --> 01:46:13,331
No, Stan.

1024
01:46:13,405 --> 01:46:16,636
I don't know what I would do without Edna.

1025
01:46:17,242 --> 01:46:18,436
She....

1026
01:46:22,314 --> 01:46:24,111
She plans the meals...

1027
01:46:24,483 --> 01:46:27,111
...sends my shirts to the laundry....

1028
01:46:27,352 --> 01:46:31,686
You're making another basic,
common, masculine mistake...

1029
01:46:31,757 --> 01:46:33,850
-...confusing love and laundry.
-Love and--

1030
01:46:33,926 --> 01:46:37,191
Let me tell you something.
For years now, a very nice gentleman...

1031
01:46:37,262 --> 01:46:39,696
...who operates,
for reasons I’ll never understand...

1032
01:46:39,765 --> 01:46:43,223
...as ''Madame Renée,''
has picked up my shirts every Monday...

1033
01:46:43,302 --> 01:46:45,793
...and returned them,
beautifully done, on Thursday.

1034
01:46:45,871 --> 01:46:50,535
And not once, in all those years,
have I felt the slightest urge to marry him.

1035
01:46:52,111 --> 01:46:54,204
How much money do you make?

1036
01:46:55,481 --> 01:46:57,608
Between $70,000 and $80,000 a year.

1037
01:46:57,683 --> 01:47:01,847
How much of that $70,000 or $80,000
do you get to spend on yourself?

1038
01:47:02,254 --> 01:47:06,418
On that, you know, of course,
with Edna and the kids...

1039
01:47:06,992 --> 01:47:09,460
...and the payments on the house in Scarsdale....

1040
01:47:09,528 --> 01:47:11,291
And then of course...

1041
01:47:11,363 --> 01:47:15,732
...I do carry a lot of life insurance.

1042
01:47:15,801 --> 01:47:16,733
Yeah, I understand.

1043
01:47:16,802 --> 01:47:18,360
Now, stop for one moment...

1044
01:47:18,437 --> 01:47:21,497
...and think what life could be like right now, if....

1045
01:47:21,573 --> 01:47:23,632
Men of the jury, this concerns you, too.

1046
01:47:23,709 --> 01:47:26,940
Stop and think what your life
could be like right now...

1047
01:47:27,012 --> 01:47:30,812
...if you'd had the common sense
not to marry Josephine...

1048
01:47:30,883 --> 01:47:35,081
...or Hilda or Mary or Peggy or Rochelle.

1049
01:47:35,921 --> 01:47:37,013
Or Edna?

1050
01:47:39,224 --> 01:47:42,523
Think what you could be doing
with all that money right now.

1051
01:47:42,594 --> 01:47:43,686
Yeah.

1052
01:47:44,997 --> 01:47:47,591
Could have a little Chris-Craft maybe.

1053
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:52,197
Get rid of that broken-down,
money-pit of a house in Scarsdale.

1054
01:47:53,672 --> 01:47:57,108
it’s very easy, Harold.
All you've got to do is poke the button.

1055
01:47:59,978 --> 01:48:02,572
-Could I grow a mustache?
-Of course.

1056
01:48:03,682 --> 01:48:06,617
-Put wax on the ends?
-Who could stop you?

1057
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:12,484
-I used to wear one before I was married.
-I remember. You cut quite a dashing figure.

1058
01:48:12,558 --> 01:48:15,652
-You really think so?
-Absolutely. Push the button.

1059
01:48:16,195 --> 01:48:20,928
It was always a little sparse on the left side.

1060
01:48:21,033 --> 01:48:23,433
A good barber could trim it
so you'd never notice.

1061
01:48:23,502 --> 01:48:25,436
Why don't you push the button?

1062
01:48:25,938 --> 01:48:28,839
I never could afford a really good barber then.

1063
01:48:28,907 --> 01:48:30,875
But you could now.

1064
01:48:32,377 --> 01:48:34,038
But I could now.

1065
01:48:34,112 --> 01:48:37,548
When's the last time
you started thinking about girls?

1066
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:43,118
-Girls?
-Think of a whole world full of girls.

1067
01:48:43,188 --> 01:48:47,284
Just think on that, a world pulsating with girls.

1068
01:48:47,659 --> 01:48:48,853
Models?

1069
01:48:50,929 --> 01:48:52,897
-Actresses?
-You know it.

1070
01:48:54,132 --> 01:48:56,657
My insurance man's new secretary....

1071
01:48:57,469 --> 01:49:01,064
Tall girls, thin girls, small girls, round girls....

1072
01:49:04,243 --> 01:49:05,232
Pinup girls.

1073
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:08,939
They don't pin up anymore, they fold out,
but you're getting the idea.

1074
01:49:09,014 --> 01:49:12,211
instead of that broken-down
money pit of a house in Scarsdale...

1075
01:49:12,284 --> 01:49:15,117
...you get a townhouse all to yourself.

1076
01:49:15,654 --> 01:49:18,020
-With a butler?
-Push the button.

1077
01:49:18,557 --> 01:49:22,186
-Like Charles?
-Push the button.

1078
01:49:22,361 --> 01:49:26,161
To have the martini glasses chilling
when I come home?

1079
01:49:26,231 --> 01:49:27,630
That's right, exactly.

1080
01:49:27,699 --> 01:49:30,463
Come with me.
All you have to do is push the button.

1081
01:49:30,535 --> 01:49:33,561
Push, and she disappears.

1082
01:49:33,939 --> 01:49:36,169
Nobody will ever know, Harold.

1083
01:49:36,909 --> 01:49:39,901
Just one little push and she's gone.

1084
01:49:39,978 --> 01:49:42,913
Just push the button.

1085
01:49:45,884 --> 01:49:47,749
No one will ever know?

1086
01:49:48,353 --> 01:49:49,513
Harold!

1087
01:49:49,588 --> 01:49:52,079
lf you think I’ve made your life a living hell...

1088
01:49:52,157 --> 01:49:55,126
...you haven't begun to learn
the meaning of the word ''suffer''!

1089
01:49:55,193 --> 01:49:57,093
Shut up, you old bat!

1090
01:49:58,297 --> 01:50:00,629
Besides, you won't feel a thing!

1091
01:50:09,174 --> 01:50:11,199
I’m free! I did it!

1092
01:50:11,977 --> 01:50:13,444
Harold!

1093
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:15,341
I did it!

1094
01:50:21,053 --> 01:50:22,577
Quiet, everybody.

1095
01:50:22,788 --> 01:50:24,380
Just calm down.

1096
01:50:24,456 --> 01:50:28,825
Bailiffs, better remove this woman here.

1097
01:50:28,994 --> 01:50:32,088
Good idea! Throw her out! I mean, remove her.

1098
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:34,392
Harold!

1099
01:50:37,302 --> 01:50:40,863
What time will you be home for dinner?

1100
01:50:41,139 --> 01:50:43,767
I’ll be home whatever time
it pleases me to be home.

1101
01:50:43,842 --> 01:50:47,141
Of course, I may stop off at the club...

1102
01:50:47,746 --> 01:50:50,613
...to have a couple of quickies on the way.

1103
01:50:52,017 --> 01:50:54,247
That's all, woman, you may go.

1104
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,019
Just take her out, put her in the tank if necessary.

1105
01:51:06,264 --> 01:51:07,731
All right, then.

1106
01:51:15,107 --> 01:51:16,574
Gentlemen.

1107
01:51:26,918 --> 01:51:30,217
I address you not as judge and jury...

1108
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:34,620
...but as a fellow American male.

1109
01:51:36,294 --> 01:51:41,288
The crime that you have just seen
Harold Lampson commit in his imagination...

1110
01:51:41,366 --> 01:51:44,460
...I have been accused of committing in reality.

1111
01:51:45,737 --> 01:51:49,730
Too long has the American man...

1112
01:51:50,742 --> 01:51:53,233
...allowed himself to be bullied...

1113
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,842
...coddled and mothered and tyrannized...

1114
01:51:56,915 --> 01:51:59,145
...and made to feel like a feeble-minded idiot...

1115
01:51:59,217 --> 01:52:01,549
...by the female of the species!

1116
01:52:03,989 --> 01:52:08,756
Do you realize the power
that you have in your hand here today?

1117
01:52:10,395 --> 01:52:13,762
lf one man, just one man...

1118
01:52:13,832 --> 01:52:18,064
...can stick his wife in the goop
from the gloppitta-gloppitta machine...

1119
01:52:18,136 --> 01:52:21,230
...and get away with it, boy, we got it made!

1120
01:52:21,306 --> 01:52:23,604
We have got it made, all of us!

1121
01:52:25,444 --> 01:52:27,435
Gentlemen, I did it.

1122
01:52:29,047 --> 01:52:30,514
I killed her.

1123
01:52:31,716 --> 01:52:34,310
I murdered my wife!

1124
01:52:36,688 --> 01:52:40,920
Every single charge the district attorney
has leveled against me is true.

1125
01:52:40,992 --> 01:52:43,552
indeed, I did slip her a mickey.

1126
01:52:44,896 --> 01:52:48,354
I cold-bloodedly then fed her
into a tomb of goop...

1127
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:50,196
...from the gloppitta-gloppitta machine.

1128
01:52:50,268 --> 01:52:52,532
I ask you to acquit me!

1129
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:58,538
Acquit me on the grounds of justifiable homicide!

1130
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:02,606
And not for my sake.

1131
01:53:05,283 --> 01:53:06,614
For yours.

1132
01:53:11,089 --> 01:53:14,923
If we do let him off,
it'll scare the hell out of old Shirley.

1133
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:18,220
I could go around the world on a tramp steamer.

1134
01:53:18,396 --> 01:53:20,387
I could buy a motorcycle.

1135
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:24,664
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1136
01:53:24,769 --> 01:53:26,134
Not guilty!

1137
01:54:02,874 --> 01:54:04,364
There you are.

1138
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:07,105
Congratulations, sir.

1139
01:54:07,179 --> 01:54:09,909
it’s gonna be just like old times again.

1140
01:54:13,485 --> 01:54:16,010
Charles, I hope you don't get upset.

1141
01:54:16,688 --> 01:54:18,815
I have a confession to make.

1142
01:54:19,658 --> 01:54:21,182
I didn't do it.

1143
01:54:24,296 --> 01:54:26,264
You didn't do it, sir?

1144
01:54:28,433 --> 01:54:31,766
lf you didn't murder her, where is she now?

1145
01:54:31,836 --> 01:54:32,860
I don't know.

1146
01:54:32,938 --> 01:54:35,930
Probably with her mother in Italy. I don't know.

1147
01:54:37,809 --> 01:54:39,174
But, sir...

1148
01:54:40,278 --> 01:54:44,180
...that means that some fine day,
she may come back here again.

1149
01:54:45,817 --> 01:54:47,148
I hope so.

1150
01:54:51,356 --> 01:54:53,017
It doesn't matter.

1151
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:55,252
It doesn't matter!

1152
01:54:55,327 --> 01:54:59,593
Sir, under American law,
you cannot be tried for the same crime twice!

1153
01:55:00,031 --> 01:55:02,022
They've already acquitted you of her murder.

1154
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:05,934
So if she did come back,
you could quite legally kill her again!

1155
01:55:06,004 --> 01:55:09,770
It would be open season.
Just one peep out of her and....

1156
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:11,941
Right between the eyes!

1157
01:55:13,812 --> 01:55:16,110
it’s so good to be home again.

1158
01:55:16,181 --> 01:55:19,412
I’ll have the whole place
back to normal in a matter of days.

1159
01:55:19,484 --> 01:55:21,475
Goodbye, big gunky lamps.

1160
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,950
Farewell, gay little chintzes.

1161
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:27,491
And I’ll have you tipping the scale
at 160 pounds...

1162
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,050
...in no time.

1163
01:55:41,072 --> 01:55:42,596
She's in there.

1164
01:55:43,241 --> 01:55:45,232
Good God, sir, she's in there!

1165
01:56:01,092 --> 01:56:03,617
Here you are, sir. Here's your chance.

1166
01:56:03,695 --> 01:56:06,129
Go on in there and finish her off.

1167
01:56:21,046 --> 01:56:23,241
I suppose if he can put up with her, I can.
