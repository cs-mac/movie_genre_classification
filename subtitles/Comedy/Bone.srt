 Join -= sTOs =- (sTerOids) now or not :)

2
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,323
- Paulie, how's it look?
- Snitch says the cop's body's...

3
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:39,662
about 300 yards down
in the abandoned tunnel.

4
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,100
- Howie?
- Right behind you, Captain.

5
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,604
Keep back till I process the scene.

6
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,440
Watch out below!

7
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:18,487
- So where the hell is the car?
- I don't know.

8
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:22,427
- That's the last time I take a red-eye.
- Maybe we can take a cab.

9
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,322
I'm gonna fire this son of a bitch.

10
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,264
He's always got an excuse.

11
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,709
Come on, we'll be home
before you know it, hmm?

12
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,209
Yeah.

13
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:20,813
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I think you’re going the wrong way.

14
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:29,162
Honey, honey, wake up. We're lost,
or he's taking us for a ride.

15
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,562
We're in the middle of nowhere.

16
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,157
Where the hell you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

17
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,163
We're not tourists here, man.

18
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:42,573
Hey, where are you going?

19
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,318
Let us out.
Stop the car.

20
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,923
- Stop this car, man!
- Stop the car!

21
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,527
Shit.

22
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:12,003
- Oh, my God.
- Son of a bitch.

23
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:14,473
Stop the goddamn car!

24
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,552
- Stop it, please.
- Stop the car.

25
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:30,346
Stop this car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!

26
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,853
Good morning.

27
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,532
You look a little dehydrated.

28
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,797
- How about some juice?
- How about two fingers of vodka?

29
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,667
Isn't it a little early for vodka?

30
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,805
Time, as you well know,
is a relative consideration, Thelma.

31
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,503
-Juice.
- Vodka.

32
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,873
- Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

33
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,387
I'd love to, but a med tech with
liquor on his breath, I think not.

34
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,252
- Thanks.
- So, how are you?

35
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,225
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

36
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:09,785
Every time I'm here, it's skewed further
out of spec. You need a new unit.

37
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,855
I really need a new body.

38
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,866
I'm afraid I can't help you
with that.

39
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,994
- I'll bring you a new unit tomorrow.
- Okay.

40
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,767
- This one'll be stable till then.
- Thank you, Richard.

41
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,606
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it anyway I can get it.

42
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,613
- How's he doing this morning?
- He asked for vodka again.

43
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,445
- Give him any?
- No!

44
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,351
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi, Richard.

45
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:39,121
Hey, would you look at this!
Peregrine falcon. Am I right?

46
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:42,185
Yep.
He likes cripples.

47
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,199
Yeah, there was a piece about them
in the Times the other day...

48
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,201
nesting all over the city.

49
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,705
Something to do with architecture
of all these old buildings.

50
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,536
I thought he liked my company.

51
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:02,313
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally, Barry.

52
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:05,284
- Drink, Doc?
- No, thanks, Thelma, I'm fine.

53
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,986
Bed mode.

54
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,431
- Got vodka in there?
- No.

55
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,934
You ain't getting any either.

56
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,494
All right, I'll let you guys talk.

57
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:32,177
So, Linc, you can imagine how much
sleep I've gotten the past few days...

58
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:33,679
considering your request.

59
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:37,911
That's funny. Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

60
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:41,421
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

61
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,049
you know as well as I do, there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

62
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:49,722
One finger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.

63
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,930
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.

64
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:58,165
Build-up of fluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

65
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:03,142
We both know I'm waiting for the seizure
that's gonna make me a vegetable.

66
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:06,812
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

67
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,780
I wanna make the final transition
on my own terms.

68
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,156
I'll get it done
with or without you.

69
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,425
Oh, yeah,
I suppose you would.

70
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,494
So?

71
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,801
- Okay.
- Okay what?

72
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,178
Okay, I'll assist you...

73
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,308
in your final transition.

74
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:47,377
- What about today?
- Linc, preparations have to be made.

75
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,046
This is not a flu shot.

76
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,591
My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

77
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,187
Besides, I've got a medical conference
to go to. I've got a plane to catch.

78
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,197
You're lying.

79
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,261
When do you get back?

80
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,062
Sunday.

81
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:06,664
Okay. Sunday.

82
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:13,774
- I'll see you then.
- Get out before you change your mind.

83
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,677
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myself out.

84
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,118
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

85
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,892
You are...

86
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:30,396
a very good friend.

87
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,940
Amelia.

88
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:27,782
- Hey.
- Hey. Morning.

89
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,189
You okay?

90
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:33,192
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.

91
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,027
- What time is it?
- It's early.

92
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,407
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta shower.

93
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:54,879
- No, you don't. Stay here.
- I gotta go.

94
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:12,127
- Hey, I'll make breakfast?
- No, thanks, I'm gonna be late.

95
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,168
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am, huh?

96
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,036
Look--

97
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,908
My therapist tells me...

98
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,137
I might not be getting what I need
out of this relationship.

99
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:30,650
What are we doing here?
I think we make a great couple.

100
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,082
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.

101
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:39,421
Steve, we've been through this.

102
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:43,930
I care about you. You know that.
I can't make a commitment.

103
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,837
Go to work then.

104
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,003
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late.

105
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,691
So, Amelia, is it true
you're quitting the cops?

106
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:16,321
- No, transferring to Youth Services.
- You lucky fuck.

107
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,388
You must have one hell
of a rabbi downtown.

108
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,990
- We're gonna miss you here.
- Three-post-eleven here.

109
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,526
- Frightened child at Am trak site.
- I'm a block away. I'll take it.

110
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,369
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.

111
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,035
- Finish eating. I'll check it out.
- See you, kid.

112
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,971
Three-post-eleven,
anything further on that ten-ten?

113
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,473
Nothing yet.

114
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,511
Wait, I think I see him.

115
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,571
Are you the one
who called the police?

116
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,859
Wait there, okay?

117
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,385
- Are you out of your mind?
- Shut off the engine, all right?

118
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,397
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

119
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,043
- My name is Amelia. What's yours?
- Chris.

120
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:25,813
Chris, hey. I got a job for you.
Here's some money.

121
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:30,220
I need you to buy me one of those
cheapo cardboard cameras...

122
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,019
the ones you can throw away.

123
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,855
Okay. Fast as you can.

124
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,196
Three-post-eleven to central.

125
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,110
Get Amtrak to send a bus over here.
Get these passengers out of here.

126
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,118
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

127
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,983
- Anything else?
- First officer on the scene is there.

128
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:47,186
I found strange stuff near the body. I
collected it before it was washed away.

129
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,892
- I also took some pictures.
- Thanks.

130
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:59,064
- You the one who stopped the train?
- I thought it would disturb evidence.

131
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,337
So why not shut down Grand Central while
you're at it, hmm, Patrolman Donahue?

132
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,072
- Is that right?
- Donaghy.

133
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,910
- A rookie, I take it?
- No, sir.

134
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,007
Pretty dumb.

135
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,743
Captain, guess who
the vic turns out to be.

136
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,813
- Talk to me.
- Alan fucking Rubin.

137
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:25,260
Listen, I don't want anybody
in this area except for the crime unit.

138
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,527
- Okay?
- Okay, Detective.

139
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,836
Knight to H-6. Check.

140
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,911
- You got company. Cops.
- Tell 'em I'm busy.

141
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:48,216
- They said it was urgent.
- Tell 'em I'm out running.

142
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,848
She's too polite for that, Linc.

143
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,858
Hey, looky who's here.

144
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:00,630
- I got a serious situation.
- It's going around, Paulie.

145
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,634
Chief Murphy sent me.

146
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,699
The good chief.

147
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:11,176
Hear about the couple at the airport,
got in a taxi yesterday morning?

148
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,235
- Never made it home.
- We don't watch the news anymore.

149
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,805
He used to read four papers a day,
tape all the news shows.

150
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:19,044
Yeah, and now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.

151
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,415
Things never change.

152
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,480
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

153
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:27,917
Found him dead, buried,
shot in the face...

154
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,987
hand sticking out of the ground with his
wife's wedding band on his finger...

155
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,896
which was skinned to the bone.

156
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,832
She's still missing.

157
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,927
Excuse me while you catch up, okay?

158
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:43,442
Don't go too far, Thelma. These nice
gentlemen are leaving in 30 seconds.

159
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,604
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.

160
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,272
- I don't think so.
- Yeah?

161
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,441
A man worth millions found dead...

162
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,419
with his wife's wedding band
on his mutilated hand.

163
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,478
What does that tell you?

164
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,150
The doer is saying he's got her.

165
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:02,320
He's probably contacting the family
right now making a ransom demand.

166
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:05,796
- I would've been paged i fhe had.
- Check your batteries.

167
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,194
It's definitely a ransom.

168
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:12,798
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.

169
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,637
I've read all your books--
Scene of the Crime...

170
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,701
at least a dozen times.

171
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:20,211
It's great to actually meet you.

172
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:25,648
- Where do you find these guys?
- They wanna work with the best.

173
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,622
I guess now you’re gonna ask me to
discuss the crime scene with you, huh?

174
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,215
In fact, we got a bunch
of physical evidence...

175
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,727
that doesn't exactly make sense.

176
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:38,730
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's in the report.

177
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,196
You okay?

178
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:47,567
- You okay?
- Out! Now!

179
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:51,077
- Anything we can do?
- Asses outta here now!

180
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:54,375
We're gonna get you some air.
Come on, breathe for me, Linc.

181
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,574
I said, out!

182
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:01,678
Come on, deep breaths.
Deep breaths, come on.

183
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,657
Deep breaths. I'm getting a B.P. on you.
Come on now, breathe.

184
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,592
Look at me. Breathe.

185
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,532
Look at me. Deep breaths.

186
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,160
Come on, come on.
You've got to take this oxygen.

187
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,898
Come on, Rhyme,
stay with me.

188
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:22,635
Come on, you can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

189
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,643
Come on, look at me.

190
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,532
You okay?

191
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:01,069
I would be okay if your powers
of resuscitation were less adept.

192
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:04,548
Not on my shift, all right.

193
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,245
If you have a problem with that,
you just fire my ass.

194
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,756
You know I provide generously for you
in my will. Keep that in mind.

195
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:15,784
Rhyme, I'm not interested
in having this conversation. Okay?

196
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:19,958
Okay.
Crime scene report Sellitto left--

197
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:23,298
would you load those photos
in the viewer for me?

198
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,803
View scan.

199
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,779
Okay, let's take a look
at what we got here.

200
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:39,116
Where it says location--
Now, what's that?

201
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,745
What's it say about that newspaper?

202
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:46,849
''Newspaper found beneath a coarse-thread
hex bolt with 4:00 p.m. circled on it.''

203
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:48,018
4:00 p.m.

204
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,854
Zoom.

205
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,828
What about the little piece of paper?
What's the number on it?

206
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:03,399
- Torn book page with 119 on it.
- 119, 4:00 p.m.

207
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:15,087
- What's today's date?
- Today's November 9.

208
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:19,251
Phone mode. Sellitto, Paulie.
Call.

209
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:25,453
What?

210
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:31,360
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

211
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:36,603
are having their first drug experiences
at the fifth grade level.

212
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:41,704
Now, here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

213
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,278
Marijuana.

214
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:50,254
Wouldn’t you like to get your hands
on that briefcase?

215
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:53,190
Barbiturates, amphetamines.

216
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,360
Cocaine.

217
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,458
Rock cocaine.

218
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:11,510
- What is this about?
- Do you know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

219
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:13,512
- Textbook guy?
- Yeah.

220
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,311
- What does that have to do with me?
- You'll find out.

221
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,856
Come on in.
They're right in there.

222
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,526
A patrol cop took these pictures?

223
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,530
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

224
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,860
Smart guy.

225
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:36,368
Also had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

226
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:39,030
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

227
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,198
meet Lincoln Rhyme.

228
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:42,707
Donaghy.

229
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,678
You took some terrific
photographs, Officer.

230
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,118
- You know who I am?
- I read your manual at the academy.

231
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:58,187
- What'd you think of it?
- I'm not a book critic, sir.

232
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:02,084
- But you found it useful?
- Yeah, I guess so.

233
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,596
Guess so? Sure, you did.
You stopped that train.

234
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,598
Photos you took.

235
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,932
I'd say you have a natural instinct
for forensics.

236
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,938
So what do we got, Paulie?

237
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:18,535
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

238
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:21,136
using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

239
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:24,149
We have asbestos on the track bed
where there shouldn't be any...

240
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:27,744
and an iron bolt holding down
a piece of paper...

241
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,948
with a book page with 119
written on it.

242
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,925
Decaying oxidation on the bolt's head,
but not on the thread...

243
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:37,861
which says to me that someone
removed it from somewhere else...

244
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:39,364
and placed it there recently.

245
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,595
Wouldn’t you agree, Officer?

246
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,277
Paulie, I'm convinced
that this crime scene was staged.

247
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:54,142
- Perp's trying to tell us something.
- What the fuck you saying?

248
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,308
Book page 119.
11/9-- That's today date.

249
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,978
- Newspaper, 4:00 p.m. What time is it?
- 1 2:1 5.

250
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:03,784
She's alive.

251
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:07,314
- And he's gonna kill her at 4:00.
- P.m.

252
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,424
We have your interest yet, Officer?

253
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:19,201
- I want you to work the case with us.
- It's not my area.

254
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:22,506
Are you being modest...

255
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,135
or are you a little uneasy
about doing some real police work?

256
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:30,112
- Excuse me?
- What department you work in, Officer?

257
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:33,619
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up at orientation.

258
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:35,278
I see, youth services.

259
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:38,483
I waited over a year to get that
transfer. I'm not gonna jeopardize--

260
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,892
Jeopardize what? Cushy desk job?

261
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,556
- Forensics is not my area.
- I disagree with you.

262
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,324
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

263
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,664
I can.

264
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,141
- And if I refuse?
- You'd put your career at risk.

265
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,407
You think, because of your condition,
you can push people around?

266
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,573
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

267
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,780
- Truly?
- Yeah, damn right.

268
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:10,313
Well, forgive me, truly...

269
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,985
if I insist on having someone with
your brains and a fresh pair of eyes.

270
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,188
There's a life
at stake here, Officer.

271
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:20,930
We're gonna need some key people
and tech support.

272
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,264
- I know the guy.
- Okay.

273
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,528
What the hell are you smiling at?

274
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:40,676
Pull up a chair. Tell me everything
you know about the crime scene.

275
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,086
- You saw my report.
- I read your report.

276
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,092
I wanna know what you felt.

277
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,295
What you feel...

278
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,627
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

279
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:56,430
You are in love with the sound
of your own voice, aren’t you?

280
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,767
It's your voice I yearn to hear.
Pull up a chair. I won't bite you.

281
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,527
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

282
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:35,062
is consistent with a Webley, a very
old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

283
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:37,609
Thank you, Kenny.
On the big board, please.

284
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:41,670
- What do you got on that bolt?
- Three initials on the head: N.S.G.

285
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:44,649
And the bolt's not steel,
it's iron.

286
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,981
Iron? Iron.

287
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,750
Making it old-- like the Webley.

288
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,281
Officer Donaghy,
what do you know about asbestos?

289
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,523
- It kills hard-working Americans daily.
- Very good.

290
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,758
- You computer literate?

- A little.

291
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,800
- Where's my Thelma?
- Guess.

292
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,999
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

293
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:12,306
Amelia hates my books and computers, but
she's got an A-plus nose for evidence...

294
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:16,872
so I want you to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. files.

295
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:21,181
Check if there’s any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

296
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,448
A.S.A.P.

297
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:27,249
- Where the hell is Eddie Ortiz?
- I'm right here!

298
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,296
How's the world's
crankiest crimina list doing?

299
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,957
Playing beat the clock.

300
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,933
Everybody's worst nightmare.

301
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:39,494
You get into a cab, and there's
a psycho from Jersey driving.

302
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,506
We don't know he's from Jersey.

303
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,737
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

304
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:48,178
- What'd you do, bring the whole lab?
- Mama always said be prepared.

305
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,909
- Where do you want this?
-Just put it in the corner.

306
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,951
How is your mother?

307
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,853
She's 76, and she's schtupping some guy
named Morris. Can you believe it?

308
00:31:56,923 --> 00:32:00,415
- God bless her.
- It's Morris I'm worried about.

309
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:03,951
He's 79, with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

310
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:14,199
Afternoon.
Captain Cheney.

311
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,332
What's your address?

312
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,877
There's about a dozen cleanups
scattered across the five boroughs.

313
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,970
Put it up on the viewer for me,
will you, please?

314
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,982
Narrow it down to the oldest location
as soon as you can.

315
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,109
- How you doing, Howard?
- Fine, thank you.

316
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,279
- How's it going?
- Middle of the middle, as you can see.

317
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:33,587
Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that iron bolt.

318
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,629
Look, I was hoping
to grab a minute with you.

319
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:39,790
- If you don't mind.
- Excuse me, Howard.

320
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,527
Sorry.

321
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:46,061
We got Officer Donaghy to thank here
for photographing the crucial evidence.

322
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:49,369
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

323
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:53,071
I just stopped by to make sure
you had all the support you need.

324
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:57,707
I'm putting the full resources
of my department here at your disposal.

325
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:00,149
And I appreciate it, Howie,
thank you.

326
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:02,153
But the thing is, Linc...

327
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:06,988
I've formalized department standard
procedure since you were in charge...

328
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,584
Eddie, could you put what you got
up on my screen, please?

329
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:13,223
so I'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

330
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,391
Absolutely.

331
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,997
At all times.

332
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:20,800
At all-- Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

333
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,267
Old paper.

334
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,471
Coarse grade.

335
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,176
I say, 80, 90 years old.

336
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,411
Turn of the century,
it looks like.

337
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,581
This perp likes old.

338
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,356
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- Yeah, okay.

339
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,427
Good.

340
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,234
Old paper.

341
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,771
Old gun.

342
00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:58,636
Buried his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

343
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,412
Sand.

344
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:05,708
Eddie, what do you got
on the sand?

345
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,316
Doesn't really look like sand.

346
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,483
- I'm not sure.
- Can you individuate it?

347
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,121
- If I had E.D.X., I could do anything.
- We don't have that, Eddie.

348
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:22,190
Look who forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

349
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,362
Come on, I'm all over
this thing now.

350
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,397
We're talking pearly looking.

351
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:34,977
Some kind of shellfish or something.

352
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,574
Oysters shells, maybe?

353
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,082
Could be.

354
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:47,017
Definitely. If I had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

355
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,053
I got it. The oldest asbestos sites
are coming up now.

356
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:27,859
In 1 91 3, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

357
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:31,494
workmen found the body of this rich
industrialist, Talbot Soames.

358
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,936
He'd been kidnapped the year before,
shot in the head and buried...

359
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,875
in what they thought was white sand
but turned out to be oyster shells.

360
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:43,540
Crushed oyster shells-- That's what they
used as landfill in lower Manhattan.

361
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:46,585
That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Ms. Rubin is gonna be--

362
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,745
somewhere downtown.

363
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,255
She's gonna be underground.

364
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,791
She's gonna be in a basement...

365
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:56,487
near or in the Woolworth Building.

366
00:35:56,562 --> 00:36:01,761
Paulie, call Emergency Services Unit
to meet us at the Woolworth Building.

367
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,768
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

368
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:06,100
Okay? Eddie,
did you bring your van?

369
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,140
- It's downstairs.
- We're gonna need it.

370
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,335
Throw your keys to Amelia.
Paulie, you and Solomon go with her.

371
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,141
- Shouldn't I go too?
- You stay. We're gonna work that bolt.

372
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,445
- That's the missing piece.
- Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

373
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:19,779
Fuck him.

374
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,623
Just trust me.

375
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:33,393
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. I'll be with you...

376
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,434
every step of the way.

377
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,945
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

378
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:54,043
- How did Rhyme get to be that way?
- He was born brilliant. It happens.

379
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,054
I mean the physical part.

380
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:00,085
About four years ago, he was working
the body of a transit cop...

381
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,423
found shot in a subway tunnel.

382
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:06,063
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

383
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,566
Jesus.

384
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:13,797
- Family?
- Married sister in Phoenix.

385
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:17,172
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

386
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,107
Technically, he's still active duty
collecting full pay.

387
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,206
P.B.A. insurance picks up
round-the-clock care and the gadgets.

388
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,650
On weekends, always one or two cops
there, lending a hand.

389
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,951
- Tough deal winding up like that.
- You won't hear him complain about it.

390
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,218
He gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.

391
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,886
In your case,
I'd be complimented.

392
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,259
You gotta learn to relax
around a compliment...

393
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,195
especially one from Rhyme.

394
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,757
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?

395
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:46,271
Kiddo, if you were any more wound up,
you'd be a Timex.

396
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,571
He was a human dynamo. Writing books,
lecturing all over the world...

397
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,843
giving expert opinion in trials...

398
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,976
working half the crimes scenes
in the city.

399
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:03,453
- You know what he did on his downtime?
- I can't imagine.

400
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:06,616
He'd collect things--
dirt, metals, plastics...

401
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:09,957
hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

402
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,190
medical tools--
anything you could think of.

403
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,526
Obsessive.

404
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,695
He'd have it all analyzed
and catalogued for his database.

405
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:23,234
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get there
in one piece, if possible.

406
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,103
Yeah, find out about that.
That might be good. What else?

407
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:54,469
Nicholas Steven Gerard,
elevator construction.

408
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,236
- Gotta be underground.
- I got a subway builder here.

409
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,746
- Subway builder's out.
- N.S.G.-- Niagara Steam Generation.

410
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:04,942
Bought by Eastern Gas and Electric
in 1 928.

411
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:09,215
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies.

412
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,032
Forty-five, you got 11 minutes left.
Where the hell are you?

413
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,901
We just hit the financial district.

414
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:05,637
There's a steam junction
with big asbestos-coated pipes.

415
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:10,580
That's where our victim’s gonna be.
I bet my legs on it-- Wall and Nassau.

416
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:14,752
Has E.S.U. been notified?

417
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,615
Yeah, they're on their way.

418
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:20,955
E.S.U. says that steam is released
through that junction every day at 4:00.

419
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:23,824
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

420
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:26,990
I don't know, but it's gonna happen
in about ten minutes and 30 seconds.

421
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,459
All right, Linc, we're here.
We're going down there.

422
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:38,370
Yeah, I'm here.

423
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,969
It's their job to try
and save Mrs. Rubin's life.

424
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:45,449
It's your job to get ready
and work the crime scene if necessary.

425
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,150
There's some things you’re gonna need,
so look in the back of the truck.

426
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:55,785
You'll see an aluminum suitcase
and a radio headset.

427
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:59,663
- See it?
- Yeah, I see them.

428
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:23,187
There must be a way in.

429
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:28,415
- What's the problem here?
- Fucking valves freeze up easy.

430
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,685
Come on, guys, shut it off.

431
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:33,391
- You there?
- I'm here.

432
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:36,900
- I'm inside the pipe.
- One, two, three.

433
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:43,607
Go!

434
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:49,509
I think I hear something.
I hear something.

435
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,744
What is it? Someone's in there!
I can hear her crying.

436
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,519
Everyone, quiet now.

437
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,455
Mrs. Rubin?

438
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:18,937
She's in there.
Mrs. Rubin!

439
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:22,777
We're on our way in now.
Come on, guys.

440
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:26,113
Let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up!

441
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:29,154
-Jesus Christ.
- Get a drill and a tap.

442
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:31,280
Somebody cut this thing
halfway through.

443
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,320
Let's dig!

444
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,506
Move back!

445
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,152
Linc, she's gone.

446
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:47,027
The whole place is scalded in steam.

447
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:47,199
Let's go. Move away.

448
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,962
Let's go. Move away.

449
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:50,467
Nothing to see here.

450
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:54,233
E.S.U. are gonna blow a hole in the
subbasement wall. No other way in.

451
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:58,402
I am working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?

452
00:43:58,477 --> 00:44:02,174
- Yeah, that's right.
- I don't want E.S. U. guys...

453
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:06,047
rushing in there, trampling the evidence
before we get a chance to run the scene.

454
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:10,179
- What do you want?
- I want Donaghy to go in first.

455
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:12,985
Come on, Linc,
she's not trained for this.

456
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,992
We can get our asses in a sling.

457
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,722
My ass has been in a sling
for four years.

458
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:21,027
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.

459
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:23,033
All right, you got it.

460
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:33,270
Okay, let's move!

461
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,220
I'm doing this under protest.

462
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,258
The perp could still be in there.

463
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:50,159
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

464
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,687
You can't handle it in there,
I want you to get your ass out.

465
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:56,233
- Amelia, you ready?
- Yeah.

466
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,235
You listen to me.

467
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:01,772
I'm with you every step of the way.

468
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:04,270
Go on.

469
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,277
Good luck.

470
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:20,290
- I'm in.
- Tell me what you see.

471
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:30,725
Everything's been boiled to hell.

472
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:36,640
Oh, God.

473
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,801
What is it?

474
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:41,744
It's an awful smell.

475
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:43,610
That means you're close.

476
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:10,807
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You're fine.

477
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:15,677
Just fine. You're doing great.
Just remember the academy.

478
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:19,148
When you walk,
move in a straight line.

479
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:22,015
We don't want to disturb
any footprints he might've left.

480
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:24,021
Yes, assuming he's gone.

481
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:36,194
There's no footprints.
There's nothing yet.

482
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,475
Oh, God.

483
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:55,019
What?

484
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,021
Talk tome.

485
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:03,260
I can see her.

486
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:13,361
The steam pipe was opened, and she's
tied down right in front of it.

487
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:16,532
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.

488
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:20,840
Can't do anything but help her
by working the crime scene.

489
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,174
That's your job.

490
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:25,182
Open your suitcase,
get your camera.

491
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:10,056
I can't do this.

492
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:13,757
You can do it. Yes, you can.
Yesterday you stopped a train.

493
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:16,460
You can do anything you want
when you put your mind to it.

494
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:18,969
Don't work me, Rhyme.

495
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:30,175
- Just tell me what to do next.
- Very slowly, walk the grid...

496
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,682
one foot in front of the other.

497
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,190
I want you to look around you now.
Remember...

498
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:45,252
crime scenes are three-dimensional--
floors, walls and ceilings.

499
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,839
Yeah, I'm here.

500
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,176
There's something strange.

501
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:01,945
Things he left for us?

502
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,449
Yes.

503
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,388
- In a cluster again?
- There's a small piece of wood...

504
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,982
and it looks like some hair.

505
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,392
I'm gonna walk you through
collecting the evidence.

506
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:19,692
You do everything
exactly as I say.

507
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,375
- Oh,Jesus.
- Talk tome.

508
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:36,971
- It's a bloody bone.
- Where is it?

509
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,680
It's in my fucking hand.

510
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:43,243
Human?

511
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:48,188
I think so, yeah.

512
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,160
Photograph it...

513
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,719
bag it.

514
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:13,017
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

515
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,417
One more thing.

516
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,888
We gotta process the body.

517
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,984
What? I'm no medical examiner.
I can't do that.

518
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,619
I'm not asking you to do an autopsy.

519
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:29,360
I just want you to--
Just describe the restraints.

520
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:45,307
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

521
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,817
They look more like
old shackles or something.

522
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:55,122
And there’s a chain
across her waist.

523
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,252
And her feet are...

524
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,263
bound with a rope.

525
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,834
Hands above her head?

526
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,202
Yeah.

527
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:14,645
There's also a large piece of flesh
missing from her right forearm.

528
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:19,909
It's right down to the bone,
like it was surgically removed.

529
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:22,943
This is what I want you to do.

530
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:25,854
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

531
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:29,451
It’s probably our best chance
for good prints.

532
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:31,586
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.

533
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:35,690
The M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

534
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:39,362
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

535
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,446
Okay.

536
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:52,847
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

537
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:56,444
We gotta have those cuffs
for prints.

538
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,370
I can't.

539
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:23,380
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

540
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:25,143
I can't. No.

541
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:28,242
Saw off her hands,
take off the cuffs.

542
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,390
Listen to me. Saw off her h--
We need those cuffs.

543
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,652
I can't!

544
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:37,251
- Amelia, we need--
- No, fuck you!

545
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:51,702
If he wants that woman's hands cut off,
he can come down and do it himself.

546
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:50,486
Hello?

547
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:53,557
Who is it?

548
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:27,590
Jesus.

549
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,309
- Take it easy.
- Shit, what are you doing?

550
00:56:53,551 --> 00:56:56,384
- You okay?
- Am I okay? What are you doing?

551
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,355
Rhyme has been trying
to call you for hours.

552
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:02,154
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

553
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:06,629
My phone's fine.
I don't need his concern.

554
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:09,132
He needs you over
at his place right away.

555
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:14,831
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

556
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:18,034
Rhyme thinks the evidence you collected
indicates there's an other vic in play.

557
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:21,135
And he's laying that at my feet?

558
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,339
Don't shoot the messenger.

559
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:49,171
- You just move in?
- Yeah, about a year ago.

560
00:57:53,811 --> 00:57:55,244
Really?

561
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,527
- You were a model.
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

562
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:20,401
Kid model to street cop--
there's a leap.

563
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:25,575
For whatever it's worth...

564
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:29,708
I thought what you did today
was pretty damn terrific.
