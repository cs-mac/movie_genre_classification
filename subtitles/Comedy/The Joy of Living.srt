1
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:37,538
Spellcheck (fast) and modified by kloofy, enjoy ;)

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,960
Breaker, breaker one-nine.

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,963
Smokey report.
We got a bear--

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,971
Breaker one-nine.

5
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,976
Any takers.
Breaker.

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,983
...1-40. His 20, mile marker 2-4-3.

7
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,985
Anybody out there ?
Copy. Over.

8
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,994
Hello?

9
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,998
Lewis.

10
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,000
No!

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,962
...for the first time I see myself
through somebody else's eyes.

12
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,970
Yeah. Yeah.
It's completely claustrophobic.

13
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,974
Big surprise.
And we 're like, "Okay--"

14
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,976
Aren' t we supposed
to get a hell of a downpour?

15
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,980
- Two hundred mile slipper-slide.
- Anybody out there ?

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,982
Yeah, they had a speed trap set up.

17
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,990
No one ever said
freshman year 'd go by so fast.

18
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,992
At least Colorado has seasons.

19
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,995
Berkeley's like summer all year.

20
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,997
Yeah. It's late. I'm not
keeping you on the phone, am I?

21
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,999
No. No, not at all.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,961
So, what's, um-- You know,
what's David doing this summer?

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,964
- I don't know. Who cares?
- What?

24
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,967
Sorry. I didn't tell you before.
I just...

25
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,969
felt a little strange,
you know?

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
You what--
I don't understand.

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,975
We broke up.
He--

28
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,979
He's been acting serious and weird.

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,981
Serious and weird, how?
He was getting all serious and weird?

30
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,987
- I mean l-- I told you
what he was like, and--

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,989
- Wait, hold on.
- Lewis, it's 3:00 in the morning.

32
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,991
- I got a final tomorrow.
- I'm sorry.

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,994
I-I'll be quieter.

34
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,959
Lewis?

35
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,965
I'm sorry. So, what happened?

36
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,969
He kept...
Looking at me, as if, you know...

37
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,971
he totally thought
that he knew me...

38
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,974
which he so obviously didn't.

39
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,976
And he started crying.

40
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,979
Which sort of sealed
the deal, you know?

41
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,982
- You made him cry?
- I broke up with him.

42
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,984
Wouldn't you cry?

43
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,988
Listen, Venna,
you're cute, but you're not that cute.

44
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,990
I was kidding.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,993
Well, I'm not
in the mood to go home.

46
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,997
Wish I had a car,
then I could...

47
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,999
just get there gradually.

48
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,960
Decompress a little bit, you know?

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,964
If you had a car, you could
stop by Colorado and pick me up.

50
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,969
We could have an adventure.
The two of us and a windshield.

51
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,972
- I have a car.
- No, you don't.

52
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,974
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?

53
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,977
- No!
- Yeah, well, like, I got one.

54
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,992
- Sexy choice. Yeah.
- Yeah?

55
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,996
Vintage 1 971 Chrysler Newport.

56
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,959
* Show me am I right *

57
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,962
* Show me how you feel *

58
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,964
* Gimme all you've got *

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,967
* Show me where to start *

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,970
* Give me love and breathe *

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,973
I've changed
my plans. I'm no longer flying back.

62
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,975
-I bought a car, so I'm driving.
- By yourself?

63
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,979
No. Actually, I was thinkin'
about picking up Venna.

64
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,984
Mom ?

65
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,986
Sorry. I-It's-- Sorry.

66
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,988
That's great, Lewis.

67
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,992
- What's the matter?
- Your brother just called.

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,994
He was arrested again.
Drunk and disorderly.

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,999
- Where, in San Diego?
- Salt Lake City.

70
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,963
Don't worry. It's not your problem.

71
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,966
- What did Dad say?
- You know our dad.

72
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,968
He didn't even want
to talk to Fuller.

73
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,971
Said if he hadn't grown up yet,
it was never going to happen.

74
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,975
-Fuller!.
-I know.

75
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,978
-I miss him too.

76
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,963
Listen, before
you start writing anything--

77
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,967
- License, please. Registration.
- My brother's in jail.

78
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,969
And I haven't seen him
in almost five years.

79
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,973
So, I'm like driving 200 miles
out of my way just to help him out.

80
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,977
That U-turn, it was based on
a whole, like, good deed scenario.

81
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm also writing you up
for a broken tail Light.

82
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,982
I have one of those?

83
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,988
Look, I'm aware of how frustrating...

84
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,990
the prison system in this country
must be for you.

85
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,993
Repeat offenders,
the unrehabilitated--

86
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,996
I watch American Justice,
with your host, Bill Kurtis.

87
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,000
But I'm different.
I'm reformed.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,961
You know, I'm strong. I'm--

89
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,964
Officer Wilkins, this is my--
Listen, this is my pledge to you.

90
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,967
You will not be
seeing me again.

91
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,970
Two strikes are enough
for Fuller Thomas.

92
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
Hey.

93
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,980
Hey.

94
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,984
You look... tall.
Taller than me.

95
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,986
- How's it goin'?

96
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:47,991
Well, a lot better now.

97
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,998
Kid. Good to see you.

98
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,959
You came all the way
to Salt Lake just for me?

99
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,963
Well, technically,
you are still my brother.

100
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,968
Hey, this is my brother.

101
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,970
I can't get--
Look at you, man!

102
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,972
- Mr. Thomas!
- Thank you for coming.

103
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,974
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,977
-Sign out, please.
- You're welcome.

105
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,986
Listen, I'm supposed to
be picking up a friend.

106
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,989
- And I'm running kind of late, so--
- Uh-huh?

107
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,992
I just, uh, well, I just wanted
to see how you're doin'...

108
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,994
and take you wherever
it was you needed to go...

109
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,996
because I sorta need
to hit the road.

110
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:38,000
- Yeah, where are you goin'?
- Um, Boulder, Colorado...

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,961
- and then I'm goin' home.
- Oh, perfect.

112
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,964
- Yeah, that's great!
- Wait, what?

113
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,970
With the exception of
the seatspring piercin' my ass...

114
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,972
this ride's excellent.

115
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,976
So, uh, who's this friend
you're pickin' up?

116
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,978
Her name is Venna. She's a friend
of mine from back home.

117
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,981
Wait, the blinker?
That girl from the Heights?

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,984
The one who was like--
all day long?

119
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,987
No, she's not like that all day.
You haven't seen her in years.

120
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,990
Oh, okay.
You're fuckin' her?

121
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,996
Well, what question's
more legit than that?

122
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,959
- We're just friends, okay?
- Okay, you're not fucking her.

123
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,963
- But you want to.
- You don't know

124
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,966
Oh, I don't?
I don't know what I'm talking about?

125
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,968
All right, here's how it is:

126
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,971
Um, she's always dated guys
from the right side of the 'burbs.

127
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,974
You were always left on the sidelines.
You get your scholarship to Berkeley.

128
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,977
She's off to the University
of Colorado. Right?

129
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,981
- You don't understand.
- You guys have been talking

130
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,984
and now she realizes that you have
the warm fuzzies for each other.

131
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,989
You're not lettin' on, even though
you scrambled and bought this car...

132
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,991
just topick her up.

133
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,994
No, you're still playing
the neutered boy "friend'"...

134
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,996
who's like,
always there for her...

135
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,998
because you're nice--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

136
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,959
What are you doing?
Whoa, whoa!

137
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,968
So, you're still good,
or need me to drive, or--

138
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,971
No more bullshit small talk.

139
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,975
About me, my relationships,
or my car.

140
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,977
- Okay.

141
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,996
No, I swear. I'm barely
slowing the car in Denver.

142
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,999
I'll give him a seven-mile-an-hour
chance to jump and roll.

143
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,959
You did your mom...

144
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,962
a big favor,
and she's happy now.

145
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,965
And this time tomorrow,
you'll be here with me...

146
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,967
and it'll be a whole new
level of stress to deal with.

147
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,971
Okay, well, I'm gonna get goin'.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

148
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,973
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

149
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,975
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

150
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,985
- Downsizing?

151
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:14,990
Gas company just lets
a talented man like you go?

152
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,992
-Just like that?
- Yep.

153
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,996
Well, that sucks.
But this job kicks ass, huh?

154
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:25,000
Got your trailer here, and now
you're workin' kind of outside.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
You got a view.

156
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,968
- What is this?
- C. B. radio. Olive branch.

157
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,972
- Check it out.
- You put a hole in my car.

158
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,975
I talked him down to 40 bucks.

159
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,979
Breaker one-nine,
breaker one-nine.

160
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,981
We need a westbound,
come on.

161
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,985
You got Black Sheep here
ridin' front door with...

162
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,988
uh, Mama's Boy.

163
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,991
We're barrelin' down on ol'
Eye-8-Oh east away, just wonderin'...

164
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,994
- if you could see any bears
from your rockin' chair, over.

165
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,997
Roger, you got a 40-mile
clear shot, 'cept for Jamestown.

166
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,959
Got yourself a Kojak
with a Kodak at 1 -8-5.

167
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,962
All right, no cops
till Jamestown.

168
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:14,967
Free to speed like a motherfucker
for like the next 40 miles or so.

169
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,974
Aren't we supposed
to get a hell of a downpour?

170
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,977
We got a 200-mile slipper-slide.
Come on?

171
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,980
Doesn't
matter, not from this rocking chair.

172
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,983
Some people like it when it rains.

173
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,985
It's gonna rain hard tonight.

174
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:37,990
- Keeps everybody inside, you know.
-What the hell's with this guy?

175
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,992
Howdy!

176
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,995
You got Black Sheep here,
with Mama's Boy. Who we got? Over.

177
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,998
Could I please get a better handle
than Mama's Boy?

178
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,959
No.

179
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,961
Yo, Rain Man,
what's your 20?

180
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,966
- Hey, can you do a woman's voice?
- What?

181
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,968
Do a girl. Say, uh...

182
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,972
"Hey, Black Sheep,
this is, um, Miss--"

183
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,975
- No. Forget it.
- Come on, man.

184
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,977
You did a girl
when we pranked, uh--

185
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:10,981
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Schramm.
-Yeah.

186
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,983
- That was good.
-No, I was nine.

187
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,985
That was what I sounded like then.

188
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,987
This is like a prehistoric Internet,
or something.

189
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,991
Come on! You fuck with
someone in a chat room.

190
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,993
- It's the same thing.
-No, forget it.

191
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,996
Come on, man!

192
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:30,959
Say, uh, "Hey, Black Sheep,
this is, uh, Candy Cane. '"

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,963
Just say it.
You'll be amazing.

194
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,969
Hey, Black Sheep, this is Candy Cane.

195
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,971
I been lookin' for ya all day.

196
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,974
That was horrible.

197
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,977
Howdy there, Candy Cane.
This is Black Sheep.

198
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,979
I'm right on schedule.

199
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,981
Now, say, uh, "I'll see ya
later on tonight, honey."

200
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:58,987
- Go, go, go!
- So I guess I'll be seein' ya

201
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,991
- You got it.

202
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,994
and I'll see
your beautiful ass in the P.M.

203
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,960
- So, what was that about?
-Just wait.

204
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,962
Candy Cane, come on.

205
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,966
I knew it!
These guys are so fuckin' horny.

206
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,969
Get him goin'. Get him all worked up,
and then in the middle of it...

207
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,973
say, "Hey, guess what?
I'm a dude."

208
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,975
No way. I can't do that.

209
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,977
Come on, man!
Come on.

210
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,980
-Come on, man, it'll be fun.

211
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,982
Come on, just do it.

212
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,986
Do it.

213
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:42,990
Hey there, who's this?

214
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,997
- Rusty Nail.
- Nice. Nice.

215
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,960
Well, Rusty Nail, I hope
you're doin' better than I am.

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,962
Man, this drive, it seems like
it's takin' forever.

217
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,968
- Roger that, Candy Cane.
- Aw, you got him. You got him!

218
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,973
You know what makes it easier
sometimes, is pretendin' the person...

219
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,975
that I'm talkin' to
is right next to me.

220
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,979
So, why don't you pretend
that I'm sittin' there with you...

221
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,982
just the two of us...
and the windshield?

222
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,985
All right.

223
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,988
-Go, go! Tell him what you look like.
- Shh!

224
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:27,993
So, I'm 5'1 0", I got dirty-blond
hair down to my shoulders...

225
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,995
I got blue eyes,
really soft skin--

226
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,998
Wow, man.
This is turning me on.

227
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,959
And ifl were there, Rusty Nail,
you know what I'd do?

228
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,963
- Tell me.
- Awesome!

229
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,966
- I'd makeyou feel good.

230
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,968
You would?

231
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,971
Ifl were there and I asked you to,
would you unbutton my blouse?

232
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,974
Sure.

233
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,977
Well, then I'd just
take it off, so now what?

234
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,980
- What do you want to do with me?

235
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,985
-I've never really done this before.
- This is so classic!

236
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,988
I-l--
I'd take off your bra.

237
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,991
Ooh. Okay.
You take that off.

238
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,999
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We can't lose this guy! Go.

239
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,960
I couldn't hear that,
Rusty Nail.

240
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,966
- Rusty Nail? Sweetheart?

241
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,968
That was almost so good!

242
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,970
- Damn!
- What, did we lose him?

243
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,974
Yeah. Shit!

244
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,978
Hey, man, you're a gifted C.B.
prank caller when you commit to it.

245
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,980
"I'd take off your bra."

246
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,965
Hey. Hey, don't park
in a handicapped space.

247
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,967
There's spaces
all over the place.

248
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,969
Yeah, I know.
That's my point.

249
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,972
Dude, I'm gonna gimp it.
I'm not just gonna run in there.

250
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:16,977
God! Just sit here.
I'll work us a deal, okay?

251
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,989
One more goddamn maid knocks
on my door askin' about towels--

252
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,991
Sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.

253
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,994
Sorry, my ass!
Where's your boss?

254
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,996
I want the real manager.
The white one.

255
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,999
The one whose first language
is fuckin' English?

256
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,961
- Can you understand that?
- Hi. Could I get a room for the night?

257
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,963
You can disturb me all you want.
I love towels.

258
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,965
- Not done here, friend.
- I know that, amigo. I'm just--

259
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,968
I haven't slept in two days.
You'd best not mess with me.

260
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,971
- You just take care of your own shit.
- Peace.

261
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,974
Tomorrow mornin',
you mark myw ords, asshole--

262
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,979
...a long talk
with your manager.

263
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,981
Your brown ass is gone.

264
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,984
Fuckin' punk.

265
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,995
- What a dick.

266
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,963
Candy Cane.

267
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,966
Candy Cane.

268
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,972
Hello?
Candy Cane?

269
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,978
- Did you see that fat fucking guy?
- Shh.

270
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,980
- Listen.
- Hello, Candy Cane. Are you there?

271
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,985
- You are kidding me.
- Can you believe that?

272
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,987
- H-Have you talked to him yet?
- No.

273
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,990
- I haven't said anything.

274
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,994
Anybody out there
know Candy Cane? Come on.

275
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,998
What?

276
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,959
Tell him you want to meet up.
Tell him you want to get together.

277
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,961
You're turnin' in for the night.

278
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,964
You want to see him later
at the Lone Star Motel...

279
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,967
in Table Rock, Room 1 7.

280
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,969
Do you just love prison so much?

281
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,972
- We're in 1 8. I mean,
you saw that prick, right?

282
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,975
The prick is in Room 1 7!

283
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,977
Nah, I can't do that.

284
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:25,981
Come on! That guy sucks, okay?
He body-checked me on the way out.

285
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,984
- Yeah, I know. I saw that.
- What? You-You saw that?

286
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,988
And you're not jumping at this
extraordinary opportunity...

287
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,990
to exact some
much-deserved revenge?

288
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,992
Are you crazy?

289
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,994
Come on! Do it!

290
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,996
Calm down.
- This is amazing!

291
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,964
Rusty Nail. Hey, there.

292
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,971
Candy Cane.
I thought I'd lost ya.

293
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,974
Well, I guess fate
wouldn't allow that.

294
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,977
Glad to know you're
thinkin' about me.

295
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,981
Listen, I'm pullin'
over for the night.

296
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,984
You wouldn't be interested in
gettin' together later, would ya?

297
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,987
I-l thought you were
meeting with Black Sheep.

298
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:19,993
Well, that was the plan, but
how about I blow him off...

299
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,995
and take a chance with you?

300
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,999
-God.
- I love you, man. This is so great!

301
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,959
Relax.

302
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,962
But I'm not sure that
I'd be what you'd expect.

303
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,967
Please.

304
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,970
Well, you are a man, aren't you,
with a soul and a heart?

305
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,974
- That's all I'd expect.
- Great.

306
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,981
Listen, I'll be
at the Lone Star Motel...

307
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,983
in Table Rock,
if you're interested.

308
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:52,985
Pink champagne.

309
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,988
Tell him that you like
pink champagne.

310
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,993
And if there's anyway you could
bring some pink champagne...

311
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,996
it's my favorite.

312
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,999
That as good.

313
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,959
- What room?

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,963
Room 17. Midnight.
You got that, baby?

315
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,967
I got it.

316
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,970
- I can't wait.

317
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,977
- That was mean.
- I know! I know! This is awesome!

318
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:31,982
That guy sucks, okay? He totally
body-checked me on the way out.

319
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,985
- All you do is put--
-Do you miss home?

320
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,988
Yeah. I miss...

321
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,991
Mom's chocolate chip cookies.

322
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,997
Playin' football with Dad, Sundays.

323
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,959
Goin' to-- Oh, wait. That's
somebody else's childhood.

324
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:54,963
What I meant was,
"N-No-o."

325
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,967
You should call sometimes.

326
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,969
You know, when
you don't need bail money.

327
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,971
Yeah, but how often is that?

328
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,975
- I'm serious.
- I call.

329
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,978
Yeah, I know exactly what he says
every time he hangs up the phone.

330
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,980
That I'm the world's biggest loser.

331
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,985
That's comin' from a plumber.

332
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,987
That's comin' from
a guy who wears...

333
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:22,991
a full-length lime green
jumpsuit to work every day.

334
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,993
They don't needme.
I don't need them.

335
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,997
It works like a charm
if you repeat it enough.

336
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,961
- Listen.

337
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,968
Hit the TV.

338
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,980
Oh.
It's Rusty Nail! It's him!

339
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,987
Shh.

340
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,990
Who the hell is it?

341
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,993
I brought the, uh, the drink.

342
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:10,998
This is amazing!

343
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,962
I brought
the, uh, pink champagne.

344
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,966
Is this a goddamn joke ?

345
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,970
I swear to fucking God.

346
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:40,986
What are you-- Are you Black Sheep?

347
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,988
Why don 't you come over here ?

348
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,999
Are you fuckin '
with me, standing in the dark?

349
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,959
This prick is such an asshole!

350
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,962
Show me your face. What was that?

351
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,987
That was weird.

352
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,991
Hey, you know what I think?

353
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,994
I think someone
might have gotten hurt.

354
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,997
No. No, we would
have heard that.

355
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,960
We did. That was a gasp.

356
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,962
Bet that Rusty Nail guy got hurt.

357
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,965
No, it wasn't a gasp.
That was a laugh.

358
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,973
Hey, where are you going?

359
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,976
- What, are you calling Mom?

360
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,978
- Front desk.
- Hi, we just, uh--

361
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:59,982
We just heard some disturbance from
the room next door, in, uh, Room 17.

362
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,985
"Yeah, hi, this is the drama queen
from Room 18--"

363
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,988
That's hard to say.
It was like a-- Iike a thud.

364
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,990
What are you

365
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,992
No, we think someone
might have been hurt.

366
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,996
And we thought you'd want
to check that out, maybe.

367
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,998
All right. Thank you.

368
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,961
You know what's
gonna happen now, right?

369
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,963
Prick's gonna kill
the night manager.

370
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,994
Hello?

371
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,996
Guy said everything's fine.

372
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,959
All right. Thank you.

373
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,977
The guy said everything's fine.

374
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,981
What'd I tell ya?

375
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,980
-Good mornin'.
-How are you today?

376
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,982
Pretty good.
How are you?

377
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,986
- Where are you boys from?
- Originally, New Jersey.

378
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,989
- U h-huh. What are you doi n' here?
- We're drivin' cross-country.

379
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,992
- My brother-- Yeah, Lewis.
- Your brother?

380
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,995
- Where is he?
- In the room. I don't know.

381
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,998
We had a little incident here
last night. Did you hear anything--

382
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,000
any sounds, or anything
out of the ordinary?

383
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,962
Yeah, actually, uh, uh, next door
I heard some sounds.

384
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:30,966
-Next door?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,969
-Could you describe those sounds?
- Yeah, sure.

386
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,972
They were like, uh--

387
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,977
No, wait.

388
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,981
Like that.

389
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,984
- What's goin' on?
- All right, this is Lewis.

390
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,986
There was a "sitchy-ashun"
Iast night. That's all I know.

391
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,989
So after you heard these sounds,
uh, did you look out your window?

392
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,991
- Did you open your door?
- No, sir.

393
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,995
- What happened?
- After you closed your door,

394
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,997
you didn't see anybody else until
I knocked on your door this morning?

395
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,959
That's right. Well, we did call
the night manager, because we were...

396
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,961
uh, concerned, right?

397
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,964
- Right.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. He mentioned that.

398
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,968
And he also said that one ofyou
had an altercation with the victim.

399
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,972
- Which of you was that?
- Wait. The night manager said what?

400
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,975
Apparently one ofyou had words
with the victim, in the motel office...

401
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,978
- when you were checkin' in?
- No, no. We never met--

402
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,983
- What?
- Ellinghouse.

403
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,985
Ronald Ellinghouse.
He was staying in Room 1 7.

404
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,988
The huge guy?
Yeah, I met him.

405
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,990
-But he's-- He's not the one--
- What happened to him?

406
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,994
It wasn't comely.

407
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,998
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that means.

408
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,961
He was found early this mornin'
lyin' face down...

409
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,964
on the highway median.

410
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:55,968
So, you're saying that the--

411
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,970
the huge guy is the victim.

412
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:04,977
You have no idea who might have visited
Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?

413
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,981
No, sir.

414
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,984
I wish-- I wish we could be
more helpful, but l--

415
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,987
- Is he dead?
- Coma.

416
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,991
You know what I'm thinkin'?

417
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:23,996
I'm thinkin' that a little look-see
might "refreshify" your memory.

418
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,959
Takin' a look-see at what?

419
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,979
Ripped his jaw...

420
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,982
clean off.

421
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,993
That is the pain in my ass.

422
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,997
My own personal file of ongoing shit
that I got to deal with.

423
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:10,000
And now, guess what?

424
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Now, I got me another one.

425
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,962
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse...

426
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:18,967
Layin' two inches from dead
in my jurisdiction.

427
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:23,972
Why? Because you sorry-ass punks
thought you'd have some fun.

428
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,974
Fuck!

429
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,978
I'd keep you retards in custody
if I thought it would help answer...

430
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,981
one of the hundreds
of new questions I got.

431
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,985
But, no. All you know
is his damn C.B. handle.

432
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,987
And maybe he drives a truck.

433
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,993
Doyou understand the kinds
of shit I got to grapple with now...

434
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:48,997
because of what
you assholes did?

435
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,999
You! You got out ofjail when?

436
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,961
Yesterday?

437
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:58,966
I want you outta here.
This is like an old-fashioned western.

438
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:02,970
I want you out of Wyoming
before the sun goes down.

439
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,986
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you told them that...

440
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,988
we invited Rusty Nail back.

441
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,990
They could have
thrown me back in jail.

442
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,992
A man is half dead
because ofwhat we did.

443
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,995
Oh, bullshit.

444
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,997
Bullshit!

445
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,999
What, you order ten pizzas
foryour neighbor...

446
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,961
a delivery guy gets there and
your neighbor opens up with an AK-47.

447
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,964
- Is that your fault?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

448
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,966
Fine.
Be the martyr all you want.

449
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,968
No, that's not what I'm doin'.

450
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,971
I'm trying to figure how I'm gonna
drive away after what we've done.

451
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,975
Do what I do.

452
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,978
Just remind yourself that
in 1 00 years, you're gonna be dead.

453
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,980
It's the closest thing
I've got to a philosophy.

454
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,983
No, you know what? I'm taking you
to Denver, and that's it.

455
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,985
Great.

456
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:36,980
Eastbound,
looking for a westbound...

457
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,983
- for a bear report?

458
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,987
Not a soul.
Never any Smokeys on that str--

459
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,996
- ...andy Ca--

460
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,959
Candy Cane.

461
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,963
- Hello.
- Hey!

462
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,967
- Candy Cane.
- Hey!

463
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,970
- I'm asleep.
- Hey, Candy Cane!

464
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,975
Candy Cane?

465
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:16,979
Jesus.

466
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:22,985
Anybody out there know
Candy Cane?

467
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,988
-Or Mama's Boy?

468
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,991
Baa, baa, Black Sheep.

469
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:31,994
- What are you gonna say?
-Hey, Russell.

470
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,998
This is Black Sheep.
Go to 23.

471
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,961
Hey, Black Sheep.

472
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:46,967
Do you know
where I can find Candy Cane?

473
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:52,973
Hey, uh,
what is your deal?

474
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,976
I mean, seriously.

475
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,980
-I'm looking for Candy Cane.

476
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:07,988
So, you've been
driving around all day...

477
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,990
Looking for a voice?

478
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:16,997
I think that you can
tell me where to find her.

479
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,999
- Tell him it was a joke.
- Uh, I talked to Candy Cane...

480
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,960
about last night.

481
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,962
And she said
that she's not interested.

482
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,965
- No!
- She's not interested in you--

483
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:30,969
- Don't do this.
-...ory our pink champagne.

484
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:35,974
I need to find... Candy Cane.

485
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,978
You need to find...

486
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,981
a highly-qualified psychiatrist--

487
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,985
not a psychologist--
you're gonna need some drugs.

488
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,987
You're gonna have to find
a damn good lawyer...

489
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:49,988
because the cops
are all over your ass.

490
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:53,992
- Goddamn!
- Give it to me.

491
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,995
Hey, there,
Rusty Nail, y-you hear this?

492
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,997
That was me, all right? I'm a guy.

493
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,959
It was just a joke.

494
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,961
It was just a joke.

495
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,967
Apologize.

496
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,971
- Right.
- No,just do it.

497
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,974
- Apologize to him?
- Yeah.

498
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,976
- I-I'll do it.
- No.

499
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,980
Listen, you sick fuck...

500
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,984
you pathetic,
lonely walkie-talkie...

501
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,986
freak show motherfucker, you're
not getting anything from me.

502
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,990
Know why? I have something
more powerful than your psychosis.

503
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,992
It's called a volume knob.

504
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:38,996
And the only thing I need to make you
go away is to turn it counter clockwise.

505
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:43,000
Got that?
You copy that?

506
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,962
You know, Black Sheep,
you really ought to get that fixed.

507
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,964
Get what fixed?

508
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,968
Your tail light.

509
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,976
-Do you see anything?
- Yeah. Cars and trucks.

510
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:03,979
-Just drive.Just be cool.
- Oh, my God.

511
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,985
- Did he follow us from the motel?
- I don't know. I don't know.

512
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:13,989
- As long as we keep drivin',
we're safe. What?

513
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,993
- Oh, come on, come on!
- I know. But it's okay.

514
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,995
I saw a sign.
"Gas at Laramie."

515
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:25,000
- There'll be a phone there,
and I'll call Sheriff Ritter.

516
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,960
-Laramie. That'll be good.
- We'll be all right.

517
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,965
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Okay, just stay cool.

518
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,968
- Oh, shit! Will you stop
telling me to be cool?

519
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,970
You're makin' me like, crazy.
Get the map.

520
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,974
- Okay. All right.
- Fuck! We're not gonna

521
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,976
Wait, take the next exit.
I think there's a town there.

522
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,978
- How far is it? How far is it?
- I don't know.

523
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,981
My cuticle to my knuckle.
I don't know. Twelve miles.

524
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,984
- We might not make it twelve miles.
- Take this exit right here.

525
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,993
Yes!
Yes, you're a genius!

526
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,968
I'll pay, you pump. Or doyou
want to pay? I don't care.

527
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,970
- I'll pump.
- Okay. Okay.

528
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,965
Uh, Table Rock, please. Rawlins County
Sheriff Department. Yeah.

529
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,980
Oh, my God.

530
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,988
Hey.

531
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,992
-Hey. Hey.

532
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,995
Hey. Hey!

533
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,967
Sheriff Ritter is not available.

534
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,970
At the tone,
please record your message.

535
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,972
When you have finished recording...

536
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,975
you may hang up or press one
for more options.

537
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,977
Please wait for the tone.

538
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,996
You just got the gas?

539
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,998
Oh, right.

540
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,963
Come on, come on,
come on! Aw, come on.

541
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:10,976
Come on. Get in the car,
get in the car! Come on.

542
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:14,980
- What?
- Go, go, go, go!

543
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,982
- He's in there, man.
Did you see him?

544
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,985
Keep driving, keep driving.

545
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:22,988
Go! Yeah!

546
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,990
- Whoa!

547
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,995
Oh, my God!

548
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:33,999
-Can you see an on-ramp?
- No!

549
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,963
Okay-- Damn it!
The guy's comin' after us.

550
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,966
- Oh, no. Shit!
- Okay, we're not gonna panic.

551
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,968
- Right.
- We missed the on-ramp, man!

552
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,980
Ooh, mailbox--

553
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,982
Whoa.

554
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,989
No, no, no, no!

555
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,991
Shit!

556
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,961
No.

557
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,971
Lewis! Lewis!

558
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:32,975
- He said Lewis!
- Stay the fuck back, man!

559
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,979
And I got
a MasterCard.

560
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,995
- Thanks, man. We thought--
- You really scared us.

561
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,997
- Yeah.
- It wasn't the mustache, was it?

562
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:58,000
My old lady keeps telling
me to shave the thing.

563
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,961
No, no. It wasn't
the mustache, man.

564
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,965
What the-- We're not hip--
What is that thing, your club?

565
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,967
- My tire thumper?
- Yeah.

566
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,969
Shit.
Just checkin' pressure.

567
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,972
Yeah, pressure.
Yeah, the pressure thing.

568
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,975
Are you boys all right
to get back to the main road?

569
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,977
Yeah, we're fine.
Now that we're not murdered.

570
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:19,980
Thanks a lot for this, man.
That was nice ofyou.

571
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,983
- Y'all have a good night.
- Sorry about that.

572
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,991
- Fuckin' Fu Manchu.

573
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:33,994
I've never felt like
more of a pussy in my whole life.

574
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,999
- Oh, my God.

575
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,991
Hey, what kind of range
is there on a C.B.?

576
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,995
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe...

577
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,997
five miles?

578
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,962
Well, hey, you know,
I think we should get to a phone.

579
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:26,964
Call the cops in Table Rock...

580
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,966
Leave a message and let 'em know
that Rusty Nail's in the area.

581
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:33,971
- Shh. What the hell is that?

582
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,991
Go!

583
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:57,995
Go, go!

584
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,963
He's right on us!

585
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,975
Oh, man,
he's right on our ass!

586
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,984
- No, don't use that!
- 9-1-1 !

587
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,987
We need some help. Please!
Is anyone out there?

588
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,993
Goddamn it!

589
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,964
Come on! Fuck!

590
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,975
Yeah! Yeah!

591
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,982
Tree! Tree!

592
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,993
- You okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:22,996
I'm okay. Let's go. Come on.

594
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,959
Yeah, come on, come on.
Come on, let's go!

595
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,964
-Let's go, let's go.
- Shit!

596
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,967
It's not goin' anywhere!

597
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:38,971
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit!

598
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:44,977
Shit!

599
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,979
All right!
Come on! Go, go!

600
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,982
Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

601
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:08,000
Aw, shit!

602
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,966
Oh, no! No!

603
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,978
Come on!
Don't kill us, man!

604
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,981
We apologize!

605
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:34,985
- Don't kill us, man!
We were just playin' with you, man.

606
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,992
Why?

607
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:46,997
Just--
Just for a laugh.

608
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,960
A laugh?

609
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,964
Just for fun.

610
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:02,971
Well, I was

611
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,999
So, where are you now?

612
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,960
We're about
ten miles outside ofLaramie.

613
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,962
We had some car trouble, and, uh,
we're gonna be a little late.

614
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:20,966
That's all right.
Is everything okay?

615
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:23,969
Yeah. No, I mean,
it's been a long drive.

616
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,972
- All right. See you then.
- All right.

617
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:48,994
They fixed the taillight.

618
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:57,961
So, why don't you
just come home with me?

619
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,964
Blow off Denver
and come home with me.

620
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:03,967
No, I'm okay.

621
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,972
Listen, I don't want
to tell Venna what happened.

622
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:12,976
I don't want to ruin things.
Freak her out, you know?

623
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:44,967
Hey.

624
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,972
The color's not great, but
it's spacious. It's a big car,you know?

625
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:52,975
- I love it.

626
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:56,979
- When did you get it?
- I've had it for a while.

627
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,981
- It doesn't look too beat up.
- No.

628
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:00,983
No, actually, I think the dents
add some character.

629
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:04,987
- Actually, I was talking about Fuller.

630
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:06,989
- Hey!
- Hey.

631
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,991
- So, it's been a while.
- Yeah.

632
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,994
So. Well, have you named it yet?

633
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:15,998
Well, we were thinkin',
uh, either Tad...

634
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:19,960
or, uh, "Lewis's Shitty Newport."

635
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,967
Hey! She's hot!

636
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,972
- Hey.
- Have a good summer, Vee.

637
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:34,975
Uh, guys?
My friend Charlotte.

638
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,977
She'll be
my roommate next year.

639
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:40,981
- These are the infamous Thomas boys.
- Oh, Lewis, right?

640
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,983
Yeah. Nice to finally meetyou.

641
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:47,988
And, look, I'm Fuller. I'm Lewis's
older, somewhat troubled brother.

642
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,991
- And you're definitely
goin' with us, right?

643
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,993
I kind ofhave to go back
to San Antonio.

644
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,995
Isn't San Antonio
on the way to New Jersey?

645
00:49:55,996 --> 00:50:00,959
- It was nice to meet you.
- You're breakin' my heart,

646
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:00,959
- It was nice to meet you.
- You're breakin' my heart,

647
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,962
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Me too. Miss you.

648
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:06,965
- I love you. Be safe.
- I loveyou too.

649
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,968
Ah, that's so Charlotte.

650
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,970
- Wavin' and drivin' off like that.

651
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,973
So, are you guys ready
for an adventure orwhat?

652
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,976
Oh, completely.

653
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:20,979
Yeah! Yeah, sure.

654
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:22,981
Shotgun? You want it,
you gotta call it.

655
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,983
Uh, shotgun.

656
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:29,988
* Even heavy things
are weightless,yeah *

657
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,992
* Don't take up
any space at all*

658
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:38,997
* Ride on, ride on *

659
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:42,960
* Ride on, ride on *

660
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,964
* Oh, yeah, it's so clear *

661
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:52,970
Hey.
Welcome to Nebraska.

662
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:56,974
See this hat I got you?

663
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:01,979
* Ride on, ride on *

664
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:07,985
So.

665
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:12,990
I want to tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

666
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,994
Picking me up.

667
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:19,997
It's pretty much the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

668
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:33,969
This is the part
where you kiss the girl.

669
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,973
Well, historically.

670
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,977
Hey, Lewis. You're blushing.

671
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:46,982
* Ride on, ride on*

672
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:53,989
* Oh,yeah, it's so clear *

673
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,993
* All the bad things will go *

674
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:02,998
- Thank you.
-* All the good things are here *

675
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,961
- Hey, the room's this way.
- Yeah, but the bar's this way.

676
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:11,965
- Here's to--
-...Nebraska!

677
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:13,967
To states? All right.

678
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,973
Ah, look what
Uncle Fuller found.

679
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,978
Three tequilas.

680
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,981
All right.

681
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:34,988
Well, I can, uh, tie a knot
in a cherry stem with my tongue.

682
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:37,991
- Shut up!
- Uh-huh.

683
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,993
All right, choose your weapon.

684
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:41,995
Let's see what you're made of.

685
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,999
- And... go.
- Mm.

686
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,967
- Done.
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,971
Still medalled.

688
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,973
- Bronze.
- Not even close.

689
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:02,975
Oh, it's straight. It wasn't even bent.

690
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,999
May I have
three more shots of tequila...

691
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,960
- and some matches, please?
- What's your name, sweetheart?

692
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:38,969
Come on, what's your name?
Hmm?

693
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:41,972
Oh, what's your name, sweet thing?

694
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:44,975
I'm just here to buy drinks.
You can call me whatever you want.

695
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,977
How 'bout I call you Peaches?
Do you like Peaches?

696
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:49,980
- No, not really.
- Oh, you don't like Peaches?

697
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,982
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- What?

698
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,985
- Is this your bitch?
- Excuse me?

699
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:57,988
Excuse me, I said...

700
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:00,991
is this your bitch?

701
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,994
'Cause ifit is, you better
shut your bitch up.

702
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:08,999
Hey, look at me, campus boy. Huh?
Did you hear what I said?

703
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,959
Look me in the face.

704
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,962
You better shut your bitch... up.

705
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:17,966
Bitch, shut up!
Are you mouthin' off again? God!

706
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:21,970
Damn it! You can't turn your back
for one minute, you know.

707
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,973
I owe you one.
Now, come on!

708
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,976
- Back on the truck with you, Daisy!

709
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:30,979
Drunk in the bar!
Now, come on!

710
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,981
Goddamn it!

711
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:34,983
Gentlemen.

712
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,991
Careful, those are expensive.

713
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,995
Ohh.

714
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,962
What?

715
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,965
Hey.

716
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,967
Hey!

717
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,971
Hey.

718
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,974
I got a plan.

719
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:09,977
- And what's your plan?
- Let's never go back there again.

720
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,981
Oh, I can't wait
to never go back there.

721
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,984
Yeah.

722
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,986
I'll be in my presidential suite.

723
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,991
Excellent.
We're gonna head to our--

724
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:27,995
- our spinning hotel room.
- Okay. See you later.

725
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:31,999
Good night.

726
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,965
I get the orange one!

727
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,968
This one.

728
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:51,977
Hey! See, I told you
this was a good place.

729
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:54,980
Adult channels.

730
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,982
Good. Hey, are you
in the mood for...

731
00:55:56,982 --> 00:56:00,986
a story, or, like,
a collection of scenes?

732
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:00,986
a story, or, like,
a collection of scenes?

733
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:04,990
She isn't a Navy SEAL.

734
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,993
God! Takes me right out.

735
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:11,997
Hey, Venna's great, man.

736
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:15,959
She's got--

737
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,964
I mean, you guys--
You guys are just friends, right?

738
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,969
I mean,
that's what you said.

739
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,972
Right? You're just--
just hangin' out, and--

740
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:33,977
Cause if you're anything

741
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:37,981
you tell me right now,
and I'm gonna just-- I'll--

742
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:41,985
...off.

743
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,987
You know?

744
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,990
Great.

745
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:57,960
Oh, we never got
those last drinks.

746
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,963
Yeah, um...

747
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:02,965
you know, if we're gonna
get an early start...

748
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:05,968
we should probably
just crash and go to bed.

749
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,970
Yeah. But, hey...

750
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,973
I'm a-- I'm a licensed bartender.

751
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:15,978
Yeah, I'd show you my license,
but my hands are full, so--

752
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:19,982
Oh. Where's your better half?

753
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,984
He's busy. Snoring.

754
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:27,990
Well, you know, I really don't
think that I can drink anymore.

755
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:31,994
I disagree.
And I'm a professional.

756
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:39,960
You know what's amazing?

757
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,962
Nobody knows
where we are right now.

758
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,968
Just kinda...

759
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:49,970
out there.

760
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:54,975
Floating.

761
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:58,979
If anybody wanted to find us
for some strange reason...

762
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,982
they couldn't.

763
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,985
What am I talking about?

764
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,988
I have no idea. Here, try this.

765
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

766
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,963
Is Lewis okay?
He doesn't normally drink so much.

767
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:27,966
Yeah, he's totally fine.

768
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,980
Fuller, get the phone.

769
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,999
Hello.

770
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,961
How I thought
you said there was no girl.

771
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:07,965
- What?
- You said there was no girl.

772
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,967
Fuller.

773
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:18,976
Listen, there--
There isn't any girl.

774
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:24,982
Then, what's she doing
in the other room with your brother?

775
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,998
- He's out there!

776
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:41,999
- He's watching us!
- Rusty Nail?

777
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:44,960
- Hejust called me.
- Who's Rusty Nail?

778
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,963
Yeah, just now. He knew you were
in here. He's watching us!

779
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:50,966
- There's somebody watching us?
- He just called.

780
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:53,969
He said, "I thought there was no girl."
And what you were doing...

781
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:55,971
in the room with her,
which is an excellent question.

782
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,974
- We're gettin' out ofhere, so
put on your shoes.

783
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:01,977
- Just do it!
- How scared am I supposed to be?

784
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:12,988
Much more than usual.

785
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,985
Okay, there's nobody behind us.
Can somebody please talk to me?

786
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,987
He knows we're brothers.
How does that happen?

787
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:56,990
All right, we're goin' to the police,
we're gettin' of fthe highway...

788
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,993
- then we're goin' home!
- Lewis, goddamn it!

789
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,996
Something weird happened to us
before we picked you up.

790
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,999
- I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna freak you out.

791
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:08,961
- You want the short version?
- Talk to me.

792
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:11,964
- There's this sick guy.
He put this guy in a coma.

793
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:14,967
This Rusty Nail guy
did something?

794
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,969
- Because of something that we did.
- What did you do?

795
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:24,977
Hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?

796
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:28,981
He wants us
to look in the trunk.

797
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:32,985
There were signs
spray painted back there:

798
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,987
"Look in the trunk."

799
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:37,990
Signs? What makes you think
they're for us?

800
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:41,994
Look.

801
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,999
What's going on here?

802
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:54,965
That's a pretty elaborate
thing to do, paint those signs.

803
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,967
- No, no, no! No!
- What? God!

804
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:58,969
- Don't open it!
- Why?

805
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:02,973
- What if there's a head
or a body in there, man?

806
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:05,976
- Think a bomb's a reason
not to open the trunk?

807
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:07,978
I say we don't open the trunk!

808
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:11,982
I'm not getting back into the car
till I know what's in the trunk.

809
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:13,984
What are you doing?

810
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,995
Oh, shit.

811
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:30,000
Okay, we plug it in,
and we don't talk on it.

812
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,961
We just listen.

813
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,964
And whatever he says, we just--
We just go straight to the police.

814
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,967
I'm not going to go anywhere...

815
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,970
until somebody tells me why
I should be afraid ofa radio.

816
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,993
Candy Cane, are you there?

817
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,998
Oh, that's right.

818
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:14,962
I don't mean my Candy Cane.

819
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,964
I mean yours.

820
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:19,967
Venna?

821
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,971
- How does he know my name?
- We're not getting into it

822
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,974
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going.

823
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,976
You know when a corpse
can't be identified?

824
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:33,981
No next of kin.
No one to claim the body.

825
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:38,986
What they do is,
they cut off all the fingers.

826
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,988
All ten of them.

827
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,991
And then they cut offt hejaw.

828
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,994
They cut off
the person'sjaw...

829
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:51,999
and they put it all in a jar.

830
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:57,963
- They put it in a jar
with some number on it.

831
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,973
- Oh, my God, that's Charlotte.

832
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,975
- What?
- That's Charlotte.

833
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:11,977
- That girl ? Your roommate?
- Yeah, yeah.

834
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:15,981
Hey, what the hell do you want?

835
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:20,986
I want you to go to the State Line
Truck Stop parking lot.

836
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:23,989
- I'll find you there.
- Venna, please help me!

837
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,992
And if you go to the police...

838
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:31,997
I will take her apart
piece by piece.

839
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,982
Good morning.

840
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:03,987
Hey, he's back.
We're here.

841
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:08,992
Okay, here's what I want.
Fuller, Lewis...

842
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:12,996
I want you two
to head inside.

843
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,999
Take a seat at the counter.

844
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:19,962
Order six cheeseburgers each.

845
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:23,966
What about Venna?

846
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:26,969
She stays put.

847
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,974
But you two are
going in... naked.

848
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:33,976
Naked?

849
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:40,983
If we go i n there dicks hangin'...

850
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:44,987
they're just gonna call the police.

851
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:48,991
Aw, come on.
It's just for fun.

852
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,993
Bullshit,
I'm staying here.

853
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:55,998
Just stay up front.
I want you to keep the car running.

854
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:58,959
And if you see anything,
honk the horn and drive.

855
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:05,966
God, I can't fucking believe
we're doing this.

856
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,978
Billy, come on.
Get in the car.

857
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:19,980
Sissy.

858
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,993
Now they know what it feels like...

859
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,996
to be the brunt ofthe joke.

860
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:40,000
Your heart pounding.

861
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,961
Face burning hot.

862
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:46,965
Now they know what it feels like...

863
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:49,968
to be the fucking punch line.

864
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:53,972
They told me what they did
to you, and I'm very, very sorry.

865
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,975
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

866
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:58,977
I bet your friends
hada really good laugh...

867
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:03,982
seeing me standing there
in the rain, holding my bottle.

868
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:19,998
Well, that's a lesson your friends are
gonna have to learn the hard way.

869
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,959
You wanna see Charlotte alive again?

870
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,961
Here's what you're gonna have to do.

871
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:32,970
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.

872
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:37,975
You want fries with that?

873
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,982
ls this a fraternity stunt?

874
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,984
Because if this wasn't
my restaurant--

875
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:49,987
A man's gonna kill our friend
ifwe don't come in here like this.

876
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:52,990
I'd say it was
a pretty good one.

877
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,993
- We're not joking, man.

878
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:03,959
Man, we should be going to the cops.

879
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:06,962
We're not going anywhere
till we find out what he wants.

880
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:12,968
Right up here.
This is where we turn.

881
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:15,971
That's-That's what he said.

882
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,961
You out there ?

883
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,965
We're here.

884
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,968
Something special's
waiting for you.

885
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:56,970
I'd say it's about
a hundred feet up the road.

886
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:00,974
So, get out ofthe car.

887
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,976
Wait. I'm not walkin'
one foot out of this--

888
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,978
We don't have a choice.
We're doing what he says.

889
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,981
- What?
- He's-He's got Charlotte.

890
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:10,984
- Wait! Goddamn it!
-Get out of the car!

891
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,993
What the hell is this?

892
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:21,995
Wait, how many feet did he say?

893
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,998
- A hundred. A hundred.
- Huh?

894
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:34,967
Do you hear
or see anything?

895
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:36,969
This is it.

896
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:38,971
Shh!

897
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:51,984
Whoa!

898
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:56,989
Hi. Uh--

899
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:58,991
- He's not slowing down.
- He's not gonna stop.

900
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:01,994
- What's he doing?
- He's not gonna stop.

901
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:03,996
- He's not slowing down!
- Run! Car! Go!

902
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,961
- Run! Run!

903
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,970
Whoa, whoa, wait.

904
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,972
What the hell is he doing?

905
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,000
He's coming.
Let's go! Let's go!

906
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:53,962
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

907
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,964
Run! Run! Run!

908
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,968
Run!

909
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,971
Run!

910
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:08,977
- Turn left!

911
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,979
- Keep going!

912
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,982
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

913
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,987
That way!

914
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:20,989
Get down! Get down!

915
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,999
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

916
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,964
Let's go! Come on!

917
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,983
Come on!

918
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,989
Go! Run!

919
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:04,992
Turn, quick!

920
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:15,961
Venna?

921
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:43,989
* Why did I listen *

922
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:46,992
* To my friends *

923
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,996
* When they told me*

924
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:53,999
-* What to do *
- Lewis!

925
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:57,961
* Yes, I still *

926
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:00,964
* Have my friends *

927
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:07,971
* But I don't have you *

928
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:13,977
Venna?

929
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:16,980
Lewis.
-* Should I say I'm sorry *

930
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,984
* You're blue *

931
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:25,989
Lewis.

932
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,997
Lewis!

933
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,964
Venna.

934
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:05,988
Fuller!

935
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,962
- Venna?
- Lewis?

936
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,966
Fuller?

937
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:33,974
- Lewis!
- Venna?

938
01:14:33,974 --> 01:14:36,977
- You guys okay? Oh, man.
- What?

939
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:38,979
- Hey, Venna.
- Did you see that?

940
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:40,981
- Yeah.
- I was sitting back there.

941
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:43,984
- Venna. You can come out. He's leaving.
- He tried to back up.

942
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:47,988
- Venna?
- You let her out of your sight?

943
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,990
- Venna?
- Lewis, goddamn it!

944
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,993
- You let her out of your sight?
- Where the hell were you?

945
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:54,995
I was over there, man!
Back there!

946
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:57,998
Venna!
Venna, come out here!

947
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:01,960
Lewis!
Lewis, help me, please!

948
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,965
Lewis!

949
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,970
Stop, you gotta
leave her alone! Please.

950
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,972
- We'll do whatever you want.
- Lewis!

951
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:17,976
You don't feel like
meeting me at a motel later, do you?

952
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:19,978
We'll do whatever you want!

953
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:25,984
Meet me at the next town--
Medford. Room 17. Midnight.

954
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,986
Do not be one minute late.

955
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:29,988
Lewis, gas tank!
Come on!

956
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:32,991
And if there's any way that you could
bring a bottle of pink champagne--

957
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,996
- What are you doing?
Come on, goddamn it!

958
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,973
Venna.

959
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:07,985
Seven miles. Hey!

960
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:11,989
Come on!

961
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:15,993
Hey! Hey!
He said not to call the cops!

962
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:21,999
Keep a look out.
Don't worry. I've done this before.

963
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:23,959
What?

964
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:38,974
Hey, man, we're runnin'out oftime.

965
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:44,980
God... damn...

966
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:44,980
God... damn...

967
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,984
- thing won't start.

968
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,986
Uh, hello.

969
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,992
Hey.

970
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:01,997
- Hey.
- Need some help?

971
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:05,000
No, I thinkwe're fine.

972
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,961
- And he wonders why I drive a Chevy.
- No shit.

973
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:11,965
Come on. Come on.

974
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:14,968
I got some jumper cables.
I'll hook you up.

975
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,971
Uh, no, no, really.
I think we're all right.

976
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:20,974
- It's just flooded, right?
You'll get it started.

977
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:24,978
- Just take it and turn it
all the way off, then on.

978
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:27,981
Want me to show you?
You gotta hesitate it for two seconds.

979
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,987
- There it is.
- All right, perfect.

980
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:35,989
Hey, you're the man.
Thanks a lot.

981
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:46,959
Where the hell you goin'?
That's my truck!

982
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,963
Everything's going to be all right.

983
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:53,966
We're gonna get Venna.

984
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,970
And we're gonna find Charlotte.

985
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,974
Everything's--
Everything's gonna be okay.

986
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:06,979
Don't you think?

987
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:11,984
* I wonder *

988
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:16,989
* My little darling *

989
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:18,991
* Where can you be *

990
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:23,996
* This moonlit night *

991
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:28,959
Okay, motel. Motel.

992
01:18:32,963 --> 01:18:36,967
- Which one?
- He didn't say. Shit!

993
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:40,971
* My heart
My heart is aching *

994
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:50,981
* To let it go on breaking *

995
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:54,985
Venna?

996
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,987
Hold on.

997
01:18:56,987 --> 01:19:01,992
- Venna!
- I said hold on!

998
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,994
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

999
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:08,999
* Baby, since we're through *

1000
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:11,960
* I've been through lovers' lane *

1001
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,962
* Oh, but in my heart *

1002
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,965
* There's only pain *

1003
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:23,972
* You went travelin'
but will it last *

1004
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:29,978
* While I'm travelin'
I'm travelin' awful fast *

1005
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,980
- * Sweetheart of mine *
- Help you?

1006
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:35,984
- Is this your room?
- Yeah. What of it?

1007
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:40,989
* It's where, where
where it'll be *

1008
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,992
* If this new love dies
where will we be *

1009
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:46,995
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1010
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:48,997
* Will your heart*

1011
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,959
* Come running back to me *

1012
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:57,965
What's the problem here?

1013
01:19:57,965 --> 01:19:59,967
- Shit!
- What did we miss?

1014
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,971
* Baby, since we're through *

1015
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,974
* I've been through lovers' lane *

1016
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:10,978
* Oh, but in my heart *

1017
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,981
* There's only pain *

1018
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:19,987
* You've been travelin'
but will it last *

1019
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:23,991
- Hello, police.

1020
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:27,995
Yeah. I'd like to report
some dead bodies.

1021
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,998
Your name, sir?

1022
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,979
Hello?

1023
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:56,982
Hello?

1024
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:59,985
Come on.

1025
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,990
Hello?

1026
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:11,997
It's unlocked.
- Comin' in.

1027
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,961
- Hey, we're comin' in.
- We're comin' in.

1028
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:25,969
Venna? Hello?

1029
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:33,977
- Venna?
- Hey.

1030
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,992
Oh, the switch.

1031
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:03,966
- Hello?
- Nice, isn't it...

1032
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,969
being on the receiving end?

1033
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,973
- Where the hell's Venna?
- Who?

1034
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:12,975
Look, I'm not kidding.
Where's Venna?

1035
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,978
You see, you might not
be kidding, but I am.

1036
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,981
- What did he say?
- That's the point.

1037
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:22,985
- Get it?
- No, believe me...

1038
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:24,987
you made your point, all right?

1039
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:26,989
And we're sorry.
We told you that.

1040
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,992
Hey, Lewis, you know what
I think is a real kick?

1041
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:35,998
Pretending the person that
I'm talking to is right next to me.

1042
01:22:35,998 --> 01:22:38,000
- Right next to me.
- What?

1043
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,962
What the fuck is he talking--

1044
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:46,967
Not what you expected, is it?

1045
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:51,972
That's not what I expected
when I came to room 17, neither.

1046
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:55,976
You guys sittin' right next door...

1047
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:58,979
Listening through the wall.

1048
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,983
That's what you did, right?
You listened through the wall.

1049
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:07,988
What do you want?

1050
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:12,993
I just want to enjoy this for a second.

1051
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:14,995
We gotta call the cops.

1052
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:17,998
No. If we call the cops,
he'll kill her.

1053
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,959
- Well, what the fuck, man?
- You--

1054
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:22,961
I think you should go outside.

1055
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:24,963
- See if you can see in his room.
- Are you crazy?

1056
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:29,968
Just do it! I'll keep him on the phone.
Go out there now. Go.

1057
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:48,987
Shit!

1058
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:52,991
- You still there?
- Oh, yeah, I'm here.

1059
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:56,995
Why don't you come on over?
Your Candy Cane's waiting.

1060
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:13,971
Listen. We learned
our lesson, all right?

1061
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:16,974
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1062
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:19,977
So, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

1063
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:21,979
You're gonna
give us back Venna...

1064
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:25,983
then Charlotte and we're gonna
walk away from this whole thing.

1065
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:27,985
And we're not gonna
tell anybody, all right?

1066
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:29,987
And we sure as hell
won't tell the cops.

1067
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:17,993
Don't!

1068
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:20,996
Don't open the door!

1069
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,999
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door!

1070
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:38,972
Come on!

1071
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:45,979
Wait! Aah! Shit!

1072
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:47,981
Lewis!

1073
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,963
Fuller, where are you?

1074
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:15,968
Fuller?

1075
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:38,991
- Fuller?

1076
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:42,995
Fuller, come on.
Let's get you off this.

1077
01:26:42,995 --> 01:26:46,999
- Aah! Don't!
- What?

1078
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:50,961
Pipe! Jesus, there's a pipe
in my leg!

1079
01:26:50,961 --> 01:26:53,964
Aah!

1080
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:10,981
We've got a body in here!

1081
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:12,983
We've got a possible 839!
Search every room!

1082
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:20,991
Oh,jeez!
What is he doing?

1083
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:27,998
- Come on, come on, come on!

1084
01:27:27,998 --> 01:27:30,959
Sheriff's Department!
Open up! Kick it open!

1085
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:35,964
Clear the door!

1086
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,968
Twenty-four, clear!

1087
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:47,976
Move!
On the ground! Now!

1088
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:50,979
- Watch it!
