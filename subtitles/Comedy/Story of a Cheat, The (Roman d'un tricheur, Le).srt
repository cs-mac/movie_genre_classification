There was a time...

forget their inner voices.

stopped dreaming.

they now lived to fish.

- Is there something wrong?
- No, no.

Well, yes.

I need to get some air.
How can I get out of here?

Quick. Come this way.

[ Deep Breath, Sighs ]

00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,110
- Ah! Bravo!
- [ Exhales ]

646
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,281
- An amazing jump.
- [ Daniel ] Thanks.
- [ Laughing ]

- [ Maitre ] Wonderful.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,426
And why is everybody

[ Master ]
We must study the sun.

Yeah, I mean you.

[ Whimpering, Crying ]

Look through the lens.

00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:46,396
Okay, now watch carefully.

Right? Well, what do you see?

- No, no, no.
- Hmm?

- An eclipse.
- An eclipse?

What does the sun do
that it doesn't do every day?

682
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,907
An eclipse, my friend.

683
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,109
That is the answer to the question.

684

- Watch that fish.
- Uh.

685
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:17,089
You see, the fish is the moon.

686
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,754
It's much smaller than the sun...

687
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,730
but it's also a lot closer to us.

688
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,429
When it moves to an exact position
between us and the sun-

689
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,974
- Yeah?
- it covers the sun completely.

690
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,203
- Oh.
- And that is why we call it an eclipse.

691
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,474
What does that have to do
with my wave, Maitre?

what we need to find out here.

dinner prepared for us.

And then perhaps later...

Hello, Daniel.
What are you doing in there?

704
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:35,027
I followed your advice.
I left the lagoon to fulfill my dream.

705
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,940
But there inside, where you are right now-
Are you sure that is the right way?

Hmm.

Uh... I-l- l- We can't stay for dinner.

709

But you want to know
where to find your wave, don't you?

00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,469
Of course, but l-

I thank you for your help
and hospitality...

712
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:13,031
but this is something
that I have to figure out for myself.

713
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,876
All alone?
Well, that's just really dumb.

714

Ifthere's anyone that can do that...

715
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,185
I am certain it is me, young fellow.

716
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,484
I know things that-
that others just don't know.

You can tell me
anything that you want.

739

All my life I've heard that wishes
come true inside the purple shell.

And what do we find?
A selfish guy who cares only about himself.

Don't feel sad, Carl.

742
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,654
It's true that things
were not as you were told.

743
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,696
But you've seen the truth with your own eyes.
Not many achieve that in their own lives.

744
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,493
The important thing is
that we learned a lesson.

745
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,501
- What lesson?
- That not everything you hear is true.

- Hmm.
- That some things are not
what they appear to be.

Thank you for freeing him
from that horrible prison.

- [ Maitre ] You!
- [ Grumbling ]

804
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,892
Not only have you left without paying...

but now you want to steal my slaves!

806

How dare you!

807
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,635
How dare you make slaves
out of all of these innocent creatures?

808
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,800
They're mine! They're mine!

809
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,640
They're mine!

810
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:53,409
They were never yours! You can't realize
your dreams by stealing the dreams of others.

[ Yelling ]

812
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,267
Carl?

- [ Carl Chattering ]

00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,037
[ Chattering Continues ]

815
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,575
Yes. Yes, right here. I got you.
You get away from me!

816
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,770
- [ Chuckles ]
- Wait till my friend Daniel gets here!

00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,211
- He's gonna- [ Gasps ]
- What's wrong, Carl?

818
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,374
Look!
[ Shuddering ]

819
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,112
- [ Gasps ]
- How nice! Another visitor!

820
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,121
Your friend here
doesn't wanna talk to me.

821
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,420
He's trying to poke me
with this pointy thing.

822
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:40,121
Stay back! A sea urchin in my hands
is a deadly weapon!

823
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,357
- [ Squealing ]
- Hyah! Hi-yah!

824
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,899
What do you want?

825
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,458
First I'd like to find out who I have
the pleasure of meeting here.

826
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,540
- [ Whimpering ]
- [ Squealing Continues ]

827
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,412
I hope you can, uh, stay to eat.

828
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,745
- [ Chuckles ] l- I mean, to talk.
- We're only passing by.

829
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,615
"Passing by." lnteresting.

830
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,383
-Well, aren't you scared of me?
-I don't fear what I don't know.

831
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,619
Well, y-you should be careful
out here in the open ocean.

832
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,895
A-And where's the rest of your pod?

833
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,056
They must be fishing
in the island's lagoon.

834
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,329
- So what are you doing out here all alone?
- I'm following my dream.

835
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,234
- I'm looking for the perfect wave.
- Blah, blah, blah.

836
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,137
Now just a second here.
What kind of a dream is that?

837
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,803
Isn't there anything you want
with all of your heart?

838
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,972
Me? I- I don't know.

839
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,983
Come on. We all want something.

840
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:40,648
But most creatures get so busy that they
lose track of their true purpose in life.

841
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,190
Ya think so?

842
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,884
Of course.

843
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,326
Even my friend Carl here has a wish...

844
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,090
but he doesn't know what it is yet.

845
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,189
- That's why we travel together.
- But-

846
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,463
- You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
- Of course.

847
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,596
Yes, I think so.
At least that's what I'd like to think.

848
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,197
You don't happen to know where
I could find the perfect wave.

849
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,970
I bet you get around, don't you?

850
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:05,070
Well, you know,
I myself, I'm not so interested in waves.

851
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,650
- That's simply not my thing.
- Sure.

852
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,049
Not everybody likes the same thing.

853
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,552
That'd be pretty boring.

854
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,486
Exactly. Exactly!

855
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,855
So, what is it you really wish?

856
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,861
My- M-M-My wish?

857
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,091
Well, I don't, uh-

858
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,966
I don't, uh- Well,
you know what I am, right?

859
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,164
Of course. Naturally. A shark.

860
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,434
A shark? Ha!

861
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,103
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with here.

862
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,738
They know me from here to Zanzibar.

863
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:42,215
I mean, I'm the biggest,
the meanest and, uh-

864
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,048
[ Chuckles ]

865
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,714
You know what they say about me...

866
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,347
don't ya?

867
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,518
Yeah, yeah, the usual talk-

868
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,257
That you eat a lot and everyone's
really scared of you, stuff like that.

869
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,664
- But you see, that's the whole problem here.
- What?

870
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,896
Everyone's afraid of me
and runs away when they see me...

871
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,496
and it's so impossible
for me to talk to them.

872
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,701
So you want to have friends to talk to?

873
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:12,578
How can I talk to anybody if, before they say
anything, I'm already chompin' them down?

874
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,912
- [ Muttering ]
- Well, that is a real problem.

875
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,918
But nothing that can't be solved.

876
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,821
Think. Everybody runs away
because you try and eat them.

877
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,586
So then-

878
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,127
I eat them before they go away.

879
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:30,222
No! If you don't eat them,
then you can talk to them.

880
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,426
Easy, don't you think?

881
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,902
If I don't eat them, I can talk to them...

882
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,702
and they can talk to me.

883
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,605
Of course!

884
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,737
That's why when I eat them
they don't talk!

885
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,543
Well, some scream.

886
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,141
- But screaming's not talking.
- [ All Yelling ]

887
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,947
Cool, huh?

888
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,215
Well, I have to try. it.

889
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:56,258
- Where are the fish?
- Take it easy, my friend.

890
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,055
- You just called me "friend"?
- Yeah. Why?

891
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,392
Nobody has ever called me his friend.

892
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,363
Sure feels good, right?

893
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,002
[ Shrieking, Panting ]

00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:10,266
- [ Laughs ]
- Hey, what did you do that for?

895
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,897
Carl's my friend.

896
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,566
Sorry, sorry.

897
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,736
I wanted to not eat you.

898
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:20,179
I just have to practice this
a little more until I get it right.

899
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,513
I'm really sorry, little guy.

900
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,110
I almost messed up, didn't l?

901
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,782
I've just never done this before,
this whole not-eating thing.

902
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,020
Uh, it's okay. You'll learn how.

903
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,926
Well, thankyou, my friends.

904
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,932
Hey! You there!
Wait a second, fishies!

905
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:41,094
I'll get you guys anyway,
but I won't eat you.

906
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,605
Do you hear me?
You'd better wait for me!

- Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say!

That dolphin made the worst mistake...

00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,189
of his miserable existence.

[ Carl, Daniel Laughing ]

918
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:59,341
[ Carl ] First, I gave a lesson to a shark
that likes biting his friends...

919
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:03,283
and before that, I defeated
a monster full of scars...

920
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,820
after defeating his army of barracudas.

921
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,016
Ha! I can't wait
for the next challenge, Daniel.

922
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,559
Lucius, the dream-eater.

923
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,720
[ Yelps ]

924
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,598
Lucius, the dream-eater?

925
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:21,534
The creature that you described
is Lucius, the dream-eater.

926
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:26,098
He lives to capture the dreams
of all creatures that inhabit the ocean.

927
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,769
I'm surprised you survived
an encounter with him.

928
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,278
I don't think he'll bother us anymore.

929
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:35,875
I personally took care of the dream-eater
with my bare tentacles.

930
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,977
Hoo! If that's so, then it's good news.

931
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,750
- Who are you?
- I am a sunfish.

932
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:45,726
And before you ask me what I'm doing,
I am swimming after the sun.

933
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,798
- Hey, I like the sun!
- You like the sun?

934
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:54,598
That's so cool. I've always fantasized
about touching the sun.

935
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,501
If only for an instant.

936
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,074
- You wanna touch it?
- As it gets close to the ocean.

937
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,042
Imagine almost touching it
before it disappears.

938
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,612
It could happen, right?

939
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,739
If you think so.
But try not to burn yourself.

940
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,182
My dream is to touch the sun.

00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,446
- I also have a dream.
- Really?

942

I've been searching the sea
to find the perfect wave.

- How do you know my name?
- So the story was true.

945
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,922
- What story?

As promised by the Voice of the Sea...

1278
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,973
Daniel returned to his beloved island.

1279
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,100
He told them about his adventures...

1280
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,441
and how he managed
to fulfill his dream...

1281
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,980
and discover
the true purpose of his life...

1282
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:05,781
overcoming the doubts and fears
that had always existed only in his mind.

1283
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,856
Daniel's pod was dazzled
by Daniel's story..

1284
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:12,620
They decided to cross the outer reef
and venture into the open sea.

1285
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:16,857
They were awed by the beautiful world
that existed beyond the lagoon...

1286
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,628
and for the first time in their lives,
they felt free.

1287
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,067
They now knew,
just as Daniel had known...

1288
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:26,072
that their journey to
the world of dreams had begun.

1289
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:30,201
And as for Daniel, well, he kept traveling
through the oceans of the world...

01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,748
riding waves and experiencing
a thousand adventures.
