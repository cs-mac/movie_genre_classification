It just came to me.

154
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,686
We have that house there,
and we haven't been able to sell it.

155
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:03,622
We've gone there every other year.
Why not this one?

156
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,660
- [Cheering]
- Now, you will be careful, won't you?

157
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:10,061
- We'll be so good, nobody will know us.
- Don't worry about a thing.

158
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:13,658
- I'll try not to.
- Oh, everything will be fine, Mother.

159
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:16,966
I'll take your place, Martha can
have charge of the money and the meals...

160
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:19,632
Frank will take care of the boys
and Ernestine will take care of the girls...

161
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:22,009
- and we'll all take care of Tom.
- [All Chuckling]

162
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:22,566
- And we'll all take care of Tom.
- [All Chuckling]

163
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,076
Let's go, everybody.
We only have 20 minutes.

164
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,482
- See you at the station.
- All right.

165
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:34,680
- Ain't they coming' with us too?
- No, no. It'll be too crowded.

166
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:38,590
How can you say that? Eight valises,
a dog, a cat, a canary bird.

167
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:42,095
- Nine people.
- Nine people? We're only supposed to be seven.

168
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,961
One, two, three...
Mickey and Peter Schermerhorn!

169
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:48,297
- You two get right out of this taxi.
- But Jackie said we could go.

170
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,462
I'm sorry. You can't.

171
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:53,701
Go on. Out of there, quickly.

172
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:58,712
Hurry now. We've got enough trouble
without taking the neighbor's children too.

173
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,850
Drive on.

174
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:05,852
Bye.

175

[Horn Blowing]

00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,669
Oh, Janey!

177
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,173
If it isn't the bathing beauties.
Aren't you going in?

178
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,439
Later, Frank, later.

179
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,538
Oh, I get it.

180
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:37,015
Look at that poor sucker
standing there.

181
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:40,315
- Does he know what plans
you have in store for him?
- Please, go away.

182
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:43,585
- Oh, that poor Morton.
- [Scoffs]

183
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:49,796
- Morton just noticed us.
- Has he?

184
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:54,301
- What plans do you have in mind for him?
- None. Absolutely none.

185
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:56,632
He looks exactly the same
as he did last year.

186
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,298
I thought you found him
rather attractive last year.

187
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:03,275
I did, but I'm a year older, and women
mature so much earlier than men.

188
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,677
- He's a baby. Really, he is.
- I don't think he's a baby.

189
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:11,514
- Want him?
- Want him? He's an Amherst man.

190
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:16,046
Well, here he comes. Just catch
the ball when I throw it to you.

191
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,057
Hello, Ann.

192
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,184
Oh, hello, Morton.
You remember my sister Ernestine.

193
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:23,890
Oh, yes. Hello. Ann, how about going in
for a swim? The water's keen.

194
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:27,264
- I don't think so.
- Come on. I'll race you to the pier.

195
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:30,395
I don't feel like it, but if it's
a race you want, Ernestine...

196
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:34,202
Hi, everybody.! Who wants
to race me out to the pier?

197
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:36,835
- I do!
- Well, come on, then.

198
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,985
Say, you're not the only one
who got mature this year.

199
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:48,146
Oh, Martha's just an infant.

200
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:50,554
She doesn't look like
an infant in that.

201
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:54,186
Well, thanks for turning
Morton over to me.

202
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,856
Believe me, Ernestine,
you haven't lost a thing.

203
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:00,594

- Thanks.
- You're new around here, aren't you?

00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:27,349
Yep. First day on the island,
first day on the job. Al Lynch is the name.

No. Sagiwan Agricultural

- Isn't that marvelous.

Tom, I'd like for you to meet Mr. Lynch,
our new deliveryman.

00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,904
- Hi.
- Ah, Mr. Lynch.

218
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,345
I'm very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

219
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:51,317
And now, would you mind bringing
the groceries in, or do you need some help?

220
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:53,444
Help? Me?

221
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,560
I only took this job
to keep my muscles in trim.

You know, Red Grange
is delivering ice this summer.

224
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,768
- Here?
- No, no, someplace else.

225
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:11,362
But I take a great interest in him.
We both play the same position.

226
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,431
- Oh?
- Isn't that interesting.

- Tau Tau Tau.

walked in with the groceries.

Martha, couldn't you just squeeze
some hamburgers out of that budget?

00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,938
They're gonna have a barbecue too.

302
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,106
Well, isn't it a good thing
we got here first.

303
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:54,316
Martha, is this the meat
you said would be along?

304
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,718
- You can't.
- No? Watch me.

305
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,723
You can't possibly.

306
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,885
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

307
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:04,191
- Hello.
- Hello, Colonel.

308
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,857
- Were you planning a barbecue too?
- Why, yes, but...

309
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:10,459
Oh, I'm sorry.
Gosh, we didn't know it.

310
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:13,004
Why don't you take over the fire.

311
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:16,235
We'll just go back to the house
and boil ours on the stove.

312
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,173
I wouldn't hear of it.

313
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,644
We insist. Don't we?

314
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:24,740
After all, you're planning
a party, and, well, we're only family.

315
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,149
All we have is frankfurters, anyway.

316
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:32,316
Let's get our things together
and get out of Colonel Putnam's way.

317
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,883
You'll do nothing of the kind.
You're going to stay right here with us.

318
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,088
We'll combine forces.

319
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:40,688
- Oh, no.
- I insist.

320
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,462
We have more than enough steaks
for everyone, haven't we, Emily?

321
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,164
Oh, yes, Colonel.
Enough for a regiment.

322
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:55,113
Well, it isn't up to me.
It's up to Ann.

I won't enjoy a mouthful of food.

Well, we couldn't do that
to you, Colonel. Could we?

- Absolutely not.

We'll all have to go

I stopped in to see
the real estate agent...

00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,056

for the rest of the summer.

were canceled...

worked so closely together.

I guess he was the one
they were really hiring.

They think of me as someone
who just tagged along.

- What will you do, Mother?
- I don't know, Ann.

- No.
- Three cases a week.

Don't touch the ones with chalk marks.
They're Tom's.

- Okay.
- What flavor did Tom make?

500
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:55,630
I saw him put some yeast, prunes
and sugar in 'em.

00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:57,864
Eew! Must taste terrible.

- Yes.

- Yes, he was quite a guy.

I was just down here visiting
the Wilson Tool and Die outfit.

506
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:23,654
Wilson's got a couple of boys running
the plant for him and they're just great.

- I know. That's why I'm here.

I got a great opportunity
for fellas like them.

I could use a couple of good men.

but they all have very good jobs.

give 'em up, either.

I tried to steal those two fellas
from Wilson, but nothing doing.

- They wouldn't be exactly right for you, anyway.
- No?

517

We trained Evans and Boyd
for Wilson Tool and Die.

518
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,227
- They wouldn't be right for Harper Electric.
- We?

00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:04,999

No, that'd never work.

- Why wouldn't what?

- Right here.

893
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:32,127
Oh, I won't be able to.
I have to go back to college tomorrow.

894
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,794
- But I'll be back for Easter vacation.
- Good. Good.

895
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,703
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

896
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:42,571
- Is Mother gonna be here till Easter?
- Of course not.

897
00:57:42,643 --> 00:57:46,306
- Well, then, I don't understand.
- It's all right, Ernestine.

Ann does.

899
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:52,308
And when that Kendall Williams
person left me standing on the sidewalk...

900
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,820
in front of the Engineers' Club
all dressed up...

901
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,755
with no dinner to go to,
I was so furious...

902
00:57:57,825 --> 00:57:59,725
I guess I didn't watch
where I was driving...

903
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:02,193
and I ran into a parked truck.

904
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:04,856
- And here I am.
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

905
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:06,866
It's positively ridiculous.

906
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:10,335
Everybody in the country ought to know
that Dr. L.M. Gilbreth is a woman...

907
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,338
and a very remarkable one.

908
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,567
Lillie, what you need
is some good publicity...

909
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:16,871
- and I'm going to see that you get it.
- How?

910
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:20,402
Well, you remember the day I walked into your
house and told you my name was Sam Harper?

911
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,846
And you said,
"Of Harper Electric?"

912
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,850
- Right?
- Yes.

913
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,512

everything to me.

Oh, I don't mind.
It's quite an experience.

I know. You keep saying that.
But how could that be good publicity?

01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:12,602
I'll tell you. They mentioned your name.
They spelled it correctly.

They used your picture.

with the president of the United States?

Yes. I thought he looked
much funnier than we did...

but nobody laughed at him.

at you or not. They'll remember you.

I should tell her myself.

- Don't make it sound so solemn.
- I'm not.

or something? I wouldn't want you there.

at anything so much in his life.

01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,273
I didn't tell her.

it's such a good idea?

you're just starting practice.

if we wait a while?

No, I don't.

Why do you want to wait?

1009
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,890
I just told you.

1010

No, you didn't tell me.

This afternoon you weren't
worried about the two of us...

facing the world together.

1013
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,959
There's obviously another reason.

1014
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:15,763
- All right, then. It isn't fair to them.
- To whom?

1015
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,468
To Mother and everyone else
in the family.

1016
01:08:18,543 --> 01:08:21,671
Oh, Bob, don't you see?
I've had all the best of it.

1017
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:23,976
Now it's Ernestine's turn
to go away to school...

1018
01:08:24,048 --> 01:08:26,278
and someone ought
to help Mother.

1019
01:08:26,351 --> 01:08:28,342
I think I ought to.

1020
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:32,112
I mean, we can be engaged...

1021
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:34,818
but let's not get married for a while.

1022
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,862
- How long a while?
- I don't know.

1023
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:41,057
- A year? Two?
- I don't know!

1024
01:08:48,573 --> 01:08:51,667
I've heard of families like this,
but this is the first time I ever met one.

1025
01:08:51,743 --> 01:08:55,645
- Families like what?
- Oh, they raise the children and then use them.

1026
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:58,648
Never let 'em go. They turn them into
a lot of assistant mothers and fathers...

bringing home the paycheck,
taking care of the younger kids.

My mother isn't like that at all.

1029
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:05,749
Maybe she isn't, but that's the way
it comes out for you and me.

1030
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:09,225
It's wrong, Ann, and if you won't
tell her, I will.

1031
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:11,285
No, Bob, no.

1032
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:15,188
Oh, won't you please wait?

1033
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:17,200
It won't work, Ann.
We're too much in love.

1034
01:09:17,268 --> 01:09:20,499
We should get married now and start
out together. Now, you know that.

1035
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:24,040
So let me tell her.

1036
01:09:24,108 --> 01:09:26,099
I can't.

1037
01:09:27,712 --> 01:09:31,375
Okay. So you can't.

1038
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:33,815
Please, Bob, I love you so.

1039
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:36,080
- Okay, okay, let's forget it.
- Oh, please, Bob.

1040
