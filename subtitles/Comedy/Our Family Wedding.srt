<i>- They derail!
- How about this?</i>

60
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,652
How about we invite your dad

She called me, like, a couple of days ago.</i>

Dad, not at work.

78

<i>Tell Jesse or Ramon.</i>

<i>They called in sick, too. Gout and scurvy.</i>

84
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:10,020
<i>Let me guess.
This is about the health coverage.</i>

85
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:14,061
<i>That's it. Give me the keys to
the other truck. I'll tow the cars myself.</i>

86
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:17,325
<i>All right. you know you don't pedal
with your feet anymore, right?</i>

87
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,399
Times have changed.

88
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,434
<i>And you have always
been my favorite son.</i>

89

messed over by so many men</i>

148
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,009
<i>that they're twisted up like war vets.</i>

149
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:24,551
<i>They wake up in the middle
of the night screaming,</i>

150
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:25,812
<i>trying to choke you in your sleep.</i>

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,821
<i>They get their little tweezers out and
they're stabbing you in the heart, going...</i>

152
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:30,988
<i>"you know you did it.
you know you did it. "</i>

153
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,354
<i>Slow down.</i>

154
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,020
<i>you already hooked me up
with the unmentionable.</i>

155
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,155
<i>- I don't wanna say her name, so...
- Oh, no.</i>

156
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,756
<i>- you begged me to hook you up with...
- Hey.</i>

157
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,857
<i>- Don't...
- If it wasn't for me...</i>

158
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,266
<i>- you know we got a rule.
... setting you up with...</i>

159
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,462
<i>- Do not say that name.
... Cheryl.</i>

160
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:44,833
Oh!

161
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,565
<i>Man, I know.</i>

162
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,836
<i>I'm working on it, I'm working on it.</i>

163
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:55,482
<i>If it wasn't for Cheryl, you wouldn't
have Marcus, and he turned out wonderful.</i>

164
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,178
<i>And that's a surprise,
seeing he was raised by your crazy butt.</i>

165
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,256
<i>Luckily, he had me around
to watch his back.</i>

166
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,923
<i>What would you do if you didn't have me
here to rescue you, huh?</i>

167
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,861
<i>you'd be standing
on the side of the road.</i>

168
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:13,058
<i>All true. See,</i>

169
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:18,527
<i>this way, you're the only woman
I need in my life.</i>

170
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,909
<i>- Oh, God.
- Thanks, babe.</i>

171
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,875
<i>- See you later.
- Bye.</i>

172
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:30,915
<i>- Okay. How do I look?
- you look fine.</i>

173
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:34,450
<i>Hey, you know those cufflinks you
made me, the ones with the little fishes?</i>

174
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:35,545
Mmm-hmm.

175
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:37,818
Do you know where they are?

176
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,752
<i>- Hey, I looked in there.
- Of course you did.</i>

177
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:45,900
<i>I can't wait for you to see the car
for Lucia's graduation gift.</i>

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,491
<i>It's the best work I've ever done.</i>

179
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,935
Hey. Reservation for Boyd.

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,812
- Just a moment.
- Okay, thanks.

181
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,045
<i>So, we're gonna tell them
everything, right?</i>

182
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,786
<i>- Babe?
- yes.</i>

183
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,348
<i>Good. Now, show the twins a little bit.
Come on.</i>

184
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,451
<i>All right, that's gross.</i>

185
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,093
<i>- Hi, Izzy.
- Hi.</i>

186
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,790
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

187
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,465
<i>Iz, this is Marcus.
Marcus, this is my sister, Isabel.</i>

188
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,902
<i>- Hey.
- you look better than your picture.</i>

189
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:27,804
<i>- I like your face.
- Thanks, and you...</i>

190
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,343
<i>And your fingernails
are nice and manicured. It's nice.</i>

191
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,037
<i>- Okay, enough.
- Cute.</i>

192
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:34,376
<i>Can you give us one real quick,
just a minute?</i>

193
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:35,710
<i>yeah.</i>

194
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,182
<i>What?
- Have you told Dad about him yet?</i>

195
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,721
<i>- No, that's why we're here.
- This is gonna be so good.</i>

196
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,656
<i>- Mom! Hi!
- Oh, my God! Look at you!</i>

197
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,388
<i>- Mi hija, you are so grown up!
No, she's not!</i>

198
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,522
<i>I missed you so much.
you look great, sweetheart.</i>

199
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,123
<i>Excuse me, sir,
we're having a family moment here...</i>

200
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:56,897
Dad. Mom. This is Marcus.

201
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,001
Hey.

202
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,734
Oh. Oh!

203
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,969
Oh, this is Marcus?

204
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,238
<i>- you know about a Marcus?
- I...</i>

205
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:08,907
<i>Mrs. Ramirez, it's a pleasure to meet you.</i>

206
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,417
<i>Thank you. Call me Sonia.</i>

207
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,646
<i>And this is my dad, Miguel.</i>

208
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,320
<i>Call me Mr. Ramirez.</i>

209
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,221
<i>Sir, I've heard so much about you.</i>

210
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,159
<i>I can't say the same.</i>

211
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,291
<i>- I missed you.
- your table is ready.</i>

212
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,867
<i>- Oh, good.
- Good.</i>

213
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,367
<i>- Are you hungry?
Marcus.</i>

214
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:30,164
<i>- We should eat something.
- yeah.</i>

215
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,738
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

216
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,774
<i>Look, honey, I need to call and
see what's taking my dad so long.</i>

217
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:37,003
<i>- I'll meet you.
Okay.</i>

218
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,118
<i>- There he is. What's up, Pops?
- Hey.</i>

219
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,288
Oh.

220
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:49,856
<i>- I missed you. you look good.
- you do, too.</i>

221
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,287
Thanks.

222
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:54,188
Hey!

223
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,961
<i>Oh. Miguel, we left the wine in the car.</i>

224
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:04,071
<i>Miguel. Wine. In the car. Go.</i>

225
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:06,440
Oh.

226
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,941
<i>I'm sorry. I'll be right black.</i>

227
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,205
<i>I didn't know her folks were coming.</i>

228
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:16,249
<i>yeah, I just figured
you would bring Angela.</i>

229
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,285
<i>I thought this was a date thing,
not a family thing.</i>

230
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,946
<i>Lucia, this is my father,
Bradford Boyd.</i>

231
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:24,354
- Brad.
- Hi, so nice to meet you.

232
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,917
<i>So you're the one that
my son keeps talking so much about.</i>

233
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:30,520
<i>- This is my sister, Isabel.
- Izzy.</i>

234
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,558
Okay.

235
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,693
<i>- And my mother, Sonia.
- Hi. Thank you.</i>

236
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:36,770
<i>Where's your dad?</i>

237
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:37,860
<i>He went to the car
to get some wine.</i>

238
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:38,939
Hi.

239
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,803
<i>- Ashley?
- Lucy?</i>

240
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:42,102
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

241
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,700
<i>What the heck?</i>

242
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,039
- Hi!
- Hi!

243
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:47,637
<i>- How long has it been?
- I don't know, like, seven years.</i>

244
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,217
<i>Mom, you remember Ashley.
We played softball together.</i>

245
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:52,343
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>- What are you doing here?
- I'm with Brad.</i>

247
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,323
<i>you are?</i>

248
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,721
<i>yes, I am.</i>

249
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:01,987
<i>Whoa. My phone is buzzing.</i>

250
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:05,258
Wow. Can you give me a...
Excuse me for a second.

251
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,799
Okay, baby.

252
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,630
<i>Well, this is just... I mean, this is beautiful.</i>

253
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:10,499
<i>- Let's sit.
- Okay.</i>

254
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:15,269
<i>yes.</i>

255
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,834
<i>I was saving this
for a very special occasion,</i>

256
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,971
<i>but I guess this will do.</i>

257
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:25,642
<i>Hey, Dad, you remember Ashley, right?
From Lucia's softball team.</i>

258
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:29,314
<i>- yeah. Catcher, right?
- yeah, that's good. Good.</i>

259
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:31,016
<i>- Good memory.
- So Lucia invited you, too?</i>

260
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,152
<i>Actually, Daddy, she's here
with Marcus' father. His date.</i>

261
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,925
- 'Cause they're dating. Each other.
- He gets it.

262
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,897
Okay, you just missed him.

263
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,501
<i>Waiter, I need this bottle opened now.</i>

264
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:45,970
<i>- Not a problem, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

265
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:49,906
<i>And this is Marcus' father, Brad.</i>

266
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,876
<i>you? you towed my car!</i>

267
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,037
<i>There was a sign. you can't read?</i>

268
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,546
<i>I graduated USC magna cum laude.</i>

269
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:55,877
<i>- Marcus, do something.
Keep your voice down.</i>

270
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,110
<i>Brother.
- "Brother"? I'm not your brother, hombre.</i>

271
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,208
<i>- '"Hombre, '"really?
- Dad.</i>

272
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,480
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Dad!

273
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,953
<i>- What is wrong with you people?
- "you people"?</i>

274
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:03,182
<i>This is not the place!</i>

275
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,588
<i>you wanna say it, don't you?
Go ahead and say it.</i>

276
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,785
<i>Embarrass yourself in front of
your daughter. Go ahead and say it.</i>

277
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:08,555
- Say the word.
- He's a jerk.

278
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:10,688
<i>- Look, Dad.
- yes.</i>

279
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:11,856
What's going on?

280
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,093
How do you even know each other?

281
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:15,294
<i>He parked in a "No Parking" zone.</i>

282
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,461
<i>He towed my car.
I had my hand on the knob.</i>

283
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,368
Hand on the knob!
How many times have we heard...

284
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:19,497
<i>This is not the place.</i>

285
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,938
Hey! Hey!

286
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:25,969
<i>Okay. Let's just calm down
and have a seat. Please.</i>

287
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,381
<i>Please.</i>

288
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,954
<i>- Please.

289
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:37,114
<i>No. you first.</i>

290
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,920
Oh, no, no, no, you first.

291
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:41,051
<i>- No, no, no, I insist.
- What?</i>

292
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,722
<i>Oh, God. I insist, please!</i>

293
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,560
<i>- No, you...
- Boys.</i>

294
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,593
Sit.

295
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,663
Of course.

296
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:59,936
<i>- Pop.
- Just straightening my tie.</i>

297
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:09,423
<i>you know what I think?
I think it's amazing.</i>

298
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:12,721
<i>I think that your dad towed his car,</i>

299
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:15,387
and your dad thinks
her dad said something racist,

300
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,259
and you're here with me.

301
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:21,096
<i>I just think this is meant to be.
I think it's absolutely incredible.</i>

302
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:25,070
<i>And it just connects all of us, it's...
I think this is fate.</i>

303
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:30,339
<i>Wow. you know
you just said that out loud.</i>

304
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,304
<i>Okay. Let's start this night over.</i>

305
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:38,181
<i>We can sit and have a lovely dinner
and enjoy getting to know each other.</i>

306
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,753
<i>That's the point of this whole thing, right?</i>

307
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,288
<i>Actually, the point of all this
is to let you know that... Ow! Ow!</i>

308
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,982
We're hungry.

309
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,718
<i>- Let's eat.
- yeah.</i>

310
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:49,126
<i>I hear the gnocchi's
really good here.</i>

311
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,563
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking at my menu.</i>

312
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,124
We're getting married.

313
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:56,760
- What?
- What?

314
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>- What?
- yep.</i>

315
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,473
We are.

316
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:05,205
<i>yay.</i>

317
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,279
So sweet.

318
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,516
<i>Marcus is volunteering
for Doctors Without Borders for a year,</i>

319
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:17,147
<i>and he leaves in three weeks.</i>

320
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:20,625
<i>So we wanted to do it before that,
before he leaves to Laos.</i>

321
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:23,424
<i>Laos? Like Los Angeles? Las Vegas?</i>

322
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,330
<i>Just Laos. Daddy, it's near Thailand.</i>

323
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,335
Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:35,872
<i>What's the rush? I mean, unless there's
something that you two need to tell us...</i>

325
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,945
<i>- Oh, God, you're pregnant!
- Lucia!</i>

326
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:40,070
<i>No. What? No! No! Dad.</i>

327
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:41,409
<i>No, no, no.</i>

328
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,412
<i>I'm not pregnant.</i>

329
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,284
<i>That would be impossible.</i>

330
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,516
<i>Okay.</i>

331
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,922
<i>Impossible?</i>

332
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:52,993
Mmm-hmm.

333
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:54,356
<i>- Impossible's good.
- Good.</i>

334
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:55,622
<i>Impossible's good! It's good!</i>

335
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,788
<i>BOyD: Impossible's good.
That's a good thing.</i>

336
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,126
Very proud of you.

337
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:02,498
<i>We know this may all seem rushed,
but it just felt right, you know?</i>

338
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,234
<i>I couldn't leave without her.</i>

339
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:11,104
<i>And I can't just let him
leave without me, so...</i>

340
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,206
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
you're going with him to Sri Lanka?</i>

341
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,408
<i>Laos. It's near Thailand.</i>

342
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,283
<i>What about...
What about your law degree?</i>

343
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,616
<i>Well,</i>

344
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:29,127
<i>it's not gonna affect it at all.
I checked. I did the research.</i>

345
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,532
<i>Foreign exchange law classes
at the University of Laos?</i>

346
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,295
<i>- Is there even a University of Laos?
- yes, I checked.</i>

347
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:39,532
Baby.

348
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,101
Bye.

349
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,340
<i>What, you couldn't get the tow truck
down here fast enough to tow it?</i>

350
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,849
Hey, Brad. Watch your head.

351
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,956
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

352
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

353
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,849
<i>you'll be hearing from my lawyer.</i>

354
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,231
<i>I just don't like lying.</i>

355
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:10,998
<i>Look, I promise, when things calm down,
I will tell them.</i>

356
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,643
<i>I'll see you at home.</i>

357
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,812
<i>Hello, mi hija.</i>

358
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:32,014
<i>Are you okay?</i>

359
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,326
<i>yeah. I'm great.</i>

360
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,227
<i>After the way Dad acted.</i>

361
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:41,131
<i>you just surprised him, that's all.
Just give him a little time.</i>

362
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,896
<i>Marcus is a really good guy, Mom.</i>

363
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,198
Mmm-hmm.

364
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:50,501
<i>He wants to do really good things
in this world.</i>

365
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,948
<i>And what do you want?</i>

366
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,278
<i>I want the same thing.</i>

367
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,685
<i>Then you're lucky.</i>

368
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,153
<i>Good morning.</i>

369
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:12,994
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning, angel, hey.</i>

370
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,260
<i>Is Marcus still coming?</i>

371
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,858
<i>- yep.
- Good.</i>

372
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,937
Hi, Mama.

373
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:23,443
Come here, come here.

374
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:24,806
<i>Let me see.</i>

375
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:31,175
Oh, my goodness, you make me so happy.

376
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,446
<i>Just wait till you meet him.</i>

377
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:38,122
<i>I made you your favorite breakfast,
chorizito con huevos.</i>

378
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,159
<i>Gotta fatten you up for your babies.</i>

379
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,355
<i>- you look about ready, gordita.
- Shut up, flaca.</i>

380
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,765
<i>Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!
- Watch it.</i>

381
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:51,034
<i>Isabel, again no makeup.</i>

382
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,606
<i>- How do you expect to find a husband?
- I'm not looking.</i>

383
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:56,938
<i>- you wanna stay a spinister all your life?
Spinster.</i>

384
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:58,978
Sounds better than being trapped
by some guy

385
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,776
<i>who expects me to cook
and clean and have babies</i>

386
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,406
<i>while he sits around getting fat.</i>

387
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:05,007
<i>Not you, Dad.</i>

388
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:10,018
<i>What's the rush?
At the age you're at right now,</i>

389
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,025
<i>you supposed to be lining them up
like bowling pins and knocking them over.</i>

390
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,652
<i>- Look here. Congratulations, all right?
- Thank you.</i>

391
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,060
<i>Do not listen to these fools.</i>

392
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:20,964
<i>Marriage, it's a beautiful thing.</i>

393
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,695
<i>I mean, once you find that combination</i>

394
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,328
- between trust and commitment...
Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:28,340
<i>...it's like the doors just fly open...
- Just beautiful.</i>

396
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:31,002
<i>Trusting thing. Loving thing.</i>

397
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,171
<i>you know how much
his woman trusts him?</i>

398
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,013
<i>Lauryn call him every 10 minutes.
That's how much she trusts him.</i>

399
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,219
<i>Well, looky, looky.</i>

400
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:42,584
<i>BOyD: Greg, just go ahead
and answer it, okay?</i>

401
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,385
<i>We're cool. We're just gonna wait.
We're cool.</i>

402
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:45,584
<i>No, I don't need to.</i>

403
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,126
<i>Don't move it away. Come on, man.
The phone's got GPS.</i>

404
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,320
<i>It's cool. We don't have a problem with it.</i>

405
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,590
<i>- Pick it up. Go ahead.
- Don't try to act tough for us.</i>

406
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,325
<i>- I'm not trying to act tough.
Okay, okay.</i>

407
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,162
<i>Go ahead. It's really, really, really...</i>

408
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:56,429
<i>Don't tell me to answer.
I won't answer the phone.</i>

409
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,971
<i>I don't need to answer the phone.</i>

410
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:02,500
<i>you see? There. Phone stopped ringing.</i>

411
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,475
<i>Did I answer it? No. Why?</i>

412
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:07,172
<i>Because that's how I...</i>

413
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,183
<i>That's how I get down.</i>

414
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,479
<i>"Get down"?
- Okay?</i>

415
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:15,680
<i>Now as I was saying,
when two people come...</i>

416
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:20,724
<i>- Great.
- Look, answer the phone, man,</i>

417
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:22,056
<i>because she's just gonna put you
on lockdown,</i>

418
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,152
it's gonna mess up our nights.

419
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:24,925
<i>No, we don't have lockdown
in my household.</i>

420
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:26,761
<i>They have marital Guantanamo.</i>

421
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,732
<i>Look. So she checks up on me
every once in a while?</i>

422
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:29,825
<i>Ankle bracelet.</i>

423
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:32,735
<i>So what? you know what I get in return?</i>

424
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,105
<i>Sex on the regular. It is so nice. Sex...</i>

425
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,337
<i>When was the last time
you had sex on the regular?</i>

426
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,208
<i>- Sex on the regular?
- On the regular.</i>

427
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:44,944
<i>Ain't all about quantity.
It's all about quality.</i>

428
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:48,818
<i>Well, just because you pay for it
doesn't make it quality.</i>

429
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:51,916
<i>I'm killing them today.</i>

430
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:54,893
<i>y'all can laugh all y'all want, man.
Ain't no shame in my game, baby.</i>

431
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:56,895
<i>- Brad, you know how I get down.
- I do.</i>

432
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:58,897
<i>- And my girl, Peaches...
- Peaches is a...</i>

433
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,694
<i>She is a professional.</i>

434
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:03,461
<i>- Peaches.
- If you don't pick that phone up,</i>

435
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,664
<i>you're gonna be asking me
for Peaches' phone number.</i>

436
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,638
Okay, so what happens
if you don't answer it?

437
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,641
<i>What?
What happens... What?</i>

438
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:10,937
<i>If you don't pick it up?</i>

439
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,843
<i>- Well, nothing happens.
- Five, four...</i>

440
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,508
<i>- I'm a man, that's what happens.
... three...</i>

441
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,744
<i>- It means she steps off.
- Two...</i>

442
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:21,286
<i>She knows. She knows who wears
the pants in this relationship.</i>

443
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:22,514
One...

444
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:25,990
<i>Oh, you must have forgotten
what happened in Cancun last year.</i>

445
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:29,187
<i>- Hey, honeypie. What's up?
- "Hey, honeypie. "</i>

446
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:30,957
<i>No, we weren't talking about you. No.</i>

447
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:34,034
What's that song that Babyface made
a few years ago?

448
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,465
<i>I'm not talking in my high voice.</i>

449
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,964
<i>you know, I'm just happy to hear from you.</i>

450
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,237
Hey.

451
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,176
<i>Guys, give him a break.</i>

452
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,217
<i>They're clowning me.
No, they didn't call you a clown.</i>

453
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,751
<i>you see that, right? That could be you.</i>

454
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:05,025
<i>- No. No, Lucia's not like that.
- Not yet.</i>

455
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:07,191
<i>you don't really know what she's like.</i>

456
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:09,895
<i>Wait, where's all this coming from?
I thought you liked her.</i>

457
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,733
<i>you saw her dad.</i>

458
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,872
<i>you saw her family.</i>

459
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,805
<i>Are you just tripping
'cause she's not black?</i>

460
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:19,470
<i>All I'm saying is that
you don't know the deal</i>

461
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,673
<i>until you say, "I do. "</i>

462
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:25,013
<i>And that ring on your finger,
that's about the realness.</i>

463
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:28,612
<i>I wanna make sure that
you're doing it at the right time</i>

464
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:31,282
and that you're not rushing things.

465
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:33,792
<i>Love can't tell time. I gotta go.</i>

466
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:34,883
Where you going?

467
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,860
<i>Pop, I already told you.
I'm meeting her family for brunch.</i>

468
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:39,990
<i>I miss her, I can't wait to see her. All right.</i>

469
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,192
There goes another one.

470
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,398
<i>you scared him away.</i>

471
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:53,039
<i>you're scaring the white people.</i>

472
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:00,643
- Hey.
- Hey.

473
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,545
Ready?

474
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:04,624
<i>- yeah. you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

475
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,056
<i>All right.</i>

476
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,997
<i>- Abuela.
- yeah?</i>

477
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:15,762
This is Marcus.

478
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:18,499
Ma'am...

479
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:21,101
<i>- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?</i>

480
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:24,574
<i>- I'm just trying to help.
Get up.</i>

481
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:27,607
Come on.

482
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:29,981
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

483
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,451
<i>- Marcus.
- Mr. Ramirez.</i>

484
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:37,286
<i>Hey, I'm headed off to the store
to get some eggs. Why don't you join me?</i>

485
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:39,859
<i>Miguel, we have plenty of eggs.
- Sure.</i>

486
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,689
<i>No. One can never have too many eggs.</i>

487
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:51,131
<i>- Mr. Ramirez, I know we just met...
- Miguel. Miguel.</i>

488
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:53,502
<i>It's Miguel. Call me Miguel.</i>

489
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,009
<i>- Miguel, weren't you...
- No.</i>

490
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,204
<i>No. Mr. Ramirez.</i>

491
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:04,181
<i>Mr. Ramirez,
weren't you and Mrs. Ramirez young</i>

492
00:26:04,284 --> 00:26:05,251
when you got married?

493
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:09,413
<i>yeah, we were, but I was respectful.
I talked to her father first,</i>

494
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,923
<i>so he could get to know
the measure of the man I am.</i>

495
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:12,992
Oh.

496
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:16,460
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't even think about that.</i>

497
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:21,323
<i>- Do people still do that?
- If they value family.</i>

498
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,564
<i>I do.</i>

499
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,400
<i>I do, absolutely, sir. Absolutely.</i>

500
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,265
That's good to hear.

501
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:33,403
<i>I'm sure you and your wife would enjoy
time to get to know me a little better.</i>

502
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:35,448
<i>I wish there was a way
to accelerate the process</i>

503
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,143
of getting to know someone, you know?

504
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:39,617
<i>yeah.</i>

505
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,751
There's the grocery store.

506
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:51,989
<i>It's like you were saying, a really quick
and easy way to find out who you are.</i>

507
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:55,125
<i>It's pretty simple. All you gotta do
is put your thumb on that scanner pad,</i>

508
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:57,100
- and that's it. Right, Turman?
- That's right.

509
00:26:57,204 --> 00:27:02,437
<i>I'm gonna run your prints for the basics,
prison record, warrants, sexual offenses...</i>

510
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:04,838
<i>Come on, really?</i>

511
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,208
<i>Really?</i>

512
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>Ramirez Towing is one
of LAPD's biggest vendors, so...</i>

513
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:12,782
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

514
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:15,448
<i>you know, if I loved someone
as much as you say you love her,</i>

515
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:17,615
<i>and I had nothing to hide, I would do it.</i>

516
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:21,524
<i>I've got nothing to hide.
So for me, personally, it's easy.</i>

517
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:25,196
See that?

518
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,025
<i>you know what? you're right.
Whatever it takes to win you over.</i>

519
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:32,229
<i>Oh! Slow your roll
before you lose your soul.</i>

520
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,068
<i>Let me walk you through it.</i>

521
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,844
Step back.

522
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,148
<i>you're done.</i>

523
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:45,812
<i>Laos? you know,
there's a lot of sick kids in America.</i>

524
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,886
<i>Why don't you help them?</i>

525
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,545
<i>Look, I know healthcare sucks for our poor,</i>

526
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,089
<i>but there are places in the world
where kids have no access to medical care.</i>

527
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,556
<i>Whoa. Hello. Guys, we got a problem.</i>

528
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:59,189
<i>There's a warrant for your arrest for failure
to appear on a public nudity charge.</i>

529
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,288
<i>- Bill!
yeah.</i>

530
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,424
We got us a perv.

531
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:02,763
That's disgusting.

532
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,364
<i>Miguel, I'm talking about you.
you got an outstanding warrant from 1984.</i>

533
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:10,466
<i>What? No! No!</i>

534
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:14,308
<i>I was 19. We were having fun,
and we were drunk and...</i>

535
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:17,042
<i>I mean, no, no, no. We were not drunk,
'cause that would be illegal.</i>

536
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,483
<i>- We were high... No! We were not high!
- I'd stop talking if I was you.</i>

537
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:22,350
<i>Okay. I'm not talking.</i>

538
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,650
Wow.

539
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,860
<i>- I'm good, right?
- For now.</i>

540
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,588
<i>Hey, man, have a great time in Laos.</i>

541
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:33,063
<i>- Thanks.
- yeah.</i>

542
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:43,036
<i>Miguel, please do not ruin this for her.</i>

543
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:48,713
<i>He is in love and he wants to get married.
What's wrong with that?</i>

544
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:51,409
<i>Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.</i>

545
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,748
<i>- Look at us.
- Look at us.</i>

546
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:57,790
Just because our marriages didn't work,
that doesn't make marriage a bad thing.

547
00:28:57,891 --> 00:28:58,880
Oh.

548
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:02,758
<i>So are you saying that
you'd actually like to do it again?</i>

549
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:05,532
<i>I don't know.</i>

550
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:08,567
Come on. Why are you trying...

551
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,194
<i>you are crazy. you know that?</i>

552
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,570
<i>I'm not crazy. I just like things
to make sense. Is that okay?</i>

553
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,508
<i>Well, life doesn't always
make sense, Bradford.</i>

554
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:22,173
<i>And love doesn't always make sense.
I don't think that's such a bad thing.</i>

555
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,085
<i>Wow, Angie. That is so deep.</i>

556
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:35,127
<i>I'm so happy that you followed me to
Los Angeles for that little tidbit of advice.</i>

557
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:37,059
<i>"Followed you"? Don't flatter yourself.</i>

558
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:39,995
<i>'Cause I needed somebody
to be here and school me.</i>

559
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,657
<i>Do a little step for me.</i>

560
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:42,960
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,971
<i>Am I gonna have lots of fun.</i>

562
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,171
<i>Are you trying to touch my booty?</i>

563
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,936
<i>I did? Is that your butt?</i>

564
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,410
<i>All right, I'll be back.</i>

565
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:54,741
- Oh, oh!
- Stop!

566
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:04,950
<i>I took care of your suspension.
I brought it in on the flatbed.</i>

567
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:07,526
<i>I even fixed the little knob there
on the gear shift.</i>

568
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,425
<i>It was kind of tricky on the '65,</i>

569
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:12,862
- but on the '66, they fixed them.
- But on the '66, they fixed them.

570
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,860
Wow.

571
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:17,562
<i>- Thank you.
- you're welcome.</i>

572
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,101
<i>- Is that a scratch?
- What?</i>

573
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:24,734
- There's a scratch right here on my hood.
- There's no scratch.

574
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:26,745
There was no scratch on my hood
before you towed it.

575
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,576
<i>- you're saying I scratched your car?
- you scratched my car!</i>

576
00:30:28,682 --> 00:30:29,808
<i>I did not scratch your car!
How would I scratch</i>

577
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,383
<i>- the top of your car?
- Were you trying to slip it by me?</i>

578
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,544
<i>- I was underneath the car.
- What is wrong with you?</i>

579
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:36,680
<i>Wait, wait. Pop! Pop! Pop!
There's nothing there.</i>

580
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,088
<i>Look, it's a smudge. Look. See?</i>

581
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:42,889
- See, there's no scratch.
- There's no scratch.

582
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:44,725
There's no scratch, sweetheart.
There's no scratch.

583
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,129
<i>Look, why don't we just all go inside
and relax?</i>

584
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,862
<i>- I need to use your bathroom.
- Sorry.</i>

585
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:53,768
<i>But the guest bathroom, I'm renovating it.</i>

586
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:58,243
<i>you might have to hold it
till you get home.</i>

587
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:00,870
<i>And that's the only bathroom you have
in your whole house?</i>

588
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:02,676
That guests get to use, yes.

589
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:06,219
<i>Mr. Ramirez, I'll show you the bathroom.
It's upstairs to the left.</i>

590
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:11,650
<i>I guess a few years after him, I moved
here to practice entertainment law.</i>

591
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,350
<i>Angela's like my aunt.</i>

592
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,621
<i>Well, more than my aunt.
She helped raise me.</i>

593
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:18,594
Okay.

594
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,111
What?

595
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:42,046
Mmm.

596
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,488
<i>Really?</i>

597
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:04,868
So your mother is where?

598
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:08,105
We were divorced when he was five.

599
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:10,877
<i>I fought for custody, and I got it.</i>

600
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,315
She didn't fight back.

601
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:26,725
<i>yes.</i>

602
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,711
Come on. Come on!

603
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:42,442
Stop!

604
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,241
Oh.

605
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:54,191
<i>All righty. So, we were thinking
March 3rd for the wedding.</i>

606
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:57,759
<i>It's in two weeks. Nothing big. Easy.</i>

607
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:02,929
<i>yeah, we wanted to do something small,
just the people in this room and her sister.</i>

608
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,128
<i>yeah,
Izzy would be there, of course.</i>

609
00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:05,670
<i>No.</i>

610
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:07,501
<i>No?
- No, no, no.</i>

611
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:08,904
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

612
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,308
<i>- What do you mean, "no"?
- No. I mean, no.</i>

613
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,480
<i>It should be something special. Like, it
should be a traditional Mexican wedding.</i>

614
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,514
Too badwe're just one mexican short.

615
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:20,608
Here we go.

616
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,984
<i>No disrespect, Mrs. Ramirez,</i>

617
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,818
<i>but I think that both the cultures
have to be represented.</i>

618
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:29,453
<i>I mean, we have a lot of
African-American wedding traditions</i>

619
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:31,827
<i>that are great and we should explore them.</i>

620
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,930
<i>Like what?</i>

621
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:42,899
<i>I can't believe you forgot, Angie.
you know, jumping the broom.</i>

622
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:44,465
<i>- One.
- We could do that.</i>

623
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:46,546
<i>- yeah. yeah.
That's fun.</i>

624
00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:50,138
<i>Dancing. We like to do the electric slide
when we...</i>

625
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,309
<i>- No.
... actually have our weddings.</i>

626
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:53,852
<i>I like. That's a nice one.</i>

627
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:56,889
<i>you must have your dance routines.</i>

628
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,892
<i>your merengues, your salsas,
your Macarenas.</i>

629
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:03,686
<i>And singing.</i>

630
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:10,167
<i>We like to do the negro song.
The national black song.</i>

631
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:13,138
<i>The Negro National Anthem.</i>

632
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:15,263
<i>you know the song.</i>

633
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:18,567
<i>Lift every voice and sing</i>

634
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:19,702
<i>- Marcus.
- No.</i>

635
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:21,644
<i>Till earth and heaven ring</i>

636
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,289
<i>Ring with the...</i>

637
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,858
<i>- Stop.
- Pop.</i>

638
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:39,088
<i>Let our rejoicing rise</i>

639
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,826
<i>Dad!
- Brad!</i>

640
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,697
- Dad! Hey!
- Can you stop?

641
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,599
<i>- Tell him to stop, too.
Pop!</i>

642
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:47,373
Brad, come on!

643
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,839
<i>Dad.
Pop.</i>

644
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,603
<i>- Hey.
- Will you stop?</i>

645
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,946
Stop. Stop.

646
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:55,603
Stop.

647
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:57,305
<i>Dad.</i>

648
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,109
Stop.

649
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:04,447
<i>Cool.</i>

650
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:09,360
<i>Look, I think that we could incorporate
all of these things.</i>

651
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:12,994
<i>We can think about making the wedding
a little bigger.</i>

652
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,691
<i>No. No, we can't afford that.</i>

653
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:25,567
<i>She's saying that in the Mexican tradition,
the padrinos, or the godparents basically,</i>

654
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,705
pay for the wedding.
But since there are none, in this case,

655
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:32,581
that it's up to the father of the groom
to pay for the wedding.

656
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:37,288
- That's tradition.
- Mmm.

657
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:42,324
<i>you got to be joking.</i>

658
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:45,689
<i>I'm sorry, but I just...</i>

659
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,234
<i>Look, if it's too hard to handle... I mean,
if you don't have the money, I understand.</i>

660
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,202
Just try to be a man about it.

661
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,772
<i>- Excuse me?
- No, not "excuse me. "</i>

662
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:56,034
<i>Say, "I'm cheap. Can't do it. "</i>

663
00:35:56,743 --> 00:36:02,113
<i>Fine, it's handled. I'll pay for it.
Don't worry, it will be big and Mexican.</i>

664
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:05,979
<i>We'll have my cousins come over.
They're gonna speak Spanish.</i>

665
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,179
<i>you know, the ones that act so Mexican
they embarrass us.</i>

666
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:12,657
<i>Wait. We have two families,
the simplest thing is to split the cost.</i>

667
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,920
<i>Okay, hello. Hey.</i>

668
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:18,156
<i>What about us? It's our wedding.
What about what we want?</i>

669
00:36:18,264 --> 00:36:21,131
Four words.
"Our marriage, their wedding. "

670
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:25,269
<i>- But I'm just saying that...
- Repeat after me, "Our marriage... "</i>

671
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:28,972
- Our marriage.
- Our marriage.

672
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:30,542
"... their wedding. "

673
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:32,445
- Their wedding.
- Their wedding.

674
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:35,446
<i>Great. So, I suggest we go with a DJ
instead of a band.</i>

675
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:37,180
<i>Oh, we could save money on that.</i>

676
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:39,615
<i>I got a crate-full of
Tower of Power records.</i>

677
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,209
Dad.

678
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:43,687
<i>- I'll handle the DJ.
- That's a good idea.</i>

679
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,621
<i>Okay, that still leaves the venue.</i>

680
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,454
Why don't we just have it here?

681
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,118
<i>- BOyD: What?
- yes!</i>

682
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,321
<i>yes.
BOyD: No, no, no, no.</i>

683
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,127
<i>No, that's a great idea. This place is
perfect for a small wedding and reception.</i>

684
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,099
<i>yeah, and we can set the tables
on the lawn,</i>

685
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:58,966
<i>and we can float candles in the pool.</i>

686
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:00,334
<i>And release doves.</i>

687
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,839
- Oh.
- Doves?

688
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:05,011
Do you know that
there's acid in dove droppings?

689
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,079
<i>Do you know what that does
to wooden lawn furniture?</i>

690
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,477
<i>It puts little, bitty spots
all over the furniture.</i>

691
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:10,048
<i>Dad, I know how you care about the crib,</i>

692
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,983
<i>but it would mean a lot to us
to have the wedding here.</i>

693
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,480
<i>No doves.</i>

694
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,285
<i>No doves, all right.</i>

695
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,563
<i>Mom, I like these.</i>

696
00:37:31,538 --> 00:37:33,199
<i>Iz, which ones do you like more?</i>

697
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:37,205
<i>- Hello?
- Helpful.</i>

698
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:41,005
<i>What? Watch it, man.
you're gonna break the door.</i>

699
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:43,810
<i>I'm sorry, man.
I think I got the address wrong.</i>

700
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,411
Do you know which house is Brad Boyd's?

701
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,180
<i>I'm Brad Boyd. This is my house.</i>

702
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:49,948
<i>Are you sure?</i>

703
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:51,885
<i>yeah, last time I checked.</i>

704
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,685
<i>I supposed to build an altar
for Lucia's wedding.</i>

705
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,057
<i>Are you sure it's your house?</i>

706
00:37:57,163 --> 00:37:59,188
<i>What? What? It can't be my house?</i>

707
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:01,267
<i>What... What are you trying to say?
Go ahead and say it.</i>

708
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,334
<i>Nothing, bro.</i>

709
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:03,959
<i>Oh! I get it.</i>

710
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:09,507
<i>I was in a really serene place.
I was doing my morning meditations.</i>

711
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,543
<i>I'm sitting out here.
you got people running all over my house.</i>

712
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,373
<i>My uncle Manny
works construction during the week.</i>

713
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,812
<i>So if we want it for free,
it's gonna be on his off hours.</i>

714
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:18,179
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.</i>

715
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:21,185
<i>That vase, that's a Bauer.
It's very expensive.</i>

716
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,182
<i>I can't believe it. This is ridiculous...</i>

717
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

718
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:33,525
<i>Sonia, thanks for
this wonderful seating board.</i>

719
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:35,692
<i>Schematic. A seating schematic.</i>

720
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:39,294
<i>All right. Well, trust me when I say
the seating schematic</i>

721
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:43,205
<i>is the most important and complicated
aspect of this process.</i>

722
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:45,004
<i>How we arrange these tables</i>

723
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:48,808
<i>can be the difference between
a day to cherish and a hellish oblivion.</i>

724
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:50,849
<i>- Good.
- BOyD: Okay. I'll start.</i>

725
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,546
<i>I put my mom, my brother, his wife,</i>

726
00:38:55,655 --> 00:39:00,149
my two nephews, my dad and step mom

727
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,955
<i>from St. Louis at Table Number 3.</i>

728
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:07,055
<i>Oh. Hey, Earlene.
you still screwing my husband?</i>

729
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,032
<i>- I'm not your husband, woman.
- yes, you are.</i>

730
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:12,593
<i>We never got a divorce.
We're just legally separated.</i>

731
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:13,967
<i>you never got a divorce?</i>

732
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:17,236
<i>Baby, it's been 35 years. I think there's
a statute of limitations or something.</i>

733
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,607
<i>- you never got a divorce?
- Alzheimer's.</i>

734
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:22,806
<i>- you lied to me.
- Oh, my God.</i>

735
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,749
<i>Still the other woman.
How does it feel?</i>

736
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,977
<i>I'll show you how it feels!</i>

737
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:30,750
<i>Told you it's gonna be tricky.</i>

738
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:34,384
<i>How about we put your mom
and your nephews at Table 9?</i>

739
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:38,125
<i>BOyD: My brother, he's a big mama's boy.
He can't be far away from my mom.</i>

740
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,791
Mama. Mama!

741
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,268
<i>- What are you calling your mother for?
- Mama.</i>

742
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:48,766
<i>Sonia, why don't you put your
Aunt Rosita and Uncle Juan at Table 6,</i>

743
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,775
<i>and, Brad, you can put your mom
and the kids there as well.</i>

744
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:57,705
<i>Oh, you must be
with the black groom's family.</i>

745
00:39:57,817 --> 00:40:00,445
<i>I know this because you are black.</i>

746
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:10,787
Oh! What was that?

747
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:13,627
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no. you cannot sit
Cousin Jaime near any women.</i>

748
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:17,833
<i>Oh. Well, in that case, can we move
my friends next to Marcus' frat brothers?</i>

749
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:18,926
<i>Mmm.</i>

750
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,903
<i>My boys get a little rowdy
when they drink.</i>

751
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:22,702
<i>So do my girls.</i>

752
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,775
Okay. What about Raymond?

753
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,143
<i>I thought he was in prison.</i>

754
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,478
<i>Paroled last month.</i>

755
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,421
<i>What the fuck you looking at, holmes?</i>

756
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,379
Mom!

757
00:40:38,491 --> 00:40:39,617
<i>Table 8, Table 8.</i>

758
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:41,023
<i>yeah, the officers from Rampart.</i>

759
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:42,560
<i>yeah. That's good, that's good.</i>

760
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,869
<i>What about Marcus' mom? your ex?</i>

761
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:03,712
What?

762
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:07,310
Okay.

763
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:13,224
<i>- Oh, my.
This way, ladies.</i>

764
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:14,884
Okay. Thank you.

765
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:18,694
<i>Ladies, welcome.</i>

766
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:20,698
<i>Oh, my God. Lucia, look at this.</i>

767
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,562
<i>- And look at this one.
- Okay.</i>

768
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,332
<i>Let's begin our journey with a picture.</i>

769
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,566
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

770
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:29,902
<i>Hey, Luce,
I've been meaning to ask you...</i>

771
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,169
<i>Smile for the before.</i>

772
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:33,370
<i>...is it true what they say
about black guys?</i>

773
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:36,675
<i>Why ask a question when you know
the answer, pinche puta?</i>

774
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:42,115
<i>Spanish is such a romantic language.</i>

775
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:44,348
<i>- Isn't it?
- It is.</i>

776
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:47,392
<i>Okay. It's time to pick out some gowns.</i>

777
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,222
<i>Mi hija, look.</i>

778
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:51,489
Magnificent.

779
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:54,699
Maybe.

780
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:56,824
Bravo.

781
00:41:56,936 --> 00:41:58,096
<i>Stay still.</i>

782
00:41:58,838 --> 00:41:59,998
<i>Beautiful.</i>

783
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:08,103
<i>- Look good?
- Very nice.</i>

784
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:10,574
Whoa.

785
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:14,816
Excuse me. Why is his white?

786
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:17,853
He has to be distinctive with the bride.

787
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:20,952
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

788
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:25,156
<i>Sorry, but I'm the father of the groom.</i>

789
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:29,860
<i>I'm distinctive, and I would like to have
a white dinner jacket, as well.</i>

790
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:34,097
<i>you cannot. you have to stay in the black.</i>

791
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:36,675
<i>That's how it's going to be uniform.
Just like that.</i>

792
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,667
Our marriage, their wedding.

793
00:42:41,514 --> 00:42:44,950
<i>Look, Pops, just wear the black tux.
It's classic.</i>

794
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:49,315
<i>What's the matter, Brad?
you don't like black?</i>

795
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:53,716
<i>Black is always classy.</i>

796
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:57,920
<i>you know what they say,
"Once you go black... "</i>

797
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,123
<i>your credit goes bad.</i>

798
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:02,929
What did you say?

799
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:06,127
Come out and enjoy the inauguration of

800
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,037
<i>the most important dress
you will ever wear.</i>

801
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:11,207
Oh.

802
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:14,171
<i>Careful. Take a look.</i>

803
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,020
- Mom?
- What?

804
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,725
What are you doing?

805
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:31,686
<i>- It is so pretty.
- Mom!</i>

806
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:32,765
Oh.

807
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:38,063
<i>I just...
I thought I'd try some things on with you.</i>

808
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:40,071
<i>you know, to save time.</i>

809
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:45,970
Our marriage, their wedding.

810
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:47,204
That's cute.

811
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,741
<i>Izzy, where's your dress?</i>

812
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,282
<i>I wasn't really feeling it.</i>

813
00:43:51,384 --> 00:43:52,749
<i>you weren't feeling it?</i>

814
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:54,877
<i>- Well, did you even try it on?
- Sure.</i>

815
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:56,784
<i>What's wrong with this dress? I like it.</i>

816
00:43:56,889 --> 00:43:58,948
<i>Then you wear it.
Since when do you like pink?</i>

817
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:01,492
<i>It's not pink. It's lavender rose.</i>

818
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:04,529
<i>- yeah, whatever.
- What the hell is your problem, Izzy?</i>

819
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,495
<i>you're supposed to be my maid of honor.</i>

820
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,861
<i>I never asked to be your maid of honor.</i>

821
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:11,198
<i>you're my sister, okay?
That's what sisters do.</i>

822
00:44:11,804 --> 00:44:14,568
<i>I vow to not get married young
like yessenia or Letti...</i>

823
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,266
<i>Always pregnant
or getting pregnant,</i>

824
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,501
never dreaming of anything better.

825
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,874
<i>I know the pact. Okay?</i>

826
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,811
<i>I fell in love.</i>

827
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:24,613
<i>It changes things.</i>

828
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:27,645
But it doesn't change who you are.

829
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:31,446
<i>you don't think Mom told herself that?</i>

830
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:34,322
<i>- Do you think she's happy?
- yes.</i>

831
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:38,395
<i>I mean, what the hell does she do all day?</i>

832
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,262
<i>- Her jewelry.
- yeah. Okay, sure.</i>

833
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:42,959
<i>If she's not taking care of Dad.</i>

834
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:45,469
<i>And when do you think is the last time
he did something nice for her?</i>

835
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,936
<i>I bet you that dinner the other night</i>

836
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,133
was their first night out in a decade.

837
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:54,111
<i>And you saw the way she was looking
at the vibrator in the lingerie store.</i>

838
00:44:55,715 --> 00:44:59,674
<i>She probably thought
it was a food mixer or something.</i>

839
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:01,844
<i>No, it was like she saw water in a desert.</i>

840
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:05,287
Okay. Stop. That's disgusting.

841
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,694
<i>I swear, you get pregnant
before you're 30, I'm gonna kick your ass.</i>

842
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:12,093
<i>Look, Izzy, I'm not Mom.</i>

843
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:15,133
<i>yeah, all right.
We'll check back with you in 25 years.</i>

844
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,873
<i>I'll cook your dinner, too</i>

845
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,035
<i>Oh, baby</i>

846
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:28,579
<i>Soon as I get home from work</i>

847
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:30,376
<i>I'll pay your rent</i>

848
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:32,508
<i>What?</i>

849
00:45:32,618 --> 00:45:34,643
<i>What? Why are you laughing?</i>

850
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:39,020
<i>My dad's friends were singing this song
to me 'cause they say I'm whipped.</i>

851
00:45:40,226 --> 00:45:41,352
<i>Really?</i>

852
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:44,354
<i>They just don't know what I got.</i>

853
00:45:45,965 --> 00:45:50,925
<i>Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt</i>

854
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,239
<i>Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work</i>

855
00:46:00,846 --> 00:46:03,440
<i>All right, keep your eyes closed
just for two more seconds.</i>

856
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:05,915
<i>Come on, Miguel, I got like
a thousand other things to do.</i>

857
00:46:06,018 --> 00:46:09,579
<i>yeah, I know, but I just wanted you
to see Lucia's present.</i>

858
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:10,678
<i>Look.</i>

859
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:13,518
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

860
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:16,157
<i>- Is this your old ride?
- yeah.</i>

861
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:18,093
Sexy, isn't it?

862
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:21,689
<i>I just finished it this morning.
you like the new color?</i>

863
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:24,395
<i>- Pink?
- yeah. Come on, get in.</i>

864
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,067
Ooh. Wow.

865
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:30,902
<i>Aw.</i>

866
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,138
We had some good times in this car.

867
00:46:34,246 --> 00:46:35,645
<i>yeah, we did.</i>

868
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:39,876
Mmm.

869
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:42,514
Wanna have some more good times
in this car?

870
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:44,886
<i>yep. Oh, no, not now. No.</i>

871
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,549
<i>- Come on, nobody's looking.
- No, no.</i>

872
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:49,093
<i>It's the garage. No, no, no, no.</i>

873
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,288
<i>'Cause it's where I... Oh!</i>

874
00:46:52,732 --> 00:46:54,962
<i>- Down here. That's fine.
That's not what I meant.</i>

875
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:56,591
<i>I mean, get off, not get on.</i>

876
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:58,897
<i>Really?
- I was trying to get away from you.</i>

877
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:02,666
<i>you guys are old. That's disgusting.</i>

878
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:04,504
<i>No, it's not what it looks like.</i>

879
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,737
<i>I'm looking at the rusty muffler
from under here...</i>

880
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:08,040
<i>yeah, I bet it's rusty.</i>

881
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:09,341
<i>No, really, it's...</i>

882
00:47:13,185 --> 00:47:16,245
<i>Hey, hey, hey. you don't touch
another man's grill. Give me that.</i>

883
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,687
<i>So, Marcus, are you Catholic?</i>

884
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:22,557
<i>Technically, I'm Baptist,
but I'm not really into organized religion.</i>

885
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:24,527
<i>But he believes in God. Right, baby?</i>

886
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:28,296
<i>yeah. I just don't go to church.</i>

887
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:31,293
He's a heathen.

888
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:39,676
<i>She's just saying that traditional Mexican
weddings are traditionally Catholic.</i>

889
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:44,240
<i>Well, we were thinking about
something a little less traditional.</i>

890
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,317
<i>- Right, Luce?
- Mmm.</i>

891
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:49,112
We were just thinking about it.

892
00:47:49,221 --> 00:47:50,586
<i>Like what?</i>

893
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:55,349
<i>- This woman know how to cook?
- No.</i>

894
00:47:55,461 --> 00:47:57,929
<i>But it's no big deal. My Pops taught me.</i>

895
00:47:58,731 --> 00:48:00,062
<i>your Pops taught you?</i>

896
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,294
<i>So, Lucia, your dad was telling me
that you are at Columbia Law.</i>

897
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:04,369
Mmm-hmm.

898
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,597
<i>- Dean's list.
Great school.</i>

899
00:48:06,706 --> 00:48:09,300
<i>you planning on taking the bar
in New york or California?</i>

900
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:11,672
<i>I don't know yet. I haven't really decided.</i>

901
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:15,406
<i>you know what? I think everybody's being
a little bit off the mark right now,</i>

902
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:18,074
<i>talking about law degrees and all that.</i>

903
00:48:18,184 --> 00:48:21,449
<i>This woman can't even cook.
What you gonna feed your children? Huh?</i>

904
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:22,885
<i>- T.J.
- Fruit Loops?</i>

905
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,853
SpaghettiOs, out of the can?

906
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,919
"Can this," what? What does that mean?

907
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:29,051
<i>you talking about my mama?</i>

908
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:30,753
<i>Can your mama
make huevos rancheros?</i>

909
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:31,887
Huevos, what?

910
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:33,624
<i>Have you called Father Paez yet?</i>

911
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,030
<i>No, not yet.</i>

912
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:37,830
<i>Lucia, it's going to take
a personal plea from you</i>

913
00:48:37,937 --> 00:48:40,997
<i>to get him on such short notice.
And if you can't, what are you going to do?</i>

914
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:42,301
<i>I'm sure we can get somebody else.</i>

915
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:44,509
So can Lucia.

916
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,577
<i>Grandma, stop.</i>

917
00:48:45,678 --> 00:48:48,272
We were thinking
we might just write our own vows.

918
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,041
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

919
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:53,448
<i>Father Paez baptized you,
and he's done all of our family weddings.</i>

920
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:57,420
<i>Isn't it enough that
you're being disrespectful to your faith</i>

921
00:48:57,523 --> 00:48:58,990
by not marrying in the church?

922
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,389
<i>Okay, I will call him. I'll call him.</i>

923
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:13,332
We were supposed to come to town,

924
00:49:13,439 --> 00:49:15,566
<i>and you were going to
come clean to your parents</i>

925
00:49:15,674 --> 00:49:18,802
<i>and have a small ceremony
before heading overseas.</i>

926
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:21,937
<i>Now all I hear is
tradition this and tradition that,</i>

927
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:23,810
and you changing everything
we agreed on.

928
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:28,148
<i>Well, I can see how you might be
a little reluctant towards tradition,</i>

929
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:31,417
given the very unorthodox way
you grew up.

930
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:33,182
Unorthodox?

931
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:37,194
<i>Marcus, you were raised by a single man
who dates girls I went to high school with.</i>

932
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:38,388
<i>It's a little unorthodox.</i>

933
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:41,057
<i>No, you're trying to flip this on me,
make up for the fact that</i>

934
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,431
<i>- you can't tell your dad the truth.
- All right. Okay.</i>

935
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:47,472
<i>you know, you get around your family,
you act like a little 12-year-old.</i>

936
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:49,040
<i>- you're a grown woman.
- Marcus, I don't really feel like</i>

937
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:50,870
<i>talking about this right now.</i>

938
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:58,709
<i>Baby. Babe, Lucia, I'm sorry.</i>

939
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:01,619
<i>Look, everything is just so tense
around this wedding, you know?</i>

940
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,347
<i>yes. I know.</i>

941
00:50:03,455 --> 00:50:06,549
<i>I don't really wanna think
about this wedding anymore.</i>

942
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:10,656
We just need to have fun.

943
00:50:12,064 --> 00:50:14,658
<i>- Have fun?
- That's not what I meant.</i>

944
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:18,531
<i>All right, sweetie.
Give me a good one, this one.</i>

945
00:50:18,637 --> 00:50:19,968
Hey, hey.

946
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:22,063
Baby, hi.

947
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:26,337
<i>Daddy, I invited Marcus.
He played in high school. He's really good.</i>

948
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:27,912
<i>What's up, pop-in-law?</i>

949
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:31,915
<i>Hey, Miguel. Lucia said that
your team needed some help, so I'm here.</i>

950
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:33,143
- Hi, Brad.
- What?

951
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:35,880
<i>yeah. No... We don't need any help.</i>

952
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:37,888
We've never won a game.

953
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,515
<i>I'm gonna warm up with Marcus, Dad.</i>

954
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:47,859
Marcus, make sure you're ready.

955
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:00,935
<i>Come on, Dad. you got this.</i>

956
00:51:01,814 --> 00:51:04,305
<i>All right, Luce. you know where to put it.</i>

957
00:51:11,156 --> 00:51:12,487
What the...

958
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,559
<i>That's all right, Dad.</i>

959
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,327
<i>- Come on, Marcus.
All right, Marcus.</i>

960
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,695
<i>- Show the old man what you got.
Come on, Marcus.</i>

961
00:51:46,992 --> 00:51:48,687
<i>Go, baby.</i>

962
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:51,424
<i>See, we're not all about the flash.</i>

963
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,499
We're about the work ethic.
That's why we dominate the game.

964
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,592
<i>Like A- Rod and Manny,
that kind of work ethic?</i>

965
00:51:58,137 --> 00:52:00,071
<i>Well, those guys are Dominican.</i>

966
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:02,936
<i>I'm sorry, what are you trying to say?</i>

967
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:05,607
<i>Come on, B-squared.</i>

968
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:07,303
<i>BOyD: Give me one.
Knock it out.</i>

969
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:10,814
<i>yeah, yeah. Go, go, go, go. yes!</i>

970
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:12,315
<i>Come on, Brad.</i>

971
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:23,617
<i>I got it! I got it!</i>

972
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:27,697
<i>Good job, Dad.</i>

973
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,462
Come on in, come on in, come on in, guys,
come on in.

974
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:32,699
<i>- Okay...
- Okay, look,</i>

975
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:34,102
<i>we're only down by one.</i>

976
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:37,039
<i>I just need one of you to get on base,
and I'll get us home.</i>

977
00:52:37,142 --> 00:52:38,973
<i>- Right. That's a good plan.
- All right.</i>

978
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:41,546
<i>I've never seen anybody strike out
in self- pitch softball before.</i>

979
00:52:41,914 --> 00:52:43,575
<i>Oh, the bat slipped, okay?</i>

980
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:45,081
<i>Hold it tighter next time. Just a thought.</i>

981
00:52:45,184 --> 00:52:46,947
<i>- Dad, you got this.
- Okay. I got this.</i>

982
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:48,212
<i>Win on three. Win on three.</i>

983
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,049
<i>One, two, three...
Win.</i>

984
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:54,356
<i>Watch, brother. you're about to
witness Mexican power, my friend.</i>

985
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,725
<i>- Oh, I don't think so.
- yeah, Mexican power. Say it.</i>

986
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,195
<i>- Hold the bat.
- No, Mexican power.</i>

987
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:00,492
<i>- Just hold the bat.
- Mexican power.</i>

988
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,567
<i>- Hold the bat. Don't drop the bat.
- Mexican power.</i>

989
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:05,535
<i>Try not to drop the bat. Don't drop the bat.</i>

990
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:07,298
Don't drop the bat!

991
00:53:07,406 --> 00:53:08,964
<i>Come on, Miguel.</i>

992
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:11,200
<i>- All right, Daddy.
He's a choker.</i>

993
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,710
Don't pay attention to them.

994
00:53:13,812 --> 00:53:15,439
<i>Here we go. Nice and easy.</i>

995
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:18,812
<i>BOyD: you can do it. Hit the ball.
Hit the ball. Good job. Go!</i>

996
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:21,277
<i>Go, go. you got it.</i>

997
00:53:22,454 --> 00:53:23,944
<i>Run, run, run.</i>

998
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:31,294
<i>Go, Daddy. Go, go, go!</i>

999
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:33,456
<i>- Go!
- Come on, Dad!</i>

1000
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,261
<i>Come on, man! No!</i>

1001
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:38,026
<i>you're short.</i>

1002
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,939
<i>That was a good hustle, Dad.</i>

1003
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,940
<i>you got to be kidding me. Miguel.</i>

1004
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:47,244
<i>you... What was that?</i>

1005
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:48,813
<i>It's all right, Dad.</i>

1006
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:53,410
Come on, Marcus, knock it out of the park.

1007
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:54,611
One more time, baby. Come on.

1008
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,915
<i>Come on, Daddy. Give him a good one.</i>

1009
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,649
<i>Knock it out of the park, Marcus.</i>

1010
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:01,658
Come on, baby. Bring mama home.

1011
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:04,053
<i>you got this.</i>

1012
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:06,791
<i>All right, Marcus.
Show the old man what you got.</i>

1013
00:54:06,899 --> 00:54:10,027
<i>Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!</i>

1014
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:13,730
Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!

1015
00:54:19,378 --> 00:54:20,345
What the...

1016
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:22,380
<i>Marcus. Daddy, what are you doing?</i>

1017
00:54:22,481 --> 00:54:23,971
<i>- Are you okay?
- BOyD: Are you crazy or something?</i>

1018
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,710
<i>- you lost your mind?
- Come on, let's go.</i>

1019
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:27,809
Hey, hey, hey.

1020
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:36,852
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

1021
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:39,931
<i>What is your problem, Dad?</i>

1022
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:42,591
<i>What is my problem? Brad attacked me.</i>

1023
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:45,067
<i>yeah. After you beaned Marcus
with the ball.</i>

1024
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,071
<i>The ball slipped. And the way
he fell to the floor, all dramatic.</i>

1025
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,266
<i>- I mean, come on.
- Dad, stop.</i>

1026
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:53,310
- He's not good enough for you.
- Oh, come on. How can you say that?

1027
00:54:53,412 --> 00:54:54,879
He went to USC.

1028
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,675
<i>He graduated from
Columbia Medical School.</i>

1029
00:54:56,782 --> 00:54:58,545
<i>Daddy, what is the problem?</i>

1030
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,845
<i>If he's so special,
why did you hide him from me?</i>

1031
00:55:03,322 --> 00:55:04,983
<i>I wasn't hiding him.</i>

1032
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,082
We speak every Sunday,
and you never brought up his name.

1033
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:10,522
Why?

1034
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:19,494
<i>Come on in the house, mi hija.</i>

1035
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:24,165
<i>I promised Lucia
her parents would love me.</i>

1036
00:55:24,276 --> 00:55:26,073
<i>- There you go.
- Guess I lied.</i>

1037
00:55:26,578 --> 00:55:29,911
<i>Dude's a little off. you know that, right?
I mean, he's a little touched.</i>

1038
00:55:30,015 --> 00:55:33,507
<i>To be honest,
I'm not in love with them either.</i>

1039
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:36,682
<i>I mean, is that wrong?
Should I be worried about that?</i>

1040
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:40,356
<i>Or the fact that none of this is
going like I thought it would?</i>

1041
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:46,792
<i>you say you want to marry her, I'm good.</i>

1042
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:49,299
<i>you say you don't want to marry her,
I'm good, too.</i>

1043
00:55:49,401 --> 00:55:53,269
<i>That's not what I'm talking about.
I just really need some advice here.</i>

1044
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:56,538
<i>I'm your dad, but I'm not the person
to ask for marriage advice from.</i>

1045
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:58,769
<i>'Cause you know how I feel about that.</i>

1046
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:03,541
<i>you'll figure it out. I've always let you
do your thing, and you always do it good.</i>

1047
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,641
<i>yeah, I know. I just...</i>

1048
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:11,553
<i>Sometimes, I wish
you weren't so unorthodox.</i>

1049
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:15,124
<i>Oh, oh! Okay. I see. Is this 'cause</i>

1050
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:17,889
<i>I didn't make you eat that asparagus,
make you grow up really big and strong?</i>

1051
00:56:17,996 --> 00:56:19,224
<i>you still grew up big and strong.</i>

1052
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:22,390
<i>Is that what you wanted?</i>

1053
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:25,498
<i>yeah, maybe.</i>

1054
00:56:30,142 --> 00:56:33,339
<i>I can see that you're head over heels
for this girl.</i>

1055
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,144
<i>I felt like that about your mom.</i>

1056
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:41,777
<i>I rushed it. I ignored all the signs.</i>

1057
00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:47,618
<i>So if anything doesn't feel good, anything,</i>

1058
00:56:48,827 --> 00:56:51,261
<i>all I'm asking is that you trust it.</i>

1059
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:54,824
<i>- Okay?
- yeah.</i>

1060
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:04,542
<i>Ready now.
Here's the pitch, high and outside.</i>

1061
00:57:04,643 --> 00:57:05,769
<i>Ball three.</i>

1062
00:57:05,877 --> 00:57:11,110
<i>you know, this guy doesn't look nearly as
sharp today as he was in his last outing.</i>

1063
00:57:11,216 --> 00:57:14,845
<i>In fact, this is as far out of the strike zone</i>

1064
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,649
<i>that I've seen him pitch
in a long, long time.</i>

1065
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:24,151
<i>Okay. Runners are at first and second
in the third. No score.</i>

1066
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:28,759
<i>you know, when you were a little girl,
I would rock you to sleep.</i>

1067
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:33,071
<i>I would dream about the day
that you'd get married.</i>

1068
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:36,538
<i>What it would be like,
what he would be like.</i>

1069
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:39,440
<i>This is just not how I dreamt it would be.</i>

1070
00:57:40,345 --> 00:57:41,710
<i>yeah.</i>

1071
00:57:46,118 --> 00:57:48,609
<i>Well, it's not your dream anymore, Dad.</i>

1072
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,717
<i>It's mine.</i>

1073
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:58,688
<i>And when I look at Marcus,
I don't see brown, or black, or white.</i>

1074
00:58:00,732 --> 00:58:02,962
<i>Isn't that how you raised me?</i>

1075
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,938
<i>Well, good night.</i>

1076
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:14,307
Okay.

1077
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:31,323
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

1078
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:35,196
<i>Here comes the bride
on the top of the cake</i>

1079
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,598
<i>- BOyD: Is this organic?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no.</i>

1080
00:58:37,703 --> 00:58:39,864
<i>This is from where?
A different place, or what?</i>

1081
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:41,700
<i>- Three different places?
- Listen, I want... No.</i>

1082
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:45,573
<i>No, no, no. I want you to experience
the cake like you will on the day.</i>

1083
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:48,077
The bride and groom
need to feed each other.

1084
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,579
- Oh.
- That's the tradition.

1085
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:51,774
<i>That's really sweet, but we're not the...</i>

1086
00:58:51,883 --> 00:58:54,875
Wow, that is such a great idea.

1087
00:58:54,986 --> 00:58:57,352
<i>- Honey...
- I bet it even tastes different.</i>

1088
00:58:57,456 --> 00:58:59,924
<i>- you only get married once.
That's exactly right.</i>

1089
00:59:00,025 --> 00:59:01,287
<i>- Here we go.
- yes, you link arms.</i>

1090
00:59:01,393 --> 00:59:03,554
<i>That's the tradition.
The bride needs a little cake</i>

1091
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:04,959
to feed to the groom.

1092
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:07,691
<i>And then, how do you turn it around
to go back like...</i>

1093
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:11,235
<i>you see what I'm saying?
This whole thing is ridiculous.</i>

1094
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:13,736
<i>- you are an ass.
- Why do people who love each other</i>

1095
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,170
shove cake into each other's face?

1096
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:16,399
<i>Because they love each other.</i>

1097
00:59:16,508 --> 00:59:17,907
Why do we have to have cake?

1098
00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:19,806
<i>- No!
No, that's not how we do it.</i>

1099
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:22,072
<i>- you're supposed to take a little piece.
- Well, that's how we do it.</i>

1100
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,374
<i>- Now it's on.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

1101
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:24,847
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.</i>

1102
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,474
<i>What are you doing? No, no, no!</i>

1103
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:28,712
<i>- What are you doing? No, no.
- Get out of the way.</i>

1104
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,617
Excuse me. Stop! Stop!

1105
00:59:30,722 --> 00:59:32,952
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1106
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:35,618
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1107
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:37,661
<i>Okay. This has got...</i>

1108
00:59:38,163 --> 00:59:39,994
<i>Got to stop, okay? I mean, to leave them...</i>

1109
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:44,091
<i>I know you're getting married...
No, no, no. Oh, God. Okay.</i>

1110
00:59:44,202 --> 00:59:46,966
<i>Not in my hair. Are you serious?</i>

1111
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:55,837
<i>So much more fun planning a wedding
when you're not the one getting married.</i>

1112
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:58,981
<i>yeah. Speak for yourself.
Because this wedding is killing me.</i>

1113
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:00,551
<i>And my pocketbook.</i>

1114
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:03,180
<i>I hear you.</i>

1115
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,988
<i>What? you just threw that thing
on the floor.</i>

1116
01:00:08,093 --> 01:00:10,459
<i>you know you just threw that on the floor?
you're messing with me, right?</i>

1117
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:14,862
<i>I am. I do half of the things I do
to mess with you.</i>

1118
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:18,730
- Why do you want to mess with me?
- Because...

1119
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,200
<i>Why do you like messing with me?</i>

1120
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:26,341
<i>- I think...
- you think...</i>

1121
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:38,555
<i>I can feel it</i>

1122
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,316
<i>Even when you're not here</i>

1123
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,924
<i>I can't do a thing
Oh, I'm so in love with you</i>

1124
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:50,831
<i>So, darling, help me, please</i>

1125
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,804
<i>Have mercy on a fool like me</i>

1126
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:02,507
<i>- Getting nervous?
- No.</i>

1127
01:01:04,649 --> 01:01:10,087
<i>This is Brad Boyd coming at you live,
Hot 93.7 KZL y.</i>

1128
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:11,951
<i>So what's on tap for tonight, LA?</i>

1129
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:16,426
<i>What am I doing tonight? As you know,
my son Marcus is getting married,</i>

1130
01:01:16,528 --> 01:01:20,555
<i>so I'm gonna be at Le Spot
looking for a DJ for the wedding.</i>

1131
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:24,396
<i>So the question is,
'"What are you doing tonight, LA? '"</i>

1132
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:26,733
<i>All right, caller, you're on.</i>

1133
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:28,328
<i>Hey, Brad, it's Miguel.</i>

1134
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,101
<i>you know,
if I'm paying for half the wedding,</i>

1135
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,233
<i>I'm coming with you to see about this DJ.</i>

1136
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,314
<i>Hey, Brad. How's it going?
- I'm with him.</i>

1137
01:01:40,418 --> 01:01:43,319
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy.
- Brad, this guy won't let me in.</i>

1138
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:45,286
- He's with me.
- Sorry.

1139
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,516
Come here.

1140
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,422
- Hey.
- Hey!

1141
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:49,858
See this?

1142
01:01:50,529 --> 01:01:53,555
<i>yeah. I'm gonna have a drink.</i>

1143
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:58,994
<i>- Bartender.
- I'm not a bartender.</i>

1144
01:01:59,104 --> 01:02:02,938
<i>- This is a bar and you are tending it.
- I'm a mixologist.</i>

1145
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:05,566
<i>- A what?
- Mixologist.</i>

1146
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:09,602
<i>Don't mess with this guy's identity,
all right?</i>

1147
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:12,239
<i>- What kind of beer you have on tap?
- We only serve what's on the menu.</i>

1148
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:17,117
<i>Could I have a Hendricks with about
this much tonic and a splash of bitters.</i>

1149
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:19,019
<i>It's not on the menu.</i>

1150
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:22,393
<i>- Let me know, guys.
- Watch this. Watch this.</i>

1151
01:02:23,361 --> 01:02:26,592
- Bartender.
- Hey, guy behind bar!

1152
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,663
<i>- Sir Mix-a-Lot.
- Mixmaster flash.</i>

1153
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,008
<i>- Mixologist.
- yeah?</i>

1154
01:02:38,877 --> 01:02:42,040
<i>- Let's have a Pink Nipple.
- Make that two Nipples, please.</i>

1155
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:49,410
<i>Wow! It gives it that irrigated flavor.</i>

1156
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:51,989
<i>Really? He's serious.</i>

1157
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,523
<i>Look at that. Ooh!</i>

1158
01:02:58,563 --> 01:03:01,031
<i>- Just like a Cosmo, you know?
- A what?</i>

1159
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:02,793
<i>- A Cosmo.
- Open up a tab?</i>

1160
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:04,994
We're just gonna have one drink.

1161
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:14,841
<i>Hey, mixologist.</i>

1162
01:03:15,714 --> 01:03:17,875
<i>Please fill my liquid receptacle.</i>

1163
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:22,286
<i>When is the last time
that you were in a club?</i>

1164
01:03:22,387 --> 01:03:24,446
<i>- I've been married for 25 years, right?
- Okay.</i>

1165
01:03:25,457 --> 01:03:27,015
Twenty-five years!

1166
01:03:32,897 --> 01:03:34,296
<i>yeah, baby!</i>

1167
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,560
Oh, yeah! Remember that?

1168
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:38,602
- That was nice.
- What about this?

1169
01:03:41,306 --> 01:03:43,365
<i>And then the Roger Rabbit.
Bro, remember that movie?</i>

1170
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:48,477
<i>yeah, there it is. There it is. I could do it.</i>

1171
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:53,847
<i>The Matrix. Look, The Matrix.
I'm Neo! I'm Neo!</i>

1172
01:03:54,919 --> 01:03:57,149
Shoot me! Hey, Brad.

1173
01:03:57,255 --> 01:03:58,984
<i>- yeah?
- I can't get up, bro.</i>

1174
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,285
<i>you got it. you got it. yeah.</i>

1175
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,020
Whoo!

1176
01:04:03,128 --> 01:04:04,755
That's a true story.

1177
01:04:04,896 --> 01:04:07,023
<i>- Do you guys know Duran Duran?
- yeah.</i>

1178
01:04:07,132 --> 01:04:11,000
<i>The Reflex. I told them, all of them.</i>

1179
01:04:11,102 --> 01:04:15,801
They gave me this tie, man.
This is a Duran Duran tie.

1180
01:04:15,907 --> 01:04:16,999
<i>yeah, man.</i>

1181
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:20,209
<i>Miguel, we gotta chill
on the drinking, man,</i>

1182
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:23,610
<i>'cause we still gotta go over here,
talk to the DJ.</i>

1183
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:27,242
<i>- yeah, 'cause that's why we're here.
- yeah. Hey, hey, hey!</i>

1184
01:04:28,053 --> 01:04:30,920
- DJ Spin-Sane.
- There he is!

1185
01:04:31,423 --> 01:04:33,755
<i>- The spinster.
- yeah, I'm Spin-Sane.</i>

1186
01:04:34,592 --> 01:04:37,561
<i>But I ain't no DJ, gramps.
I'm a turntable- ist.</i>

1187
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:42,161
<i>you got... Exactly, man.</i>

1188
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:44,735
<i>It's a whole new world out there, bro.</i>

1189
01:04:44,836 --> 01:04:49,500
<i>See, he isn't a DJ. He's a turntable- ist.</i>

1190
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:54,601
<i>- And that guy over there, mixologist.
- BOyD: Mixologist!</i>

1191
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:58,911
<i>I am not a Latin. I am a Latinist.</i>

1192
01:04:59,017 --> 01:05:04,387
<i>So add an "- ist" at the end.
Fo' shizz, my nist.</i>

1193
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,720
<i>- 'Cause what are you?
- I'm a radio-logist.</i>

1194
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:11,694
<i>- you're a doctor.
- Always wanted to be a doctor.</i>

1195
01:05:11,796 --> 01:05:13,787
<i>Like father, like son, Doctor.</i>

1196
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,200
What the...

1197
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,996
<i>Hey, man!
- Cool, cool.</i>

1198
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:21,800
<i>No, that's funny. Come on, that's funny.</i>

1199
01:05:21,906 --> 01:05:24,136
<i>- Wow, look at his face.
- BOyD: It was a mistake.</i>

1200
01:05:24,242 --> 01:05:26,005
<i>- He's been drinking a little bit.
- He's like a mountain.</i>

1201
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:30,411
<i>Hey, you're a mountain-ist.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

1202
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:34,349
Hey, he wants to dance.
He wants to dance.

1203
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:44,987
<i>Captain, line two.
Oh, thanks.</i>

1204
01:05:46,397 --> 01:05:49,662
<i>you should have had the wedding here.
you can't seem to stay away.</i>

1205
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,405
<i>you were supposed
to just go in there and see the DJ.</i>

1206
01:05:54,506 --> 01:05:56,940
<i>- Why couldn't you even do that?
- It's not my fault.</i>

1207
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,238
<i>I told you he was a little touched.
He went crazy loco on me in there.</i>

1208
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:02,006
<i>- Too many Nipples.
What?</i>

1209
01:06:02,113 --> 01:06:04,877
<i>Look, for the next couple of days,
I just need you to be my dad.</i>

1210
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:07,383
<i>After the wedding's done,
you can go back to being Brad Boyd.</i>

1211
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:11,683
<i>- Hey, I'm always your dad, all right?
- yeah, and I've always been your dad.</i>

1212
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,485
<i>- Jesus!
Hey, watch your mouth.</i>

1213
01:06:13,591 --> 01:06:17,584
<i>I get to act crazy and be drunk
'cause I raised you your whole life.</i>

1214
01:06:17,695 --> 01:06:21,563
<i>And then he comes around and tells me
that he's gonna marry my daughter</i>

1215
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:25,966
and take her to Timbuktu.
Oh, yeah, and not bring in a paycheck.

1216
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:29,798
<i>He's gonna be living off
of your lawyer checks</i>

1217
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:32,968
<i>while he sits around
just doing whatever he does.</i>

1218
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:36,274
<i>Are you saying that your daughter
is too good for my son?</i>

1219
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:37,939
<i>No. No, I'm not.</i>

1220
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,249
<i>But I am asking you, Marcus, straight up,
man to man,</i>

1221
01:06:44,122 --> 01:06:47,614
<i>would you respect a man
who doesn't pull his own weight?</i>

1222
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:52,592
<i>No, sir, I wouldn't.</i>

1223
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:15,451
<i>- I'm gonna tell him tomorrow. I promise.
- Whatever.</i>

1224
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:24,523
<i>Do you want to be
like your new buddy Brad</i>

1225
01:07:24,629 --> 01:07:28,963
<i>and hang out at the clubs all night long,
picking up on the young girls?</i>

1226
01:07:29,067 --> 01:07:33,936
<i>you know, Sonia, I forgot Valentine's Day
and I'm really sorry.</i>

1227
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:41,402
The other day
my daughters made fun of me.

1228
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:44,037
<i>- What do you mean?
- They didn't know I was listening</i>

1229
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:47,174
<i>and they made fun
of the woman I've become.</i>

1230
01:07:47,285 --> 01:07:51,881
<i>- They're our children. That's what they do.
- No, no, no. I used to be a cool chick.</i>

1231
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:55,653
<i>- I was fun. Don't you miss that?
- We're not kids anymore.</i>

1232
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,593
<i>I know.
I know we're not kids anymore, Miguel.</i>

1233
01:07:58,696 --> 01:08:02,723
<i>But when did I stop being a woman?
I'm a wife, I'm a mother.</i>

1234
01:08:03,434 --> 01:08:07,803
<i>But you don't see me as that girl
that you used to pick up in your ride.</i>

1235
01:08:08,673 --> 01:08:12,507
<i>And we would just drive
with the top down.</i>

1236
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:19,883
<i>Then we'd park
and listen to music all night,</i>

1237
01:08:20,785 --> 01:08:22,548
<i>till the sun came up.</i>

1238
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:26,112
<i>But we can't do that anymore
'cause I gotta go to work.</i>

1239
01:08:26,224 --> 01:08:29,751
<i>Why is it when I asked you the other day
how I looked,</i>

1240
01:08:30,862 --> 01:08:32,386
you said, "Fine,"

1241
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:36,828
<i>but whatever car you're working on
looks sexy?</i>

1242
01:08:45,677 --> 01:08:47,372
<i>I dropped out of law school
to be a volunteer teacher.</i>

1243
01:08:47,478 --> 01:08:51,278
<i>We think that's noble. He's not going to.
It's gonna kill him.</i>

1244
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,314
Baby, he was drunk
and pouring his heart out.

1245
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:59,356
<i>- What was I supposed to do?
- Stand up for me.</i>

1246
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:06,519
<i>you just stood there and watched
as I drowned to save yourself.</i>

1247
01:09:13,004 --> 01:09:16,997
<i>I know about disappointment.
you know how I feel about my mother.</i>

1248
01:09:17,108 --> 01:09:19,736
<i>Babe, it wasn't like that.</i>

1249
01:09:19,844 --> 01:09:22,540
<i>Look, when you tell me you love me,
I need to be able to trust that.</i>

1250
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:26,777
<i>When you say you'll never leave me,
I need to be able to believe it.</i>

1251
01:09:28,453 --> 01:09:31,786
<i>If you can't stand up to your dad
for our relationship, for me,</i>

1252
01:09:31,889 --> 01:09:35,484
then what are we doing?
Why are we doing this?

1253
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:40,958
What are you saying?

1254
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:47,260
<i>you don't want to do this?
you don't want to get married?</i>

1255
01:09:53,578 --> 01:09:54,943
<i>I don't know.</i>

1256
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:01,741
<i>you don't know?</i>

1257
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:10,817
<i>Well, let me make it easy for you.</i>

1258
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,873
<i>Lucia, what's wrong?</i>

1259
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:27,172
- The wedding's off.
- What? Wait a minute.

1260
01:10:27,278 --> 01:10:29,075
What do you mean our wedding is off?

1261
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,445
<i>No, Mom, not our wedding.
My wedding is off.</i>

1262
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,177
- The wedding's off?
- The wedding's off.

1263
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:36,149
<i>you want to go toss the ball, angel?</i>

1264
01:10:36,254 --> 01:10:38,620
<i>No, Dad, I don't want to toss a ball!</i>

1265
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:40,418
<i>- And I'm not your angel.
- Lucia, calm down.</i>

1266
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:42,117
<i>Would your angel
have dropped out of law school?</i>

1267
01:10:43,294 --> 01:10:45,159
<i>you dropped out of law school?</i>

1268
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:47,828
<i>And I've been volunteer teaching
at a charter school</i>

1269
01:10:47,932 --> 01:10:50,127
for immigrants for three months.

1270
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:55,905
<i>And I love it.
Imagine that, Daddy, I love what I do.</i>

1271
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,332
<i>Oh, and I've been living with Marcus.</i>

1272
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:03,274
<i>And yes, we were having sex.</i>

1273
01:11:19,297 --> 01:11:20,594
- Hey.
- Hey!

1274
01:11:24,402 --> 01:11:28,532
<i>I was in the neighborhood, so I thought
I'd drop off the invoice from the caterers.</i>

1275
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:31,699
Okay. Oh, great, great.

1276
01:11:33,177 --> 01:11:34,337
Thanks.

1277
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,747
<i>Can I come in?</i>

1278
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,347
<i>I got some... Just a couple of things
I'm gonna take care of.</i>

1279
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:41,543
Brad?

1280
01:11:41,652 --> 01:11:44,120
<i>Brad, I think the omelet's burning.</i>

1281
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,787
<i>I'll be right there. I'll be right there.</i>

1282
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:53,353
<i>Angie! Angie!</i>

1283
01:11:54,365 --> 01:11:57,823
<i>Angela, you're my best friend.
I don't want to mess that up, all right?</i>

1284
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:01,427
There's no woman that means more to me
than you mean to me.

1285
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,728
<i>She appeared in the distance</i>

1286
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:39,667
<i>Like a prayer I had uttered once</i>

1287
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,106
<i>She appeared in my life</i>

1288
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:48,715
<i>Like a dream</i>

1289
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:55,055
<i>only half-remembered</i>

1290
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:03,530
<i>She entered my heart</i>

1291
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:08,562
<i>Stayed a while</i>

1292
01:13:13,177 --> 01:13:16,704
<i>She entered my heart</i>

1293
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:20,974
<i>Stayed a while</i>

1294
01:13:21,085 --> 01:13:23,986
<i>Made me to smile</i>

1295
01:13:24,522 --> 01:13:27,923
<i>Then gone</i>

1296
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,999
<i>Gone from my life</i>

1297
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:40,859
<i>yeah</i>

1298
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:52,112
<i>Her love was like a burning flame of desire</i>

1299
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:59,047
<i>Desire</i>

1300
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:08,789
<i>If I could do it all over again,</i>

1301
01:14:11,402 --> 01:14:14,166
<i>I would call you after my first semester</i>

1302
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:18,499
<i>and tell you that,</i>

1303
01:14:19,644 --> 01:14:23,944
<i>even though I know how hard you
worked to put me through law school,</i>

1304
01:14:24,915 --> 01:14:26,883
<i>it just didn't feel right.</i>

1305
01:14:30,988 --> 01:14:32,478
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

1306
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:42,321
<i>I just hope that you can forgive me.</i>

1307
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:54,136
Remember when you were nine,

1308
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,848
<i>and you melted that stick of butter
on the brand new VCR</i>

1309
01:14:58,949 --> 01:15:00,917
<i>with the Duran/Leonard fight tape
still in it?</i>

1310
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:06,214
<i>you were so scared when I came home.</i>

1311
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,186
<i>And I told you, "Even when I'm mad at you,</i>

1312
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,160
<i>"I still love you. "</i>

1313
01:15:21,872 --> 01:15:23,669
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

1314
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:45,823
<i>I made one mistake. One.</i>

1315
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:49,161
<i>What, did he just forget all the times
that I was there for him?</i>

1316
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:52,429
<i>Through med school,
when his mom would call.</i>

1317
01:15:56,941 --> 01:16:00,536
<i>- He doesn't want to marry me.
- He said, "I don't know. "</i>

1318
01:16:03,514 --> 01:16:05,573
How many times did we scream
at each other growing up?

1319
01:16:05,683 --> 01:16:10,382
<i>Two hours later, we're best friends again.
Only difference is, now we're grownups.</i>

1320
01:16:10,488 --> 01:16:11,716
<i>Gotta apologize first.</i>

1321
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:17,953
<i>We never apologize.
That's how we dominate their brain.</i>

1322
01:16:20,798 --> 01:16:22,959
<i>Okay, get up.</i>

1323
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,297
<i>- Put this on. Come on. Let's go.
- What are you doing?</i>

1324
01:16:25,403 --> 01:16:28,031
Being your maid of honor.

1325
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:30,733
<i>Just shut up. Stop it. Go. Get up.</i>

1326
01:16:33,544 --> 01:16:37,503
<i>She was beautiful. She was classy,</i>

1327
01:16:41,152 --> 01:16:42,278
adventurous.

1328
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:48,919
<i>But she never really loved me.</i>

1329
01:16:50,628 --> 01:16:51,720
Five.

1330
01:16:52,963 --> 01:16:55,625
<i>- you know how I knew?
- How?</i>

1331
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:58,995
<i>She never laughed at my jokes.</i>

1332
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:03,535
<i>- Pop, your jokes are corny.
- That's not the point.</i>

1333
01:17:03,641 --> 01:17:06,701
<i>If your lady loves you,
she laughs at your jokes.</i>

1334
01:17:06,811 --> 01:17:09,336
<i>It was a sign. I just totally ignored it.</i>

1335
01:17:12,783 --> 01:17:14,751
<i>Lucia laughs at my jokes.</i>

1336
01:17:19,824 --> 01:17:22,292
<i>That's 'cause Lucia is your friend.</i>

1337
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,261
<i>Gotta pay attention to the signs.</i>

1338
01:17:34,338 --> 01:17:35,532
Five.

1339
01:17:55,726 --> 01:17:58,160
- Wait, wait.
- What?

1340
01:17:58,262 --> 01:17:59,388
<i>What's the plan?</i>

1341
01:17:59,497 --> 01:18:01,556
<i>My plan was to get you here,
and you're here.</i>

1342
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:04,463
<i>- Wait. Izzy, wait.
- What?</i>

1343
01:18:04,568 --> 01:18:08,060
<i>What if he won't come out?
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?</i>

1344
01:18:08,172 --> 01:18:10,265
Then he doesn't deserve you. Come on.

1345
01:18:10,374 --> 01:18:12,604
<i>- I don't want to.
- Come on.</i>

1346
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:17,174
<i>you know, Angela laughs at your jokes.</i>

1347
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:20,908
<i>yeah.</i>

1348
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:24,154
Ten.

1349
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:53,114
Don't do that!

1350
01:18:59,056 --> 01:19:00,023
<i>Abort!</i>

1351
01:19:07,364 --> 01:19:08,626
What's that?

1352
01:19:32,122 --> 01:19:35,091
<i>Stop. Lucia, stop.
you're gonna get us mauled out here.</i>

1353
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,990
<i>- Dogs love me.
- They're coyotes.</i>

1354
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:39,217
Oh.

1355
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,797
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1356
01:19:40,898 --> 01:19:42,229
What are you doing?

1357
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:46,929
<i>Marcus, I'm sorry.</i>

1358
01:19:48,668 --> 01:19:53,230
<i>For making you feel anything less than
the most important person in my life.</i>

1359
01:19:55,008 --> 01:19:56,339
<i>I love you.</i>

1360
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:59,940
<i>And if you still want me, we could just...</i>

1361
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:02,981
<i>We could go to Vegas tonight
and get married</i>

1362
01:20:03,082 --> 01:20:04,549
<i>and we could just forget about all of this,</i>

1363
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:08,485
<i>the wedding and the families
and the traditions and...</i>

1364
01:20:09,355 --> 01:20:12,256
Just you and me and...

1365
01:20:12,358 --> 01:20:15,816
<i>- your family would kill us.
- I don't care anymore.</i>

1366
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:21,465
<i>Look, babe,
I don't want you to ever feel like</i>

1367
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,365
<i>you have to sacrifice your family for me.</i>

1368
01:20:30,543 --> 01:20:31,874
<i>I love you.</i>

1369
01:20:33,713 --> 01:20:36,079
<i>- Always?
- Always.</i>

1370
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:41,279
<i>Told you.</i>

1371
01:20:41,387 --> 01:20:45,949
<i>you</i>

1372
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:50,553
<i>show me who I am and what I'm doing</i>

1373
01:20:55,068 --> 01:21:00,165

1374
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:05,575
<i>better know this love runs deep</i>

1375
01:21:16,389 --> 01:21:19,881
<i>She's not here. She left with Isabel.
- I'm looking for you.</i>

1376
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:23,294
<i>- What, Miguel?
- Come here.</i>

1377
01:21:28,234 --> 01:21:30,794
<i>- you know what I realized about this car?
- What?</i>

1378
01:21:30,903 --> 01:21:33,963
<i>It's grown and sexy.</i>

1379
01:21:34,841 --> 01:21:35,808
<i>Just like my wife.</i>

1380
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:40,036
<i>It's like you two were
meant for each other.</i>

1381
01:21:46,419 --> 01:21:47,784
<i>My God!</i>

1382
01:21:52,959 --> 01:21:55,052
<i>- I love you.
- I love you more.</i>

1383
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,525
<i>Go ahead. Have fun.</i>

1384
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:21,912
Hey, baby.
Want to come have fun with me?

1385
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,079
<i>yeah.</i>

1386
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,784
<i>- Wow, this is a nice car.
- yeah. How do I look?</i>

1387
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,358
<i>Perfect.</i>

1388
01:22:44,777 --> 01:22:47,041
<i>you guys need to take this ball out
and play on the grass, okay?</i>

1389
01:22:47,146 --> 01:22:48,135
- Okay.
- Before you break something.

1390
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:51,148
<i>- That goes by the pool on the right.
- By the pool.</i>

1391
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,775
<i>Hey, don't... you're Mr. Popular, right?</i>

1392
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:58,780
<i>Is that my Brian Smith? Hey, you need
to cover that. That's very, very expensive.</i>

1393
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,984
<i>yo, bro, you got a plunger?</i>

1394
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,717
<i>Fancy toilet.</i>

1395
01:23:06,332 --> 01:23:08,960
<i>- I think you have the wrong house.
- Me no English. Sorry.</i>

1396
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,797
This is the wrong...

1397
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:15,940
<i>Let me help you. This goes over here
on the table. Thanks. Right here.</i>

1398
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:21,977
<i>- What is this?
- It's a wedding cake.</i>

1399
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:24,879
<i>Wedding cake. Comprende?</i>

1400
01:23:24,984 --> 01:23:26,849
<i>Mama, she speaks English.</i>

1401
01:23:26,953 --> 01:23:30,650
<i>- Who are these people?
- Excuse you!</i>

1402
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,384
<i>you see, this is exquisite cake.</i>

1403
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:35,484
<i>- No.
- I chose it myself.</i>

1404
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,722
<i>The chef, he worked three hours
on the marzipan</i>

1405
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,457
<i>just to get the right molding and design.</i>

1406
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:46,104
<i>My Lucia is going to have
a traditional Mexican wedding cake.</i>

1407
01:23:46,205 --> 01:23:48,673
<i>Honey, you all know
you're across the border.</i>

1408
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,105
<i>I'll handle it, Ma.</i>

1409
01:23:51,511 --> 01:23:54,036
<i>- Hermoso. It's a beautiful cake.
- The kids are gonna love this cake.</i>

1410
01:23:54,147 --> 01:23:55,546
<i>It is beautiful.</i>

1411
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:57,912
<i>- you want cake?
- yes.</i>

1412
01:23:58,017 --> 01:24:00,349
<i>- you want cake?
yeah.</i>

1413
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:01,545
There!

1414
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:14,028
<i>Keisha. Keisha!</i>

1415
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,101
<i>Keisha! No, baby. Stop!</i>

1416
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:19,968
<i>No, we gotta give it to Jesus.
Come on, baby, give it to Jesus.</i>

1417
01:24:27,513 --> 01:24:28,980
What is this?

1418
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,176
<i>Oh, my God. It's a dish called birria.
It's for Mexican celebrations.</i>

1419
01:24:34,287 --> 01:24:35,618
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
you need to get this thing out of here.</i>

1420
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:36,710
<i>yes, I know.</i>

1421
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:40,087
<i>Hey! No, no! We are not gonna kill a goat
in this man's backyard.</i>

1422
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:43,290
<i>No goat killing in the house.</i>

1423
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,131
<i>He'll eat anything.</i>

1424
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:51,301
<i>No, no. Not in my house.
you gotta get him.</i>

1425
01:24:53,806 --> 01:24:56,297
<i>He's a goat! What the hell, bro?</i>

1426
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:58,999
What now?

1427
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:02,569
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's going on? Who did this?

1428
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:03,671
- He did!
- He did!

1429
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:11,282
<i>- Can you take care of your kids, please?
- Wendell, get the boys, please.</i>

1430
01:25:18,798 --> 01:25:20,026
<i>- Get them outside.
- Thank you, Brad.</i>

1431
01:25:20,132 --> 01:25:22,259
<i>you see that little line right there?
Off-limits.</i>

1432
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,131
Don't come in my house.

1433
01:25:24,237 --> 01:25:25,864
<i>They're just hyper, Brad. I'm sorry.</i>

1434
01:25:25,972 --> 01:25:27,098
<i>Nice.</i>

1435
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:31,433
<i>- Family.
- I know.</i>

1436
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,774
<i>- you understand?
- I understand.</i>

1437
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:43,450
<i>BOyD: Can you see it?
No.</i>

1438
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,150
<i>Look at this mess!</i>

1439
01:25:49,262 --> 01:25:52,527
<i>- He tore your bathroom up.
- I can't believe it. Look at this.</i>

1440
01:25:52,632 --> 01:25:56,090
<i>- Where's the goat?
- I don't know. Maybe he got out.</i>

1441
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:02,133
What?

1442
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,142
<i>- BOyD: What the heck?
- Go!</i>

1443
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:16,221
<i>Hey, Miguel. Down, boy. Down.</i>

1444
01:26:16,322 --> 01:26:18,187
<i>Just let him finish, then he'll go to sleep.</i>

1445
01:26:22,128 --> 01:26:23,959
<i>I got it!</i>

1446
01:26:24,063 --> 01:26:25,963
<i>- Where the...
- Get the goat!</i>

1447
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,359
<i>The goat! The goat!</i>

1448
01:26:39,578 --> 01:26:42,513
<i>Look at this.
They do some kind of ritual around here.</i>

1449
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,014
<i>I saw that goat with something on.</i>

1450
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,846
<i>- yeah. I've never seen no goat...
- I've never seen anything like this.</i>

1451
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:50,080
<i>- All Spanish weddings have goats?
- This is ridiculous.</i>

1452
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:52,180
<i>Got to pray. This is terrible.</i>

1453
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,485
<i>- Look at this.
- This is embarrassing.</i>

1454
01:26:53,592 --> 01:26:56,527
<i>Got to pray, yes.</i>

1455
01:26:56,929 --> 01:26:58,760
<i>It's all right, Luce.
We're gonna fix it right now.</i>

1456
01:26:58,864 --> 01:26:59,922
<i>- No worries.
- Call me.</i>

1457
01:27:00,566 --> 01:27:04,229
<i>Totally got it. We're all helping.
Everybody's helping.</i>

1458
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:07,431
Why is there a goat here?
Who brought a goat?

1459
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:10,065
- Dia did.
- Dia, you brought a goat?

1460
01:27:10,176 --> 01:27:12,076
<i>I bring it for the barbeque.</i>

1461
01:27:12,178 --> 01:27:15,272
<i>Marcus, you're not supposed to see me.
It's bad luck.</i>

1462
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,379
This is a disaster.

1463
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:31,160
<i>All right, everybody. Let's get this
cleaned up. We got a wedding.</i>

1464
01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:34,363
- Okay, enough.
- Okay, gum.

1465
01:27:35,634 --> 01:27:36,726
Okay.

1466
01:27:39,472 --> 01:27:43,704
<i>- I made you these.
- Oh, Mom, they're gorgeous.</i>

1467
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:44,798
Mmm-hmm.

1468
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,879
- Thank you.
- Something new.

1469
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:51,507
<i>- Thank you.
- you're welcome.</i>

1470
01:27:51,617 --> 01:27:54,415
<i>Okay. Now, I want you to come</i>

1471
01:27:57,256 --> 01:27:59,724
<i>And look at this beautiful woman.</i>

1472
01:28:02,261 --> 01:28:04,923

<i>Soft lips glistening
Got me listening to your every word</i>

<i>I can see the language barrier
beginning to blur</i>

<i>Got to have it
Though you're not an item to be won</i>

<i>But a dream too lavish to be slept on</i>

1587

<i>So I uncock my weapon</i>

1588

<i>And step unharmed
to your feminine charms</i>
