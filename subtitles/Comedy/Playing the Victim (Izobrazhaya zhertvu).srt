1
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,550
Yes, I did!

2
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,010
Yuri Chursin

3
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,430
Vitaly Khaev

4
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,970
Okay, Lyuda, turn it on.

5
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,050
It's on.

6
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,140
Okay, we are beginning
our investigative experiment.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,680
Crucian, where did you sit?

8
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,510
- At that table.
- What was next?

9
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,890
- She stood up.
- She who? She who, Crucian?

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,800
- Marinka.
- What Marinka? The victim!

11
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,550
Well, she stood up...
the victim...

12
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,680
She said
that she wanted to pee...

13
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,930
And she went to that one...

14
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,390
- Point with your hand.
- Here.

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,970
So did the victim go
to the toilet right after you came?

16
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,890
No.

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,300
What was before that?

18
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,010
We were sitting and talking.

19
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,510
What did you talk about?
Lyuda, focus!

20
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,390
Sure, sure.

21
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,390
We just talked...

22
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,850
- I was asking her...
- About what?

23
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,970
- Why she stayed at Igor's place.
- He's mumbling, I can't hear a word!

24
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,890
About what?
Say it again, louder!

25
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,800
Why she stayed at Igor's place.

26
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,850
Okay, what exactly
did you ask her about?

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,850
I've told you already!

28
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,100
It's an investigative experiment.
We are recording everything.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,100
So once again, louder
and for the camera.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,890
Or you didn't understand?

31
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,930
Marat Basharov
Andrey Fomin

32
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,010
So, Crucian, what did you ask
the victim about?

33
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,390
Why she stayed at Igor's place for
the night after the birthday.

34
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,180
Okay, Crucian, let's swim further.
What did she answer?

35
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,550
She said it had been late and dark
and she had been afraid to go home.

36
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,680
Go on.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
I told her that I love her.

38
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,640
Anyway everyone knows
that I love her.

39
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,050
But why should she stay at somebody
else's place for the night?

40
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,260
What would they say about me?

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,300
She told me to shut up
and went to take a pee.

42
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,100
Then she came up to that one
and took the keys.

43
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,390
Point with your hand.

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,390
- Were you sitting at that table?
- No, over there.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,260
Okay, let's sit down.

46
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,100
Valya, and you sit down too.

47
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,010
Igor Gasparyan
Maxim Konovalov

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,050
So, you were sitting here
and she went out?

49
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes, to take a pee.

50
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,800
And you were standing here?

51
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,550
Yes, I gave her the key
and she paid me right away.

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,100
I asked her to pay right away
before she pisses.

53
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,390
Anna Mikhalkova
Alexander Ilyin

54
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,180
I feel disgusted to take money after
because I need to work with food.

55
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,260
Okay, Crucian, go on.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,140
Then I stood up, followed her,
and knocked at the door.

57
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,220
Okay, stand up. Let's go.

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,010
Marina Golub, Fyodor Dobronravov,
Elena Morozova

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,890
Lyuda!

60
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,720
How many times did you knock?

61
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,260
- Two. Then two again.
- Okay, knock!

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,390
Seva, it's cold...

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,850
She asked, "Who is there?"

64
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,760
I said it's me.
She opened the door.

65
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,430
Okay, you open the door
for us, please.

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,260
Yes, of course, just a moment.

67
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,140
Seva, you didn't understand?

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,140
Also Starring
Liya Akhedzhakova

69
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,850
Okay, Crucian. What's next?

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,100
Nothing. Marinka opened the door

71
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,220
and that one started screaming,
demanding me to pay:

72
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,500
you can't shit together
for one price.

73
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,550
No, you know what I meant?

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,800
If you are together, even if you
are related, you must pay for two.

75
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,100
Correct?

76
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,890
I just reminded him
the regulations.

77
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,390
Okay, go on, Crucian.

78
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,600
I paid, came in,
and locked the door.

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,300
Okay, come in.

80
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,890
Just don't lock the door,
so we can see.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,220
Seva! Take the kids away.

82
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,510
Where was she? Was she sitting?

83
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,010
Yes, on the lavatory pan.

84
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,850
Okay, Valya, sit down.

85
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,180
Okay, go on.

86
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,140
I took out the knife
and stabbed her in the neck.

87
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,550
Where from did you take the knife?

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,220
From the pocket of my trousers.

89
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,030
Okay, give him... this...
Seva, find something.

90
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,430
Seva, poke this into yourself.
Check if it goes in.

91
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,260
- In what?
- In the body.

92
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,800
They should not be dangerous.

93
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,430
Shit!

94
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,050
Lyuda, hold the camera.

95
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,260
Okay, show us
how you stabbed her.

96
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,010
Like this.

97
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,350
No, like this.

98
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,300
Okay, how did the victim react?

99
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,350
- How?
- What did she do?

100
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,550
Well, she farted.

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,350
Then she began to wheeze
and fell down...

102
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,390
I don't remember.

103
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,640
What did you begin to do next?

104
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,510
I decided to dismember her.

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,800
Music Composed by
Alexander Manotskov

106
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,010
- I began to cut her hand.
- Okay, show me how you cut.

107
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,720
Her hand...

108
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,180
Like this.

109
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,760
Then when I reached her bone,

110
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,100
I thought that she had bones

111
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,850
and I wouldn't be able
to sow them.

112
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,930
Okay, why at all
did you begin to sow her?

113
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,100
Where would you put the pieces?

114
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,550
- Did you have a bag?
- I had a little bag.

115
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,390
I could wash off everything
that was left.

116
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,100
What a simpleton!
Everything would get stuck there.

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,550
How would I know? I thought there's
a pit where all shit is washed off.

118
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,680
What pit? It's a bio- toilet.

119

Director of Photography
Sergey Mokritsky R.G.C.

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,970
- I told you to shut up.
- To throw pieces into my toilet!

121
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,350
Seva, get her out of here...
Why are you laughing?

122
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,260
It's working already.

123
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,600
Okay, go on.

124
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,430
Okay, Crucian. What were we at?

125
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,640
I really thought there was a pit.

126
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,470
I decided that I need to unscrew the
lavatory pan to throw her in there.

Ulyana Savelyeva,
Leonid Zagalsky

129
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,640
I stood like this.

130
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,600
I took it and began to pull.
I pulled and pulled.

131
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,260
But it didn't give in.

132
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,390
I made myself dirty:
nobody cleans here...

133
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,390
I thought: come what may;
and I went home.

Written by
Brothers Presnyakovs

135
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,850
It seems done.

136
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,970
They charge so much and there
is no toilet paper here!

137
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,890
That's it, Lyuda. Turn it off.

139
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,800
Valya, take the ears off...

140
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,850
Seva, later, later.

141
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Renat, where are you?

142
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,390
Already?

143
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,390
Good.

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,010
No, I won't be soon.
We have a dismemberment.

145
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,050
May I go?

146
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,470
Listen, there is a big bag
in the fridge.

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,930
It's mother.

148
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,350
Mom came in the afternoon and
brought some meat. You chop it.

149
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,220
Where? On the balcony...

150
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,550
Just be careful
and don't fall through.

151
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,680
Listen, I'll come and think
of something. Maybe some soup.

152
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,350
And what do you want?

153
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,640
What?

154
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,850
PLAYING THE VICTIM

155
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,430
Valya...

156
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,680
Valya, what's the
matter with you?

157
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,260
What are you doing?

158
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,930
Dad...

159
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,140
You don't turn
the TV off again...

160
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,640
And it's winding
and winding electricity.

161
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,390
Turn it off or
we'll have to pay money.

162
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,850
Turn it off.

163
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,640
A meter, Valya.

164
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,140
Everything has a meter.

165
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,890
Electricity, us...

166
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,550
You didn't turn the TV off

167
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,260
and it winded the whole
mother's salary. Yes?

168
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,430
And she winded my meter so

169
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,550
that all my life went by in a glance
before I could look around.

170
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,680
There are such
situations in life

171
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,380
when you live and live
not suspecting anything.

172
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,180
And you've already
disturbed somebody,

173
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,220
even somebody very close to you,

174
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,720
you've disturbed
just because you live.

175
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,550
Dad, who did you disturb?

176
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,430
Valya?

177
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Dad, who?

178
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,100
Who, dad?

179
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,350
Valya, you don't sleep?
You dreamt about your father again?

180
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,910
Why are you in a hat
all of a sudden?

181
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,970
Valya, I also dream about him.
Yes, I do.

182
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,850
I don't dream about him...

183
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,510
Come on, Valya. You dream
about him or not - it's okay.

184
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,050
Where are you going?
Calm down and have a rest.

185
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,300
Valya!

186
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,770
Go to bed.

187
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,700
- Do you have problems at work?
- I am fine.

188
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,280
- And why Olya doesn't visit us?
- She just doesn't.

189
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,080
You shouldn't lead
the girl by the nose.

190
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,370
You have to make up
your mind about her.

191
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,120
Why are you taking it out?
It's all in flake- camphor.

192
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,370
Already in flake- camphor?

193
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,750
Valya, it's been a long time
already. It's enough.

194
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,080
How long?

195
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,370
Long enough.

196
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,910
And not enough for me.

197
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,410
Valya, you can't return your dad.
And we have to live.

198
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,500
I won't be making up
my mind about her.

199
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,290
I won't be making up
my mind about her.

200
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
- Who are you talking about?
- About Olya.

201
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,580
- Why?
- So you don't have an excuse.

202
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,870
- What excuse?
- That I live.

203
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,040
I don't live and
you shouldn't either!

204
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,620
Valya, I need it, you see.
I don't want to go crazy.

205
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,750
And I want!

206
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,870
Hello, uncle Peter!

207
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,870
Why did you come out?
We are talking.

208
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,370
Come on, it's so stuffy.
Can't I? I won't...

209
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,830
Valya, stop it!

210
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,450
And they pierced his ribs...

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,830
Blood and water poured out.

212
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,870
Uncle, look at my press.
It's so strong.

213
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,250
So what?

214
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,410
Try to hit it.

215
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,450
Slow down.

216
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,120
Why to slow down?
Try to hit it!

217
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,250
Come on, it's really strong.

218
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,450
Valya, wait. Come on, stop it.

219
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,660
Sonny! What happened?
Did you hit him?

220
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,200
No.

221
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,200
He asked for it himself.

222
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,000
You hit him, you moron!

223
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,750
It's not nice to be famous,
It's not what raises you up high.

224
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,790
You don't need to create an archive,
To worry about your manuscripts.

225
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,660
Self- giving is goal of creative work
And not the fuss, not success.

226
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,200
It is a shame when meaning nothing
You're a story on everybody's lips.

227
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,580
Sysoyev, come on. He is she now,
washing window standing on the sill.

228
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,950
Come on, Valya.

229
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,660
You want to help her, right?

230
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:56,660
What are you saying?
"Let me help you?"

231
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,870
Come on, show us your actions.

232
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,250
- I tell her, "Let me help you."
- I can't hear it.

233
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,330
Speak louder.

234
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,120
- I tell her, "Let me help you..."
- And?

235
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,830
She remains silent.

236
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,870
What should I do?
I tell even louder,

237
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,950
"Let me help you."

238
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,870
- "Let me help you."
- And then?

239
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,080
"Let me help you!"

240
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,620
"Let me help you!"

241
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,700
I go to the kitchen,

242
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,290
take a bucket,

243
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,330
and come to the door.

244
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,580
Come on, show it.

245
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,870
Come to the door.

246
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,000
She turned to me and said,

247
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,790
"You don't have to do anything.
Continue to rest."

248
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,120
Okay.

249
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,410
Go on, Sysoyev, go on.

250
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,700
I slammed the door
and went out to the porch.

251
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,870
Suddenly I hear a loud noise.

252
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I return to the room.

253
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,830
Window is closed,

254
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,700
and she is no longer
on the windowsill.

255
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,370
So, according to your words,
it was the draft that...

256
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,040
Yes, exactly.

257
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,410
It means the window got shut by the
draft and threw her outside, right?

258
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,200
Threw her outside.

259
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,410
Slam the door!

260
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,000
That's why this is
an investigative experiment.

261
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,950
We have to check everything out.

262
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,870
Comrade Captain,
may I get down?

263
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,580
Okay, get down, Valya.

264
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,660
Well, Sysoyev. Slam the door.

265
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,620
Here it is. I told you.
You've seen it.

266
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,750
I told you.

267
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,040
- We have to check the strength.
- Whose strength?

268
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,540
The window's!

269
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,870
With what strength
the window closes?

270
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,580
How can we understand if it
could push a person out or not?

271
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,500
Yes, well done, Lyuda.

272
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,200
Okay, Valya. Get up on the
windowsill and open the window.

273
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,790
- Comrade Captain, if he is right?
- That's what we'll try to find out.

274
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,750
- Seva, take off your belt.
- I don't have a belt.

275
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,830
How come? Are you nuts already?

276
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,700
It's part of the uniform.

277
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,410
You can take my belt in the
sleeping- room, in my trousers.

278
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,700
There are no trousers here.

279
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,160
How come there are no trousers?

280
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,790
- There aren't any here.
- And who took them?

281
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,410
Okay, Sysoyev. Calm down,
that's enough.

282
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,580
I wasn't here; my wife fell
to her death. Who could take them?

283
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,330
I wanted to ask one thing.

284
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,950
Did you seal up windows
for the winter?

285
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,540
And why?

286
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,450
Renat, why didn't you
seal up windows?

287
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,120
Look for any pantyhose with
Lycra, they are more durable.

288
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,700
We need durable...

289
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,160
Look, what you got!
Don't you know what Lycra is?

290
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,700
These are worm, woolen ones.

291
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,000
The ones with Lycra are all
shining and transparent.

292
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,250
What did I want to say?

293
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,710
I forgot everything
because of you.

294
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,700
How do you imagine it?

295
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,410
In other words, I have to wait?

296
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,910
Valya, take it. One end tie to
yourself, another - to the radiator.

297
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,540
I hope you don't mind if
you don't have a belt in your house.

298
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,450
- I had a belt.
- I had several...

299
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,830
Okay, that's it!

300
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,080
Do you love me?

301
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,250
A fool.

302
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,870
I am working. That's all.
I kiss you.

303
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,870
Okay, Valya.
You make a sailor's knot.

304
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,290
Look, if suddenly it slams
and you fly out,

305
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,370
you just tuck right away,

306
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:18,040
so you don't hit the walls.

307
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,200
Get on there.

308
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,500
Seva, take it off.

309
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,040
Hold it.

310
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Tighter. Wind it
round your hand.

311
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,120
Pull in right away.
Don't wait, Seva.

312
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,370
Okay, Valya...

313
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,870
Seva, don't wait.

314
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,290
Lyuda, pay attention.

315
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,410
Make sure to shoot all of this.

316
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,410
Okay. I'll do a panoramic view.

317
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,000
Sysoyev, let's go.

318
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,080
Sysoyev, you do it when I tell you.
Okay, on my count.

319
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,950
Valya, step closer to the edge.
Turn over there.

320
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,540
No, I can't.

321
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,120
You can't what?

322
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm afraid of height. If anything,
I'll better fall with my back first.

323
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,250
What back?
How will you tuck then?

324
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,500
I don't know. Somehow sideways...

325
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,660
How will you do it
sideways, Valya?

326
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,660
Everything you do is sideways.
Your whole life is sideways!

327
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,410
Okay. You ready, Sysoyev?

328
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,080
Yes.

329
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,540
Slam it!

330
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,000
- I didn't get it.
- There is no draft.

331
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,410
Ah, Sysoyev!
A point not in your favor.

332
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,540
You saw it yourself:
it was closing.

333
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,370
Yeah. It was closing.
And now it wasn't.

334
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,660
Okay, Sysoyev. Try it
one more time and that's it...

335
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,120
Comrade Captain.

336
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,540
Get up.

337
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,120
And you slam.

338
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,450
An unpleasant moment,
Sysoyev, isn't it?

339
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,000
But it was closing.

340
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,990
All of you saw that it
was closing. Everyone saw it.

341
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,200
Okay, enough, Sysoyev. Enough...

342
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,870
No, it isn't enough.

343
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,540
Comrade Captain,
let's try one more time.

344
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,540
Get out of here.

345
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,910
Okay, it's done. We are leaving.

346
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Keys... Keys...

347
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,750
So what? Is that all?

348
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,540
Let's seal the apartment up.

349
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,250
Do you want to get married?

350
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,450
Married?

351
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,160
Do you have your
passport with you?

352
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,450
What do you mean?

353
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,870
Let's register our
marriage right away.

354
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,830
Ah, you are playing the fool!

355
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,000
You know that you
badly hurt me now.

356
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,030
No, I am serous.
Do you hear me?

357
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,620
I am very serious.

358
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,120
Let's go to your place.

359
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,790
No!

360
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,040
First you talk to the boy!

361
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,500
Come on. Your boy
will turn 30 soon.

362
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,200
He is upset.

363
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,330
He is very upset.

364
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,950
Go on, feel sorry for him!

365
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,080
- He won't feel sorry for you.
- What are you talking about now?

366
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,250
You know what I am talking about.

367
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,250
What's the matter, Valya?

368
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,330
You are crazy.

369
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,580
- Hello, aunt Galya.
- Hi, Kostya.

370
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,500
Okay, I'm off now.

371
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Alone...

372
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,450
Listen, could you
strangle me a little bit?

373
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,000
How? You mean with my hands?

374
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,370
No.

375
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,700
Keep touching me with your hands.

376
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,080
But I need at that moment
to have not enough air,

377
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,040
to really suffocate...

378
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,410
Oh, scarfing.

379
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,200
What scarfing?

380
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,830
It's called so.
I've read in Marie Claire.

381
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,620
Jerk- offs do it like this: beat of
and strangle themselves with scarf.

382
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,450
It intensifies the sensation.

383
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,040
No, on the contrary,
I need to put it down.

384
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,000
- Put down what?
- The sensation.

385
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,250
Cut off oxygen for me!

386
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,140
Slow down, relax.

387
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,070
I am fine.

388
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,610
If only you thought
about me just a little,

389
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,360
we'd be married long ago.

390
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,150
But who am I?
What am I talking about?

391
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,400
You don't need it!

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,700
You decided, what would
you say why we have to part?

393
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,860
Don't think too much.

394
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,490
We are kind of together anyway,

395
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,990
playing that you are my man
and I am your woman!

396
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,650
The only thing hurts my feelings:

397
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,570
at 33 I'll have to go out,
make somebody fall in love with me,

398
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,700
look for somebody anew.

399
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,950
I can't get acquainted
with anybody or talk.

400
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,070
I ran out of steam on you
about 5 years ago.

401
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,950
I am exhausted.

402
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,610
I don't have any interests left.

403
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,740
Who am I going to catch?

404
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,700
I'll have to play that
I'm interested in a person

405
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,400
to get him to marry me...

406
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,150
Valya!

407
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,360
Hello, Olya.

408
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,650
Get up. Totally grew lazy.

409
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,860
Got a scarf on!

410
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,900
He used to sleep with his hat on.
And now the scarf.

411
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,820
Valya, go and get some bread.

412
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,650
- Which should I get?
- Get Moskovsky long loaf.

413
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,570
- And if they don't have it?
- Get pita then.

414
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,990
Pita? Isn't it dangerous?

415
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,320
- Pita is bread too. Even tastier.
- Tastier...

416
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,110
But we are at war with them.

417
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,530
- With whom?
- With those who bake pita.

418
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,400
<i>-But they live here.
- Who?</i>

419
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,280
Who bake pita. They live here.

420
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,350
They are still part of them.

421
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,740
So what, not to buy pita now?

422
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,110
I don't know. You could
venture, of course.

423
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,860
But what if they get
a secret order to poison all pita.

424
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,400
Even you said,
pita is tastier than our bread.

425
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,280
- Even tastier than a long loaf, yes?
- Yes.

426
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,280
So, all this pita will be bought.

427
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,070
And then boom...
Since they got their orders.

428
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,360
But everyone would know who did it!

429
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,400
Of course, it just would be late.

430
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,030
We would have already
eaten their pita.

431
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,530
Hey, sister, come here.
You will go to Moscow.

432
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,490
- Brother, why should I go to Moscow?
- You'll find out soon.

433
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,450
Be careful!
The doors are closing...

434
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,450
What's your name?

435
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,950
17 years old! No!

436
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,740
We continue to fight
with our world terrorism.

437
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,030
I think we'll do
without bread today.

438
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,650
I'll cook noodles.
Noodles are like bread.

439
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,580
And tomorrow I'll get it myself.

440
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,360
Whatever you say.

441
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,320
I'll pick it myself and buy it.

442
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,820
Let's go, Olya. You'll help me.

443
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,570
It's okay, don't cry.

444
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,320
Don't take cheese away.

445
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,650
Here is a chicken.

446
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,280
Crab sticks for the salad.

447
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,480
Olya, in school Valya was made
to go to the swimming pool.

448
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,740
- To the swimming pool?
- Yes.

449
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,400
In third grade they
started to take him there.

450
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,860
- And he was afraid of water.
- Really?

451
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,400
His father wanted
to teach him to swim.

452
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,200
He took him in the boat
to the middle of the river.

453
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,610
And threw him out.
He thought Valya would swim.

454
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,320
And he almost drowned.

455
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,240
So, he even doesn't approach water.

456
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,950
- We'll put it here.
- And so?

457
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,320
And nothing.
You put bananas here.

458
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,990
Imagine, he specially didn't take
second swimming trunks with him.

459
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,490
And they don't let you in a pool
in the ones you have on...

460
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,650
And he pretended that he forgot,
because he was afraid.

461
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,820
If you try to persuade him,

462
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,860
he'll pretend and
you'll get nothing from him.

463
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,150
Tell me as a woman,
will you live with him?

464
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,070
Yes.

465
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,650
Yes? Do you know
what is to be done?

466
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,610
No.

467
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,610
Olya... You've got it?

468
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,030
Come on, no more tears.

469
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,650
Take the matches and
let's go to cook noodles.

470
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,110
No. I already said that
he needs second swimming trunks.

471
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,570
I said. That's it.

472
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,360
Fuck it, Valya!

473
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,200
I warned you that we'd be
in the swimming pool.

474
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,990
I didn't know
that second pair is needed!

475
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,280
What's the big deal?

476
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,780
What's the big deal?

477
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,320
I told you not to jump in!

478
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,950
My trunks are clean!
I put them on today!

479
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,820
- No!
- Please. I even didn't pee today.

480
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,200
- So what?
- There is no even a single stain.

481
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,070
- Look, how many germs are there.
- And no germs on the second ones?

482
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,990
No! They are clean!
You don't wear them outside!

483
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,400
But they are clean!

484
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,860
How they can be clean
if you've put them on!

485
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,030
All kinds of stuff are on them!
And we put chlorine in the pool!

486
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,610
We follow all regulations!
Girls, let's go!

487
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,900
Okay, that's it!

488
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,610
Then we'll be right here,
on the bank,

489
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,950
on the edge.

490
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,400
Okay, Lyuda.

491
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,110
Alright, girls, breathe deeply...

492
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,780
- Lyuda, did you turn it on?
- Yes, already.

493
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,200
Okay. We start an investigative
experiment in the case of Takhirov.

494
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,820
Zakirov.

495
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,280
Yes, Zakirov Takhir.

496
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,820
- Remember, no one gets in water!
- We got you!

497
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,150
I'll watch you and I'll see!

498
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,070
Zakirov, how did you get
in the swimming pool?

499
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,700
<i>-By ticket.
- And the victim?</i>

500
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,780
She had a season ticket.

501
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,200
So, you knew that when you come
with your ticket she would be here?

502
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,570
Yes, I did.

503
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,320
Okay. Where was the victim?

504
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,570
Here, in the second lane.

505
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:44,320
<i>-Okay, did she see you?
- Nah, I not wanted she see me.</i>

506
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,450
He didn't want her
to see him, yes?

507
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,490
Yes.

508
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,990
<i>-Okay, what did you do next?
- I jumped into the pool.</i>

509
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,490
Okay. Let's pretend
that you jumped right here.

510
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,900
But don't go into water!

511
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,450
Approximately like this.

512
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,900
Yeah. A circus with horses.

513
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,950
Seva, don't you know
what to do with your hands?

514
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,150
Oh, Valya. Fuck it!

515
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,280
I warned you that we
would be at the pool!

516
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,820
What am I going to do now?

517
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,110
And I have to close
the case by tomorrow.

518
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,240
Comrade Captain, I didn't know.

519
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,990
I put clean trunks on purpose.

520
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,990
I didn't know I have to bring them.

521
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,200
Okay, Zakhi...

522
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,320
Zakirov.

523
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,240
Okay, Zakirov. You're in water.
What's next?

524
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,450
I am in water... She's grinning.

525
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,280
Her friends were there.

526
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,490
She's crying to them...

527
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,200
I dove right away.

528
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,320
Okay, you dove, yes?

529
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,240
Come on, squat down.

530
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,900
Okay. And then?

531
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,950
Then I swam towards her.

532
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,030
Okay, how far did you swim?

533
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,400
Well, 10, 15...
Not more than 7 yards.

534
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,030
Okay, Valya.
Stand 10 yards away from him.

535
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:43,240
Okay, Zakirov.
Imagine that he is the victim.

536
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,320
Swim towards her,
I mean towards him,

537
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,860
and do what you did
with the victim.

538
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,740
Swim.

539
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:05,450
Fuck it, Valya! We even found
second swimming trunks for Takhir.

540
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,740
And you were coming
from home, not from jail.

541
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,900
Comrade Captain,
I really didn't know.

542
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,530
Is it a children playground here
for you? This is a crime site.

543
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,990
Is this clown tired?

544
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,860
Come on, show us!

545
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,610
I don't remember well...

546
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,200
I swam up to her.

547
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,360
She was floundering about
with her feet, splashing around.

548
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,820
Okay, try to remember...

549
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,650
I started looking for her feet.

550
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,200
Because there were
other feet there.

551
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,740
And she had green nail polish
on her foot, a green pedicure.

552
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,610
I found it...

553
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,320
Listen, why are you standing? Help
me, flounder about with your feet.

554
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,990
Come on, Valya.

555
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:19,280
What are you smiling at? Move your
feet. Do something today already.

556
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,320
Then I swam up to her.

557
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,740
I grabbed her feet and pulled
them to me, as if she dove.

558
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,150
Okay, grab him and pull,
as if you are under water.

559
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,030
Grab him.

560
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,200
She was floundering about
with her feet there.

561
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,570
Stop floundering!

562
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,990
I let her go
and swam to the other side.

563
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,110
I got out and left.

564
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,200
When she came to the surface,
they thought she was swimming.

565
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,900
And I left.

566
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,490
Hey, where are you going?

567
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,650
And how long he hanged under water?

568
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,360
At least six minutes.

569
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,450
Six?

570
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,990
You're thinking in the
right direction, Lyuda!

571
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,280
It means he at first
swam to her about 30 feet,

572
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,820
then he was holding her,

573
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,570
and then swam away.

574
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,990
Zakirov, did you show
everything right to us?

575
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,280
Yes. It happened like that.
More or less.

576
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,740
I loved her, Comrade Captain.

577
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,320
I loved her and she didn't.

578
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,610
She didn't love me.

579
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,780
She was just playing.

580
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,570
I did everything I could for her.

581
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,610
And she began to live
with my brother.

582
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,070
How could she?

583
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,530
I begged her. I stood on
my knees. I begged him.

584
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,200
I was telling him,
"You're my brother."

585
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,820
I gave her everything that I could.

586
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,030
You need pantyhose - please,
as many as you like.

587
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,650
I always told her
to come by and pick out.

588
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,360
One of each, two of each.

589
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,650
You need pantyhose - please.

590
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,240
Chocolate - only foreign.

591
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,860
English Karli- Varli.

592
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,110
The best chocolate.

593
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,110
I gave her three bars at a time,
treated her friends.

594
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,650
Okay, Zakirov.
Stop singing songs.

595
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,650
Let's keep silence now.

596
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,360
How long is it?

597
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,780
Zakirov, were you
without an aqualung?

598
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:51,610
Yes. I was without an aqualung,
just in swimming trunks.

599
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,360
We have to check it.

600
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,070
It doesn't add up.

601
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,320
Is he like a fish?
Or like a pearl diver?

602
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,050
Even they can't make it
so long without air.

603
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,570
Okay, Zakirov. I'll
note down the time now.

604
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,320
I'll tell you when to start,

605
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,070
and you hold your breath
as long as you can.

606
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,030
We have to check it.

607
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,990
- Got it?
- Yes.

608
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,200
Let's go.

609
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,700
Not to breath?

610
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,950
- Are you breathing?
- I wait when you tell me to start.

611
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,110
He is waiting...

612
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,700
- Hold your breath!
- I got you.

613
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,610
But how long?

614
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,570
What kind of day it is today!

615
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,570
- What's his name?
- Takhirov.

616
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,110
Takhirov! I'll wave my hand now
and you hold your breath.

617
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,950
Hold it as long as you can.

618
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,700
-Got it?
- No.

619
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,320
- What don't you get?
- My name is Zakirov, not Takhirov.

620
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,200
Listen.

621
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Listen,

622
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,400
Zakirov.

623
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,570
If you don't get us quickly,

624
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,110
we'll tape your mouth and nostrils
and take tape off in half an hour.

625
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,900
We'll see what kind of a
fucking diver you are!

626
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,610
Explain me, what I should do.
I don't resist.

627
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,200
Close your mouth and don't breathe.
Let me know when you run out of air.

628
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,320
I got it.

629
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,030
Done! No more air.

630
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,360
Shit!

631
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,030
Shit!

632
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:43,320
What a freak!

633
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,490
He didn't hold on
even a minute, bitch.

634
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,650
Maybe to slay him here,
in this swimming pool!

635
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,520
Hello, Renat. Where are you?

636
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,100
Watch it.

637
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,150
Look, there's a chance
to go to a pool.

638
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,690
On Saturday.
And what are you doing?

639
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,350
I see. Meeting of the classmates.

640
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,020
15 years since graduation.
Will the girls be there?

641
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,100
You were studying
with the girls, or what?

642
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,230
I know all this.

643
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,310
You'll meet, have a drink,
and everything will start anew.

644
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,230
You think I haven't been
to such parties?

645
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,600
I see. I'll go alone.

646
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,940
I won't go with you.

647
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,850
What I have to do there?
It isn't interesting for me.

648
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,150
And imagine, it's
interesting in the pool.

649
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:46,020
We have a totally different level of
integration into culture with you.

650
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,230
Look, and maybe it wasn't he?

651
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,520
And who?

652
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,630
How could he if he couldn't?

653
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,810
Maybe he did it some other way.

654
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,650
What a freak!

655
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,440
- Freak.
- What a freak.

656
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,020
- Damn with him.
- Yeah, damn with him.

657
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,560
- We've held our experiment. Right?
- Yeah, right.

658
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,350
No one saw him,
because he dove at once.

659
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,560
Right.

660
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,730
- That's it...
- That's it!

661
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,770
Something comes together
and it's okay.

662
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,400
Okay then.

663
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,440
A good pool, isn't it?

664
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,270
Zakirov, is a ticket here expensive?

665
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,150
Yes.

666
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,520
But by season ticket it's cheaper.
I bought for one visit.

667
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,650
I thought it would be
enough to drown her.

668
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,650
Lyuda, maybe we'll go here
together and swim?

669
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,400
You swim with your family.

670
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,350
I have a bath with my family.

671
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,230
Let's do it with you.

672
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,190
- Was it on?
- Compromising stuff.

673
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,650
- Come on.
- Compromising stuff.

674
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,440
Give it to me!

675
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,770
Erase the end.

676
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:25,480
Move it, Zakirov!
Stop mumbling at once!

677
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,600
Listen, Zakirov. How did you
hold your breath under water?

678
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,350
With my arse.

679
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,940
- Valya!
- What?

680
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,730
I am tired. I'll go to study.

681
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,310
- Where?
- In the university.

682
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,480
You studied there. Tell me,
what faculty is the best.

683
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,100
They are all the same.

684
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,150
Why do you need it?

685
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,810
It will be easier for me
with higher education.

686
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,810
You think I should catch
creeps my entire life?

687
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,100
Why are you playing?

688
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:02,600
You are looking for a
high paying, prestigious job?

689
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,350
- And what's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

690
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,520
Just why should you walk
the roundabout paths

691
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:14,480
to the target that is
half a yard away from you.

692
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,230
Here is your devoted
genie Takhirov,

693
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:22,310
who'll make all your wishes come
true if you set him free.

694
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:28,770
He is the prisoner of the lamp,
and you can become Aladdin.

695
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,190
What? How? No.

696
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,900
And why are you afraid?

697
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,520
We'd tell captain that he ran away.

698
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,520
The worst that will happen to you:
you'll get fired.

699
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,060
And you'll help the man.

700
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,730
He isn't guilty at all.

701
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,980
She's guilty.

702
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,100
It's just very simple.

703
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,900
This one will be gone
in seconds.

704
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,730
He'll get to his mountains,
and you'll get your reward.

705
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,770
Listen, I'll do whatever you want.

706
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,980
We have a car. White one.

707
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,350
I'll give you money.
As much as you want. Honest.

708
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:17,520
Let me go before they come back.

709
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,310
Listen to your buddy.

710
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,350
Whatever you say,
I'll do everything.

711
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,940
- Come on. How...
- What are you waiting for?

712
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:29,730
Look, one minute more and his hairy
arse will be a dot in the horizon.

713
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,770
And you will be in a white car
with a heap of cash.

714
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,350
Go ahead.

715
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,600
I was joking, Seva.

716
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,150
We'd serve life for this dude.

717
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,190
And even if he gets away...

718
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,520
Please, pass me
the key over there...

719
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,940
You think he'll be looking
for us to thank us?

720
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:25,150
He'll just sing against us.

721
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,850
Why were you saying
all that crap to me?

722
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,520
So, that you'd get
the essence of the moral.

723
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,730
What is it?

724
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,400
Moral, Seva, is in the ways
of satisfying the needs.

725
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,350
You study and work.

726
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,520
Live calmly, save your salary.

727
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:46,850
That's what human being is.
Normal member of the society.

728
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,480
Takhirov didn't know that,

729
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,770
and here is the result:
he's in handcuffs!

730
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,600
It's so easy to stumble, Seva. And
I don't want it to happen to you.

731
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,600
You like naked men?

732
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,230
- Do you have latest newspaper?
- Yes.

733
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,810
Go fuck yourself!

734
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,730
Brother, Seva, come on!

735
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,900
Come here!

736
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:20,520
Shut up, I said!

737
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,440
Come here, fast!

738
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Dress him! That's it!
To the station!

739
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,900
Excuse us!

740
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,020
Excuse us, please!

741
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,150
Excuse us!

742
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,810
How long should I wait for you?

743
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,980
Hush!

744
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,270
- What's up?
- He's expressing remorse...

745
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,190
He just asks to be sent
far away to Siberia.

746
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,730
He wants to purify
himself spiritually.

747
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,350
He went into such hysteric here.

748
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,560
He isn't the first one,
he isn't the last one.

749
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,020
And as far as Siberia goes,

750
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,100
it'll be up to the court to decide.

751
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,900
It's not for him to choose.

752
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,810
Not necessarily in Siberia.

753
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,020
We have a lot of places
like that in Russia.

754
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,400
Let's go to the balcony
and have a smoke.

755
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,940
Smoke here. Why should you
go outside?

756
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,600
Can we?

757
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:42,150
No. Go out to the balcony.

758
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,310
Let's go and have a smoke.

759
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,310
You go, I don't smoke anyway.

760
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,060
Let's go, you'll make me a company.

761
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,650
Let's go and have a drink...

762
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:05,980
Come on, go with your
uncle to the balcony.

763
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:12,480
And I'll clean up everything here.

764
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,560
Come in and let's talk.

765
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,440
Come on in.

766
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:48,020
Why do you stay at the doors?

767
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,900
Are you afraid or what?

768
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,980
What's the matter with you?

769
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:02,350
I'm just joking with you.

770
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,400
Fill it up!

771
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,600
Your mother asked me to talk to you.

772
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:22,230
Your mother and I will live together.

773
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,560
An ordinary dinner and he died...

774
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,020
Who?

775
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,400
My father. Your brother.

776
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,690
Oh, yeah. But you know,
he had problems.

777
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,150
He dined and died.
It usually happens.

778
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,520
Whom did he have problems with -
you or my mother?

779
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:51,980
With his health, Valya.

780
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,520
Why do you use these chopsticks?

781
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,730
To make life more complicated...

782
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,270
I understand if you ate
what they eat with them.

783
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,440
And what do they eat with them?

784
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:27,190
Raw fish, rice pellets.

785
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,100
Whatever these narrow- eyed eat.

786
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:36,560
And in Russia, Valya, you need
a spoon in order to live!

787
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:39,900
To grab more and eat.

788
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:44,020
And not to peck like them
with the sticks.

789
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,520
Look here.

790
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,440
We put a scoop on the stick,

791
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,650
because a stick alone
isn't enough for our table.

792
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,900
How will you pull the food
toward you?

793
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,690
And here, look.
It's comfortable.

794
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,810
You see? Comfortable.

795
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Let them meditate at their Orient.

796
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,150
And peck with their sticks.

797
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,770
You know, uncle, after
Genghis Khan all boundaries

798
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,060
between East and West
have been erased.

799
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:28,850
Maybe they have been erased for you.

800
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,190
But not for me.

801
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,900
And not for your mother.

802
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:41,520
Were there Nazis in the village
where you were born?

803
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,270
Occupation?

804
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,900
That's why you take care
of European culture so much!

805
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,940
The German blood boils!
Appeals to you!

806
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:26,600
Listen, you scum!

807
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,730
Start your own family and move out!

808
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,940
And your mother and I
will live here!

809
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,850
Scum... With these chopsticks.

810
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,690
Beast.

811
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:11,440
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. You don't exist. Killed.

812
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,230
Scum.

813
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,690
- And what, you cook raw fish?
- Yes.

814
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:19,560
- And people order it?
- Yes.

815
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,980
- And they eat it?
- Yes.

816
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,480
Just great!

817
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,900
And how much is it?

818
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,690
It's different.

819
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:39,230
There are 15 types of
sushi alone on the menu.

820
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,400
From 2 euros.

821
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:51,060
Yeah? No. I am afraid of worms.

822
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,150
You get worms from raw fish.

823
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:57,230
And then they live inside a man.

824
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,600
Okay. We'll continue.

825
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,850
It isn't funny anymore.

826
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:08,190
Tomorrow morning
we'll go to see mother.

827
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,560
So what, that she's healthy
like a horse?

828
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,230
Shouldn't we visit the healthy ones?

829
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,060
She loves us, really.

830
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,400
Renat, she loves us.

831
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,560
Yes, and you too!

832
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:39,350
And you're in kimono...
Are you from Japan?

833
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:47,230
No, it was the manager's idea.

834
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:53,100
There are a lot of
Japanese restaurants now.

835
01:10:54,020 --> 01:11:00,350
So they do their best
to cash on this exotic.

836
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,560
Till the first emergency,
so to say.

837
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,560
It's a dangerous business.

838
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:17,150
Over there... you have
to study for a long time

839
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:21,440
to be able to cook all this crap.

840
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,650
There is a fish there,

841
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,400
if you cut it wrong,
it emits poison...

842
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,350
Come on.

843
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,020
- How is it called?
- Fuga.

844
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:34,270
Fuga.

845
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,810
The most expensive fish.

846
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,850
Vasya, our chef, cooked it recently.

847
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,940
He drank a little for courage.

848
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:46,310
He cut this fish and served it.

849
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,440
Whole staff stood there and
watched to see what happens.

850
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:54,440
- And what?
- Vasya!

851
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:58,980
We ran out of sake
and served heated Russian vodka.

852
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,770
Maybe that's why we got along then.

853
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:07,230
But everybody got
real tense though...

854
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:11,470
I am fine.
We are in a restaurant.

855
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,510
I can't today.
We're investigating.

856
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,600
Yes, he's here too.

857
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,600
Because he is my boss.

858
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,510
And we have a murder here.

859
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,430
Yes, a murder.

860
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,050
Hello.

861
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,390
Hello!

862
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,510
No, I am at work.

863
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,100
Why you wear kimono, I asked.

864
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,800
I'm saying it.
Our manager told me,

865
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,720
when I retired from the theater.

866
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:07,140
Samurais are standing at every
corner in the restaurants now.

867
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,850
- Samurais?
- Yes.

868
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:13,260
He meant the restaurants like ours.

869
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:17,760
And you, he said,

870
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:22,220
would be an old
Japanese woman with a past.

871
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,850
Right now.

872
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,350
With a past.

873
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:40,010
So that it'd be different from
others. Get it? So it'd catch you!

874
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,300
Teahouse like a bonbonniere

875
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,930
Rolled in blooming roses.

876
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,260
From the deck of
English gunboat,

877
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:58,430
One sailor stepped down
at that moment.

878
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:04,010
He stepped down there
as it had to be

879
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,930
To meet all famous sailors.

880
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:13,050
He asked for wine
and a cup of tea

881
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,720
And couldn't say anything else.

882
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:22,220
And in the corner,
a beautiful Japanese girl

883
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,430
Sang something softly about love.

884
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,850
He remembered his native land,

885
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:35,510
Sea blood began to boil in him.

886
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,430
And in the morning
the gunboat again

887
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,640
Set its sails on the order.

888
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,470
Why did the Japanese girl cry so?

889
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,140
And why was the sailor so cheerful?

890
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,350
Ten years passed by like in a tale.

891
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,850
And the girl's son was growing up.

892
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,720
He childly opened his eyes wide

893
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,640
And asked, "And who is my father?"

894
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:26,010
And the beautiful Japanese woman,

895
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,220
Tenderly fingering her son's hand,

896
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:35,220
Answered her sweet little boy,

897
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:39,260
<i>"Your father was
an English sailor!"</i>

898
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:44,390
So pour me stronger wine.

899
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:48,510
How many roses are blooming
in my garden.

900
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,350
Wine makes it easier for me,

901
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,640
Because I'm still in love with him!

902
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:09,390
I beg you. We have to open
in 15 minutes...

903
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,140
If you don't sing...

904
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:17,140
I am the witness here!

905
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,850
Okay, we still need her.

906
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,550
All right.

907
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:26,100
When you finish with your
testimony, come to my office.

908
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,220
I will! I will.

909
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:32,970
- I am testifying, and this one...
- 15 minutes.

910
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,260
- Lyuda, turn it on.
- Already.

911
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,350
- Okay, Verkhushkin.
- Yes.

912
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,430
With what purpose did you
come to the restaurant?

913
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,930
Ten years. Anniversary
of graduation.

914
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,180
Be specific. What graduation?

915
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,970
From Astronaut's College or what?

916
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,300
Ten years since we
graduated from school.

917
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,510
- We gathered here...
- Who is "we"?

918
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,720
Our class, former class.

919
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,890
Was the victim from your
class as well?

920
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:18,250
Yes. Horse and I
sat together in class.

921
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,800
What horse?

922
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:23,720
This is his nickname, Horse.
We were friends.

923
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,680
Okay, you were friends.

924
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,760
Step aside from here.

925
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,760
Bring me the menu.
And come back at once.

926
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,010
Well done.

927
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,550
And where did you sit here?

928
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,260
Also together.

929
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:50,510
I sat here and Horse opposite,
at your place.

930
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,350
Okay, Valya. Sit down.

931
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,970
- What, again?
- I'm bringing the menu!

932
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,300
You'll be instead of
Horse today.

933
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:02,140
Okay, you were sitting.
What were you talking about?

934
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:07,300
And right away about why, where,
from what did you shoot at Horse?

935
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:10,100
At the victim...

936
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,680
- What's this?
- These are rolls.

937
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:17,970
When we had a drink,

938
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:22,140
he began to bait me
in front of everybody.

939
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,390
I own a car wash.

940
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,640
And he told me
to finish my food quickly,

941
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:32,010
because he wanted me
to wash his car.

942
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:36,890
And what's the difference between
the rolls and these sushi?

943
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,550
It's the same shit.

944
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:46,050
Rolls just have caviar
sprinkled on the top.

945
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,350
Okay, Lyuda!

946
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,260
Why exactly did you shoot him?

947
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,430
I told him to stop laughing,

948
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,550
and he kept laughing loudly.

949
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,050
I tell him to stop laughing,

950
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,930
and he kept laughing loudly.

951
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,970
Okay, go on!

952
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,350
I told him, let's go outside.

953
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:06,550
He says, let's go.

954
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,510
We got up.

955
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,350
Okay, get up.

956
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,390
- Did the victim get up too?
- Yes.

957
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,180
Valya, get up!

958
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,760
So, how did you go? Who was first?

959
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,760
He went first, and then me.

960
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,140
He went to the bar, to that doll.

961
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,100
Yeah, he just walked up to me,

962
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:34,180
and that one shot at him
right away!

963
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:38,720
I felt at once that
something would happen now!

964
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,140
And it did.

965
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,100
I feel it every day,

966
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:49,720
especially when they have their
graduation celebrations here.

967
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:52,510
Graduates!

968
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,430
Wait, wait!

969
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:58,600
He went. And where were you?

970
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:02,010
Let me adopt a pose.

971
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,220
Like this!

972
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,430
It's me - the last thing
he saw in his life!

973
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,800
Valya, go to her!

974
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:34,850
He came up to her
and said something.

975
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,760
I took out my gun

976
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:41,970
and popped off at his head twice.

977
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,140
- You popped off!
- Yes, I popped.

978
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,140
He popped.

979
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,720
They weren't BB's,

980
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,760
with real bullets.

981
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:09,430
Just like kids. Fucking bastards!

982
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,970
Shit, shit!

983
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:20,100
They buy everything for
themselves, fucking fagots!

984
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,550
And we have to go
and clean up after them!

985
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,760
Fuckhead!

986
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,260
Where did you get the gun?

987
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:30,010
Where did you get the gun!

988
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,680
Where do you get everything?

989
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:35,600
Where the fuck did you
fly in here from?

990
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:41,300
I never thought in my life that I'd
get in such fucking environment!

991
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:47,140
Where from all of you flew in?

992
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:53,260
You went to the same schools,
had the same teachers.

993
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:57,430
Your parents are almost
of my fucking age.

994
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,970
What did they make you from?
Out of what?

995
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,510
All of you!

996
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,850
Shit, this one forgets his swimming
trunks going to the pool.

997
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,220
This fagot pops off at the guy
he sat next to in school.

998
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:15,300
What the fuck do you need in life?

999
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:19,800
How do you want to live it?

1000
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:22,220
And this one too, fuck!

1001
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,850
What the fuck have
you done yesterday?

1002
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:29,300
No, I don't fucking understand you.

1003
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,720
I don't, though I'm not old yet.

1004
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,760
And I don't understand them.

1005
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:39,350
How is it possible
to sew up a police inspector?

1006
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,180
- What's his name?
- Semakin.

1007
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:46,010
To sew up Semakin, dress him
in a woman's clothes like a whore,

1008
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,970
and throw him drunken
into the holding cell.

1009
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,800
I don't get it!

1010
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:58,640
And all of you
are not such milksops.

1011
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,140
All of you are almost 30!

1012
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,720
At your age I already had
a kid and a wife!

1013
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:11,260
Where did you get all those
woman's clothes?

1014
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:16,260
Those slutty pantyhose...

1015
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,970
I went to get my mom's one.

1016
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,720
Your mom's?

1017
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,050
Your mom's...

1018
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,390
Wasn't it bloody hard for you
to go for them?

1019
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,850
No, at the most, on April Fools'
day, on day of humor,

1020
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:38,800
I put mustard instead of
my wife's toothpaste.

1021
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,010
This is a normal joke.

1022
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,850
And what about you?

1023
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:46,010
And the most important is
that you don't give a fuck!

1024
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:49,100
And you don't give a fuck
that you don't give a fuck.

1025
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:53,640
But it's you, your generation,

1026
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:58,180
you drive trains, fly planes.

1027
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,260
Lawyers by the way.

1028
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:06,390
Work at nuclear plants!

1029
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:11,680
And most importantly,
why the fuck do you go to work?

1030
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,180
Don't give a fuck

1031
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:17,600
and go to such responsible jobs.

1032
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,140
And then everything goes
to shit in our society!

1033
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,050
I'll call police now.

1034
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:29,300
Stasik, calm down.

1035
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:32,600
Come on... He popped off.
I am calm, I am calm...

1036
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:35,890
Come on, bring that fish.
Your fish and sake.

1037
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,140
If I don't try it now, I never will.

1038
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,000
- You mean that one?
- That, poisoned one.

1039
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,890
Vasya, bring fuga.

1040
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,180
Shit!

1041
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,010
- He popped off. Popped...
- Stasik...

1042
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,930
Go to the arse,
somewhere to the nearby table,

1043
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,970
where I can't see you...

1044
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,550
How long has it been?
4, 8, 16...

1045
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,180
Okay, I started to be fan at 14.

1046
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:12,680
Our soccer team has been
fucking with me for 26 years!

1047
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:17,800
No, there were successes before:
we made it to the finals.

1048
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:21,220
But now, fuck, every
championship goes to shit.

1049
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:24,760
You wait four years,
and then what?

1050
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:28,600
Because the same stupid
asses like you play.

1051
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,470
They don't give a fuck.

1052
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,510
And most importantly,
they learned to pretend!

1053
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,680
They used to protest before.

1054
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:43,140
It was a public position: we don't
fucking need a thing and we protest.

1055
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,850
And now it's all hush- hush,
no protests.

1056
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:52,140
They pretend to be whoever is
needed, get any job they want.

1057
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,390
And don't do a shit.
Just screw around!

1058
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,350
You're screwing around with life.

1059
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:02,180
And those, who take it seriously,
go crazy, suffer.

1060
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,850
You have to fucking play in soccer.

1061
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,430
And they take make- up artists
and stylists with them.

1062
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,800
And in the end, they fucking loose!

1063
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,180
You have to think there,
how to score a goal.

1064
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:22,470
And this asshole is combing
his permed pubes,

1065
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,890
so that they stand up
in the rain.

1066
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:28,680
He doesn't listen to the coach
during the break but fixes his hair.

1067
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,350
Fill it up, mother.

1068
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,140
Shit, this isn't food.
It's some mindfuck!

1069
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:02,600
And everything should be quiet,

1070
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
"popped off", "caught up"...

1071
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,930
They understood it

1072
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:12,260
that in order to be left the fuck
alone they have to pretend.

1073
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:22,300
It's a global fuck- up...

1074
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,890
on all social levels...

1075
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,640
And what do you want?

1076
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:33,300
I took the number 26 tram yesterday.

1077
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,260
I ask the driver

1078
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:39,470
whether his tram goes
along Malyshev Street.

1079
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,600
And he replies,
"How the fuck should I know?"

1080
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,680
Just imagine, driver doesn't know
the streets on route of his tram!

1081
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,350
- And what did he tell you?
- Who?

1082
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,140
This Horse.

1083
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,720
Spit on it...

1084
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,140
Spit...

1085
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,220
He said, spit on it.

1086
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:05,180
Maybe he wanted to spit
on everything! But he had no time...

1087
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,970
He was killed...

1088
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:11,550
His schoolfellow relaxed!

1089
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:15,140
- Are you done?
- Done!

1090
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,640
Get lost!

1091
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,140
Spit on it...

1092
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,350
Slide apart.

1093
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,010
Well done...

1094
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:24,470
I'm happy, very happy...

1095
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:28,100
Me too. I'm very happy. Well done!

1096
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:31,430
You've really been
a man here, Valya!

1097
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:35,260
But of course... It's bad

1098
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:40,930
if a baby is born and
you aren't married. You see?

1099
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:45,510
We thought and decided that we
wouldn't go for a honeymoon

1100
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,300
and we wouldn't have a wedding.

1101
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:51,430
No, how come?
We have to drink to this.

1102
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:54,970
- Valya, we have to drink to this.
- We'll drink.

1103
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,930
- It's just necessary.
- We'll surely drink.

1104
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,760
Come on.

1105
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:18,430
Come on.

1106
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,510
Like this?

1107
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,180
You're right that you
won't have a wedding.

1108
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,760
Why should you feed them?

1109
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:43,180
You'll buy something
you need on this money.

1110
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,680
- A washer.
- Yes.

1111
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,470
And do you use
the chopsticks, do you?

1112
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,850
And you?

1113
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,050
The fish is really good.

1114
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,720
- Where did you buy it?
- In a restaurant!

1115
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:10,890
It should be expensive.

1116
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,640
It's okay. Today is a special day.

1117
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,390
Pour me just a little.

1118
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,100
That's enough.

1119
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:29,050
So what, Valya? Are we eating right?

1120
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,180
Right!

1121
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,350
You know, it's comfortable
for me with these fingers.

1122
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,180
Is it right?

1123
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:38,300
Right.

1124
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:41,220
And why don't you eat yourself?

1125
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,800
I'm listening to you.

1126
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,930
In general, you're a fine fellow.

1127
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,220
I respect you.

1128
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,800
It'd be good for you
to find a normal job.

1129
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:55,470
Or a baby will born... He'll ask,
"Daddy, where do you work?"

1130
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,530
And what will you tell him?

1131
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:05,970
Valya, really. You just go,
pose the corpses...

1132
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,390
Who needs this? Why?

1133
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,890
Oh, Valya, Valya.

1134
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:28,390
I somehow feel myself not good.

1135
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,930
I'll bring some water.

1136
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,800
Okay, who went where?

1137
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:50,470
Well, she got up.

1138
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,850
She really wanted
to go to the kitchen...

1139
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:55,350
But her legs gave way
and she fell down.

1140
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,050
She fell right here!

1141
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,640
Okay, lie down...

1142
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,510
Okay, Valya, what was then?

1143
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:15,760
Then... Uncle rushed to her...

1144
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,510
Why are you staring?
Come on, rush, rush!

1145
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:23,140
Then he stared at me,

1146
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:28,100
wanted to say something, stood up,
and fell on the floor himself.

1147
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,390
And what was she doing?

1148
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:44,010
She? She got everything
at once and ran to the sink.

1149
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,970
She began to drink water.

1150
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,600
I tried to explain to her
that it wouldn't help,

1151
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:00,600
that poison was already working,

1152
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,850
and that it would be better
just to wait it through.

1153
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:06,430
But she screamed
and kept drinking.

1154
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,890
Then she limpened on the sink,

1155
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,220
and that was all.

1156
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,680
Come on, limpen!

1157
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,430
Lie down!

1158
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:39,430
Okay. What's next?

1159
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:45,100
Next...

1160
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:55,010
I didn't know for sure
whether they'd be poisoned or not.

1161
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,510
But since it happened like that,
I was just watching.

1162
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,930
I tried to remember
in order to play...

1163
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:10,300
to reproduce everything later.

1164
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:15,760
Because you would need
to find out, how it really was...

1165
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,100
Alright.

1166
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:22,180
Lyuda?

1167
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:24,640
Turn it off.

1168
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:09,850
Valya.

1169
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,350
What's the matter?

1170
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,100
Don't be afraid, sonny.

1171
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:21,180
Don't be afraid.

1172
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:32,720
Why are you scared, Valya?

1173
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:35,430
Valya, come on!
