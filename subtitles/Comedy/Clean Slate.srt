1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,378
OK. It's Monday morning.

2
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:42,479
Your name is M.L. Pogue.

3
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,456
Maurice Leonard.

4
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,482
Pogue is fine.

5
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,155
You live in Venice.
That's Venice, California.

6
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,893
You have an office
just off the boardwalk.

7
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,730
You're a small -time gumshoe--

8
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:57,965
credit reports, insurance scams,
that kind of stuff.

9
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,996
Nothing you'd call...
adventurous.

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,272
Right now, you're
on vacation temporarily.

11
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,371
You're unable to take any cases
due to illness.

12
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,382
You have a dog.

13
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,215
He has
a depth perception problem.

14
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,030
But don't worry about the dog.
He can take care of himself.

15
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,197
It's you
that's got the problem, pal--

16
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,697
a problem called
Korsakoff's syndrome.

17
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,903
OK. Are you ready for this?

18
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:43,211
Whenever you go to sleep,
you lose your memory.

19
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,410
What?

20
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:53,557
Whenever you go to sleep,
you Lose your memory.

21
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:56,153
-Shit.
-Now, don't get upset.

22
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,823
You're bound to feel a little
disorientated at first...

23
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:01,664
but, really, don't panic.
You've got a system.

24
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,898
As long as you talk into
this recorder every night...

25
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:07,406
everything's going to be fine.

26
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,433
OK. Here's what happened.

27
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,446
Two months ago, you were
injured working on a case.

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,074
-There was an explosion.
-Are you my dog?

29
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,710
That's what's causing
this amnesia every night...

30
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,652
so be careful.

31
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,315
There may be complications.

32
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,830
Wait. It gets worse.

33
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,598
You can't tell anyone
about the amnesia.

34
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:40,367
You're the key witness against
the guy who set the explosion.

35
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,204
If anyone finds out
your memory's gone...

36
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,210
the whole case could collapse.

37
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:47,008
The best thing you can do
is stay in your apartment.

38
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,776
Don't show your face
around town...

39
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,282
don't talk to strangers...

40
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:54,219
and above all
don't answer the door.

41
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,280
I repeat--don't talk to anyone.

42
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,783
Just stay in bed.

43
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,178
Shh! They're following me.
They want to kill me.

44
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,183
Who's trying to kill you?

45
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,214
Cornell. The FBI.
I don't know.

46
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,927
What--what are you doing?

47
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:44,198
I'm calling the police,
as soon as I find the phone.

48
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,602
-No. You can't.
-Why?

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,163
-I don't trust them.
-Who?

50
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,698
-I need you.
-I'm not taking any cases.

51
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,971
Thank you.

52
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:05,016
Well, I can listen.

53
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,117
-You're mad at me.
-No, I'm not.

54
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,458
-You are.
-Really, no.

55
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:13,057
-You can't lie to me.
-AII right, I'm a Little mad.

56
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,863
Pogue, you've got to believe
I missed you.

57
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:18,393
I didn't want you to suffer.

58
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,463
Oh, do you believe me?

59
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,039
Yes, I believe you.

60
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,341
Did you think I was dead?

61
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,847
Should I have?

62
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,682
Yes, I--I did think
you were dead.

63
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:39,816
Will you kiss me?

64
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,722
AII right.

65
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,570
Down!

66
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,362
You want
to run that by me again?

67
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:25,935
I'm being blackmailed.

68
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:29,305
-Uh, by who?
-I honesty don't know.

69
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,537
I got a note
telling me to come to L.A.

70
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:34,809
If I didn't,
they'd tell Cornell where I was.

71
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm supposed to phone them
in two days, set up a meeting.

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,054
Uh, who, uh, followed you...

73
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,588
-B-Beth?
-You can use my real name.

74
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,491
Good, yeah. I will.

75
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,499
I don't know. I didn't get
a good look at him.

76
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,263
-He was big.
-Big?

77
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,930
By the way, how's Dolby doing?

78
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,236
Dolby?

79
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,799
Oh, he's, uh, great.

80
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,141
Really?
I heard he was shot.

81
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,114
Uh, except for that. Yeah.

82
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,741
And he was dying.

83
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:14,652
Yeah, yeah, but, uh,
he looks great now...

84
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:17,657
and he's jogging and
playing tennis. He's good.

85
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,488
So he's out of the wheelchair?

86
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,791
-But?
-It's, uh...

87

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,061
-But then, what--
-It's a new wheelchair.

88
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,797
They just invented it.
It's water-powered.

89
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,168
Really?

90
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:34,503
Look, could we not
talk about this right now...

91
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,704
because, like,
it's really sad for me, OK?

92
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:48,118
-Who's that?
-It's the police, Mr. Pogue.

93
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,486
It's the police.

94
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,684
Don't tell them I'm here.
Don't.

95
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,286
I need you, Pogue.

96
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,736
Mr. Pogue?

97
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,138
Would you step outside,
Mr. Pogue?

98
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,240
What is it?

99
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,214
Turn around, please, Mr. Pogue.

100
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:22,086
Get your hands behind your back,
Mr. Pogue.

101
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,050
Let's go.

102
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,185
Come on.

103
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,863
What do you think?

104
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,569
What's it going to be?

105
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:46,511
The Mona Lisa.

106
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,576
How's it going, Pogue?

107
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,582
Just great.

108
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,452
-You want the joke of the day?
-Sure.

109
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:59,185
Why don't blind people
sky-dive?

110
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:00,556
Why?

111
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,618
It scares the shit
out their dogs.

112
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,590
That's funny.

113
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,033
Mr. Pogue!
Mr. Pogue, the rent!

114
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,474
The rent, Mr. Pogue!

115
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,249
If it's not too much to ask,
what'd I do?

116
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:02,210
-Stay here.
-Right here.

117
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:22,030
Surprise!

118
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:29,643
Happy birthday to you

119
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:33,982
Happy birthday to you

120
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,514
Happy birthday, dear Pogue

121
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,219
I told you I'd get you.

122
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,196
Happy birthday to you

123
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,326
Make a wish.

124
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,701
Speech!

125
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,215
I, uh...

126
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,894
I just want to thank everyone
for their effort here.

127
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,056
Thank you.

128
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,860
-More!
-No!

129
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,101
Come on!

130
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,538
Seeing all your...

131
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:33,204
faces here today...

132
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,806
brings back such...

133
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,718
memories.

134
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,084
It's hard to know
where to begin.

135
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,611
Start with the girls!

136
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,720
Jealous, Bob?

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,024
You old dog, Bob!

138
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,225
Sure, I could talk about Bob...

139
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,293
John and Susan and Mary...

140
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:01,137
Mary and--and Fred and Ethel
and Little Ricky...

141
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,766
and all the others...

142
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,140
whose friendship
means so much to me...

143
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,576
but that wouldn’t be fair.

144
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,704
I'm reminded of a story.

145
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:16,246
A story about....

146
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,814
about guts...

147
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,382
and blood.

148
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:23,827
Blood and guts and patriotism.

149
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,229
And love.
Let's not forget Love.

150
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,833
That-a-way!

151
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,704
I think we all know
who I'm talking about.

152
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,938
I'm not going to embarrass them
by mentioning their name...

153
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:40,207
but what sacrifice, huh?

154
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,508
When they went into the...

155
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,216
the thing with the...

156
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,878
the guy in the--
you know, the flames...

157
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,911
and the running the back
with the thing and the...

158
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,117
Next thing, they're getting up
in the middle of the night.

159
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,319
Who knew?

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,328
There's an old joke
that goes...

161
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,796
why don't blind people
sky-dive?


162
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:02,267
Is it irrelevant?
I don't think so.

163
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,235
Call me old-fashioned,
call me irresistible...

164
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,396
call me late for lunch...

165
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,928
but I think
grabbing the initiative...

166
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:11,205
overcoming handicaps, and, yes,
even skydiving blind...

167
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:14,042
are the true virtues, hmm?

168
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,274
I'm sure you have
your own stories.

169
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,941
Raise your hand
if you have your own story.

170
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:22,044
Come on, put 'em up.

171
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,350
Yeah, a lot of stories...

172
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,380
a Lot of hands...

173
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,723
which is to say...

174
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,655
I have a rare group of friends.

175
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,571
Thank you.

176
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:49,813
-Guess who!
-I'm not real good at this.

177
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,682
-Come on, guess.
-Let the man go, Judy.

178
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:56,518
-Judy.
-No fair, Dolby, no fair.

179
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,748
11:30.

180
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,356
How's it going, Pogue?

181
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,490
Uh, pretty good.

182
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,164
I ran into a friend of ours
this morning.

183
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,608
-Who's that?
-Sarah Novak.


184
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:20,373
What? Sarah Novak. What?

185
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,710
Come over here.

186
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:28,016
Listen, Pogue, I've seen
a Lot of innocent people...

187
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,522
killed in my time, and
I'm haunted by them constantly.

188
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:34,185
But Sarah is dead, Pogue.
You're alive.

189
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:37,594
Stop torturing yourself with it.
Stop talking to Sarah.

190
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,793
Concentrate on putting that
bastard Cornell in jail, OK?

191
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,734
You nervous about Thursday?

192
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,097
Thursday?

193
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,706
Remember, be yourself
on cross-examination.

194
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,216
Tell it Like you know.

195
00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:59,741
Like I know.

196
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,582
-Right, counselor?
-That's right.

197
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,556
Nobody's gotten that close to
Cornell before--not till now.

198
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,650
Either wind up dead or bought
or in a wheelchair.

199
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,092
But not you, Pogue.

200
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,458
Too Late to rent a hall.

201
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,590
Listen, I need to ask a favor
as a friend.

202
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:46,757
Sure.

203
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,131
I think my fiancée’s
cheating on me.

204
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,363
I know what you're thinking,
''Rosenheim, you're paranoid.''

205
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,530
But that's not it.

206
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:53,834
I want to hire you.
I need to hire you.

207
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,033
I'm not taking any cases
right now.

208
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,439
-I'm desperate.
-I'm real busy.

209
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,308
-Listen, she's making me crazy.
-I'm on vacation.

210
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,937
Just find out who she's
sleeping with. That's all I ask.

211
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,345
May I borrow the birthday boy
for a sec?

212
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,679
Actually, we were talking.

213
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,513
Come on, come on, come on.
You're supposed to be resting.


214
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,989
Open your mouth.

215
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,788
I told you I would keep
your amnesia confidential...

216
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,226
but if you're gonna be
running around...

217
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:18,628
making an ass of yourself...

218
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,825
Turn your head.
You need some stability.

219
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,834
You need settle down.
You need to relax.

220
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,428
Find a woman, somebody to
help you get through this thing.

221
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,440
Look up. If you keep up
this life of high adventure...

222
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,839
this amnesia's
going to be permanent.

223
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,174

Look down. The best place
for you right now is home--

224
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,975
familiar surroundings,
people you know.

225
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:38,313
I'm surrounded by people I know.
That's my problem.

226
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,818
Now, who are they?

227
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,787
Hey...who are you?

228
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,188
-I'm your doctor.
-You are?

229
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,657
Anthony Doover.

230
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,661
We're friends.
We play tennis on Saturdays.

231
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:53,529
Doover, Doover. And the guy
you were just talking to?

232
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:56,228
Rosenheim. Donald Rosenheim.
He's the assistant D.A.

233
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,736
You worked together
on the force.

234
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,228
Rosenheim, assistant D.A.
And the guy in the wheelchair?

235
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,902
John Dolby. He's the D.A.

236
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:07,003
Dolby. D.A.
Sarah Novak?

237
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,645
Don't think about her, Pogue.
You're feeling guilty.

238
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,651
About what? What?

239
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,653
Listen, you're never gonna
get over this amnesia...

240
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,882
until you come to grips
with what happened.

241
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:20,085
Would you just
tell me what happened?

242
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,164
Go home. Go to bed.

243
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,668
Don't move.

244
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,968
AII right. Zip up.

245
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,680
Why, thank you.

246
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:41,665
We haven't met formally,
have we, Mr. Pogue?

247
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,800
Philip Cornell.

248
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,609
You've got no thumb,
Mr. Cornell.

249
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,881
My dad loved art, Mr. Pogue.

250
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,255
He Loved art so much...

251
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,317
that when I was kidnapped
as a Little boy of 8...

252
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,329
the kidnappers
threatened to kill me...

253
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,923
unless my father surrendered
his Rubens--

254
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:11,494
Descent from the Cross--
a surpassing work, by the way.

255
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:13,004
Dad called their bluff.

256
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,974
The kidnappers sent my thumb
back to him in a box.

257
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,470
What'd your dad do
with the thumb?

258
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,673
Does he still have it?

259
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:27,178
The kidnappers were captured.
The Rubens was undamaged.

260
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,347
Did he freeze the thumb?
They can do--

261
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,257
Could they stop doing that?

262
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,822
Your testimony on Thursday--

263
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,630
I shall be most grateful if you
could see your way clear...

264
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,399
to have a convenient
loss of memory.

265
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:51,975
This is a statement
explaining you were mistaken.

266
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,479
You never saw me
at the crime scene.

267
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,141
In turn,
we could offer you this.

268
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,513
Is that a comma?

269
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:14,258
Can I think about this?

270
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,597
Of course.

271
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,625
Till tomorrow morning.

272
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,901
Give us time
to make other plans.

273
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,817
This is bad.

274
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,891
I've gotten involved
with a Sarah Novak.

275
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:45,385
She's either in trouble
and needs your help...

276
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:46,591
or she's dead...

277
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:49,692
and in a remarkable state
of preservation.

278
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,801
OK, According to the file
in your office...

279
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,936
Sarah Novak
was Philip Cornell's lover.

280
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,948
They were apparently
inseparable for five years...

281
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,916
till she left him.

282
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,612
Sarah was afraid that
Cornell intended to kill her...

283
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,645
for what she knew
about his illegal activities.

284
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:13,283
She decided to testify
against him.

285
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:17,193
She hired a private detective
to protect herself.

286
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,254
Yours truly.

287
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,468
The day after the indictment
was brought against Cornell...

288
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:25,902
Sarah was killed.

289
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,599
A car bomb.

290
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,074
You were blown clear.

291
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,736
The only witness.

292
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:12,181
Oh, good. Let's see.

293
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:15,482
So, all of this leaves you
with an interesting dilemma.

294
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,149
That is bizarre.

295
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,186
Maybe, maybe.

296
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:24,787
Ow! Ow! Shit.

297
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,560
Dead woman
walks into your Life...

298
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,330
and now we have a date
to meet her at a fashion show.

299
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,702
AII right, two questions.

300
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,698
One--why isn't she dead?

301
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:40,473
And two--

302
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,503
what am I going to wear
tonight?

303
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,765
There's only one way you can
get your questions answered...

304
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,329
and only one place
you can find her.

305
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,698
Excuse me.

306
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,029
Sorry, sorry.

307
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,228
Excuse me. Excuse me.

308
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:50,241
He's watching me.

309
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,472
So what did the police want?

310
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,639
Um...it's my birthday.

311
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,114
I know. Psst.


312
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,415
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

313
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,519
These are nice.

314
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,218
Put them on.

315
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:43,794
Come here.

316
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,966
They seem very you.

317
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,497
You think so?

318
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:54,171
-Mm-hmm.
-How's that?

319
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,703
Black and white.

320
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,613
Like your anklet?


321
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,015
Yes, Like my ank--

322
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:06,886
You're a very good detective.

323
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,950
-How do you tell time?
-With difficulty.

324
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,986
-It's broken.
-Why don't you get it fixed?

325
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,397
My grandmother
engraved on the back of it...

326
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,664
''Vivi ogni momento
al suo massimo.''

327
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,796
Ah, yes. Romanian.


328
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,898
-No, It's Italian.
-I knew that.

329
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,307
That was my second choice.
So, what's it mean?

330
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,575
''Live every second
to its fullest.''

331
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,548
I'm doing my part.

332
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,209
Clasp.

333
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:37,689
Um, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

334
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,213
Sure.

335
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,089
Why aren't you dead?

336
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,192
-It wasn't me. It was a double.
-Why?

337
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,699
-Can we handle this later?
-No. Tell me now.

338
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,065
The FBI knew
Cornell was gonna hit me...

339
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:51,933
so they put an agent in
just in case.

340
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,234
They didn't expect...
ba-boom.

341
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:55,399
Why would someone
want to kill you?

342
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,668
You're on, Beth.

343
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:00,200
I became Beth Holly
of San Francisco, a model.

344
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:03,146
What do I call you now,
Sarah or Beth?

345
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:04,649
Sarah.

346
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,652
Someone is threatening to tell
Cornell I'm still alive...

347
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:08,812
unless I give them something.

348
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:10,253
What? Give them what?

349
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,654
You're on.

350
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:16,126
What? Give them what?

351
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:41,008
On display at the end
of the hall of archeology...

352
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,715
you'll find the oldest coin
we now know to exist--

353
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:46,383
the Coin of Royal Power.

354
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,022
Dating from the year 650 b.c...

355
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,553
the coin is customarily held...

356
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:56,364
under the tightest security
in China's forbidden city...

357
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,699
but was loaned
to the county museum...

358
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,273
in a rare cultural exchange
Last year.

359
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:04,265
-He stole it.
-Cornell.

360
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,470
He was obsessed with it.

361
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,376
You know, he has every
valuable coin in the world.

362
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,210
He had to have this one, too.

363
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,012
That's why you went to the FBI.

364
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,143
I took it from him.

365
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:18,815
It is named
the Coin of Royal Power...

366
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,484
due to the symbols of royalty--

367
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,049
the lion and the bull.

368
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:26,326
Its estimated value
is seven million dollars.

369
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,796
I was angry, I wanted
to hurt him, so I took it.

370
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,361
He came after me,
so I went to the FBI.

371
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,373
I promised to testify
about Cornell’s business...

372
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,102
if they protected me.

373
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,667
And now the blackmailers
want the coin?

374
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,077
-Give it to them.
-I don't have it.

375
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,139
-Who does?
-You do.

376
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:50,521
This whole thing
is about a $7-miIIion coin...

377
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,886
that Cornell
stole from this museum...

378
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:54,085
and you stole from Cornell?

379
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,457
The morning
before the explosion...

380
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:58,258
I gave you something to hide,
remember?

381
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,993
I didn't tell you what it was.
I couldn’t.

382
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,660
I just asked you to hide it...

383
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,396
and you said you had

the perfect place for it.

384
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:06,597
Remember?

385
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:09,471
-Pogue.
-Right.

386
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:12,068
You said one word--''baby.''

387
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,102
-Baby.
-Uh-huh.


388
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,544
You wouldn’t tell me
what it meant.

389
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,505
This way.

390
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,269
No. Left.

391
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:47,204
-That's who's following you?
-That's him.


392
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,780
His name is Hendrix. He's FBI.

393
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:01,859
Be careful. I need you.

394
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,994
This isn't the way out?

395
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:49,702
I told Novak I'd kill her
if she went to the police.

396
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,732
I'm not the police.

397
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:55,912
That's why
I'm going to kill you instead.

398
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,744
Who did that?

399
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:28,310
He made it after all.

400
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,961
Welcome. Welcome.

401
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,124
December 18, 1988--

402
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:23,532
a date Like any other...

403
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:24,728
or was it?

404
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:33,706
This is the path we took.

405
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:37,875
It was a good path, a red path,
a path of many moods.

406
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:43,418
Thank you.

407
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,386
We...

408
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,054
we started here.

409
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,564
Then we went here, here,
down here...

410
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:56,123
over here, here,
and ended up here.

411
00:30:56,168 --> 00:31:00,104
Many people thought
we wouldn’t make it.

412
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:06,173
This was one of the people
who laughed at us.

413
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:09,339
We called him...Steve.

414
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,645
Later he died of dysentery.


415
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,918
We buried him here.

416
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:23,219
This, I think,
is self-explanatory.

417
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,999
These dates are important
to remember, obviously.

418
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,058
They reflect
a different time and--

419
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,160
a different place.

420
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:35,367
Exotic? Yes...and no.

421
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:37,671
Who's to say who's the savage?

422
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,836
Not me. Not you.

423
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:43,336
There's an old joke that goes,
why don't blind people...

424
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:50,719
But I--I think it was
my illustrious colleague...

425
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,848
Dr. Howard from
the University of Geneva...

426
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:55,052
who said it best.

427
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:59,189
I think I should let the doctor
tell it himself...

428
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,392
shouldn’t I?

429
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,264
Doctor.

430
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:09,869
Come on up, doctor.

431
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:13,207
Come on up.

432
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:15,076
Where you going, doctor?

433
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,603
Don't be shy.

434
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,946
Oh, yes. The doctor's
going to lead us...

435
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:21,282
on a walking tour
of the neolithic exhibits.

436
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,186
Please, everybody.
Don't Let the doctor get away.

437
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,281
He's on a tight schedule.

438
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:28,884
-Doctor!
-Doctor!

439
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:41,804
OK, things have gotten
a bit more complicated.

440
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,206
Now, Sarah gave you
something to hide.

441
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,870
You hid it either
with someone called ''Baby''...

442
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,210
or in a place that has
something to do with babies.

443
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,706
It's a coin
about the size of a penny.

444
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,413
It's worth
seven million dollars.

445
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,650
Maybe ''Baby'' is something
to do with your past...

446
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:04,992
maybe when you were a cop.

447
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:14,238
Or maybe not.

448
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:15,671
Maybe it's something
more recent...

449
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:18,335
something
just before your amnesia.

450
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:20,571
''Testimony.''

451
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:22,477
I'II check that out Later.

452
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:25,972
You were a private eye.
Maybe that's a clue.

453
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:28,349
''Two-way radio
and survellance glasses.''

454
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:43,858
Someone's wiling to kill Sarah
to get at the coin.

455
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,836
She needs your protection.

456
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,861
She needs your help.

457
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,478
Maybe it's time
to do a little legwork.

458
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:30,274
''Baby.''

459
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:55,672
Oh, damn. Oh, damn it.
Where--where are the bullets?

460
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:27,501
Oh, so it was you.

461
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,959
-Guess who.
-Judy.

462
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:55,158
Surprise.

463
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,102
-What are you doing here?
-11:30 on the dot.

464
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,196
Ready?

465
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,866
I...

466
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,374
For what?

467
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,741
I hope you don't mind.

468
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:15,275
I borrowed a shirt.

469
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:20,487
Th-this is not a good idea,

Judy.

470
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:24,325
Oh. That's not what
you said Last night.

471
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,763
Don't I Look as good tonight?

472
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:35,635
That's not the point.

473
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:39,165

Well, what is the point?

474
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,735
Hey, I--I think the point is--

475
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,485
-Say it. Say it, Pogue.
-What?

476
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,750
-What?
-Like Last night.

477
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,779
Like Last night. Right.

478
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,389
Let's pretend
there was no Last night.

479
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:00,954
Oh, you animal.

480
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:07,335
Baby! Baby!

481
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:09,169
What did you say?

482
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,504
Skip it.

483
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:13,505
What?

484
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,921
You know what to do.

485
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,122
Then do it.

486
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,661
What are you doing?

487
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,239
Judy, wait a second.

488
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,272
Next time, try not to confuse me
with your other girlfriends.

489
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,336
Pogue, do you ever Listen
to your messages?

490
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,741
It's Paula.
I'II be home tonight.

491
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:21,369
I have the baby.

492
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,743
Let's talk this out, OK?

493
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:38,057
Hey, stranger. You drop off
the face of the earth or what?

494
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:39,529
Give me a call.

495
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,166
Hi, Pogue. It's me.
Call me sometime.

496
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,831
I'm at the new number.


497
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,675
Pogue,
it's curia you call me today.

498
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,201
I'm at the office.

499
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:01,177
Pogue, do you ever Listen
to your messages?

500
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,481
It's Paula.

501
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,114
I'II be home tonight.
I have the baby.

502
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:06,646
Let's talk this out, OK?

503
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:32,715
OK, your name is M.L. Pogue,
and you got a problem--

504
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,048
whenever you go to sleep,
you Lose your memory.

505
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,246
Shit.

506
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:42,325
Whatever you do,
don't talk to anyone.

507
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,123
Just stay in bed.

508
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,323
Pogue? It's me, Sarah.

509
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:51,963
Did you get rid of him
Last night?

510
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:53,436
Was there any problem?

511
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,336
Could you hold on one second?

512
00:39:58,142 --> 00:40:01,475
You've become involved
with a Sarah Novak.

513
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:04,140
Afraid that Philip Cornell
intended to kill her...

514
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,173
for what she knew
about his operation...

515
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:08,276
Sarah hired you to protect her.

516
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:15,825
Sarah, are you safe?
Does Cornell know where you are?

517
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,953
Pogue, Cornell thinks I'm dead.


518
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:20,657
Oh...right.

519
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:21,892
One second.

520
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:27,537
But Sarah made a deal
with the FBI...

521
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:28,971
and they made it Look Like
she was dead...

522
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,473
after a failed bomb attack...

523
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,033
so she could testify
against Cornell.

524
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:36,843
But now an FBI man named
Hendrix is blackmailing her...

525
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:39,111
threatening to tell Cornell
she's still alive...

526
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,981
unless she gives him
a valuable coin...

527
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:43,748
that Cornell stole from
the Natural History Museum...

528
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:46,757
and Sarah stole from him
and gave to you to hide.

529
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,123
But you hid it with
either someone called ''Baby''...

530
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,459
or a place that has
something to do with babies.

531
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:01,004
-Sarah, can I get back to you?
-Pogue, are you all right?

532
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:02,665
I'm fine. I'II get back to you.

533
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,732
I'II meet you on the beach
at 6:00.

534
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:16,484
-I want my money, Mr. Pogue.
-Who is this?

535
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:18,989
Your landIord. Don't tell me
you've forgotten again.

536
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:23,187
-How much is it?
-Eight hundred.


537
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,320
AII right.
I'm sending you a check.

538
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:27,194
No.
I'm coming over this second.

539
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:28,755
Good, good.

540
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:57,958
My apologies
for the early hour, Mr. Pogue.

541
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,122
Have you decided to cooperate?

542
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,431
Here it is.

543
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:06,459
Thank you.

544
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,470
Sorry about the lateness.

545
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,501
Don't be sorry, Mr. Pogue.

546
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,241
The important thing is
you signed it.

547
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:19,272
Yeah, I signed it.

548
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:21,308
I'm in your debt, Mr. Pogue.

549
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:26,153
Remember, anything you need,
just Let me know.

550
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,719
Um, this door,
it seems to stick a bit.

551
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:40,259
It probably needs
a Little oil on the hinge.

552
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,477
So, just so I'II know,
it's the first of the month?

553
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:52,572
No. It's the 8th.

554
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:56,018
Oh.
So it's always the 8th?

555
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:02,322
Today is the 8th.
Tomorrow is the 9th.

556
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,659
OK. Good. Good.

557
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,099
AII right. Bye.

558
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:48,068
What's up?

559
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:53,498
Sorry about that, boy.

560
00:44:53,537 --> 00:44:55,562
Here's fresh air.
I'II be right back.

561
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:05,642
May I help you?

562
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:08,914
Oh, Maurice. Oh, go on in.

563
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,289
What room number is it again?

564
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:16,259
Naughty.
You've been away too Long.

565
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:18,158
Number thirty-two.

566
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:20,129
Up the stairs, at the end.

567
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,324
Thank you.

568
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:26,162
Problem?

569
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,839
Whose room is that?

570
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:36,069
Mrs. Pogue's?

571
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,013
Right.

572
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,424
Mom?

573
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:00,669
Son?

574
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:03,766
Mom.

575
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,979
Oh, I made some brownies.

576
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,450
Thank you.

577
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:19,148
They Look delicious.

578
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:22,785
Mom?

579
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:26,595
Son?

580
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,992
Don't just stand there.
Come and kiss your mother.

581
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:01,992
Seven pounds, nine ounces.

582
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:04,592
-Hmm. That's me?
-Mm-hmm.

583
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:05,761
The nurse said you were...

584
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:08,101
the prettiest thing
she ever saw.

585
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:10,334
Oh, Look,
there's your first Christmas.

586
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:12,842
Oh, and that pretty tree.
That was our prettiest.

587
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:14,344
-You remember that house?
-Mom?

588
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:17,609
Mom, when I was a Little baby,
was there someplace I'd go?

589
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:19,115
In your diapers.

590
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,847
No. Some kind of hiding place.

591
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:26,288
Even as a baby,
you had the straightest teeth.

592
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:27,790
Oh, there you are.

593
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,089
Mom, where's the rest
of this picture?

594
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:32,755
''Maurice, Paula, and Baby.''
Where's the rest?

595
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:34,320
Nap time, Shirley.

596
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:36,925
Now, don't worry about it.

597
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,798
-Come on.
-Mom.

598
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,303
Visiting hours are over.

599
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:43,738
I promised I would never say
anything bad about her.

600
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:45,639
About who, Paula?

601
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:48,873
Come on.

602
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,841
What are you doing here, Pogue?

603
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:22,141
Nostalgic for the old academy?

604
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:29,351
Good to see you, John. How's
the district attorney's office?

605
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:33,322
Fine. Rosenheim wanted to
get in a Little target practice.

606
00:48:33,357 --> 00:48:38,317
Oh, you mean my good friend
Donald the assistant D.A.

607
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,954
That's right.

608
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:42,932
I'm looking for Paula, John.

609
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:44,696
Do you know
where I might find her?

610
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:48,661
Sure you want to see her?

611
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:53,672
It's none of my business,
but watch out for Willis.

612
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,202
He's never forgiven you,
slugger.

613
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:57,805
Paula’s on lane eight.

614
00:48:57,848 --> 00:48:59,281
Slugger?

615
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,786
You been seeing
any more of Sarah?

616
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:05,880
Sarah Novak? No.

617
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:07,857
-Good.
-But she's coming by tonight.

618
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:10,723
Pogue, sit down.

619
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:17,367
You need to get some help.

620
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:18,527
I wish I could.

621
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,867
You can't fight this
on your own.

622
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,303
Sarah's afraid
of bringing anyone else in.

623
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,864
Pogue, Listen to me.

624
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:26,842
Sarah is gone.

625
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:31,473
-Just till tonight.
-No! She's not coming back.

626
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:33,642
-How do you know?
-It's a fact of Life.

627
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:43,387
Good, John. Thanks a Lot.

628
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:00,810
Not now, Pogue.

629
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:03,210
-You two going to fight?
-Shut up, Donald.

630
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:04,544
Just great to see you
back together.

631
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:06,913
We're not together.

632
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,646
I was just visiting Shirley.

633
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:11,712
Yeah? She still mad at me?

634
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:14,519
N-no. She said to say hi.

635
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,288
I'm trying to shoot here, Pogue.

636
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,728
It sounds Like fighting.
I do hear fighting.

637
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,357
You two should have
never got married.

638
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:30,699
Ya-ya.
He Looks just Like his daddy.

639
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:32,709
-You think?
-Oh, yeah. Spitting image.

640
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,142
What do you think, Maurice?

641
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:38,842
I always thought he looked more
Like me, but, yeah, I see it.

642
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:41,282
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds.

643
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:42,785
Can you watch him for a second?

644
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,916
Maurice, just take him
for a walk or something.

645
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:10,575
Sarah gave you
the coin to hide...

646
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:13,014
and you hid it either
with someone called ''Baby''...

647
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,611
or in a place that has
something to do with babies.

648
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:30,192
Can I have teddy?

649
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,668
Teddy? Yeah.

650
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:46,542
Do the happy face.

651
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:20,013
Get away from him!

652
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:25,217
Don't push your luck, Pogue.
It was a sucker punch.

653
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:27,161
-Willis.
-You stay away from him.

654
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,891
-It's not what you think, OK?
-Yeah, right.

655
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:30,364
Just walk away! Just walk away!

656
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:34,529
-Knock it off.
-Would you leave him alone?

657
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,538
Let go of the damn thing!
I don't want you near my wife...

658
00:52:36,572 --> 00:52:38,164
and I sure as hell
don't want you near my son.

659
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:40,698
I'II kill you
if I see you near them again.

660
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:53,915
Pogue, I got a clue about
who's sleeping with my fiancée.

661
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:56,618
She comes home Last night
wearing this.

662
00:52:56,659 --> 00:52:58,627
It's a man's, not mine.

663
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:01,960
And check out these initials--
M.P.

664
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:05,058
Someone with the initials M.P.

665
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,662
What do you think?
Maybe it's somebody called M.P.

666
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:11,673
Uh, not--not necessarily.

667
00:53:11,707 --> 00:53:13,334
I just came by to check
the roll call, you know?

668
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:16,675
Let's see. There's, uh,
Mike and Manuel...

669
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:19,647
-Maurice!
-Mattie, Mickey...

670
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:22,116
-Maurice!
-One second!

671
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:23,516
How about Last names?
Last names.

672
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:27,318
-Maurice Pogue!
-I'm coming!

673
00:53:27,356 --> 00:53:30,325
Well, your car payments
haven't been.

674
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,350
I'm not a suspicious type
by nature. You know that.

675
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:34,886
It's just the idea of Judith
sleeping with someone else--

676
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:36,364
I could kill, you understand?

677
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:39,459
-Well, I'II check into it.
-Will you?

678
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:41,766
You're a buddy. Thanks.

679
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:43,772
Listen,
the suspenders Look great...

680
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:46,297
but I'd Lose the teddy bear.

681
00:54:00,656 --> 00:54:02,590
What do you think?

682
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:05,958
-Looks great.
-Yeah? Aw, thanks.

683
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:07,622
So, what's it going to be?

684
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:31,176
Very you.

685
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:33,908
Thanks...

686
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:35,644
I think.

687
00:55:35,684 --> 00:55:37,515
You Look happy.

688
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:41,881
You had a good day?

689
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:57,466
Have we ever...

690
00:55:57,506 --> 00:55:58,871
I mean, we...

691
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:01,376
Did, uh...

692
00:56:03,045 --> 00:56:04,910
How serious are we?

693
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:08,875
I guess that depends.

694
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:11,352
I get serious very quickly.

695
00:56:11,387 --> 00:56:13,878
I think you do, too.

696
00:56:13,923 --> 00:56:16,016
I do?

697
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:17,548
Don't you?

698
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:33,908
I mean, but...

699
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:36,810
wh-what do you really
know about me?

700
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,813
I know enough.

701
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:47,211
There's something else.
I hit a snag with the coin.

702
00:56:47,256 --> 00:56:49,622
-I don't want to talk about it.
-It's not as simple as...

703
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:51,489
Kiss me.

704
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:56,893
There was an explosion,
and my memory...

705
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,895
''Kiss me''?
What is with this ''Kiss me''?

706
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:16,345
Ouch.
What is this? What is this?

707
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:18,910
Oh, that's where those were.
Thank you.

708
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:24,652
Like it's the first time.

709
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,631
Just one second.

710
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:34,761
-What?
-It's all right.

711
00:57:34,803 --> 00:57:37,567
Wait.

712
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:39,130
Right back.

713
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:41,666
When you hear this,
it'll be Wednesday morning.

714
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:45,544
The woman sleeping next to you,
her name is Sarah Novak.

715
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:52,048
Don't be silly. I want you.

716
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:53,349
I got to go.

717
00:57:55,157 --> 00:57:57,785
Where are you--

718
00:57:57,826 --> 00:57:59,691
Don't Let her down because...

719
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:06,467
What are you--
Shit.

720
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:09,369
Because I think
you're in Love with her.

721
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:17,003
Come here.

722
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,441

My watch is in your hair.
I'm sorry.

723
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:22,143
-My bra.
-Oh, your bra, yes.

724
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,481
I'm real good at this.

725
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:42,233
Man.

726
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:45,963
The woman
sleeping next to you...

727
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:48,765
her name is Sarah Novak.

728
00:59:48,804 --> 00:59:53,639
Don't Let her down because
I think you're in Love with her.

729
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:27,600
Of course it's a good sign.
I go to sleep, I wake up...

730
01:00:27,643 --> 01:00:29,543
I remember everything
from the day before.

731
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:31,239
I'm not saying
it's a bad sign, Pogue...

732
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,840
but we can't tell anything
from that. Cough.

733
01:00:33,882 --> 01:00:35,509
Why not?

734
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:36,677
You still can't
remember anything...

735
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,313
from the day before yesterday
or the day before that, right?

736
01:00:39,355 --> 01:00:41,323
What I'm saying is,
you need a breakthrough...

737
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:43,951
a memory of something
before your amnesia.

738
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:48,963
-What's that?
-What's what?

739
01:00:48,997 --> 01:00:50,328
Scrambled or poached?

740
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:53,164
-Scrambled.
-Scrambled.

741
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:55,727
-Scrambled?
-What's scrambled?

742
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:59,207
-The eggs.
-The eggs.

743
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:03,073
Well, whoever she is, Pogue,
she's exactly what you need--

744
01:01:03,112 --> 01:01:05,171
someone to help you
get on with your Life.

745
01:01:06,415 --> 01:01:08,815
Got to go.

746
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:14,489
''Baby.''

747
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:19,055
Baby Ruth. Baby Ruth.

748
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:20,789
Baby powder.

749
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,123
Baby grand.

750
01:01:27,903 --> 01:01:31,100
Baby face.

751
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,200
Baby blue.

752
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:36,336
Crybaby.

753
01:01:36,378 --> 01:01:38,812
Sugar baby.

754
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:44,977
Baby.

755
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:10,937
Fido. Here, Fido.

756
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:13,573
Here, Spot. Here, Spot. Spot.

757
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:15,515
Rusty!

758
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,213
Pete? Here, Pete.

759
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:27,055
Hi, boy. Hi, Baby. Hi. Yeah.

760
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:29,962
Have you got something?

761
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:58,584
It's incredible.

762
01:02:58,627 --> 01:03:01,027
It's incredible.
You're incredible.

763
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:02,997
Oh, no. Well, all right.
A Little bit.

764
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:06,364
-Yes. Look at it.
-Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

765
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:07,698
So, what time's
he supposed to call?

766
01:03:07,736 --> 01:03:09,328
2:00.
I may have to meet him alone.

767
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:11,566
-AII right.

-Ouch.

768
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:13,507
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

769
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,908
What are you doing down there?

770
01:03:15,944 --> 01:03:17,206
What is this?

771
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:21,546
That's a two-way surveillance
glasses and radio.

772
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:24,051
Wear them when he phones.

773
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:26,814
-Over there.
-AII right.

774
01:04:56,979 --> 01:04:58,742
Santa Monica Pier
in half an hour.

775
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,975
No one else. Just me.

776
01:05:01,016 --> 01:05:03,814
He says if he sees you
within a mile, he won't show.

777
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,584
What's wrong?

778
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:10,615
Nothing.

779
01:05:29,878 --> 01:05:31,402
You’ll need the coin.

780
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:37,278
Thanks.

781
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,110
Anytime.

782
01:05:55,804 --> 01:05:57,362
Stay, boy.

783
01:06:00,676 --> 01:06:01,938
You're Late.

784
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:04,741
How Long does it take
to drive a block, you idiot?

785
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,372
I don't want to hear it.

786
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:09,009
-Did you get it from him?
-No problem.

787
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:11,349
Well, where is it?

788
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:13,650
-I've got it.
-Well, let's see it.

789
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:16,453
Not here. The big guy's
gonna want to see it. Come on.

790
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:18,550
The big guy can wait.

791
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:24,187
What about Pogue?
He didn't catch on?

792
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:31,164
-Do not underestimate him.
-You should talk.

793
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:33,640
Any more questions,
or can we go now?

794
01:06:33,675 --> 01:06:34,835
Let's go.

795
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:14,572
Hold on, boy!

796
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:02,219
May I help you, sir?

797
01:08:02,264 --> 01:08:04,732
Yes, you may. You may.

798
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:06,700
The gentleman on court six.

799
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:10,569
I believe he's a friend of mine,
but I'm not quite certain.

800
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:12,129
Well, I'II call down.

801
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:15,268
Oh, I want to surprise him.

802

01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,470
Certainly.

803
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,747
Court six.

804
01:08:19,781 --> 01:08:21,681
That's Doover.

805
01:08:21,716 --> 01:08:24,947
Dr. Anthony Doover.

806
01:08:24,986 --> 01:08:27,921
Is he your friend, sir?
Dr. Doover?

807
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:38,666
My mistake.

808
01:08:46,608 --> 01:08:48,337
Give me a high five.

809
01:08:50,812 --> 01:08:52,677
Well, smile, Beth.
You pulled it off.

810
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:55,046
-She's got a guilty conscience.
-Shut up.

811
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,483
What, about Pogue?

812
01:08:57,519 --> 01:08:58,747
Looks to me
Like you've been doing...

813
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:00,152
a few Little favors for him
on your own.

814
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:01,655
Stop it.

815
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,749
You're a character, Beth.

816
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:05,191
Well, let's see it.
Let me see the coin.

817
01:09:07,762 --> 01:09:08,922
Come on.

818
01:09:29,951 --> 01:09:31,384
What?

819
01:09:34,456 --> 01:09:35,889
OK, this is Pogue's doing.

820
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:39,018
He saw through
our Little charade.

821
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,790
So you go back, you get
the tape before he wakes up...

822
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,958
and we'll begin again
from the beginning.

823
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:48,668
I beg your pardon?

824
01:09:48,703 --> 01:09:51,729
It's over.

825
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:54,173
I'm not doing it anymore.

826
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:55,676
I'm not.

827
01:09:57,245 --> 01:10:00,908
May I remind you this Little
item is worth $7 million?

828
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:02,917
Seven million.

829
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:05,181
Are you telling me you're going
to turn your back on that?

830
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,781
I don't think so.

831
01:10:08,823 --> 01:10:09,983
Watch me.

832
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,382
Does it Look Like it now?

833
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:38,818
Like what?

834
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,132
Pogue,
you want the joke of the day?

835
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,796
How do you find a blind man
in a nudist colony?

836
01:10:57,339 --> 01:10:58,863
How?

837
01:10:58,907 --> 01:11:00,499
It ain't hard.

838
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:09,546
You ain't much
in a laughing mood today, Pogue.

839
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:11,552
Neither were your friends.

840
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:14,147
What friends?

841
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:16,817
The guys in your apartment.

842
01:11:23,298 --> 01:11:24,890
Hey, where you been all day?

843
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:26,400
Uh, out.

844
01:11:26,434 --> 01:11:28,868
Yeah, well, I been calling.
Somebody kept hanging up.

845
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:31,337
Come here.
I've got another clue.

846
01:11:31,373 --> 01:11:35,469
Nobody at the LAPD
has the initials M.P.

847
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,070
Are you sure?

848
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:39,410
Check this out.

849
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:42,348
I caught Judy
tearing up a letter, OK?

850
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:45,285
I got this out just before
she flushed it down the toilet.

851
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,548
Check it out.

852
01:11:46,588 --> 01:11:48,749
Look at the numbers--
''1-1-9--''

853
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,758
What's that other number?
5? Maybe a 3?

854
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:54,250
Could it be a license plate,
maybe a phone number?

855
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:56,456
Uh, probably a phone number.

856
01:11:56,498 --> 01:11:57,624
Maybe an address?

857
01:11:57,665 --> 01:12:00,828
Oh, I-I'II Look into it.

858
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:03,531
OK. Well, we've got to go over
your Cornell testimony.

859
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,267
How about tomorrow night?

860
01:12:06,307 --> 01:12:08,138
Tomorrow night. That's good.

861
01:12:08,176 --> 01:12:10,201
The testimony's tomorrow
at 2:00, so you know...

862
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:13,043
That makes sense.

863
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:14,605
That wouldn’t be--

864
01:12:15,683 --> 01:12:16,877
You're...

865
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:18,647
-Excuse me.
-You're coming through.

866
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:19,983
There you are.


867
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:24,953
You all right? There you go.

868
01:12:24,993 --> 01:12:26,688
Pogue, the testimony.

869
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:28,161
Tomorrow morning at 9:00.

870
01:12:28,196 --> 01:12:31,495
Judge BIock's upset because
we missed the Last court date.

871
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:32,693
He said if you're not
on the stand tomorrow...

872
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:33,996
he's throwing out
the whole case.

873
01:12:34,035 --> 01:12:35,969
I'II be there.

874
01:13:22,584 --> 01:13:23,949
What do you think
of the tie now?

875
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:27,785
Have you thought about
a clip-on or--

876
01:13:27,822 --> 01:13:29,119
That's enough.

877
01:13:29,157 --> 01:13:31,250
Oh, you're in trouble now.

878
01:13:32,961 --> 01:13:35,225
Where's the coin, Maurice?

879
01:13:35,263 --> 01:13:37,424
See that?
You got to watch out...

880
01:13:37,465 --> 01:13:40,628
when he starts calling you
by your first name.

881
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:42,693
I wouldn’t do that
if I were you.

882
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:45,604
There's some guys in there
with guns.

883
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,438
-Open it.
-I really wouldn’t advise it.

884
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:19,405
My landlord?

885
01:14:55,443 --> 01:14:56,603
Sir?

886
01:15:09,891 --> 01:15:12,519
Seen a pickup truck
speeding by here?

887
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:22,459
Just out for a walk?

888
01:15:23,605 --> 01:15:26,540
Oh, I hate to iron.

889
01:15:34,782 --> 01:15:36,716
When do they empty the meters?

890
01:15:36,751 --> 01:15:39,481
Tomorrow. Why?

891
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:44,291
I--I just saw some kids
messin' around with them.

892
01:15:44,325 --> 01:15:47,260
-W-what time?
-3:30.

893
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:53,425
Don't worry, sir.
We’ll be here all night.

894
01:15:55,503 --> 01:15:56,663
Great.

895
01:16:06,314 --> 01:16:09,147
-He paid me to scare Pogue.
-Shut up.

896
01:16:09,183 --> 01:16:12,311
To shoot up his apartment,
make him turn over the coin.

897
01:16:15,623 --> 01:16:16,920
What coin?

898
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:22,157
Royal...something.
It's supposed to be worth a Lot.

899
01:16:22,196 --> 01:16:24,391
How do you know Mr. Pogue
has this coin?

900
01:16:24,432 --> 01:16:26,992
Well, when they brought Pogue
into the hospital...

901
01:16:27,035 --> 01:16:30,163
he was babbling on
about the coin being with Baby.

902
01:16:30,204 --> 01:16:31,432
Will you shut up?

903
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:35,574
Baby? What's baby mean?

904
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,942
I don't know.

905
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:40,106
Anything else you can tell us?

906
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:44,346
No, except I think
I deserve something.

907
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:46,649
I mean, for my trouble.

908
01:16:46,688 --> 01:16:50,124
Oh, yes, you most certainly do.

909
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:52,626
Not on the rug.

910
01:17:41,642 --> 01:17:45,408
Pogue, I'm sorry.
I'm not Sarah Novak.

911
01:17:45,446 --> 01:17:47,414
I'm really Beth Holly...

912
01:17:47,448 --> 01:17:51,908
a washed-up actress
trying to become a model.

913
01:17:51,953 --> 01:17:55,787
I Looked Like Sarah.
That's why Doover hired me.

914
01:18:15,243 --> 01:18:17,370
OK, it's Thursday morning.

915
01:18:17,412 --> 01:18:19,710
Your name is M.L. Pogue.

916
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:22,045
You're a private investigator.

917
01:18:24,652 --> 01:18:27,212
When you're slapped,
you’ll take it and Like it.

918
01:18:33,728 --> 01:18:37,425
You're a, uh,
you're a tough guy...

919
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:39,160
a dangerous customer.

920
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,327
Women, they flock to you.

921
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:44,429
You use them and drop them
Like yesterday's laundry.

922
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,205
Or they use you.

923
01:18:52,113 --> 01:18:56,413
OK, your name is M.L. Pogue,
and you got a problem.

924
01:18:56,451 --> 01:18:58,817
Whenever you go to sleep,
you Lose your memory.

925
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:14,432
''Half a league, half a League,
half a League onward...

926
01:19:14,469 --> 01:19:16,835
''all in the valley of death
rode the six hundred.


927
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:18,862
''Forward the light brigade.
Charge for the guns, he said.

928
01:19:18,906 --> 01:19:20,840
''Into the valley of death
rode the six hundred!''

929
01:19:22,243 --> 01:19:24,575
''Aardvark--an animal
resembling the anteater...

930
01:19:24,612 --> 01:19:26,102
''found in parts of Africa...''

931
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:32,610
Whenever you go to sleep,
you Lose your memory.

932
01:19:32,653 --> 01:19:35,121
You can't go to sleep,
or you’ll Lose your memory.

933
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:24,596
''Push this button.''

934
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,267
Good morning, Mr. Pogue.

935
01:20:28,976 --> 01:20:30,466
Good morning.

936
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:34,072
I'm disappointed with you.

937
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:37,744
Eight hundred dollars
for a bribe?

938
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:41,152
I thought I meant more to you
than that.

939
01:20:41,188 --> 01:20:44,487
Now I hear
you've been holding out on me.

940
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:55,100
The Coin of Royal Power--

941
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:57,001
we know you have it.

942
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:04,167
Are you sure you've got
the right person here or...

943
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:17,655
Where we going?

944
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:52,923
What happened to your thumb?

945
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:02,768
Nothin'.

946
01:22:04,438 --> 01:22:06,269
Anything?

947
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:07,934
He's good.

948
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:19,144
If you don't tell me
where that coin is...

949
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:21,552
I will have to kill you.

950
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:24,581
But first I will kill her.

951
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:38,905
I have a court date to keep.

952
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:41,430
You have two hours...

953
01:22:41,475 --> 01:22:45,468
to sweat it out, as it were.

954
01:22:49,717 --> 01:22:52,117
Oh, Pogue, I'm so sorry.
I was wrong.

955
01:22:52,153 --> 01:22:54,781
When Doover came to me,
I had no money, nothing.

956
01:22:54,822 --> 01:22:56,983
But I didn't mean
to get you into this.

957
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:58,457
Can you forgive me?

958
01:22:58,492 --> 01:23:00,357
Sure.

959
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:03,287
Who are you?

960
01:23:11,806 --> 01:23:14,366
AII rise and face the flag.

961
01:23:14,408 --> 01:23:17,070
What is going on,
Mr. Rosenheim?

962
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:20,012
We've hit a snag, your honor.
Our witness is missing.

963
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:21,947
AII right.
Both of you, up here.

964
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:29,288
OK, Let me get this straight.
I'm a detective with amnesia...

965
01:23:29,323 --> 01:23:31,257
caused by an explosion
set by Cornell...

966
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:33,021
the guy I'm supposed
to be testifying against...

967
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,687
in a court of law
on a murder charge.

968
01:23:34,729 --> 01:23:36,424
You are an actress
who pretended to be...

969
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:37,988
a victim
killed in the explosion...

970
01:23:38,032 --> 01:23:39,590
in order to get
a valuable coin...

971
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:41,430
that she gave to me
before my amnesia...

972
01:23:41,469 --> 01:23:42,629
and I hid in my dog's collar.

973
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,796
But now you say you're sorry...

974
01:23:43,838 --> 01:23:46,238
and you want to help me get
to court and find the coin.

975
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:49,808
If we could just have
another day...

976
01:23:49,844 --> 01:23:51,436
to locate our witness,
sir, I'm sure--

977
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:54,676
You've got until 3:00,
Mr. Rosenheim.

978
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,646
Listen, you're a detective.

979
01:24:00,688 --> 01:24:04,146
You've been in tough spots
Like this before.

980
01:24:04,191 --> 01:24:05,624
I can't remember.

981
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:08,492
Listen, that doesn't matter.
You are who you are.

982
01:24:08,529 --> 01:24:10,724
Think. Give me that.

983
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,861
-Careful. Careful.
-That's cold.

984
01:24:14,902 --> 01:24:18,201
Here, take this.
You get the guy in here...

985
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,332
and then I'II--Poof!
Bam, bam, bam.

986
01:24:23,144 --> 01:24:26,580
You just sit right back down
there and get comfortable.

987
01:24:26,614 --> 01:24:28,013
That's right.

988
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:43,453
-Now what?
-I have no idea.

989
01:24:43,497 --> 01:24:45,294
-Pogue.
-What?

990
01:24:45,332 --> 01:24:47,425
You're a baseball pitcher.
You are. I'm telling you.

991
01:24:47,468 --> 01:24:49,265
That's about the distance
to home plate.

992
01:24:49,303 --> 01:24:50,736
Hit him with a pitch.

993
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:52,864
I thought you said
I was a detective.

994
01:24:52,907 --> 01:24:54,374
You were in a baseball League
at night.

995
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:56,899
-How Long ago?
-A few years--Last year.

996
01:24:56,944 --> 01:24:58,969
I think you pitched
three no-hitters...

997
01:24:59,013 --> 01:25:00,275
struck out twenty-five batters.

998
01:25:00,314 --> 01:25:02,441
-Left hand or right hand?
-Right.

999
01:25:02,483 --> 01:25:04,508
-You think I'm making this up?
-How many batters?

1000
01:25:04,552 --> 01:25:05,985
Twenty...ten in one game.

1001
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,716
You said twenty-five
a second ago. I heard you.

1002
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:11,384
What is this, a sports quiz?
You're a champion. Let's go.

1003
01:25:11,425 --> 01:25:12,892
AII right, I'II do it one time.

1004
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:15,020
-Let's go.
-One time.

1005
01:25:15,062 --> 01:25:17,087
Right now.
Just take it and do it.

1006
01:25:18,599 --> 01:25:20,726
Now. Now.

1007
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,431
-What are you doing?
-I got to be a pitcher.

1008
01:25:37,518 --> 01:25:40,043
Now, now, now.

1009
01:25:40,087 --> 01:25:41,452
Loose. OK.

1010
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,128
See? I suck.

1011
01:25:48,162 --> 01:25:49,322
I'm horrible.

1012
01:25:49,363 --> 01:25:51,194
Listen, you always lean high
on your first pitch.

1013
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,700
-I can't.
-Just do another one for me.

1014
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:54,860
One more.

1015
01:25:54,902 --> 01:25:57,370
OK, for you, I'II do it
one more time, and that's it.

1016
01:25:57,404 --> 01:25:58,769
You're a champion.

1017
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:01,936
Now.

1018
01:26:01,976 --> 01:26:04,274
Just do it now.

1019
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,885
Did you see that?

1020
01:26:20,895 --> 01:26:23,557
You did it.

1021
01:26:23,597 --> 01:26:25,462
You forgive me,
don't you, Pogue?

1022
01:26:25,499 --> 01:26:28,525
That's kind of hard for me
to answer...

1023
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:30,036
-Beth.
-Beth.

1024
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:31,799
I don't know anything about you.

1025
01:26:31,839 --> 01:26:32,999
You know enough.

1026
01:26:34,942 --> 01:26:36,307
Come on.

1027
01:26:38,779 --> 01:26:40,508
First pitch.

1028
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:42,811
That was the first pitch.

1029
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:45,782
Now, where am I going?

1030
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:48,253
Make a right to the courthouse.

1031
01:26:48,289 --> 01:26:50,689
We're going to smarten you up.
Here. Wear these.

1032
01:26:50,724 --> 01:26:52,385
-Those are nice.
-Thanks.

1033
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:02,395
Pogue, you have to memorize
your testimony.

1034
01:27:02,436 --> 01:27:06,167
The only way to keep Cornell
off our backs...

1035
01:27:06,206 --> 01:27:08,003
is to put him in jail.

1036
01:27:08,042 --> 01:27:09,942
What testimony? What do I say?

1037
01:27:09,977 --> 01:27:12,275
Here. Listen to this.

1038
01:27:12,313 --> 01:27:14,338
-Comb.
-''Testimony.''

1039
01:27:15,783 --> 01:27:17,182
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

1040
01:27:17,217 --> 01:27:18,343
-It works.
-Try it.

1041
01:27:18,385 --> 01:27:20,751
Give it to me.

1042
01:27:20,788 --> 01:27:22,449
Damn it! It's batteries.

1043
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:24,150
The batteries.
Do you have batteries?

1044
01:27:24,191 --> 01:27:26,625
Uh, glove compartment?

1045
01:27:27,962 --> 01:27:30,123
No, no, no.
Batteries. Batteries.

1046
01:27:30,164 --> 01:27:34,100
-The glasses. Put those on.
-I don't need glasses.

1047
01:27:34,134 --> 01:27:36,193
Don't worry.
Listen, just Listen.

1048
01:27:36,236 --> 01:27:37,396
I can see fine.

1049
01:27:39,173 --> 01:27:41,698
That's you. I hear you.

1050
01:27:41,742 --> 01:27:44,108
That's it.

1051
01:27:54,989 --> 01:27:57,753
God damn it, Pogue!
Where the hell have you been?

1052
01:27:57,791 --> 01:28:00,919
Keep the glasses on.
I'II go and get batteries.

1053
01:28:00,961 --> 01:28:02,656
Listen, Pogue,
just stay calm, all right?

1054
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:04,789
I don't want you to be too
detailed in your descriptions.

1055

01:28:04,832 --> 01:28:07,164
I'd rather Let the jury's
imagination run wild...

1056
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:08,725
than have them question
specifics.

1057
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:10,168
The glasses are a nice touch,
by the way.

1058
01:28:10,204 --> 01:28:12,172
They make you Look
very, very respectable.

1059
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:13,264
Thank you.

1060
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:14,672
I got another clue
about the LAPD T-shirt...

1061
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,107
the one with ''M.P.''
on the collar?

1062
01:28:16,143 --> 01:28:19,271
They haven't made that shirt
for two years.

1063
01:28:19,313 --> 01:28:23,750
Let us through, please.
You have to Let us through.

1064
01:28:23,784 --> 01:28:25,649
Do your job there,
will you, fellas?

1065
01:28:25,686 --> 01:28:28,450
Oh, kiss me!

1066
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:30,081
No time for family reunions.
I'm sorry.

1067
01:28:35,462 --> 01:28:37,987
I still don't have a check.

1068
01:28:38,032 --> 01:28:39,863
Did you talk to Sarah Novak
today?

1069
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,527
No. She's dead.

1070
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:44,493
So happy you could join us,
Mr. Pogue.

1071
01:28:44,538 --> 01:28:45,869
I'm happy, too.

1072
01:28:49,443 --> 01:28:51,843
-Excuse me. I need to buy--
-Just a sec.

1073
01:28:51,879 --> 01:28:53,676
Nice lady's buying a postcard.

1074
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:56,547
-OK, but--
-Patience.

1075
01:28:57,751 --> 01:29:00,481
Stand, sir.
Raise your right hand.

1076
01:29:00,521 --> 01:29:02,819
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

1077
01:29:02,856 --> 01:29:04,551
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1078
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:06,388
I do.

1079
01:29:06,427 --> 01:29:09,191
State your name and spell it
for the record, please.

1080
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:11,254
Maurice Pogue.

1081
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:16,429
P...o...g...

1082
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:22,875
-U-e!
-U-e!


1083
01:29:27,881 --> 01:29:30,008
Mr. Pogue, I'd Like to begin...

1084
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:32,780
with a few simple
background questions.

1085
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,412
You're a private investigator,
is that correct?

1086
01:29:36,957 --> 01:29:38,891
And where is
your place of business?

1087
01:29:40,794 --> 01:29:42,921
For the record.

1088
01:29:44,264 --> 01:29:46,061
-Stall!
-Stall!

1089
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,931
Excuse me?

1090
01:29:47,968 --> 01:29:50,061
No. You stall.

1091
01:29:51,772 --> 01:29:55,640
I mean...stall.

1092
01:29:55,676 --> 01:29:59,942
S'tall possible to turn up
the air conditioning here?

1093
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:09,451
Answer the question, Mr. Pogue.

1094

01:30:10,524 --> 01:30:13,152
My address.
You want my address.

1095
01:30:13,193 --> 01:30:14,558
P-o, P-o, P-o.

1096
01:30:14,595 --> 01:30:16,028
Before I give my address...

1097
01:30:16,063 --> 01:30:20,966
I'd Like to state
one thing for the record.

1098
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:23,435
That's a fabulous pin.

1099
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,268
Oh, thank you. It was a gift.

1100
01:30:26,306 --> 01:30:27,933
Really?
Have you seen this, judge?

1101
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:29,875
Objection, your honor!
Nonresponsive.

1102
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,276
He's such a well-mannered boy.

1103
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,139
Pogue! 1195 Speedway!

1104
01:30:36,183 --> 01:30:39,084
-Mr. Pogue.
-1195 Speedway.

1105
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:41,610
-Beautiful postcard.
-Can I have some batteries?

1106
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,623
Just one moment.
And your change.

1107
01:30:43,657 --> 01:30:45,420
Batteries!

1108
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,996
Mr. Pogue, is it also true
that you used to work...

1109
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,520
as a police officer?

1110
01:30:51,565 --> 01:30:53,430
-What size?
-''C.''

1111
01:30:57,171 --> 01:30:58,968
Amigo.

1112
01:31:03,477 --> 01:31:06,878
And that you retired from
the police force two years ago?

1113
01:31:12,986 --> 01:31:15,352
AII right, Mr. Pogue,
I have a few more questions...

1114
01:31:15,389 --> 01:31:17,823
before we move on.

1115
01:31:44,618 --> 01:31:47,917
Mr. Rosenheim,
do you have a question?

1116
01:31:57,598 --> 01:32:01,534
Yes, your honor,
I do have a few more questions.

1117
01:32:01,568 --> 01:32:02,865
Back stock.

1118
01:32:02,903 --> 01:32:06,430
It's in front of you,
in front of you. No, no, no!

1119
01:32:06,473 --> 01:32:08,998
Mr. Pogue...

1120
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:13,445
you're a bachelor,
isn't that correct?

1121
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,708
Do you Live alone?

1122
01:32:16,617 --> 01:32:19,677
Would you say that you Live
a promiscuous lifestyIe?

1123
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,883
Objection, your honor.
What's the relevance?

1124
01:32:22,923 --> 01:32:26,723
For background, your honor.
Rather pertinent background.

1125
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,251
Well, I'II allow
a Little leeway.

1126
01:32:29,296 --> 01:32:31,127
Thank you, your honor.
Again, Mr. Pogue.

1127
01:32:31,164 --> 01:32:34,395
Would you say you Live
a promiscuous lifestyle?

1128
01:32:35,769 --> 01:32:38,670
I--I wouldn’t say promiscuous.

1129
01:32:38,705 --> 01:32:41,265
Let me rephrase.

1130
01:32:41,308 --> 01:32:43,868
You are attracted to women,
aren't you?

1131
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,613
And not being married
hasn't kept you...

1132
01:32:47,648 --> 01:32:49,445
from being sexually active?

1133
01:32:50,751 --> 01:32:52,480
A simple yes or no will do,
Mr. Pogue.

1134
01:32:52,519 --> 01:32:54,578
-No.
-Thank you.

1135
01:32:54,621 --> 01:32:57,419
Mr. Pogue, what is
the seventh commandment?

1136
01:33:04,164 --> 01:33:06,792
The seventh commandment?

1137
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:10,132
Yes, yes,
that one in particular.

1138
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,670
The right to bear arms?

1139
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:17,609
A Little difficulty
with that one, Mr. Pogue?

1140
01:33:17,644 --> 01:33:19,134
Like some help with this, hmm?

1141
01:33:19,179 --> 01:33:21,943
Shall I help you out
with the seventh commandment?

1142
01:33:21,982 --> 01:33:24,746
Thou shall not commit adultery!

1143
01:33:24,785 --> 01:33:28,243
Your honor! Your honor!
Your honor!

1144
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:30,153
AII right.
Withdrawn. Withdrawn.

1145
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:33,682
Mr. Pogue, where were you
on the night of April 7th?

1146
01:33:39,466 --> 01:33:40,956
I don't remember.

1147
01:33:41,001 --> 01:33:42,127
Come, come, Mr. Pogue.
It was three nights ago.

1148
01:33:42,169 --> 01:33:43,431
Would you have this court
believe you don't remember...

1149
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:45,438
who you were with
three nights ago?

1150
01:33:49,076 --> 01:33:50,839
Yes. Let me refresh
your memory a Little bit.

1151
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:53,607
I have evidence here that
suggests you were with a woman!

1152
01:33:55,549 --> 01:33:57,915
Background is fine,
Mr. Rosenheim...

1153
01:33:57,951 --> 01:34:00,351
but let's get back
to the crime, please.

1154
01:34:06,259 --> 01:34:09,660
Mr. Pogue, you've testified...

1155
01:34:09,696 --> 01:34:10,822
that the defendant
was responsible...

1156
01:34:10,864 --> 01:34:14,163
for the death of Sarah Novak,
is that correct?

1157
01:34:16,103 --> 01:34:19,129
I got it! Your testimony.

1158
01:34:19,172 --> 01:34:21,572
I'm sorry, Pogue,
I'm not Sarah Novak.

1159
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:23,906
Oh, my God.

1160
01:34:23,944 --> 01:34:26,139
Pogue, I taped over it.

1161
01:34:26,179 --> 01:34:27,646
What?

1162
01:34:30,183 --> 01:34:32,447
A simple question, Mr. Pogue.

1163
01:34:32,486 --> 01:34:34,113
You testified in the past...

1164
01:34:34,154 --> 01:34:37,214
that Mr. Cornell
murdered Sarah Novak.

1165
01:34:37,257 --> 01:34:38,690
Is that correct?

1166
01:34:40,861 --> 01:34:42,522
Now, to the best
of your recollection...

1167
01:34:42,562 --> 01:34:46,396
and perhaps drawing upon
your extensive expertise...

1168
01:34:46,433 --> 01:34:47,923
in this particular area...

1169
01:34:47,968 --> 01:34:53,338
do you think
that Mr. Cornell has ever...

1170
01:34:53,373 --> 01:34:54,840
boffed his best friend's
fiancée?

1171
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,570
Objection!

1172
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,408
That's enough, Mr. Rosenheim.

Where is this leading?

1173
01:34:59,446 --> 01:35:00,743
I'II tell you where
it's leading, your honor.

1174
01:35:00,781 --> 01:35:04,080
-To his fucking grave!
-Objection, your honor!

1175
01:35:04,117 --> 01:35:06,449
Tell the court
you were with her!

1176
01:35:06,486 --> 01:35:08,511
-You're in contempt!
-You were with that slut!

1177
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:12,321
You want to talk about sluts?

1178
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:15,795
-Let's talk about Cynthia!
-Leave her out of this!

1179
01:35:15,829 --> 01:35:18,229
You slut!

1180
01:35:18,265 --> 01:35:20,961
As far as I'm concerned,
we're even!

1181
01:35:21,001 --> 01:35:22,628
Even? He did boff her!

1182
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:26,196
We need help in courtroom five.

1183
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:29,208
Damn it! What's going on here?

1184
01:35:32,179 --> 01:35:34,545
I'm sorry, Pogue.
I'm not Sarah Novak.

1185
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,980
I should’ve told you sooner...

1186
01:35:36,016 --> 01:35:38,450
but I started to Like
being Sarah...

1187
01:35:38,485 --> 01:35:42,182
and I started to Like
being with you.

1188
01:35:42,222 --> 01:35:45,055
I've lied to you throughout,
Pogue, I know...

1189
01:35:45,091 --> 01:35:47,924
but there is one thing
that's not a Lie.

1190
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:50,930
I Love you. I Love you.

1191
01:35:50,964 --> 01:35:54,730
I'm not Sarah, but I Love you.

1192
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:04,135
Rosenheim, what are you doing?

1193
01:36:04,177 --> 01:36:05,769
I can't reach his throat.

1194
01:36:05,812 --> 01:36:06,972
Order in my courtroom!

1195
01:36:36,309 --> 01:36:37,674
I gotcha!

1196
01:36:41,915 --> 01:36:44,110
Order in the court!

1197
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:47,347
I'II have order
in the courtroom!

1198
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:51,050
Leave him alone!
Leave my baby alone!

1199
01:36:56,062 --> 01:36:58,394
That's it! That's it!
That's enough!

1200
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,892
Come on, back off.
Back off. Back off.

1201
01:37:02,936 --> 01:37:05,336
You touch her again,
I'II kill you!

1202
01:37:08,174 --> 01:37:09,971
You son of a bitch!

1203
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,637
Not me, her!

1204
01:37:14,281 --> 01:37:17,682
The coin, it's in the alley
behind my apartment.

1205
01:37:17,717 --> 01:37:18,877
The Last parking meter.

1206
01:37:18,919 --> 01:37:21,979
Your memory's back!
I'm on my way.

1207
01:37:23,423 --> 01:37:25,891
I'II kill him!
Give me two seconds!

1208
01:37:25,926 --> 01:37:27,894
Get your hands off of me!

1209
01:37:27,928 --> 01:37:29,418
What are you doing?

1210
01:37:30,931 --> 01:37:32,455
I'm the bailiff, damn it!

1211
01:37:32,499 --> 01:37:35,991
I'II have your badges for this.

1212
01:37:37,571 --> 01:37:39,903
Move it on out.

1213
01:37:45,879 --> 01:37:48,848
Mr. Pogue,
what do you remember...

1214
01:37:48,882 --> 01:37:52,909
of the night of February 8th,
the death of Sarah Novak...

1215
01:37:52,953 --> 01:37:57,322
its aftermath,
and the person responsible?

1216
01:37:57,357 --> 01:37:58,949
I remember...

1217
01:38:05,465 --> 01:38:07,865
everything.

1218
01:38:14,708 --> 01:38:17,541
Miss, there are some kids
breaking into a parking meter.

1219
01:38:17,577 --> 01:38:20,068
-What? Not on my beat!
-Around the corner.

1220
01:38:20,113 --> 01:38:21,273
Thank you!

1221
01:38:39,799 --> 01:38:42,097
Why did you change your plea,
Mr. Cornell?

1222
01:38:42,135 --> 01:38:44,103
The fact that we made a deal
has no bearing...

1223
01:38:44,137 --> 01:38:45,729
on Mr. Cornell’s
guilt or innocence.

1224
01:38:45,772 --> 01:38:48,297
But it's kind of a thumbs-down
for his credibility, isn't it?

1225
01:38:48,341 --> 01:38:51,469
Thumbs-down? Thumbs-down?
What do you mean, thumbs-down?

1226
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:55,641
We will ask that Mr. Cornell
receive the maximum sentence--

1227
01:38:55,682 --> 01:38:57,115
Life imprisonment.

1228
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,777
I want to add one more thing.

1229
01:38:58,818 --> 01:39:00,979
This successful prosecution
could not have happened...

1230
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:04,548
without the assistance
of one very special person.

1231
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:07,458
Oh, thank you.
Even as a baby, I always knew...

1232
01:39:07,494 --> 01:39:10,088
that Maurice
was a very special person.

1233
01:39:39,659 --> 01:39:41,320
Hey, boy.

1234
01:39:41,361 --> 01:39:42,919
Good to see you.

1235
01:40:00,213 --> 01:40:02,238
Here we go.

1236
01:40:22,102 --> 01:40:24,161
Remember me?

1237
01:40:25,939 --> 01:40:27,600
Humphrey Bogart?

1238
01:40:30,477 --> 01:40:33,241
I can give you a hint.

1239
01:40:37,917 --> 01:40:40,078
Mmm, it's coming back.

1240
01:40:44,424 --> 01:40:46,915
You know what?
It's almost there.

1241
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:51,795
I'm cured.

1242
01:40:55,435 --> 01:40:57,903
How much do you remember,
anyway?

1243
01:40:57,937 --> 01:41:00,906
Well, let's see.
How about, uh...

1244
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:06,776
Viva suo massimo momento...

1245
01:41:06,813 --> 01:41:08,474
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1246
01:41:08,515 --> 01:41:10,949
Yeah, but what did you do
with the coin?
