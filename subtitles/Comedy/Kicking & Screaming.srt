Guys, guys!

162
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
How do you like that, Ditka?

163
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
Take it back.

164
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,840
Here, you get
the whole thing!

165
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,120
[humming]

166
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
We'll settle this later,
okay?

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,960
Yeah, you know
where to find me!

168
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

169
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,920
I got this for you, too!
Get out of here!

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
[gasping]
Phil, come on.

171
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
What are you lookin' at?

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Dad, he hit me.
He hit me with the ball.

173
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey, Dad, what happened
to all your fish?

174
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,960
That one ate the others.
I call him "Killer."

175
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Killer?

176
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
Yeah.

177
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
I like it.

178
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah.

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
You might wanna
clean the water
every now and then.

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's see what you can do.

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
Hey, Dad,
I didn't know if...

182
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,040
I wanted to
talk to you about Sam.

183
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Sammy's a good boy.

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,280
Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,280
Yeah.

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
He hasn't been
playing much lately
and, I didn't know if--

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
Stop right there.
I agree with you.

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
And I got some
great news.

189
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
He's gonna get
a lot more
playing time now.

190
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Dad, thanks,
that's--that's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

191
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,320
I traded him
to the Tigers.

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,360
[glass shattering]

193
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,400
(Buck)
Ooh, hey!

194
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,880
[sparking]

195
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,360
You traded
your own grandson?

196
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
Well, I didn't actually
get anything for him.

197
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
You know that cost $400?

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,320
I can't believe it.

199
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,840
W-What, you
calling me a liar?
I'll show you the receipt.

200
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
No, l-I'm talking
about Sam!

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,200
W-Why didn't you
just play him more?

202
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,600
He is going to
play more, Philly--

203
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah, for another team!

204
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
You--You--You care
about winning that much?

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
Look, Phil,
I'm not just
coaching soccer.

206
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm building men.

207
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
Okay, yeah.

208
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,040
Hey, hey, hey.

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
It's an impressive shot.
Sure.

210
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
But, you know,
I want Sam to have fun.

211
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
This isn't the big leagues.

212
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,160
For those who live
between Broadway
and Grandville,

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,600
between the ages
of 10 and 12,

214
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
who are free
on Sundays and Tuesdays,

215
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
this is the big leagues.

216
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
But what about Sam?

217
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,680
Sam, you saw him
out there today.
It breaks my heart.

218
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,920
At best,
he's a benchwarmer.

219
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
Wow! Oh!

220
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
Oh, Killer! Killer!

221
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
How did that happen?

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
[sighs]

223
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Hey, Sam,
you wanna give us a minute?

224
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Need a little adult time.

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
Uh-huh.

226
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
[door closes]

227
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
[sighs]

228
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,040
Of all the asinine things
my dad has done,

229
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,280
this is by far
the most asinine.

230
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,560
I mean, I know he's
the most competitive man
in the world.

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
But this beats them all.
I'm angry.

232
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm--I'm spitting angry!

233
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm like a tornado of anger,
swirling about!

234
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,640
My heart rate is
dangerously high right now.

235
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm glad it happened,
l--

236
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
What?
Yeah.

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,480
What do you mean?

238
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Where did my wife go?
Are you a robot?

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,480
Are you a robot-woman?

240
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,440
I--I am not a robot.

241
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760
Phil, honey,
I know this is
upsetting, okay,

242
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,440
but you have to try to
find the positive in this.

243
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,440
It was unhealthy
for Sam to play
on your dad's team.

244
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Now he'll play
for the Tigers

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
[sighs]
and have some fun.

246
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,240
Okay, look,
you're too upset about this.

247
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
So, I'll tell him, okay?

248
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
No, no, no,
no, no, no, l...

249
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,880
I need to tell him.

250
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,280
[sighs]

251
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
[grunts]

252
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
Benchwarmer?

253
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,280
[grunts]

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
[hissing]

255
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,280
Boy, did that hurt my face.

256
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,440
[knocking on door]

257
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,680
Sammy?
Yeah?

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Hey.
Hey.

259
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,600
What are you doing?
Nothing.

260
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,320
Internet dating?
No.

261
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
Mail-order bride?
No.

262
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,360
Just kidding.

263
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,760
(Phil)
Look, uh, I got
some good news.

264
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,000
I got you put on a new team.

265
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm not on the Gladiators
anymore?

266
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,480
No.

267
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,720
You're on the Tigers.

268
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
[snarling]

269
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,560
The Tigers?
Yeah.

270
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,440
They're in last place.

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,520
Yeah, but you're gonna get
more playing time.

272
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
Did Grandpa trade me?

273
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,280
No.

274
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,240
Yes, wait.
I'm happy this is happening.

275
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
This is a good thing.

276
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,240
You know, it doesn't seem
like a good thing,

277
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
but it's a good thing.
Trust me.

278
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,000
You do not wanna be
the kid

279
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,480
that's on the other end
of the bench.

280
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
You do not
want to be that kid.

281
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,880
'Cause I know that kid.

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,480
You don't wanna be him.

283
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay.

284
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,760
You don't wanna be the kid
who has such suppressed rage

285
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,120
that his heart's about
to burst through his chest.

286
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
[panting]

287
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,000
You don't wanna
be the kid that
when he thinks about

288
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
what his dad did to him...

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
[gasps]

290
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,400
I know that kid. I know.

291
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,200
That kid lives right here
in this house!

292
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Mom!

293
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
[wheezing]

294
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
Oh.

295
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,680
Mom!

296
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
He doesn't know what to do.
He doesn't--

297
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
Ouch!

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,160
Phew.

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
Okay?
Yes. Good.

300
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Coach Benson will be
good for you.
He knows his stuff.

301
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,120
I bet you this whole thing
is gonna turn out to be

302
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,080
a blessing in disguise.

303
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
Hey, the Tigers
may be in last place,

304
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,480
but those guys
look pretty good.

305
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,360
Dad, those
aren't the Tigers.

306
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
They're not even
wearing blue.

307
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,160
The Tigers are
over there.

308
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm having a baby.
Oh, I'm having a baby.

309
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
No hitting the baby.

310
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,080
No, no, don't hit
my precious baby.

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,040
[splashing]

312
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh, look,
it's gonna come out!
It's gonna come out! Oh!

313
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,560
Cut it out!

314
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Oh, it's gonna come out!

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,640
Oh.

316
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,040
Hi, excuse me. Uh,
Coach Benson around?

317
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah, you all know
Phil Weston?

318
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
(John)
Oh, yeah.

319
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,560
Hey, welcome to the team,
little fellow.

320
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,760
Why don't you go
join those other kids
over there?

321
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,280
Yeah, go ahead.

322
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,640
There's a moving truck
in front of Benson's house.

323
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Did you hear?
The pressure of
coaching got to him.

324
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,920
He cracked.

325
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,360
How could he crack?
We're only one game
into the season.

326
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,120
All right,
Tigers, it's game time.

327
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,800
Oh, but we're waiting
for our coach.

328
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,440
Well, then one of you
will have to coach.

329
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah, but I had
talked to Coach Benson,
we're brand new--

330
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right.

331
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Find yourself a coach,
or the Tigers forfeit.

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes?

333
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
Where do I know you from?

334
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,040
I've been your neighbor
for seven years.

335
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
No, that ain't it.

336
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
No, that's definitely it.

337
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,680
I'll figure it out.

338
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
So, who's gonna coach?

339
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
We got Mark into soccer,
'cause we wanted
to take a break.

340
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,560
I didn't think I'd be
coaching the little bugger.

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,960
I just got laid off.
I'm looking for a job

342
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,920
so it's hard enough
to drag myself out of bed.

343
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,440
So, uh, we forfeit.

344
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
So, we're forfeiting?

345
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
No, no, no, no. Uh,

346
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
you know what,
l--I can coach.

347
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
Well, that's swell!
Great!

348
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Just for one game.

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,680
Right. It's game time.
Get your team on the field.

350
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
Who are we playing?

351
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,360
How about
you use your eyes?

352
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Oh, great.

What are you doing here?
Where's Benson?

358
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,840
Oh, Benson's a no-show.
I'm gonna coach
the Tigers today.

359
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
Ooh. You sure
you wanna do that?

How you doing, Buck?

361
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040

Good luck, Buck.

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah. All right.
Yeah, good luck.

Okay. Let's go, guys.

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Okay, Tigers, uh,
why don't we have
starters take the field?

370
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
We don't have starters,
we never got that far.

371
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,360
All right. Well, then,
how about, uh you,

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,120
This book
really helped us
deal with it.

482
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay.
You'll probably
wanna give it a glance.

"My Child is Shy. "
Yeah.

484
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,840
Thank you.

485
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
Good.
Thank you.

486
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
who's your son?

487
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
Byong Sun.
Oh, I see.

488
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
Actually, l...
You know what, I don't see.

489
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
I'm sorry, l...

490

Oh, wait, now I see. Wow!

491
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,440
[whispering]
Okay.

492
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,600
We're at every game.

493
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,160
Not like a lot
of the other parents.

494
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,440
No, no, no, not like
the other parents at all.

[chuckles]

496
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Better! You're better
than the other parents.

[both chuckling]

Oh, so they're better?

No, no, I mean--
I mean, they're--
Well, they're different.

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
What do you mean
"different"?

501
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,520
No, l... You're different
because you're better.

502
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,560
How are they better?

503
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
No, look...

504
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
You're both better different

505
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,120
in a different
but better way.

506
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,120
Okay. You know what,
let's get the rest.

507
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,560
A little early to start
playing favorites, Phil.

Get up, Dad.

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,400

Nice fall.

(Ambrose)
Love it, yeah!

516
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,440
Grab a ball!

517
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,760
Here we go. Fan out.
Form a circle here.

518
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,880
Great. Okay, now,

519
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,360
I don't know,
it may just be me,

520
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,480
but, uh, I really got
a feeling like
we could catch fire

521
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
and have a great season. Huh?

522
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,760
Now, who's with me?

523
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,800
[whoops]

524
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,000
It's electric in the air!
Yeah!

525
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
Thank you for that show
of enthusiasm.

526
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Uh, well, l--I thought
we would just start,
uh, today by going around,

527
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
introducing yourselves,
and telling me

528
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,720
your--your strengths
on the soccer field.

529

All right.

Hey, I'm Hunter.

Hey, Hunter. I'm Phil.

533

Hi, Phil. Uh, l-I'll
eat this worm for $5.

534
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,120
How would that help us?

535
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,440
I'd have an extra $5?

536
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,360
No, you're not going to
eat that, are you?

Did you just eat that?

Yeah, I ate it.

541
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
Now you owe me $5.

542
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,520
I didn't agree to pay you $5.

543

Oh, that's sweet.
That's very sweet.

to soccer?

No, sir.

you called us out

some time, Phil.

No. I already know.
It was awful.

what a whirling dervish is,

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,000
No smoking means
no smokin'!

641
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
Okay, come on, Phil.

642
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,080
I'll throw this out
the window, honey.

643
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,000
Uh, l-I'm sorry, Mrs. D....
I'm sorry.

644
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,520
You should be.

645
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
It's a nasty, filthy habit.

646
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
Hey.

647
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,720
You can count me in.

648
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
Really?

649
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
Let's bring
your old man down.
Oh, great.

650
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,960
[people chattering]

651
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,160
(boy)
Give me a drink.

652
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,800
It's just a great group.
Okay, uh, Tigers.

653
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,720
[blowing whistle]

654
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480
Look who's here.

655
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,200
I'll give you a hint.

656
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
Hall of Fame?

657
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,560
Chicago Bears?

658
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,400
Sammy Sosa?

659
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,440
No, no, no.
Come on.

660
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,760
No, football.

661
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,320
Coached the 1986--

662
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,280
'85.

663
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,200
Uh, '85 Bears
to a Super Bowl victory?

664
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,400
It's Mike Ditka.

665
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
[people applauding]
Yeah.

666
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
Do you know Sammy Sosa?

667
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,600
Hey, zip it, kid!

668
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,360
I'm a coach that knows
about winning.

669
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm gonna push you guys
like you've never
been pushed before.

670
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,920
Some of you are
gonna wish I was dead.

671
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
It's true.

672
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,880
I know it's a weird thought,
but it's true.

673
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
I eat quitters for breakfast
and I spit out their bones.

674
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,520
Delicious.

675
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Now this is gonna be
the hardest
most difficult thing

676
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,560
you ever attempted
in your entire life.

677
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,720
You know what
when it's over--
It will get emotional.

678
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,280
When it's over...
When it's over...

679
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,240
...you guys are
gonna be champions.
Champions.

680
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,040
By God, you're
gonna be champions.

681
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,440
All right, everybody up.
Come on.

682
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Come on, hands in.

683
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,600
Come on, everybody.
Let's go out
and kick some butt.

684
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,400
Here we go. On three.
Let's have fun.

685
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,800
(all)
One, two, three.
Let's have fun.

686
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,680
"Let's have fun?"
What's that?

687
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,800
I just made it up.

688
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,880
On the ground,
give me the pushups,
come on.

689
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
If you guys
were with the Bears,

690
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,480
I'd fine you each
$10,000 apiece.

691
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
This calls for some
drastic measures.

692
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
We're gonna make
some changes around here.

693
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,480
Come on, move it.
Move it! Faster! Faster!

694
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,040
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

695
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,960
Move it! Move it!
Put some pressure
on those legs!

696
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,000
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

697
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
No candy!
Your mother said
you can't have any candy!

698
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
Please. Give me it back.

699
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
No candy.
Please. No. Please?

700
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Hey! I got eyes
in the back of my head.

701
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
[all groaning]
Come on, girls.
You gotta move it.

702
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
You gotta move it.
All the way!

703
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
Come on, move it. Move it.

704
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,400
But, coach, how is this
gonna help me with soccer?

705
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,400
It's not gonna
help you with soccer,

706
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,680
but I'm gonna get
my trash taken out, okay?

707
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,520
Come on, Beyonce,
let's get that
back end done.

708
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Uh, Coach? Shouldn't we
be going to soccer practice?

709
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm not going to
soccer practice
with a dirty car.

710
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
[whistle blowing]

711
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,320
Here we go, gang.
Let's go, Tigers. Come on.

712
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's go get them.

713
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,600
(Ditka)
Come on,
kick butt out there.

714
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,960
You're great.

00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,080
[whistle blows]

716
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Hey, Sam.

717
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,320
Yeah?

718
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,400
What is it, Dad?
How you doing?

719
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
Good.
Good. Good.

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,120
Ow!

721
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,160
What was that for? Jeez!

722
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,000
Did you just
kick your son?

723
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Yeah.

724
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320

Stop them! Come on.
Stop them!

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
Stop them! Stop them!

728
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Are you following me?
No.

Uh.

[whistle blows]
Oh.

735
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Shake it off, Sam.
Get some circulation
back in your skull.

Go, Jack, go.

[children cheering]

740
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,560
That's a legitimate goal,
right?

741
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,680
That's a real goal.

742
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
Okay, then,
that's a real goal.

743
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,560
10 more of those
and we're in business.

744
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,680
Look at me,
I'm the ref. I'm the ref.
I'm the ref.

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,720
(referee)
All right. Very funny.

746
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
You can't catch me
if you want,
because I'm the ref.

747
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Okay. Very funny.
Very, very funny.
Very funny.

748
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,280
All right. You all had
a laugh? Fine! Play on!

749
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Sorry about that.

750
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,920
How much do you think
those things are?

751
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,920
I have no idea.

752
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,840
Oh.

Shut up you little rats!

759
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,880
They're just showing
their appreciation.

760
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,120
Forget the appreciation.

761
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
I wanna win a soccer game!

762
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,000
Okay.

763
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,240
Hey, can I have this?

764
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah, go ahead.
All right!

765
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,040
Uh, good game, everyone.

766
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,600
Great effort.
Come on, let's go.

767
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,920
We'll just reconvene
at a later time.

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
All right, everyone.

769
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,680
Uh, if I could
have your attention.

770
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,560
I got a little something
for the Tigers here

771
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
to express my--my gratitude

772
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,360
and, well,
just a big thank you

773
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
for all the hard work.

774
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
(woman)
All right!

775
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
So, uh...

776
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,560
So what'd you bring, Phil?

777
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
Finches.

778
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,120
Fishes?

779
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,760
No! No, no, no. No.
Finches. Birds.

780
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm holding them.

781
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,680
They're tiny birds.

782
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
Yeah, so everyone,
come up here
and grab a finch.

Come on. Come on, guys.

784
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,880
You can watch them grow,
right in front of
your, uh, very own eyes.

[birds twittering]

786
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,800
We have to keep them?

787
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,280
You get to keep them.

788
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Why is this fun?

789
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200

I want to welcome you all
to tonight's

Highland Heights
Soccer Organization
parent's dinner.

791
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,680
Every year,
we like to take
a little time

792
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,640
for the coaches
to come up here

793
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
to tell us a little
about their team.

794
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,200
(man)
All right.

795
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,880
How about I bring up
someone who's new
to coaching in this league,

796
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,360
but is close to me?

797
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,880
I love him like a son.
Come on up, Phil.

Come on, Phil.

799
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,520
Come on, Philly. Come on.

800
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Go. Yes.

801
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,800
Good guy. Good guy.

802
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,320
[man whistling]

803
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,920
Good to see you.

804
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,320
Thanks, Dad.

805
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
Uh, thanks, Janice.

806
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,280
Hello, uh,

807
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
I'm, uh, I'm Phil Weston.

808
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
And you got balls!

809
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
[audience laughing]

810
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
He's got vitamins.

811
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,680
[audience laughing]

812
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,080
That's very funny, Dad.
Hilarious.

813
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,320
So when I took over
for Coach Benson--

814
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,800
I hear he's a woman now.

815
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
[audience laughing]

816
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,120
Ooh.

817
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,040
Actually, uh, truth be told,
no one knows
where he is right now.

818
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,640
A lot of people
are concerned.

819
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,240
[audience laughing]

820
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,840
I don't know
why that's funny.

821
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,280
God, I'm going to be honest,
I--I didn't plan on
speaking tonight.

822
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,840
I--I was-- I was
actually hoping that

823
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,080
my--my assistant coach
would be here,

824
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
uh, to kind of...

825
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
[audience murmuring]

826
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce
Mike Ditka.

827
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,480
[audience cheering]

828
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,280
It's Mike Ditka, everyone!

829
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,200
Say a few words.

830
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,320
Thanks, Paul,
thanks, everybody.
It's--It's great to be here

831
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
and, uh, gonna have
a lot of fun tonight.

832
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Paul's got the Tigers
on the move.

833
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
All right!

834
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
You live long enough,
you see everything.

835
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,800
Iron Mike and Aluminum Phil
coaching the Tigers.

836
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,320
[audience laughing]

837
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,160
I couldn't really hear you.

838
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,880
My Super Bowl ring
was making too much noise.

839
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,560
Ooh.

840
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,280
You see it, Dad?
Right there, Dad.
That was a great one.

841
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,920
Read it and weep.

842
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,680
[audience applauding]

843
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
Ditka is a great coach,
we understand that,
but he's a football coach.

844
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Understand?
Right.

845
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
And we are
still losing, Phil.

846
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,040
Okay, I understand
your concern about our record,

847
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,200
but with me
it's not about win-lose.

848
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,640
We are going to win one game
eventually, right?

849
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,040
Well, we've had
a rocky start,

850
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,160
but with
a strong team effort,
we will win some

851
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,560
I think.

852
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
Remember,
there's no "l" in team.

853
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,680
But there is an "l"
in win.

854
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,760
There is an "l" in win.

855
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,800
Hey, wait.

856
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,840
Uh, parents,
Honey.

857
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,480
I didn't see you step up
when the team was in need.

858
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,600
Okay.
Okay.

859
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,720
Phil is not
the greatest coach
in the world,

860
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,560
I'll give you that,
but at least he's trying.

861
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
I can defend myself,
please.

862
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,520
You think he enjoys losing
week after week,

863
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,560
in front of his own son?

864
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,600
You're making it worse.
You're making it worse.

865
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,440
What's with the birds?
That was weird.

866
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,560
I've got my hands full
with Hunter.
I don't need a bird.

867
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,720
Okay, you know what?
You got me. All right?

868
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,240
The finches were
a bad idea.

869
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,200
And I wasn't going to
say this, but I think
some of them have salmonella.

870
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,760
A fair amount, in fact.
What?

871
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,520
I may have inadvertently
poisoned your children.

872
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
You and l,
we got something going.

873
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,600
You know, maybe we can coach
the Little League together.

874
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,960
You really
think that, huh?
Yeah.

875
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,200
Coach Ditka?
Yes?

876
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,040
Hi. Um, uh, our son,
Byong Sun, he's very shy
and I was just wondering--

877
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,760
Sure. Yeah, I'd be glad to.

878
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,120
Thank you so much.

879
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
How do you spell that?

880
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,480
It's, uh, Byong Sun.
B-Y--

881
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,480
I think I got it.

882
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
Oh, oh, okay,

883
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,040
Okay?
thank you.

884
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,000
Bye-bye.

885
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,040
Thanks, Phil.

886
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,240
Yeah. They're great.

887
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,280
Just a wonderful couple.

888
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
(Phil)
Yeah.

889
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
Bing Bong?

890
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,280
Hey, Philly.

891
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,440
Yeah, Dad.

892
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,800
Hey, I've been
meaning to talk to you

893
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,480
about this Ditka thing.
I don't like it one bit.

894
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
Yeah, well, he's right here.

895
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm not blind.

896
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,560
What, are you trying
to stick it to the old man?

897
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,400
You go to my mortal enemy
for help?

898
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,160
That's no way
to talk about your neighbor.

899
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,120
Oh, yeah?

900
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
He's right.

901
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,800
I hated him
from the first time
I laid eyes on him.

902
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,680
Maybe even before that,
because I know
you're the guy that wrote

903
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,520
"Ditka sucks" on my driveway.

904
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
What are you
even doing here?

905
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,680
You're just doing this
to get under my skin.

906
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm glad you figured it out.

907
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
And I'm getting under
your skin.

908
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,280
It's gonna get
a lot worse
before it gets better.

909
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,840
In your dreams.

910
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,400
Ooh.

911
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Hey, why don't you take
that pretty young wife
of yours and go home?

912
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
What did you call her?

913
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,320
(Phil)
Hey guys, please.
It's a compliment.

914
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,800
I said she's lovely
and she's young.

915
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
She's the light of my life.
You don't talk about her.

916
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,880
I go home when I want.

917
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,840
It's Mike Ditka. He's big.
Stay out of this.

918
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,960
I'll tell you
for the last time.
Hit the road!

919
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Who's gonna make me?
I am.

920
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,080
You're acting like-- Oh!

921
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,680
I took a punch
from Hall of Famer,
Mike Ditka,

922
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,480
and I did not go down.

923
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,800
Sure, I wobbled a bit,
but I did not go down.

924
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,480
That Ditka has fists
like a small truck.

925
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,280
Come here.

926
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
[thumping]

927
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,560
Okay.

928
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,720
[groans]

929
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah, you need to relax.

930
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
Yeah.

931
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,960
You should've
seen the look
on my dad's face.

932
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,960
Priceless.

933
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,600
'Cause that punch
was meant for him,

934
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,320
that's what
makes me feel so good.

935
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,880
Okay, Phil,
can we please not talk

936
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,960
about your dad
or Ditka tonight?
Please?

937
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
I--l... You just need
to relax.

938
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,280
You're right.
Yeah.

939
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm sorry.
Okay.

940
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
Yeah, I just get--

941
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,760
[both moaning]

942
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,720
[sobbing]

943
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,560
I'm in
way over my head.

944
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,200
I got punched in the face
and it hurt.

945
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,840
Honey, come on,
the kids need a real coach.

946
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,760
Phil?

947
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,760
Yeah?

948
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,720
I love you.

949
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,040
What does that have
to do with anything?

950
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,160
Okay. I quit.
I give up. I give up.
You go talk to Ditka.

951
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,320
What for? He scares me.

952
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,320
Have you ever
looked into his eyes?

953
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,760
Or at his hair?

954
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,080
Well, he's been coaching
for a long time.

955
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
Share your feelings
with him.

956
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,400
You want me
to share my feelings
of inadequacy

957
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
with Mike Ditka?

958
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,280
Uh. What else can you do?

959
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,640
[sighs]

960
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,120
Okay. You're right.

961
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,440
You're right.
You're always right.

962
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,280
I'm sorry.
I'll go talk to him.

963
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,400
Okay?
Okay.

964
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
And, Phil...
Yeah?

965
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,920
try not to cry
in front of him.

966
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,720
[bawling]

967
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,520
Hey, hey, get a grip
on yourself, okay? Man up.

968
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,520
I can't.

969
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,320
You better or else
I'm gettin' out of here.

970
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,920
Here, drink this coffee.

971
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,520
I don't like coffee.
It's a vasoconstrictor.

972
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,800
Hey, coffee is
the number one drink
in the world.

973
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,920
Everybody drinks it.

974
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,200
Even little kids in Mexico
drink coffee.

975
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Well, I'm not a little kid
in Mexico.

976
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,600
[sobbing]
Okay? In fact,
I don't know who I am.

977
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,760
I took a long hard look
at myself in the mirror,
and you know what I saw?

978
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,760
What?

979
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Nothing.

980
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,480
My dad, he's something.

981
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,560
I mean, I've never
lived up to my dad's
expectations.

982
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,280
And to top it all off,
I'm letting Sam down.
My own son!

983
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,160
Ah. Hey!

984
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,240
Ow!

985
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,040
Knock it off.
I don't care about that.

986
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,800
Why is everyone
slapping me lately?

987
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,160
Drink the coffee.
It'll make you
feel better.

988
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,160
I don't-- I don't like...

989
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,160
[sniffing]

990
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,880
Um, uh,

991
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,800
Yeah. Uh-huh.
yeah, it's good.

992
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,480
Picks you up.
It calms you down.

993
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
It's the lifeblood
that drives the dreams
of champions.

994
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh.

995
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,680
Now, you gotta tell me
the problem,

996
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,080
but if you cry,
I'm out of here.

997
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,000
I--I can't do it.
I can't coach.
I can't beat my old man.

998
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,600
You can beat your dad!
He's just a man.

999
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,640
This coaching business,
Paul, is tough stuff.

1000
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,560
Phil.

1001
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,120
Whatever. It's tough stuff.

1002
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
And when you lose,
it all comes down on you.

1003
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,600
But listen,
when you put it
all together,

1004
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,600
and you win,
it's the greatest feeling
in the world.

1005
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,040
It's like
winning the Super Bowl.

1006
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,320
Really?
Yeah, really.

1007
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,280
Except, you saddled me
with a bunch of stiffs.

1008
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
Take me 3 years
to get these guys
shaped up.

1009
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm sorry.

1010
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,880
But I got a good idea.

1011
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,400
Maybe we take a shortcut,
stick it to your old man
real good.

1012
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,880
But in order to do that,
we gotta get
some fresh meat.

1013
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay.

1014
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
(Umberto)
Keepa this up,
you get nowhere in meat.

1015
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,040
[speaking ltalian]

1016
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,880
Maria, the prosciutto.
It's almost 10:00.

1017
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
(Maria)
Okay.

1018
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Umberto!

1019
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey, coach.

1020
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,880
Don't you worry,
I got you bratwurst
all ready.

1021
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,160
Hello.

1022
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,200
Beautiful. Grazie.

1023
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,600
[speaking ltalian]

1024
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,640
Right.

1025
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,040
Are your nephews
working today?

1026
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,400
Uh, si, in the back.

1027
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,320
Go back and take
a look at these guys.

1028
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
(Umberto)
Maria?

1030
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,080
[both speaking ltalian]

1031
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,960
[whispering]
Wow!

1032
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,320
Oh, they're terrific.

1033
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,240
Pretty impressive, huh?

1034
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,320
[both whooping]
Yes!

1035
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,720
These kids are the right age,
and they live in the district.
Why not?

1036
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,840
[speaking ltalian]

1037
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,400
Uh, excuse me, mister.
Your--Your two nephews...

1038
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,360
(Umberto)
Si?

1039
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,360
Uh, would--would they be
interested in, uh,
playing soccer?

1040
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,760
Massimo e Gian Piero?

1041
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
(Phil)
Yeah.

1042
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,600
No, no, no,
they not play soccer.

1043
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,920
They come here
to apprentice me.
Yeah.

1044
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,880
They have too much
to learn.

1045
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,480
You know, English, meat.
Too much.

1046
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
So they don't
play soccer at all?

1047
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
[speaking ltalian]

1048
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,120
(Phil)
They could learn
from the American kids.

1049
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,640
Don't look like that to me.
Please.

1050
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,840
[speaking ltalian]

1051
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,080
They play with American kids,
they--they pick up English.

1052
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,840
A lot--lot of famous athletes
have learned English
through sports.

1053
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
Sammy Sosa.
Yeah.

1054

Leon Spinks, uh,
Elvis Costello.

1056
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,560
No. No.

1057
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,040
Bjorn Borg, Mark Spitz.

1058
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,040
Let the kids
have some fun.

1059
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,680
Okay! Okay!

1060
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Great.

1061
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,360
But remember.
Meat first, then soccer.

1062
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,360
Yes!

1063
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,640

Every great thing in life
starts with a brat.

a five-game losing streak,
but I've got good news.

1069
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,440
Umberto.
I've got two new players
joining the team.

1070
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,400
Guys, Gian Piero and Massimo.

1071
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
Now, these boys
are from ltaly, okay?

1072
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,080
So they don't
speak English that well.

1073
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
We're all gonna
help them learn.

1074
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
They're apprentice butchers.

1075
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,000
Did the blacksmiths
and the candlestick makers
not make it?

1076
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,960
Shut up.

Ah, meat first.
Yes, si.

# Let's get it started, ha #

1277
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,480
# Let's get it started
in here ##

1278
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,560
(boys)
Go Tigers!

1279
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,480
# Spaghetti, marinara,
lasagna ##

1280
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
Don't forget
the meatballs!

1281
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,440
Hey, hey!

1282
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,840
Hey! Here we go!

1283
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Hey.

1284
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,040
Are you serious?

1285
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,040
I'll go change
in my car.

1286
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,200
Hurry up.

1287
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,840
[all cheering]

1288
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,720
[sizzling]

1289
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,040
Yeah.

1290
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,000
Hey, Philly.

1291
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,000
[sighs]

1292
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,040
Smells good.

1293
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,040
Yeah.

1294
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,200
They're
sirloin burgers.

1295
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,240
No, I mean the air.

1296
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,240
What?

1297
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,680
Smells fresh.
Yeah.

1298
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,720
What do you
mean?

1299
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,760
Beautiful day.

1300
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,800
Yeah.

1301
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,680
Couldn't ask for
a more beautiful day.

1302
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,600
I'm feeling
fully alive.

1303
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
Tigers have won
five in a row.

1304
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,560
The ltalians and Ditka
have won five in a row.

1305
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,680
We're 500.

1306
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,040
Yeah,
we're 1,000.

1307
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,160
Look, Dad,
I got a feeling

1308
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,920
we're gonna make
it to the finals.

1309
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,360
You what?
Gonna go where?

1310
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,760
Yeah.

1311
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,840
You're serious?

1312
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,320
Yeah, you bet I'm serious.

1313
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,400
[chuckling]

1314
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,320
Looks like somebody needs
to be taken down
a couple of notches.

1315
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,440
What is the law, Phil?

1316
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,440
Stop it, Dad.

1317
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,840
The law says:

1318
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,920
"You shall never beat
the old man at anything."

1319
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Just serve.

1320
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay.

1321
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,360
[chuckling]

1322
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,600

[chuckles]

1324
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh, foul, foul, foul!
Come on!

1325
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,160
You a little klutzy?

1326
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,240
All right.

1327
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,960
Okay,
here we go.

1328
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,880
Pooh! Boom!

1329
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,880
[groaning]

1330
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Sorry.
Huevos Rancheros.

1331
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,960
You wanna quit now?

1332
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,160
No, no, no, no, no.

1333
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,240
[grunts]

1334
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,760
Oh!

1335
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,400
[chuckles]

1336
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,080
Ole!

1337
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,400
[groaning]

1338
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,880
[laughing]

1339
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
You okay?

1340
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Serve it.

1341
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,240
[groaning]

1342
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,880
Phil? Honey?

1343
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,040
Don't talk to me,
it's father-son time!

1344
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,000
[chuckling]

1345
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,000
Come on.

1346
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,280
Somebody should be
videotapin' this.

1347
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,920
Ooh. Who's your trainer?

1348
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,520
Stop talking and serve!

1349
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,480
Maniac.

1350
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,440
Now, I bury you.

1351
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,000
Bury you!

1352
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,280
Bury you!

1353
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,800
Bury you!

1354
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,880
Yeah.

1355
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,680
I'll see you inside.

1356
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,840
Okay.

1357
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,880
[chuckling]

1358
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,040
That's the best
I've ever played
against him.

1359
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,760
Yeah, it didn't grind
the barbecue to a halt at all.

1360
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,560
Ow.

1361
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,320
You made
an excellent impression
on your son, by the way.

1362
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,920
Hey, l--I almost had you.

1363
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,680
What do you call that again,
when you almost win?

1364
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, losing.

1365
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,000
I'll tell you, Dad.

1366
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,240
The Tigers are
making it to the finals.

1367
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,560
That ain't
never gonna happen.

1368
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,640
Oh, yeah?

1369
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,480
Never.

1370
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,320
You wanna make a bet?

1371
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,320
Yeah.

1372
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,400
Yeah?

1373
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,400
Fine. Okay.
We'll bet.

1374
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,880
I beat you,

1375
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,680
and you sell that break-even
snake-oil stand of yours.

1376
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
And you're gonna
come to work for me.

1377
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,080
No. No, I'm not
gonna work for you.

1378
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,080
Uh? Oh.

1379
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,160
[imitating
chicken clucking]

1380
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,480
Okay, okay,
okay, okay. Stop.

1381
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,920
Okay. But if I win...

1382
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,200
What?

1383
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,360
I get the Pele ball.

1384
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,280
Do what?

1385
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,840
If I beat you
in the finals,

1386
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,760
Pele ball.
It's mine. I get it.

1387
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,520
(commentator)
Here comes Pele.

1388
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,080
A little high
and into the crowd.

1389
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,240
I got it! I got it!

1390
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,440
No. I got it.

1391
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,880
[people clapping]

1392
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Yeah!

1393
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Dad?

1394
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
What?

1395
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,880
Can I have the ball?

1396
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,880
For what?
I caught it. Why?

1397
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,480
You get
the next one.

1398
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,200
If I beat you in the finals,
I get the Pele ball.

1399
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
For the day.

1400
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,160
Forever.

1401
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,040
No way, Jose.
No, sir. No way.

1402
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,640
[imitating chicken clucking]

1403
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,080
[all laughing]

1404
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,320
All right. All right.

1405
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah?

1406
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,640
We got ourselves a bet,
okay?

1407
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,800
All right.

1408
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,360
Good.
Good.

1409
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,640
Good.
Yes.

1410
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,680
See you tomorrow.

1411
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,600
Okay. Good.

1412
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,720
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to cut you off, sir.

1413
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Ooh.

1414
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,120
Not a chance.
Gotta go feed the meter.

1415
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,480
Line 'em up.

1416
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,240
Your wife told me about

1417
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,720
the bet you made
with your old man.

1418
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,200
Oh, yeah?
What of it?

1419
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,520
I think maybe

1420
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,880
you're getting
ahead of yourself.

1421
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,520
We played the easy
part of our schedule.

1422
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,840
We gotta win
five games in a row

1423
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,280
just to make
the semifinals.

1424
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,360
So maybe you should--

1425
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,120
Maybe you should
worry more about the team

1426
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,320
and less
about the schedule.

1427
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,320
What?

1428
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,960
There's a lot of
slothfulness going on.

1429
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,960
Slothfulness?

1430
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,080
Yeah.

1431
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,520
Let's go, Tigers.
Bring it in.

1432
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,960
Bring it in, guys.

1433
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,760
Let's go.

1434
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Grab some bench.

1435
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,320
Look how much time it takes
for them to come in.

1436
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,080
Take a seat.
Let's go.

1437
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,040
Okay, guys.

1438
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,040
I had you come
here early today,

1439
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,440
so we could talk
about some sloppy play.

1440
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,760
It's come
to my attention

1441
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,680
that lately,
I've noticed

1442
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,960
a general,
blatant disregard

1443
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,240
for our game plan.

1444
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,240
Ambrose.

1445
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,240
Yeah?

1446
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,720
I saw a bunch of
nonsense out there.

1447
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,720
What was going
through your head
out there last week?

1448
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,320
I was breaking
my back for you, Coach,

1449
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,920
because of my love
for the game.

1450
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,080
Liar!

1451
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,720
Jack.
What?

1452
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,440
Who are you supposed
to pass the ball to?

1453
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,440
The ltalians.

1454
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,520
Right. Alex, when?

1455
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,080
When I come in
contact with the ball.

1456
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,200
The instant you come
in contact with the ball.

1457
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,360
That's our strategy.

1458
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,240
It's one of the many plays
we've worked out.

1459
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,920
It's the only play
we've worked out.

1460
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,920
How many sarcastic pills
did you take this morning?

1461
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Coach,
I'm just saying--

1462
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,040
"But, Coach..."

1463
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,760
[mocking]

1464
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,000
You gotta
lighten up.

1465
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,160
He started it.

1466
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,680
I seem to remember
a certain little boy

1467
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,560
who was very
sad when he lost.

1468
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,520
And that same little boy
was very happy when he won.

1469
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,760
I'm doing this
for you, okay?

1470
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,240
So that
we can have fun.

1471
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Right? Fun. Okay.

1472
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,520
Yeah.

1473
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,120
Hey,
you're--you're late.

1474
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,760
Wh-Wh-Where've
you been?

1475
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,800
Uh,
there's a problem.

1476
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,400
Wait, where's Gian
Piero and Massimo?

1477
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,920
We were supposed
to pick them up.

1478
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,440
Hey, what's going on?

1479
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,560
[speaking in ltalian]

1480
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,200
[all gasp]
Where are my ltalians?

1481
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,600
Huh?

1482
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,640
I can't afford to
lose this one, Umberto.

1483
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Meat is now.
Me and the boy will work

1484
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,720
all day to get
this order done.

1485
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,600
It's a big, big order.

1486
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,320
No, no, no. I... Believe me,
I know. Meat comes first.

1487
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,320
Sure.

1488
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,680
I've only heard it about
a thousand times from you.

1489
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,400
I can't talk to you.
Here, you take this.

1490
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,200
(Phil)
I'm really getting
sick and tired of

1491
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,760
"the meat comes first."
I'm sorry.

1492
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
# Happy birthday ##

1493
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,160
Quiet please!

1494
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,080
Shut up!
I'm on the phone.

1495
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,640
You're not
the only one in the park.

1496
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
You know, at a certain point,

1497
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,200
these kids just
wanna play soccer.

1498
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,760
They don't care
about the meat.

1499
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,560
Uh, do I have to say that?
'Cause that's gonna cause

1500
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,960
some kind of
a dramatic situation here.

1501
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
What are you saying, eh?

1502
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,360
What? Hello? Umberto?

1503
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,800
Umberto?

1504
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,920
All right, guys.

1505
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,640
We got 25 minutes
and a lot of beef to cut.

1506
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,000
Let's get to it.

1507
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,440
[saw whirring]

1508
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
(Phil)
Watch me, boys, I'm goin' in!

1509
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,160
Whoa!

1510
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,360
[horn blaring]

1511
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,560
[all yelling]

1512
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,280
[gasps]

1513
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,080
We made it.
Sorry we're late.

1514
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,800
Hey, Stew.

1515
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,160
Hey.

1516
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,800
Uh. Listen. One of-- One of my
guys didn't bring his socks.

1517
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,720
So, we forfeit.

1518
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,520
You hear that, Vultures,
we forfeit. Let's go.

1519
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,840
[whistle blowing]
Come on! Run!

1520
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,040
Hurry, run quickly!

1521
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,880
Run! Run to the car! Run!

1522
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,640
Don't look back! Run!

1523
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
We won!

1524
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,400
We won.

1525
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,600
[all cheering]

1526
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,480
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1527
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,240
Vultures. Vultures.

1528
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah!

1529
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,960
Good job, guys.

1530
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,680
Phil, it's freezing out here.

1531
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,960
It's not Phil.
It's Coach Weston.

1532
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,760
And it's not
freezing out here.

1533
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,920
Then why did you
build a fire?

1534
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,000
Because fire is
the stuff of warriors.

1535
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,120
And that's what we are,
right? Warriors?

1536
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,000
The Hopi lndians
called fire...

1537
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,840
[speaking gibberish]

1538
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,680
Coach, what are we
doing out here, anyway?

1539
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,440
We're bonding.
We're becoming a team.

1540
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,120
Surviving the elements,
here in the backyard.

1541
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,800
Coach, did you order
the pizzas yet?

1542
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,120
In due time, Connor.
In due time.

1543
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,240
However,
I want all of you to know

1544
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,480
if the pizzas don't arrive,

1545
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,320
I've already
made the decision

1546
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,960
that we will eat Byong Sun.

1547
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,280
All right.
We're not gonna eat him.

1548
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,800
But he does look delicious,
you have to admit, right,

1549
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,360
if we had to eat someone?

1550
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Dad, you're
getting a little creepy.

1551
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
I know,
let's all bay at the moon.

1552
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,800
What?

1553
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,040
You know, howl like a wolf.

1554
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,120
[howling]

1555
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,320
(woman)
Shut up out there!

1556
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,040
You shut up in there!

1557
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,480
Come on, everyone.
Bay at the moon.

1558
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,640
[howling]

1559
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,960
[all howling]

1560
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,160
[barking]

1561
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,040
[all screaming]

1562
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,960
[dogs barking]

1563
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,880
(woman)
Ooh, I don't know.

1564
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,600
The lrish Cream
sounds good, huh?

1565
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,200
What's that?

1566
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,480
Uh, it's cream
and it's, uh, it's lrish.

1567
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,920
Hurry up and order.

1568
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,440
Excuse me. Thank you.

1569
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,120
How about a smoothie?
What's in that?

1570
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,720
Smoothie's a juice drink.
We want coffee.

1571
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,760
Buddy, relax.

1572
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,800
No, you relax.

1573
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,800
I'm a regular here.
This line needs to move.

1574
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,400
I beg your pardon.

1575
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,000
Do you have scones?

1576
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,560
Tall, non fat,
double latte--

1577
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,040
Sir, you're at
the back of the line.

1578
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,080
I recognize that!

1579
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,440
Cut it out or
you're out of here.

1580
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,400
You can't
kick me out!

1581
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,400
You know,
you're--you're really
invading my ear space.

1582
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,680
I'm a frequent
coffee drinker.

1583
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,240
I'm part of the club.
I have a card.

1584
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,880
Do you have a card?
Do you have a card?

1585
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,080
No, I don't
have a card.

1586
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,240
Does anyone here
have a card?

1587
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,800
We don't have
frequent drinker cards.

1588
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,200
[screams]
That's a video club card.

1589
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,400
Zip it there,
Sporty Spice.

1590
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,440
Are we doing this?
Is this
happening now?

1591
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,560
Yeah. Wanna go?

1592
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,720
Great.
I'd love to.

1593
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,320
Let's do it. Come on.

1594
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,800
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

1595
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,480
What is wrong
with you, Derrick?

1596
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,640
I thought
we were friends!

1597
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,760
My name is Andy!

1598
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,160
Your name is Liar,
'cause you're telling lies.

1599
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,400
You know what the odds are

1600
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,960
I will never come
back here again?

1601

There's a good
chance of that!

1602

That's a chance
we'll have to take.

1603

Okay, if that's how
you want to play it.

1604

Okay.
I am disappointed!

I don't wanna see
any laziness there, okay?

00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,240
We win this,
we're in the finals.

1617
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,880
If we get a big lead,
we gotta pummel these guys.

1618
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,720
We gotta pummel them
at all costs.

1619

Dominate and hammer them.

I want you to play dirty,

if you have to,
but don't get caught.

Byong Sun, stay low, okay?

1623
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,440
That's easy for you.

1624
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,360
Just chop block them
in the back of the knee.

1625
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,560
That'll work well.

Ambrose, you're big.

1627
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,440
Don't be afraid
to throw the elbow.

1628
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,840
If you break
someone's collarbone,

1629
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,040
that's a good thing.
That's what the medic's for.

1630
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,440
Otherwise,
he's just sitting around,
all right?

You hear me?

Hey, Phil.

I--l--I don't think that's
a very good attitude.

1634
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,040
You can't talk about
hurting other players.

You don't think?

You don't-- you don't think?

1637
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,400
I don't think you
should be butting in

when I'm talking
to my team.

1639
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,480
You're my assistant, okay?

1640
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,040
You're supposed to
back me up

1641
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,840
and go get me juice boxes
when I tell you.

1642
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,240
Now go get me
a juice box.

1643
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,720
You know who
you're talking to?

1644

I'm talking to
the juice box guy.

You're crazy!

I'm not crazy.
I'm just thirsty.

go to hell?

No, you go to hell!
While you're there,

why don't you
grab me a juice box!

I'm no juice box boy,
I'll tell you that!

You're like your old man!

I would whip your butt!

1759
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,040
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

1760
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,640
What a day!

1761
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,320
Wh-What is with the coffee?

1762
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,960
Every home in Europe has
its own coffee press.

1763
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,360
In fact, every room.

1764
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,200
Okay,
you know what, Phil?

1765
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,200
You gotta stop.
You've gone overboard.

1766
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,640
What are you talking about?

1767
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,200
You called a group of
10-year-olds "losers."

1768
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,400
I did not.

1769
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,640
You screamed it
through a cone.

1770
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,680
Everyone heard you.

1771
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,760
What do you want me
to call them? Winners?

1772
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,720
'Cause that would
make me a liar, okay?

1773
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,640
And at least, give me that.
I am not a liar.

1774
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,960
You just lied, just a--
When?

1775
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,160
Just a second ago!
When?

1776
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,680
About the cone thing!

1777
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,680
Okay, you got me
on that one.

1778
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,240
That's one lie,
though.

1779
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,560
We're in the finals.

1780
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,520
Am I the only one
who cares about that?

1781
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,800
Where's Sam?

1782
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,520
Well, Sam's up in his room.

1783
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,160
Very upset. Very depressed.

1784
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,920
Depressed? We won.

1785
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,400
You didn't play him,
Phil.

1786
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,600
I warned you about,
this has become all
about you and Buck.

1787
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,760
That is patently untrue.

1788
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,160
And as far as Sam not playing
in the game, that's his fault.

1789
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,160
What?

1790
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,560
He needs to speak up, okay?
I can't worry
about every player.

1791
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,520
I can't talk to
you about this.
No, not anymore.

1792
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,960
I don't even
know who you are.

1793
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,400
You're not human,
that's for sure.

1794
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,920
You're like some
kind of animal.

1795
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,960
An animal?

1796
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,400
Yes, like a wild animal.

1797
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,480
Where are you going?

1798
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,480
I'm going.

1799
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,680
Coffee will make
you feel better.

1800
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,840
# The eye of the tiger ##

1801
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,080
(Phil)
Barbara, are you there?
Pick up. It's me.

1802
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,440
Game's about to start.

1803
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,840
Where's Sammy?
I thought you guys
were gonna meet me here.

1804
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,160
Hello? Hello?

1805
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,240
You know what,
I gotta run.

1806
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,240
What are you?
Who dresses you these days?

1807
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,160
What's this,
some kind of clown outfit?

1808
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,440
No.
It's a Tiger outfit.

1809
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,960
Good. Good.

1810
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,000
Some of the cool stuff
I can do.

1811
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,160
And you think this
suit's gonna help you?

1812
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,520
We'll see.
Might be a good luck charm.

1813
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,040
Okay, good luck, Son.
You're gonna need it.

1814
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,080
[chuckles]

1815
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,600
Bring it in. Let's go.
Huddle it up. Come on.

1816
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,000
Coach, um, where's Sam?

1817
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,360
Because I don't
see him anywhere.

1818
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,160
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it. Okay.

1819
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,080
[whispering]
Guys, listen up.

1820
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,240
Now I don't think it needs
to be said more than once

1821
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,280
how important
today's game is, huh?

1822
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,360
[whispering]
This is what we've
worked all year for.

1823
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,880
Why are you whispering?

1824
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,480
For dramatic effect!

1825
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,680
Who are those
guys over there, huh?

1826
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,760
(boys)
Tigers.

1827
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,080
They look like
pussycats to me.

1828
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,360
What do you say?
Yeah.

1829
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,360
Afraid of 'em?

1830
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,400
(boys)
No!

1831
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,360
Okay.

1832
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
You step on this field,
this is all about you.

1833
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,200
I mean, I'm not gonna be
the one staying up
late at night,

1834
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,720
you know, punching a hole
through the window

1835
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,720
or crying myself to sleep
or wetting my bed.

1836
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,840
Okay? That's not gonna be me.

1837
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,040
'Cause I'm fine.

1838
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,720
I got my vitamin store
to go back to.

1839
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,800
I'm gonna be just great.
I'm gonna be great.

1840
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,560
Let me hear you say
that we can do this.

1841
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,560
We can do this!

1842
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,760
Again.
We can do this!

1843
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,880
One more time.
We can do this!

1844
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,440
You either win

1845
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,080
and go on to greatness,
or you lose.

1846
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,920
And probably face a series of
cataclysmic events

1847
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,400
for the rest of your lives.

1848
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,760
Bring it in, guys.

1849
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,800
[whispering]
Bring it in.

1850
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,080
Tigers on three. Whisper.

1851
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,960
One, two, three.

1852
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,680
[all whispering]
Tigers.

1853
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,840
One, two, three, Gladiators!

1854
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,160
(Jim)
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

1855
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,200
and welcome to the HHSO
Championship game.

1856
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,800
I'll be giving
you a play-by-play,

1857
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,440
blow-by-blow of
what promises to be

1858
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,560
the game of the year.

1859
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,960
Look alive!

1860
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,000
Tigers versus the Gladiators.

1861
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,000
Gladiators with the ball.

1862
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,520
Immediately
stolen by Massimo!

1863
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,720
Go!

1864
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,000
Defense!
Push deeper! Deep! Deep!

1865
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,920
He kicks it high.
It's a perfect pass!

1866
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,600
Shot! Goal!

1867
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,720
Yeah!

1868
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,320
##[singing]

1869
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,280
Are you ready for this?

1870
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,800
The Gladiators with
some good ball movement.

1871
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,520
Shot! It's off the mark.

1872
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,360
Give it up, Dad!

1873
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,240
It's a long game, sonny!

1874
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,040
Hey, grab the pebble
from my hand, Grasshopper!

1875
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,480
What?

1876
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,040
Hey!
If it isn't fart-face Jones.

1877
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,200
What's up,
farty pants?

1878
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,920
Bring it on.

1879
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,840
You can have
the first punch right here.

1880
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,880
I could eat a box of cookies
for dinner if I want to.

1881
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,160
What? Can you do that? No.

1882
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,640
'Cause you're
a fart-face kid.

1883
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,560
Oh, my God!
No! Tigers! Help me!
Get him off me!

1884
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,720
[blowing whistle]

1885
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,240
Get him, Logan.
Attaboy, Logan.

1886
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,400
Ow! He's got my ear.

1887
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,320
He's got my ear!

1888
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,200
He's like a jackal from hell!

1889
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,120
(Jim)
Italians with the ball.

1890
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,560
And they pass it of
to little Byong Sun!

1891
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,320
Pass it off! Pass it!

1892
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,600
Do it! Shoot it,
Byong Sun. Shoot it!

1893
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,600
No! No, no.

1894
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,640
[grunts]

1895
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,000
(Jim)
Oh! Weak kick!

1896
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,840
Stolen away and
kicked way downfield.

1897
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,440
Gladiators moving the ball.

1898
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,160
Hunter, catch up!
Catch up.

1899
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,440
They find Bucky Weston
in the open.

1900
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,120
He shoots! Score!

1901
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,160
Yes!

1902
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,440
Gladiators tie the game.

1903
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,080
Byong Sun!

1904
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,920
What was that?

1905
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,480
I thought
I had the shot.

1906
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,520
You thought?

1907
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,120
How many times do
I have to say this?

1908
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,120
You can take as many shots
as you want during practice.

1909
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,160
But never ever
in a game.

1910
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,000
Especially not
the championship game.

1911
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,320
Okay,
you cannot talk to him--

1912
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,600
No, no, no.
Don't go there.

1913
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,400
Take a seat.
Go ahead.

1914
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,080
(Ann)
Ease up on him!

1915
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,960
You ease up on that
corduroy jacket of yours.

1916
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,400
[referee whistling]

1917
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,560
(Jim)
Gladiators moving the ball.

1918
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,720
[referee whistles]
Oh! Number 14 goes down.

1919
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,440
Come on! That?

1920
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,560
Good call, ref!

1921
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,560
That's a bad call!

1922
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,680
All right, coaches!

1923
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,760
Coaches here, now!

1924
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,920
God! That's a bad call,
you know it!

1925
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,920
Hey, hey, hey.

1926
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,960
That's a bad call!

1927
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,040
Hey! Hey,
I'm warning you.

1928
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,040
Let me ask you a question.

1929
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,080
Let me ask a question.

1930
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,880
How much you pay him
to make those calls?

1931
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,640
You are one wisecrack away

1932
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,080
from being thrown
out of this game.

1933
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,320
I don't want to
get thrown out.

1934
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
Can't a guy just be
enthusiastic about the game?

1935
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,600
You can be
enthusiastic...

1936
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,600
That's all I want to do.

1937
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,720
...at a respectable level.

1938
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,880
I just wanna have fun.

1939
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,600
Now, go to
your places!

1940
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,440
And keep your
comments to yourself.

1941
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,960
Wow! What was
that all about?

1942
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,440
Here's all I heard.

1943
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,400
The ref said....

1944
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,360
[sputtering]

1945
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,400
Then my Dad said...

1946
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,560
[sputtering]

1947
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,760
Then the ref said....

1948
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,800
[sputtering]

1949
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,280
Any more questions?

1950
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,360
Hit the road. Move it.

1951
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,800
[referee whistling]

1952
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,520
[boys cheering]

1953
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,640
(Jim)
Massimo with the ball,

1954
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,640
trying to pass it
off to his brother.

1955
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,280
Come on!

1956
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,960
But Buck Weston
has figured out
this Tiger offense.

1957
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,920
Go!

1958
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,920
[chuckles]

1959
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,080
(Phil)
Get back on defense!

1960
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,760
What did I just say?

1961
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,720
Bucky with another open shot.
Goal!

1962
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,880
Yes!

1963
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,920
Gladiators take the lead.

1964
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,040
Was anyone listening?

1965
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,600
The Italians have effectively
been shut down.

1966
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,000
Great.

1967
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,520
(Janice)
That's my boy!

1968
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,360
[whistle blowing]

1969
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,560
That's the half.

1970
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,680
Honey, wh-where have you been?

1971
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,120
I called you twice.

1972
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,640
What? Why isn't Sam
in his uniform?

1973
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,640
So, how's it going?

1974
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,680
It took me all morning
to convince him to come.

1975
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,120
And the only reason he is here
is to support his team.

1976
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,680
What, he doesn't
want to play for me?

1977
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,200
He would love to
play for you

1978
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,200
but you've turned
him into a benchwarmer.

1979
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,600
Sound familiar?

1980
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,720
Look, I just wanted

1981
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,160
to get to
the championship game, that...

1982
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,880
Well, you're here, Phil.

1983
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,240
I'm not crying.
It's frustration.

1984
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,800
Don't worry.
You'll be all right.
Gonna be all right.

1985
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,760
If you play the second half
the way you
played the first half,

1986
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm gonna trade the whole team
to the Tigers next year.

1987
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,840
Can I go in now?
I have fresh legs.

1988
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,080
(Buck)
Philly, I can't.

1989
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,640
It's the championship game,
all right?

1990
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,920
Don't bother me, okay?

1991
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,560
I didn't play
the week before, either.

1992
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,080
I promise you,
I'll play you
next season, okay?

1993
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,240
You want to be Gladiators?

1994
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,200
(boys)
Yeah!

1995
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,480
Let's say,
"We are Gladiators."

1996
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,520
(boys)
We are Gladiators!

1997
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,320
Say it again!
We are Gladiators!

1998
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,560
Okay, go out
in the second half,
I want you to stay focused.

1999
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,520
You doing okay?
I know this is tough.

2000
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,960
Hey, guys.

2001
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,680
Sam, you think
I could talk to you?

2002
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,280
I guess.

2003
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,160
Honey, do you mind?

2004
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,840
Sure.

2005
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,200
So, I just
was thinking, uh...

2006
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,400
You know,
grown-ups are always
telling kids

2007
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,160
how they mess up, right?

2008
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,200
But the truth is

2009
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,040
sometimes
grown-ups screw up

2010
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,200
but we don't have anyone to
tell us when we do it.

2011
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,520
I screwed up, Sam.

2012
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,680
You think?

2013
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,880
I just got caught up
in everything.

2014
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,040
I really lost my way,
I mean,

2015
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,640
I apologize.

2016
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,160
I just wanna ask
you if you-- if you can

2017
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,920
find it in your heart
to forgive me

2018
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,960
and you give me
a second chance,

2019
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,440
I'd like to
make it up to you.

2020
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,720
Okay.

2021
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,240
You accept
my apology then?

2022
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,600
Yeah.

2023
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,720
Thanks, buddy.

2024
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,760
All right. You're
starting the second half.

2025
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,440
(Sam)
Really?

2026
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,680
Yeah.

2027
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,840
You're not worried
about losing the game?

2028
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,680
No, I'm worried
about losing you.

2029
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,960
I brought
your uniform
just in case.

2030
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,960
So, go suit up.

2031
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,960
All right.

2032
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,520
Okay?

2033
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,800
Good job.

2034
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,840
Thanks.

2035
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,640
Now, give me
that jacket.

2036
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,280
Oh.
It's bad?

2037
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,280
Horrible.

2038
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,280
Okay.

2039
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,280
(Phil)
Hey, guys.

2040
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,320
Everyone take a seat,
if you would.

2041
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,400
I have something important
I'd like to tell you. Um...

2042
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,680
[sighs]

2043
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,120
I just want you guys to know
that I know that I blew it.

2044
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,120
I--l--l--I completely blew it.

2045
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,360
And we should've just been
having fun all along

2046
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,520
and honestly,
I don't know what happened.

2047
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,600
And I owe you,
I owe all of you an apology.

2048
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,800
I am very, very,

2049
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,320
very, very sorry.

2050
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,400
With a capital "S"
and a capital "ORRY."

2051
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,760
You know what I mean.

2052
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,920
You--You guys are great kids.
You're unique

2053
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,080
with--with--with your own
strengths and talents,

2054
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,000
and I should've
been promoting that.

2055
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,800
Instead, I wasn't,
'cause I'm a lousy coach

2056
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,280
and I didn't
teach you anything.

2057
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,560
That's not true,
Dad.

2058
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,240
(all)
What?
What are you talking about?

2059
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,400
He's a lousy coach.

2060
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,560
He didn't teach me anything.

2061
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,880
(Byong Sun)
He tried to kill me.

2062
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,440
He taught us exactly how
not to play soccer.

2063
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,560
Actually, Sam's right.

2064
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,280
That's exactly what I did.

2065
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,120
We just need to
take the field

2066
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,720
and you guys
just do e-e-exactly

2067
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,960
the opposite of
everything I've taught you.

2068
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,120
Does that make sense?

2069
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,920
What have l-- What have l
told you to do?

2070
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,560
Always play the ltalians.

2071
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,280
Okay. There you go.

2072
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,480
Gian Piero, Massimo,

2073
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,960
we'll get some
fresh legs in there.

2074
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,080
Give you guys a rest?

2075
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,280
Rest?
Yeah.

2076
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,760
Okay. Grazie.

2077
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,800
Thanks.

2078
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,040
Wh-What else
have I taught you?

2079
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,800
Break people's clavicles.

2080
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,880
Chop block.

2081
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,520
Tattoos are cool!

2082
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,080
Don't remember that one.

2083
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,360
Coffee is the lifeblood

2084
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,160
that fuels
the dreams of champions.

2085
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,000
Right. Hold on.

2086
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,280
[all cheering]

2087
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,080
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

2088
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,000
(Mark)
Way to go, Byong Sun!

2089
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,800
[all cheering]

2090
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,440
All right. What else?

2091
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,920
The most important
thing is winning.

2092
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,520
No. No, no, no, no.
The most important thing

2093
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,640
is--is having fun and
trying your best, all right?

2094
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,280
So, let's get out there
and do everything

2095
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,320
the opposite of
what I've taught you.

2096
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,800
Sound like a plan?

2097
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,960
Bring it in. Here we go.

2098
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,120
Yes.

2099
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,600
(Phil)
What are we gonna do?

2100
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,120
(boys)
Don't listen to Phil!

2101
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,640
Take the field.
Here we go, guys. Have fun!

2102
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,480
(Jim)
Down by one,
the Tigers have both Italians

2103
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,880
sitting on the bench?

2104
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,800
Odd move by
Coach Phil Weston.

2105
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,120
Stop them, guys!

2106
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,080
Goal, and the Tiger
goalie goes down hard!

2107
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,160
Oh, my--

2108
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,160
(Buck)
That's it.

2109
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,520
That's the intensity
I've been looking for.
That's it.

2110
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,240
The Tiger goalie looks okay.

2111
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,800
Hey, ref? Injury?
Time out?

2112
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,280
Coach Weston is
taking no chances.

2113
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,600
Time out.
Everyone with glasses.

2114
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,040
Can I borrow your glasses?

2115
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,440
Would you mind?
Thank you.

2116
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,800
I appreciate that.

2117
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,320
You look like
you need those.

2118
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,200
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

2119
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,440
(Phil)
You all right?

2120
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,480
Yeah, I'm all right.

2121
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,680
Just want to do a
little vision test here.
All right?

2122
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,680
Is that better
or worse?

2123
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,680
Worse.

2124
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,560
Better or worse?

2125
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,560
Worse.

2126
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,880
Better or worse?

2127
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,120
Better!

2128
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,560
Okay. Put those on.
Let's go, guys.

2129
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,920
Okay. All right.
Come on.

2130
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,920
Thanks.

2131
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,280
He's okay.

2132
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,640
(Jim)
Play resumes.

2133
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,920
The Gladiators still
dominating the field.

2134
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,280
Wow. An amazing save
by the Tiger goalie!

2135
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,360
Yes!
That's my baby!

2136
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,680
He stopped that goal.

2137
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,960
Tigers with the ball.

2138
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,680
Mark! Mark!

2139
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,720
On the neck!

2140
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,680
Yes!

2141
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,160
Mark Avery kicks the ball up,

2142
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,760
catches it on
the back of his neck.

2143
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,880
Yes.

2144
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,520
The rest of the Tigers are
forming some kind of wedge.

2145
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,040
Break through.
Win the ball back!

2146
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,600
Knock those clowns down.

2147
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,400
Mark Avery leads the league

2148
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,320
in the least amount of
time played.

2149
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,600
Hey, keeper.

2150
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,120
Ew!

2151
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,360
Mmm.

2152
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,360
[gags]

2153
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,520
Ambrose with
a powerhouse kick!

2154
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,880
[referee whistling]

2155
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,640
Yeah!

2156
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,840
[boys cheering]

2157
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,560
Yes!

2158
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,440
Hunter, I'd give you a kiss
but you just ate a worm.

2159
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,640
Yeah! Can you smell it?

2160
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,640
Yeah! All right, Mark!

2161
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,200
It's the smell
of victory, baby!

2162
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,720
I love you, Dad!

2163
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,760
See if you love me
at the end of the game.

2164
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,440
Let's go, guys. Stay focused.

2165
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,680
Every time you say
something back to me,

2166
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,280
it makes me love you more!

2167
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,360
I can't-- I can't
believe this.

2168
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,400
(Jim)
Hunter is tearing down
the field!

2169
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,360
And he kicks
the ball to Jack.

2170
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,920
Get over there!
Go, Hunter!

2171
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,560
Jack takes
the ball into the corner.

2172
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,600
Whoa! It's a little bit high.

2173
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,920
Wait a second,
what's going on?

2174
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,560
It's like they're forming
some sort of mega person.

2175
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,200
Did everyone see that?

2176
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,680
[whooping]

2177
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,800
A header by Byong Sun from
Ambrose's shoulder for a goal.

2178
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,520
Way to go, Bing Bong!

2179
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,560
That's not legal.
Is that legal, ref?

2180
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,160
Great hustle.
Gian Piero and Massimo.

2181
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,560
You're back in.
Okay.

2182
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,080
But remember,
share the ball.

2183
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,200
Okay.
Team.

2184
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,880
Right? Team.
Yeah. Good. Good, good.

2185
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,440
Okay, guys.

2186
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,400
(Jim)
The Italians are back in.

2187
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,040
And Massimo steals the ball.

2188
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,120
Less than
a minute left to play.

2189
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,760
The Gladiators are
completely out of sync here.

2190
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,840
And the ball goes
to Ambrose who fakes.

2191
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,760
Watch it! It's a trap!
Stay with the ltalians!

2192
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,480
(Barbara)
Come on, Sam!

2193
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,840
You're gonna have to
get past old,
uncle Bucky for this one.

2194
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,120
Here's something
your dad never taught you.

2195
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,760
[all cheering]

2196
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,560
Goal!

2197
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,280
[referee whistling]

2198
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,960
And you can
put it on the board.

2199
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,800
[blowing whistle]

2200
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,360
That's the game!

2201
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,240
Tigers win! Tigers win!

2202
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,760
(Phil)
Way to go, guys!

2203
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,040
(Tom)
Nice job, everyone!

2204
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,240

2205
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,800

Come on, honey!

2206
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,560
(Phil)
Sammy!

2207
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,240
Where did you learn
to move like that, Sam?

2208
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,280
I practiced every time
you benched me.

2209
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,160
(boys)
Tigers! Tigers!

2210
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,160
[boys chanting]

2211
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,080
Great game, Bucky.

2212
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,440
A hell of a game, bro.

2213
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,840
I guess we really
got out-coached.

2214
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,000
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

2215
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,000
And I'm serious.

2216
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,320
I don't give
compliments lightly.

2217
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,520
This is from the heart.

2218
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,000
I'm not blowing
smoke up my butt.

2219
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,440
I think you mean
smoke up my butt.

2220
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,880
No. Dude,
just take the compliment.

2221
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,280
You got it.

2222
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,080
I'll see you later.

2223
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,240
See you at the barbecue.

Good job.

Sorry, Grandpa.

What, are you kiddin' me?

2228

If anyone's gonna beat me,
I'm glad it was you.

2229
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,280
Great goal, Samson.

2230
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,680
So, you're not mad?

2231
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,520
The only thing
that makes me mad

2232
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,360
is that I let you get away
from the Gladiators, okay?

2233
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,360
[chuckles]

I'll never be mad at you.

(Phil)
Burgers look good, right?

2236
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,360
That one's dead.

2237
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,240
This one needs
to be turned. Okay?

2238
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,240
Looks good to me.

2239
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,240
You'll learn.

2240
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,320
[machine humming]

2241
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,200
Hey, Ditka!
Knock it off, would you?

2242
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,480
Would you knock it off?

2243
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,800
Dad, relax.
Here, I'll handle it.

2244
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,840
Yeah.

2245
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,840
I'll talk to him.

2246
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,360
Hey, Buck.
Yeah?

2247
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,360
Remember when we beat you
in the championship?

2248
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,400
Yeah.

2249
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,360
Remember when, uh, when
I shoved that kid in the pool?

2250
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,400
Whoa!

2251
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,920
[gasping]

2252
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,400
Okay, Buck.
You got me good, buddy.

2253
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,400
Yeah.

2254
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,640
How do you want
your hamburger?

2255
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,800
Well done. Thanks, Buck.

2256
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,440
Okay. You got it.

2257
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,520
Hey, coach!

2258
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,800
Yeah?

2259
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,640
Hey.

2260
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,320
Hey.

2261
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Um, I don't know if you heard,
we won the championship.

2262
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,680
Yeah, I heard.

2263
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,760
Yeah.

2264
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,440
Look, I just wanna say
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

2265
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,720
Hey, let me
tell you something.

2266
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,040
You were
a ravin' maniac.

2267
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,040
Yes, I was.
I was a maniac.

2268
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,120
Yeah, but I see you
changed your ways.

2269
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,560
And man,
down the stretch,

2270
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,480
you did one great job
of coaching those kids.

2271
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,280
Thank you. It means a lot.

2272
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,240
So, can I count on
you for next year?

2273
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,520
No.

2274
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,120
Okay. But you and l,
we're good?

2275
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,400
We're good.

2276
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,600
Good.

2277
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,960
How about you
and your old man?

2278
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,320
Better. Yeah.

2279
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,760
Listen. I mean no disrespect
to you and your family.

2280
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,800
But my job in life is

2281
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,000
to make your dad's life
a living hell.

2282
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,840
Hey, do what you gotta do.

2283
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,880
I gotta do it.

2284
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,920
I'm about to make
good on that Pele bet.

2285
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,200
You wanna come
over and watch?

2286
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,560
Yeah, I'd love to
but I gotta get

2287
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,920
all these leaves over in
that yard before nightfall.

2288
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,000
Right.

2289
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,240
We had a bet.
You won fair and square.

2290
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,680
Good job.

2291
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,240
Yes.
Thank you.

2292
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,320
I don't say this enough

2293
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,760
but you really stepped up.

2294
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,920
I'm proud of you, Son.

2295
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,560
I appreciate that.

2296
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,920
The real Pele ball.

2297
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,920
Yep.

2298
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,040
I'm actually
touching it.

2299
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,040
Take good care of it.

2300
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,400
That means an awful
lot to me, that ball.

2301
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,960
It does,
doesn't it?

2302
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,120
Yeah.

2303
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,400
Here.

2304
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,360
What?

2305
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,520
You keep it.

2306
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,880
No. You won fair and square.
It's yours now.

2307
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:07,880
No.

2308
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,000
You beat me, Philly.

2309
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,760
Well, the Tigers
beat you.

2310
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,920
I mean I had a good time
kicking your butt,

2311
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,760
I'm not gonna lie,

2312
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,040
but i-i-it's not
about winning.

2313
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,600
I thought it was.
It's not.

2314
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,360
About--About
you and me,

2315
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,600
you know, the--the ball
is just a metaphor

2316
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,960
about the distance
between us.

2317
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,080
It's a soccer ball.

2318
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,400
No, no, no, Dad.

2319
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,760
I-l-It's not
about the ball.

2320
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,560
It was never
about the ball.

2321
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,480
I don't want the ball.

2322
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,840
Then what do you want?

2323
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,760
(announcer)
And now an important message
from the King.

2324
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,560
Hi, I'm Buck Weston.

2325
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,080
King of sporting goods.

2326
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,200
And to make my stores
the best they can be,

2327
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,520
I've teamed up with my son.

2328
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,400
Hello,
I'm Phil Weston.

2329
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,680
And I'm
the Prince of Vitamins.

2330
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,160
(Buck)
Now, you can get all your
health supplement needs

2331
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,680
at Buck and
Phil's Sports Kingdom.

2332
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,480
At prices so low,
it'll blow your top.

2333
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,440
Don't worry,
kind sir.

2334
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,000
We've got
something for that, too.

2335
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,280
See?

2336
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,480
I do see,
Prince Phil.

2337
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,560
Now in five
convenient locations.

2338
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,080
I'm Buck Weston.

2339
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,560
And I'm
Phil Weston.

2340
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,120
(both)
And we've got balls.

2341
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,520
And vitamins.

2342
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,080
But mainly, balls.

2343
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,800
(all)
And vitamins!

2344
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,120
These guys
couldn't win a salad bowl,

2345
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,720
Iet alone a Super Bowl.

2346
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,080
(Diana)
Mike, I smell smoke.

2347
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,240
Nobody's smokin'.

2348
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,880
Besides,
I'm the king in this house

2349
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,600
and I can do what I want.

2350
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,920
Got you!

2351
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,960
Okay, honey.

2352
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,400
