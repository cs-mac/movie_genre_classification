1
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,800
So they wanna get a sound level
Could you say something?

2
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Translate, boy.
What did she say?

3
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,560
Sorry?
I wanna get a sound level

4
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,001
Could you say something
into the microphone?

5
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:48,371
One, two, three...

6
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,212
Is that where you're gonna sit?

7
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,077
Unless you'd like me to move

8
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,776
That's a good place
As long as that's it, that's fine.

9
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,149
Okay, we're set

10
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:05,718
What if recent United States efforts

11
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:09,093
To help the Latin American
people are successful?

12
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:13,362
If the ruling classes agreed
to land reforms and tax reforms

13
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,505
if the standard of living
could be raised

14
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,769
wouldn't the message of the
Cuban revolution lose its power?

15
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,142
Do what you want,
but don't mess with the Americans

16
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:35,351
It's pretty simple.
All we have to do

17
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,817
Is organize a coup.

18
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:42,789
What did Batista do?
He led a coup and took power in one day.

19
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,258
The main issue is to control power.
The rest is nonsense.

20
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,661
It's not about taking power,
but knowing what to do with it.

21
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,735
- That's right.
- That coup must be based on principles.

22
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,699
Let's eat. Fidel is late.

23
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,708
Argentine!
Could you give me a hand?

24
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,912
It's not about making concessions
but establishing conditions.

25
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,131
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's about time!

26
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,563
Good evening. Sorry I'm late.

27
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,802
This is Ernesto.

28
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,844
- The Argentine doctor.
- Pleased to meet you.

29
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,574
- My pleasure.
- Let's eat!

30
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,877
Twenty percent of all Cubans
are permanently unemployed.

31
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:52,758
One-point-five percent of the landowners
control 46 percent of the land.

32
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:59,060
Half the population has no electricity.
Over half live in bohios

33
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,495
Sorry, what's a bohio?

34
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,904
What's a bohio in Argentina?

35
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,044
A shack.

36
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,271
Thirty-seven percent can't read or write.

37
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:15,116
Infant mortality is through the roof.

38
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,912
What's more,

39
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,881
while the thugs of the dictatorship

40
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,787
gun down anyone who speaks out,

41
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,793
most corrupt officials

42
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:30,126
steal hundreds of millions of dollars
from the public treasury

43
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,565
and deposit it into
U.S. and European banks.

44
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:36,399
It's the same
in all Latin American countries.

45
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,631
In the last few years,

46
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,869
the balance of payments
between the U.S. and Cuba

47
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:47,381
has been favorable to the U.S.
by 1 billion dollars.

48
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,212
What does this mean?

49
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,946
That this poor Caribbean island

50
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:56,081
is helping to support the economy of
the most developed country in the world.

51
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,129
As Marti used to say,
if the U.S. takes Spain out of Cuba,

52
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,766
then we would have to take out the U.S.

53
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,834
Do you have a boat?

54
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,672
Money?

55
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,305
Not yet.

56
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,177
Fighters?

57
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,940
We've smuggled 30 into Mexico.
We'll get some more.

58
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,921
Do you think I'm crazy?

59
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,326
A little

60
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,988
Well

61
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,291
some craziness is good.

62
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,310
Fidel had extraordinary faith

63
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,977
<i>that once we left for Cuba,</i>

64
00:08:58,322 --> 00:08:59,914
<i>we would make it there,</i>

65
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,850
<i>and that once we made it to Cuba,
we would fight.</i>

66
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,259
<i>And that in fighting, we would win.</i>

67
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,425
<i>And so it was
that in November of '56,</i>

68
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,928
we left Mexico in a leaky boat,
with 82 men onboard

69
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:18,600
And of those 82

70
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,000
Only 12 would survive
to witness our victory

71
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,748
Murderer!
Assassin!

72
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:08,849
Get out of Cuba
Che! Murderer!

73
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,685
Among Fidel Castro's top lieutenants

74
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:17,231
One of the most powerful
is Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara

75
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,858
<i>the Argentine revolutionary
who became a Cuban citizen</i>

76
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,133
<i>and, as Minister of Industries,
now presides over the Cuban economy.</i>

77
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:29,472
<i>Major Guevara is a Marxist,
a soldier, a physician,</i>

78
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:33,013
And the author of the classic
handbook on guerilla warfare

79
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:35,174
He is 36 years old

80
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,616
He has been called the brains
of the revolution

81
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:42,247
And the power behind Fidel Castro,
though he denies both assertions

82
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:28,850
From this point forward,
we experienced 10 bitter days

83
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:33,641
The only way I could walk
was to hold myself up with the trees

84
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,350
Or by leaning on the butt of my rifle

85
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,844
As if that were not enough,
I was traveling with a soldier

86
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,979
who panicked every time
my asthma made me cough

87
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,326
Soldiers! Soldiers
are coming! There's a lot of them!

88
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,265
They're going to kill us!
We have to hide!

89
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,523
That's Epifanio's house!

90
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,719
Close the door.

91
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,717
Where's Fidel?

92
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,790
My name is Ernesto Guevara.
What's yours?

93
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,427
Jorge Sotús, why?

94
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,291
I have orders from Fidel
to command you and your men,

95
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,629
and lead you to where he is.

96
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:41,300
Where are you from?

97
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,936
Argentina.

98
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,972
I don't trust anyone.
I'm the only one leading these troops.

99
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:55,375
Frank Pais said to deliver these men
to Fidel, personally.

100
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:59,446
Listen! We'll stop for five minutes.

101
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,815
Sit down, everyone.

102
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,990
Hey, what's going on?

103
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,988
- Fidel is coming!
- Go and tell the doctor.

104
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,430
- Stand up, come on!
- Fidel is coming.

105
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,276
Stand up.

106
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,975
Come on, up! Grab your rifle.

107
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,494
Finally!

108
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:44,121
Good to see you. Are you all right?

109
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,790
This is Epifanio.

110
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,998
- Raúl.
- How are you?

111
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,132
Very good.

112
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,173
Camilo.

113
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,539
- How was your vacation?
- Vacation? What vacation?

114
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,249
Almeida

115
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,221
Hello, Ramiro.

116
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,454
- Hi, Vilma.
- Good to see you.

117
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,952
Vilo.

118
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,289
Hello, Celia.

119
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,281
Thanks.

120
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,487
Listen.

121
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:43,988
Fidel wants to talk to you
about what happened with Sotús

122
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:48,492
Let him speak

123
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,634
If you say something,
it could sound defensive

124
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:53,598
and he's not going to like that

125
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,134
I left you in charge
of the reinforcements

126
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:04,246
I don't have anything
against Jorge Sotús

127
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:08,441
but how can you let someone with no
experience take charge of the troops?

128
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,880
You still have this complex about
being foreign, and it's pointless.

129
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,957
You trained with us,

130
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,424
you came in the boat with us,
you were wounded fighting with us.

131
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,061
You are as Cuban and revolutionary
as everyone here.

132
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,640
We are forming three columns

133
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,569
Raúl will lead the first one

134
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,408
Almeida will be in charge
of the second one

135
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,116
And Jorge Sotús
will command the third one

136
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,909
I did all my studies
finished high school

137
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,612
then I worked as a mechanic
for two or three years.

138
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,726
I then delivered milk around the area.
Also worked as a boxer.

139
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:29,729
And in a circus, working as a magician
among other things.

140
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,367
In a circus?
How old are you?

141
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,025
Twenty

142
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:38,364
Who gave them to you?
The one and only Celia Sánchez!

143
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,402
He looks like John Wayne.

144
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,213
- A cowboy from the Wild West.
- The Little Cowboy.

145
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,148
That's it: "The Little Cowboy"!

146
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,050
Little Cowboy! Little Cowboy!

147
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,735
The army keeps moving up
and down the road, Fidel.

148
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,274
It would be pretty easy
to hunt a couple of patrols.

149
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,442
- We must be patient.
- I agree, it would be easy to do.

150
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:26,144
- We could do it fast and safely.
- No, listen a second.

151
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:29,088
If we attack one of the trucks,

152
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:33,020
then the army would say
it was a crash on the road.

153
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,962
But if we launch a full attack
on the Uvero barracks,

154
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,627
it will be impossible
for them to deny our victory.

155
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:47,308
It will have a huge psychological impact.
Do you understand?

156
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,649
Sotús isn't in position,

157
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,090
but he can't move
because it's getting light out.

158
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,028
I don't know about the others.
It's hard to see because...

159
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,303
Fuck, I missed!

160
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,254
Get down!

161
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,594
I have a saint watching over me!
He protects me from everything!

162
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,184
Are you okay?

163
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,583
- It's my arm and leg.
- Stay calm.

164
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,504
Don't fall asleep.

165
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>In War and Peace,</i>

166
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,000
<i>Tolstoy remarks that military science
assumes that the bigger the army,</i>

167
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,850
<i>the stronger it is.</i>

168
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,250
<i>On the other hand,
only vaguely do they recognize</i>

169
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,900
<i>that during military combat,
the final strength of an army</i>

170
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,200
<i>is also its true physical capacity,
multiplied by one unknown "x."</i>

171
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,000
<i>This "x" is none other
than the spirit of the troops,</i>

172
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,600
<i>measured as the greater or lesser desire
to fight and confront danger.</i>

173
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:12,714
<i>Men with the desire to fight,</i>

174
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:15,689
<i>who also understand
why they are fighting,</i>

175
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,886
<i>regardless of who they are fighting,</i>

176
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:22,300
<i>whether under the command
of military geniuses</i>

177
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,197
<i>or those of normal intelligence,</i>

178
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,198
<i>fighting with clubs</i>

179
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,169
<i>or with machine guns
that fire 30 rounds a minute,</i>

180
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,671
<i>these men will put themselves</i>

181
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:34,606
<i>in the most advantageous conditions
for fighting,</i>

182
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:36,830
<i>and they will triumph.</i>

183
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,351
Light this up! Come on!

184
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,230
What are we going to do now?

185
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,626
Take the barracks.

186
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,694
Come on!

187
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,368
Take this, motherfuckers!

188
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,300
<i>From then on, Batista began to
close his Sierra Maestra barracks,</i>

189
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,000
<i>and Fidel was right.</i>

190
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,700
<i>It was exactly as José Marti said:</i>

191
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,150
<i>"Whoever takes the Sierra Maestra
takes Cuba."</i>

192
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,993
On our side, six
comrades are dead and 17 are wounded.

193
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,192
Of the 17, six can't walk.

194
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,029
How is Almeida?

195
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,401
He's fine. He's being treated.

196
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,203
Get the prisoners.
They're coming with us.

197
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,847
excuse me, doctor.

198
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,314
I have no experience
in this kind of situation.

199
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:52,977
There's a man over there
who is choking.

200
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,023
Okay, guys, we gotta
get out of here. Come on, they're coming.

201
00:22:58,194 --> 00:22:59,491
Let's go, guys.

202
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,129
Leave that.

203
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,793
You're okay. Help him.

204
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:10,471
Che, we have to leave right now.

205
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,504
Hey, shithead. Leave that.

206
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:16,270
We have to go! Come on!

207
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:22,083
Israel Pardo's farm is not far.

208
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,687
- Ernesto can take the wounded there.
- No.

209
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,381
When they recover,

210
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,991
we can meet up with you later.

211
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,287
That could be very dangerous.

212
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,022
They're going to flood
this area with troops now.

213
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:38,962
Fidel. We don't have a choice.

214
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:43,667
Let's think about it.

215
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,771
Anyway, give him the best weapons.

216
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:57,516
<i>So Fidel is off
attacking towns to the west.</i>

217
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,780
<i>Was it frustrating to you
as a revolutionary,</i>

218
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,447
<i>nursing 20 wounded men,
trying to get them inland?</i>

219
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,000
<i>A real revolutionary goes
where he is needed.</i>

220
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,228
<i>It may not be direct combat.</i>

221
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,300
<i>Sometimes it's about
doing other tasks:</i>

222
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,901
<i>finding food, dressing wounds,
carrying comrades for miles</i>

223
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,339
<i>and then taking care of them
until they can take care of themselves.</i>

224
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,200
<i>This is what it means.</i>

225
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,947
<i>Was it during this period</i>

226
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:28,879
<i>that you discovered
what you were fighting for?</i>

227
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,100
<i>I always knew why I was fighting,</i>

228
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>but I can tell you that it was
during the March of the Wounded</i>

229
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,960
<i>in June of 1957
that I became the fighter I am today.</i>

230
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:45,328
<i>And once that happens,
it leaves you only one path.</i>

231
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:48,698
<i>Then it seems you can never stop
being a revolutionary.</i>

232
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,905
<i>I do not have any plans to retire.</i>

233
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,041
It's infected.

234
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,475
We'll have to leave it uncovered.

235
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:05,083
I have to walk with my ass naked?

236
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,744
Fuck!

237
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,555
Vilo smells something.

238
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,994
Let's pick some guavas
before going back.

239
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,230
Stop there, buddy.

240
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,142
What are you two doing here?

241
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,143
We're from here.
What's your name?

242
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,305
Israel.
Israel what?

243
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,677
Israel Pardo.

244
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:13,654
- What's his name?
- He's my brother, Guile.

245
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:18,986
- Ernesto Guevara.
- Did we scare you?

246
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,287
Guile.

247
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:32,764
Good, man, good.

248
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,808
We have to take him to a hospital.

249
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,011
Give me a swig.

250
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,260
Can we trust anyone
to take him out of here?

251
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,032
Difficult.

252
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,038
Soldiers tell people that the rebels
kill them and steal their food.

253
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,701
<i>My mother is from here</i>

254
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,073
<i>and my father came from Haiti.</i>

255
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,545
<i>When he met my mother,</i>

256
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:18,676
<i>we moved to a farm that belonged
to Juanito Echevarria.</i>

257
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:22,483
He gave us a piece
of land to grow coffee.

258
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:26,150
But we had to clear it
and plant the seeds.

259
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:32,130
And we had to give him
a third of our crop.

260
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:37,704
And one day Juanito
decided to kick us out.

261
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,238
When my father knew he had to leave,

262
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,541
he stood in front
of Juanito Echevarria and said,

263
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,907
"I'll leave if you want,
but you have to pay.

264
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:55,284
You have to pay me
for the four years that I worked here."

265
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,590
Do you know what Juanito Echevarría
paid us for four years of work?

266
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,461
One hundred pesos.

267
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:06,829
My old man got 100 pesos
for four years.

268
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:17,640
Be careful.

269
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,482
Okay.

270
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,250
This is the bullet
I removed from your body.

271
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,782
You're a champ.

272
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,483
- I'm going to get better now.
- Yes.

273
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,539
Let's go.
Keep them back, back.

274
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,903
Keep them back.

275
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:51,342
They have missiles aimed
at the United States.

276
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,353
Good morning. Would
the commander like some makeup?

277
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,151
- No.
- No, thank you.

278
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,455
You sure? All right.

279
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,294
Maybe a little powder.

280
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,106
Excuse me? Excuse me.

281
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:22,141
- Maybe a little powder?
- All right.

282
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:26,975
Two hundred million
Latin Americans that die of hunger.

283
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:33,053
All these people
contribute to the economic greatness

284
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:35,156
of the United States.

285
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,821
Revolutions are not exportable.

286
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:44,622
<i>Revolutions are created</i>

287
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,529
<i>by the oppressive conditions</i>

288
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,829
<i>that are imposed by
the Latin American governments</i>

289
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,733
<i>against its people.</i>

290
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:52,997
Cut.

291
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,943
Well done. Good job.

292
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,046
Listen, I'd like to ask you
a few more questions off the record.

293
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,738
- Should we do that?
- Yeah.

294
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:05,410
If I don't work, I don't eat.
And you are on welfare.

295
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,083
Go back to work in Cuba.

296
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,622
The people of the Third World

297
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,784
must be able to fight
for their own freedom,

298
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,589
even if this means defying
the wishes of the Soviet bloc?

299
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,340
Cuba doesn't align herself with blocs,

300
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:30,773
she aligns herself with justice.

301
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:33,278
The United States wants us
to pay a very high price

302
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:36,440
for the not-so-peaceful coexistence
that we live in today.

303
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,789
And we're willing to pay the price

304
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,020
that takes us to the frontiers of dignity,

305
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,391
not beyond.

306
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:55,732
What's the point of the U.N.
if our fate is determined by the OAS,

307
00:30:56,672 --> 00:31:02,406
an organization that expelled us
and to which we no longer have ties?

308
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,705
excuse me, Comandante.

309
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:08,281
Will you need me tonight?

310
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:17,023
Little boy, no one is so necessary
or indispensable in this life.

311
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,690
Don't go thinking
that you are indispensable.

312
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,696
Go, do what you need to do.

313
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,643
I am going to give you
a little checkup...

314
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,875
...beginning with your ears.
Is that okay?

315
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,954
Ah...

316
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,694
Too much work and not enough to eat.

317
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:01,002
Maria, try to eat meat
whenever you can.

318
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,236
- All right?
- Thanks, doctor.

319
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,340
- Let's go, Laura.
- Goodbye.

320
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,308
Mommy, that guy's a liar.
He says the same thing to everyone.

321
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,572
- Where does it hurt?
- Nothing really hurts.

322
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:19,710
I just came to see you because
I've never seen a doctor before.

323
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:25,059
Well, you've seen one now.
I'm here for you.

324
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:31,126
excuse me.

325
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,433
Can I have your canteen,
so I can fill it?

326
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:37,369
Thank you, Guile.

327
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,941
Listen, doctor.

328
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:45,443
I want to go with you all.

329
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,483
First you have to learn
to read and write, man.

330
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,346
I can learn.

331
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,353
Very good, Guile.

332
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:56,889
But I still can't take you
because I don't have a gun to give you.

333
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,959
But I don't care, I want to help.

334
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,187
We need your help here.

335
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,425
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

336
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:09,162
- Where do you come from?
- From Bayamo.

337
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,837
All of you?

338
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,003
If you are armed, you can stay.

339
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,702
If you're not,
you have to leave right now.

340
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:20,547
Esteban, come here.

341
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,317
Man, didn't I tell you to only
bring men with weapons?

342
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,560
If we're attacked, how the hell
are they going to defend themselves?

343
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,663
Have you been drinking?

344
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,293
No.

345
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,065
Where did you get that from?

346
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:51,441
I found it.

347
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,315
Hey.

348
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,854
Listen, what's your name?

349
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,394
Cuervo.

350
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:11,930
Cuervo?

351
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,068
How old are you?

352
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,438
Twenty.

353
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:22,076
They gave you a tremendous shotgun.

354
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,038
They must like you.

355
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:30,207
If they liked me
they'd let me keep my rifle

356
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:32,478
and not this stupid shotgun.

357
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,986
They would have made me
leader of a column,

358
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:39,093
and we would be fighting by now
instead of crossing these mountains.

359
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,213
With your permission, doctor.

360
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,054
We were standing guard last night
but our relief never came.

361
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:17,631
- We stayed until 6 in the morning.
- We never found out where they were.

362
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:22,133
We try to follow the rules,
but it's not easy.

363
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,368
Hey, Joel!

364
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,610
Didn't you organize
the watch last night?

365
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,244
Yes, sir. Why?

366
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:37,715
Omar and Carlos were on watch
for four hours and relief never showed.

367
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,615
Those guys are stupid shitheads.

368
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:43,224
No, you're the only shithead here.

369
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,086
Me? Why?

370
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,254
Ernesto, they should've found out
where their relief was sleeping.

371
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:54,562
- That's not my fault.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

372
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,937
That was your responsibility.

373
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:05,011
You organized the watch!
You had to guarantee the shift relief!

374
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,380
- Fuck!
- Yes, sir.

375
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,849
Tonight you'll stand watch
for four hours.

376
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,220
Stay focused!

377
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,530
It's ready, Che.

378
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:36,074
Esteban left to meet Cuervo
at the sentry post.

379
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:39,878
- When did he leave?
- Half an hour ago.

380
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,979
Those bastards are gone!

381
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,090
Bandera, come here.

382
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:53,250
Esteban and Cuervo took off.
We have to find both of them.

383
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,301
We're from Fidel's group.

384
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,107
We're looking for food and money.

385
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,115
You can put the money in this bag.

386
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:24,355
The Comandante here
wants to talk to your daughter.

387
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,805
We searched all over,

388
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,383
but nothing.

389
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,916
All right.

390
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:07,636
<i>Well, it is impossible
to defeat imperialism</i>

391
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:11,800
<i>without identifying its head:
the United States of America.</i>

392
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,600
<i>In a capitalist system,
most people live in an invisible cage.</i>

393
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,690
<i>For example, there you accept
the myth of the self-made man,</i>

394
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,500
<i>but don't understand that
the opportunities of most people</i>

395
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,500
<i>are determined by forces
they do not even see.</i>

396
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:19,170
This is ugly.

397
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:25,570
I want the vanguard a hundred meters
ahead of us at all times.

398
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,582
We should bury them.

399
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:38,852
Because yours is the kingdom,
the power and glory forever and ever.

400
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,524
Amen.

401
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:43,955
Che.

402
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:47,829
Locals say there's a terrible battle
in the Estrada Palma military base.

403
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:52,336
They say Raúl is wounded,
and that the army is coming toward us.

404
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:56,373
Forget about it. We're surrounded.

405
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,913
The only way out of here

406
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,072
is to cut through el Turquino.

407
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,186
I'm ready to take the mountain.

408
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:13,517
- Good to see you again.
- Very, very eager to meet you.

409
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,356
I want you to talk to Chris.

410
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,398
He's this guy who's writing
this fabulous book.

411
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,501
Are you hungry?
Would you like...?

412
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,465
Yes, come on,
let's get something.

413
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,631
I'll bring them back. Come on.

414
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:31,745
Major Guevara, I'd like to introduce you
to Senator Eugene McCarthy.

415
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,417
A pleasure. Pleasure, major.

416
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:39,951
He would like to thank you

417
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,525
for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

418
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:50,731
There was no better way

419
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,937
to give the people solidarity
with its revolution

420
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,607
like a U.S.- backed invasion.

421
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:04,210
Some of our problems
we owe to the United States.

422
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:07,575
Others are our own fault.

423
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:11,310
Comandante, has the U.S. embargo
against Cuba

424
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:13,113
succeeded in isolating it

425
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:15,017
from the rest of Latin America?

426
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,920
If Cuba is ever to be completely free,

427
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:24,155
it has to be important not only
for sugar, for its sugar.

428
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:27,699
Sir, would the Comandante object
to giving me his autograph?

429
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,700
Good night.

430
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,714
That was a good party.

431
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,416
Vilo.

432
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:36,632
- He says he wants to talk to you.
- I'm sorry.

433
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:42,436
The problem is that one of your men
who says he is Lalo Sardiñas

434
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,340
is down there with a group of rebels,

435
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,745
and if a patrol arrives

436
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:53,115
they're going to burn my shack
and kill my family.

437
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:57,355
And that can't happen! No way!

438
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,887
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Ernesto Guevara.

439
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:06,830
- What's your name?
- Emilio Cabrera.

440
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,563
Emilio, don't worry.
No one is going to touch anything.

441
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:19,108
Vilo, tell people to get ready,
they're about to meet Fidel Castro.

442
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,347
No, now listen to me.

443
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,047
Raúl wasn't really wounded.
We were the ones surrounding the army.

444
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:30,986
And those bastards escaped.

445
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,353
Boy!

446
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,987
Come on, motherfucker.
Give me a hug.

447
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,358
How are you?

448
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,393
Here.

449
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:46,262
- Where did you get those peasants?
- Those are my troops, man.

450
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:48,534
They're working out all right.

451
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,338
I don't speak out loud
because they'll get big heads.

452
00:43:54,482 --> 00:43:56,109
We've missed you.

453
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:03,620
Some coffee?

454
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:09,229
Hey, Joel.

455
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,127
Fidel asked me
why I hadn't made you lieutenant.

456
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,460
I told him because you didn't know
how to read or write.

457
00:44:17,772 --> 00:44:21,264
Well, I want to learn.

458
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:25,139
But I need someone to teach me.

459
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:28,248
Then get a pencil
and a pair of notebooks

460
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,281
and put them in your backpack.

461
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:33,151
Look, Che.

462
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:36,654
This is the new recruit
I wanted to introduce to you.

463
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,519
Dr. Martínez Páez.

464
00:44:38,693 --> 00:44:39,921
- Doctor?
- Doctor.

465
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,527
Pleased to meet you.

466
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:43,858
I have a present here.

467
00:44:47,235 --> 00:44:49,032
From now on,

468
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:53,507
I stop being the medic
to become a guerrilla.

469
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,701
- What, are you giving up your job?
- Yes, sir.

470
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:04,051
- Who are they?
- Chibás and Pazos.

471
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:06,949
They're signing an agreement.

472
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,884
What agreement?

473
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,757
A political alliance.

474
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,260
<i>During the early
stages of the revolution,</i>

475
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:23,768
<i>wasn't there a conflict between Fidel
and the urban movement?</i>

476
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:27,364
<i>I would say the only conflict we've had</i>

477
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,773
<i>- was with Fulgencio Batista.
- Are you saying</i>

478
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,937
<i>you had no conflict
with the urban movement?</i>

479
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,214
<i>We differed in our tactics.</i>

480
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:39,900
<i>They wanted to oust Batista
with a general strike,</i>

481
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,600
<i>and we wanted to overthrow him
with an armed struggle.</i>

482
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,800
<i>And as you can see, our method
proved to be the most effective</i>

483
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,650
<i>for removing Batista.</i>

484
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:51,297
All right, gentlemen.

485
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:58,463
The provisional government, first, will free
all political prisoners, civilian and military.

486
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:04,406
Second, it will guarantee freedom
of information for the radio and press,

487
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:10,381
and individual and political rights
established in the 1940 Constitution.

488
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:14,419
The provisional government will also
establish terms for the Agrarian Reform

489
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:17,456
leading to the distribution
of public lands.

490
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,425
Have a good trip.

491
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,091
Excuse me, Fidel.

492
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:30,431
I can't understand how you can
meet with those clowns,

493
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:33,768
and much less, how you can
make an agreement with them.

494
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,876
They're fighting against
the same enemy we are.

495
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:43,439
No, you're fighting,
they're negotiating.

496
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:46,212
They have lots of followers, Ernesto.

497
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,185
People I can't afford to turn away.

498
00:46:49,357 --> 00:46:51,120
Let's see how it goes.

499
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,157
But I'm sure that if we win the war,

500
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,729
those guys will
hand the keys over to the U.S.

501
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:03,835
Listen, when this war is won,
no one's handing any keys to anybody.

502
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,768
I'll guarantee you that.

503
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:11,509
Come here, I need you
to sign something for me.

504
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,904
It's a letter of condolence
for Frank Pais.

505
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:18,812
They killed his brother in Santiago.

506
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,483
They killed his brother?

507
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,456
Sign as "Comandante."

508
00:47:27,962 --> 00:47:29,691
Sign as "Comandante."

509
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:36,267
I'm forming a new column
on the eastern side of Mount Turquino.

510
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,667
You'll have three captains:

511
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,864
<i>Lalo Sardiñas,</i>

512
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,531
<i>Ramiro Valdés</i>

513
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:43,108
<i>and Ciro Redondo.</i>

514
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:47,005
You have to wear out
Mosquera's troops,

515
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:50,617
harass them constantly.
Don't let up on them.

516
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,117
Don't even let them breathe!

517
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,982
You cannot give them a break.

518
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:59,723
I want you to establish a base
at el Hombrito.

519
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,223
Got it?

520
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:08,134
No one can leave a wounded comrade
on the battlefield.

521
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,769
Right?

522
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:14,704
If any of you leave weapons behind
during battle or anywhere else,

523
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,035
you'll have to go back for it, alone.

524
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:21,543
And if anyone falls asleep on guard duty,
he won't eat for three days.

525
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,141
Is that clear?

526
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:27,414
Thank you, Ciro.

527
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:30,489
I want to say something else

528
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:34,587
to make myself clear.

529
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,189
We respect the peasants,

530
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:43,931
so no one is allowed
to touch their harvest

531
00:48:44,105 --> 00:48:47,541
or mess with them

532
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:49,607
or their families.

533
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:52,473
If anyone does,

534
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:56,577
he will be punished to the full extent
of the revolutionary code.

535
00:49:03,758 --> 00:49:05,225
Luis!

536
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,421
Come here.

537
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:12,254
Here you go.
Take care of it like it's your girlfriend.

538
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,367
Thank you, Comandante.

539
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:37,015
Do you need help, Comandante?

540
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,755
No.

541
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:04,807
- Gustavo.
- Yes, Comandante.

542
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:08,319
Take your math notebook out
and do some work.

543
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:10,320
I'm exhausted, Comandante.

544
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:15,959
Okay.

545
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:32,200
<i>What is the most important quality
for a revolutionary to possess?</i>

546
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,000
<i>Love.</i>

547
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:36,475
<i>Love?</i>

548
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,146
<i>Let me tell you something,
at the risk of sounding ridiculous.</i>

549
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:45,023
<i>A true revolutionary is guided
by great feelings of love:</i>

550
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:50,256
<i>love of humanity, of justice
and truth.</i>

551
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:53,890
<i>It is impossible to conceive
of an authentic revolutionary</i>

552
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:55,936
<i>without this one quality.</i>

553
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,232
Don't move, asshole!

554
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:32,872
- Please don't shoot!
- Freeze!

555
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,337
I'm a doctor.

556
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,500
Che, they're shooting mortars!

557
00:51:38,412 --> 00:51:40,107
How many men are in your troop?

558
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,646
One hundred forty.

559
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:44,950
Under whose command?

560
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:48,421
Merob Sosa.

561
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:51,417
- Mortars!
- Let's go.

562
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,392
- Tell me.
- Ramiro.

563
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:05,695
Go back and keep shooting
until Lalo Sardiñas' squad has passed.

564
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:09,538
We'll do a second line of resistance

565
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,237
up there, on the hill,
200 meters away.

566
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,607
- See you.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

567
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,400
That's Gustavo!

568
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,695
No, Roberto! Roberto!

569
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,300
<i>Are you optimistic</i>

570
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,615
about the normalization of relations
between Cuba and the United States?

571
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:58,200
<i>Friends, it would be very difficult,
it would take many, many years.</i>

572
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,800
<i>By this, I mean
with the U.S. government,</i>

573
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,300
<i>because we have nothing against
the American people.</i>

574
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:09,350
<i>There is not even a trace of hatred
in our country for the American people.</i>

575
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,003
Comandante, there's a page missing.

576
00:53:13,174 --> 00:53:16,507
- How is this possible?
- The fourteenth.

577
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,818
Here is the page. It's torn out.

578
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:30,881
Excuse me, Comandante.

579
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:34,255
There's a small problem.

580
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,529
Bomb threat at the U.N.

581
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:38,789
What did he say?

582
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,265
They called the station 30 minutes ago.

583
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,309
Hector, you go with Pedro and the
Cuban delegation in the second car,

584
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,741
and I will go in the first car.

585
00:53:53,914 --> 00:53:55,506
I think I should go with you.

586
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:57,377
I didn't ask your opinion.

587
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:02,652
Comandante, with all due respect,

588
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,688
I came here to protect you.

589
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:08,689
And I'd like you to give me
that opportunity, at least.

590
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,956
- That way we'll die together if...
- No one is going to die.

591
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:15,934
Traitor!

592
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,736
Go away! Traitor! Murderer!

593
00:54:29,717 --> 00:54:32,584
Not only did you desert
with your weapon

594
00:54:33,254 --> 00:54:36,348
and terrorize the area,
stealing from the poor

595
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,514
in the name of the revolution,

596
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,722
but also, because of your betrayal,

597
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:46,332
peasants were tortured
and murdered by Batista's army.

598
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:49,702
Why, Esteban?

599
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:52,835
The punishment for treason is death.

600
00:54:57,778 --> 00:54:59,109
And you

601
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,017
boasted of your authority
as a messenger for the Rebel Army,

602
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:08,346
and passing yourself off
as Comandante Almeida

603
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,615
you raped
Juan Carlos Estévez's daughter,

604
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,553
a teenager,

605
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:21,758
and this also
deserves the death penalty.

606
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,337
Bring him here.

607
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:07,469
Would you like a sip of rum?

608
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,284
Roberto, give him a swig.

609
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,795
Do you have a last wish?

610
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,158
Let me confess to Father Chávez.

611
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,962
We can't bring you the priest.
He's far away, we have no time.

612
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,574
- Something else?
- Then give me another swig.

613
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:39,303
Give him another.

614
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,179
Ready.

615
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,184
Aim.

616
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:55,919
Make sure everyone knows
I asked for my last confession.

617
00:56:56,096 --> 00:56:57,461
Fire!

618
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,834
Mr. President, fellow delegates.

619
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,412
The world has developed a great deal
in this political arena,

620
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:17,516
but American imperialism, above all,

621
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,482
has led people to believe
that peaceful coexistence

622
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:25,021
is the exclusive right
of the world's most powerful nations.

623
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,958
Cuba, my fellow delegates,
free and sovereign,

624
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:31,563
with no chains tying it to anyone,

625
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:35,395
without foreign investments
in its territory,

626
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:38,697
free from occupant military bosses
determining political status,

627
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:42,103
can stand tall at this assembly

628
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,837
<i>and demonstrate the correctness
of the cry with which it was baptized.</i>

629
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,709
<i>Free territory of America!</i>

630
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:06,656
The United States intervenes in Latin
America claiming they defend freedom.

631
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:10,965
One day this assembly
will acquire enough maturity

632
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:16,034
to demand equal rights for blacks

633
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:18,506
and Latin Americans living
in this country

634
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:22,672
as they awaken from the long, brutal sleep
to which they've been subjected.

635
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:26,013
We need to say here

636
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:28,552
something that is a known truth.

637
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,089
And this is a truth we have always
presented to the world.

638
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:37,791
Executions? Yes, we have executed.

639
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:42,925
We execute, and we'll continue
to execute when it is necessary.

640
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:46,436
Our fight is a fight to death.

641
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:50,435
These are the conditions
in which we live

642
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,842
because of the imposition
of American imperialism.

643
00:58:58,185 --> 00:58:59,652
Good morning.

644
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:05,785
How are you, doctor?

645
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,021
- Good.
- And my brother?

646
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:09,685
Very good.

647
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:14,829
- What's your name?
- He's Enrique, my brother.

648
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:17,503
We're from Remedios.

649
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:20,606
We worked
for the 26th of July Movement.

650
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,938
My brother and I, with a group,

651
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:27,137
tried to burn down the stable
at the town barracks,

652
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,751
but one of the soldiers
identified my brother,

653
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,987
so we came here to find Fidel.

654
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:39,181
- What's your name?
- Rogelio Acevedo.

655
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,123
- How old are you, Rogelio?
- Sixteen.

656
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:44,992
- And you?
- Fourteen.

657
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,028
Sixteen and 14.

658
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,129
I can't accept you, you're too young.

659
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:56,709
- What are you here for?
- Same reasons as you.

660
00:59:56,944 --> 00:59:59,242
Is that so? Very good.

661
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,943
Do you know how to read and write?

662
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:04,816
No.

663
01:00:07,788 --> 01:00:10,882
Raise your hands, the ones
who know how to read and write.

664
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,357
So you know how to read and write?

665
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,797
Yes, Comandante.
I made it through 6th grade.

666
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:27,468
We are not here in the middle
of the mountains just to fire guns.

667
01:00:28,475 --> 01:00:31,535
A country that doesn't know
how to read and write

668
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,237
is easy to deceive.

669
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,778
Since none of you have weapons,

670
01:00:38,986 --> 01:00:42,444
I'm picking only eight of you.
The rest will have to go.

671
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,955
This is no piece of cake,
we're here to fight.

672
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:49,391
We won't eat for days.
We'll sleep on the ground in the rain.

673
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,997
We're risking our lives here.

674
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:54,063
Is that clear?

675
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:56,258
- Yes.
- Is that absolutely clear?

676
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,060
Sure?

677
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,638
Good. You will be a teacher.

678
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:04,903
And the rest will learn from her.
You came here to fight and to learn.

679
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,375
Okay?

680
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,675
And you?

681
01:01:09,016 --> 01:01:11,450
- Come on, boys, you gotta go.
- No.

682
01:01:11,985 --> 01:01:13,384
Fuck, no. You have to go.

683
01:01:13,553 --> 01:01:16,454
If I have to go back to Remedios
I'd rather shoot myself.

684
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:18,420
Me too.

685
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,988
My God.

686
01:01:21,995 --> 01:01:24,259
- Are you listening?
- Let's go, man.

687
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,160
Let's get moving.

688
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:29,559
Come on.

689
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,619
Wait, wait!

690
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:56,627
You can't do that, man.

691
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,093
Stand up!
You're stopping the column!

692
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,891
- Hold my gun.
- Let's go.

693
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:09,575
The next letter is...

694
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,273
No? Look.

695
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:14,640
Here. Yello...

696
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:18,814
Excuse me, Che.
He says he needs to talk to you.

697
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,043
What's going on?

698
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,247
Comandante, Camilo calls me
a bad word every time he sees me.

699
01:02:24,424 --> 01:02:27,291
- What bad word?
- Something rude I don't like.

700
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,429
Go and get Camilo.
Like what?

701
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:34,124
I don't want to be a bother, but I'm a man
who shouldn't be disrespected.

702
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,268
everyone is laughing
and making fun of me.

703
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,597
I don't really understand
what he's saying, but I don't like it.

704
01:02:39,773 --> 01:02:42,241
What's going on, Comandante?

705
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:43,842
Albertico.

706
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,638
What's the story?

707
01:02:47,314 --> 01:02:50,340
Okay, friend, now tell me
what Camilo's been saying to you?

708
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:54,016
He calls me "vanilla piss."

709
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,617
Ventriloquist, man, ventriloquist.

710
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:02,455
- That's not a bad word.
- But it sounds bad. I don't like it.

711
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:05,621
A ventriloquist is someone
who talks without moving his mouth.

712
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,059
- Why are you calling me that?
- Yes, Camilo, why?

713
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:12,637
Because he's a good messenger

714
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:15,866
and he's always popping up
with information,

715
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:20,574
and he reminds me of a ventriloquist
puppet that moves like this.

716
01:03:20,747 --> 01:03:22,408
Albertico, it's not a bad word.

717
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:25,142
It's not an insult, man.
I say it with affection.

718
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,410
- He's a very good messenger.
- Really?

719
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:31,422
No, it's true. He's doing things
really well. He's always there.

720
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:32,819
Yes, he is.

721
01:03:32,993 --> 01:03:34,460
You wanna play ball, Che?

722
01:03:34,661 --> 01:03:39,257
Today is a perfect day to abandon
the guerrilla movement.

723
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,697
Another chance like this
may not come along for weeks.

724
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:47,904
Let's see.

725
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,969
Anyone who'd like to leave
this column, step forward.

726
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:06,525
Stand up there.

727
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:10,025
Come on,
the quitters and the horses' asses!

728
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,496
Stay there.

729
01:04:19,306 --> 01:04:22,104
I'm not leaving because I'm scared.
I have a pain and...

730
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,334
You are a moron. Shut up.

731
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,241
- My mother is sick.
- You are a moron!

732
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,117
You'll have to give back everything
that belongs to the column.

733
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,278
You're a bunch of cowards.

734
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:39,423
You have 30 minutes
to get out of here.

735
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:46,121
If we find you, you're deserters.
Israel, Roberto, take them out.

736
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:51,663
Dickhead, aren't you leaving with them?

737
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:53,962
Another faggot.

738
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,310
Anyone else?

739
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:04,946
So did you grow balls?

740
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,177
We can still stand a little bit more.

741
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,458
You already behaved with dignity,

742
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:17,028
but you have no chance
of adapting to this warfare.

743
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:20,089
Okay, I'll make an exception.

744
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:25,165
I'll let you take your things with you,
I'll give you a guide

745
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,829
and 10 pesos to each of you.

746
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,206
Comandante.

747
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,611
I think you should
forgive me in advance,

748
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,442
as I know you will not like
what I'm going to say.

749
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:42,820
If we joined the troops,
it wasn't to go back humiliated.

750
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:46,015
We prefer, and I speak for both,

751
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,650
to die on this mountain rather than
return home as failures.

752
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:53,423
We'll make the maximum effort
even if it costs our lives.

753
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,159
This is the last straw.

754
01:05:56,669 --> 01:06:00,867
While the strong
grow weaker and leave,

755
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,737
these snot-nosed kids
get more courageous.

756
01:06:04,611 --> 01:06:06,408
Is there any logic here?

757
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:20,418
The important ones aren't the ones
who leave, but the ones who stay

758
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,719
and the ones
who will join us in the future.

759
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,995
Listen to me.

760
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:28,266
Comandantes Raúl and Almeida
will come with me.

761
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,363
They will open the second
and third front with their columns.

762
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:33,896
Camilo

763
01:06:34,507 --> 01:06:36,668
will replace Sardiñas
as your new captain.

764
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,579
Damn.

765
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,478
Look how generous the revolution is.

766
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,300
<i>Individualism,</i>

767
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:09,767
<i>the isolated action of a person</i>

768
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:13,038
<i>alone in a social environment,
must disappear in Cuba.</i>

769
01:07:14,214 --> 01:07:18,014
<i>But are people built that way?
Isn't it really human nature?</i>

770
01:07:18,386 --> 01:07:20,547
<i>It is very easy to claim
that in capitalism,</i>

771
01:07:20,722 --> 01:07:27,560
<i>the individual has the option to satisfy
or to express true human nature.</i>

772
01:07:28,763 --> 01:07:31,493
<i>A child has one toy and wants two.</i>

773
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:38,230
<i>That child gets two toys and wants four.
This is human nature, isn't it?</i>

774
01:07:38,406 --> 01:07:41,807
<i>But when a whole society
behaves in the same way,</i>

775
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:47,300
<i>or when it becomes a monopoly,
oppressing the less fortunate,</i>

776
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,700
<i>is that human nature?</i>

777
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:53,000
<i>It is then that one has to stand up
and do something.</i>

778
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:57,000
<i>And aren't you acting as
an individual? Isn't Fidel an individual?</i>

779
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,000
<i>Yes, of course, we are individuals</i>

780
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,650
<i>who have accepted the challenge</i>

781
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:07,950
<i>and the responsibility to lead
in the name of a society as a whole.</i>

782
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:21,439
Long live free Cuba!

783
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:29,852
Will they have much time to respond?

784
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,888
Each one will have 10 minutes.

785
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,496
- From the podium?
No, from the floor.

786
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,030
- And my rebuttal?
Ten minutes.

787
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,167
- Also from the floor?
- No, from the podium.

788
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:54,476
My government has nothing to do
with the fact that every day,

789
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:59,346
in Cuban circles, to bolster
the illusions of the Cuban people,

790
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:04,546
they announce
the formation of invading brigades

791
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,783
armed with revolvers

792
01:09:06,993 --> 01:09:11,054
and small-caliber weapons
to confront an army that,

793
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:15,395
according to
the declarations of their leaders,

794
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:21,063
has at their disposal,
the most modern nuclear arms.

795
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,503
The collective and individual actions

796
01:09:25,678 --> 01:09:29,239
of the governments of this hemisphere
to restrict trade with Cuba

797
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,212
are defensive measures,

798
01:09:31,384 --> 01:09:33,784
taken in response
to Cuba's continued promotion

799
01:09:33,953 --> 01:09:38,287
of subversion and violence
elsewhere in this hemisphere.

800
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:42,451
We do not support or condone
hit-and-run attacks

801
01:09:42,629 --> 01:09:47,760
against ships in the Cuban trade,
or against other targets in Cuba.

802
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:51,761
The surveillance flights are authorized

803
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:55,669
by the resolution approved
by the Organization of American States

804
01:09:55,842 --> 01:10:00,370
under the Rio Treaty
on 23 October 1962.

805
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:04,982
Absolutely false are the accusations

806
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:09,281
that acts of genocide are being
committed in Venezuela.

807
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:14,123
Moreover,
it is simply absurd and intolerable

808
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,558
that a Cuban representative

809
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:20,426
dares to make judgments
about Venezuelan sovereignty,

810
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:25,502
the unique and exclusive patrimony
of the Venezuelan people,

811
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:29,006
a truly free people,

812
01:10:29,175 --> 01:10:31,609
which has a democratic government

813
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:35,509
with elections whose legitimacy
are known to the entire world.

814
01:10:35,682 --> 01:10:38,913
The tragedy of the Cuban revolution

815
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:44,284
Lies in not having known how to
institutionalize this great movement

816
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:47,517
into an administration
with legal rights in the Americas.

817
01:10:47,694 --> 01:10:50,254
The greatest flaw of their leaders

818
01:10:50,463 --> 01:10:55,298
is that they suffer from excessive vanity
which blinds them

819
01:10:55,702 --> 01:10:58,603
and prevents them
from observing past examples

820
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,863
which are typical of America,

821
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:04,801
like the Mexican revolution in 1910.

822
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:11,344
I, who lived many years
of my youth in Cuba,

823
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:15,151
and who perhaps
feels more than Che Guevara

824
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,619
that there has been
enough suffering

825
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:20,350
and pain for the Cuban people.

826
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:25,494
In my brief reply to your capricious
intervention into Panamanian issues,

827
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:29,031
I'd like to finish by saying to you:

828
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,966
Don't defend me, compadre.

829
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,574
Vilo!

830
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,511
Take the sick to the shelter!

831
01:12:17,683 --> 01:12:19,583
To the shelter!
Take them to the shelter.

832
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,720
Don't run. Don't run.

833
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:38,192
Hurry up!

834
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,638
Come on!

835
01:13:09,268 --> 01:13:11,463
One, two, three.

836
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:20,176
Polo. Take the prisoners
to your house and keep them there.

837
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:25,611
Polo. Make sure no one mistreats them,
verbally or physically.

838
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,453
- Understood, Roberto?
- Sure.

839
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:31,488
Come on, walk!

840
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:38,791
Che!

841
01:13:40,366 --> 01:13:43,665
They killed Ciro.
They shot him in the head.

842
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:47,565
We couldn't recover his body.

843
01:14:27,914 --> 01:14:29,905
May I talk to you for a second, sir?

844
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:38,413
They were very well organized.

845
01:14:39,325 --> 01:14:41,953
- More than we expected?
- Much more.

846
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:47,065
They have a school, hospital,
printing press, a power plant.

847
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,201
They must have been here months.

848
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:52,432
What do you want me to do with this?

849
01:14:56,275 --> 01:14:57,640
Torch it.

850
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,640
I need you to go to Minas del Frio

851
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:05,783
and create a training camp.

852
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,853
What for?

853
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:15,224
I want you to be personally
in charge of the new recruits.

854
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,189
What about my column?

855
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:22,560
Ramiro can take your place for now.

856
01:15:26,739 --> 01:15:29,105
You know we're days away
from an attack.

857
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:35,611
- I don't understand.
- This is more important.

858
01:15:37,382 --> 01:15:39,475
It makes sense, teach.

859
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:42,915
Who can do that better than you?

860
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:47,187
Tell me. No one, man.

861
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:49,884
Look, when this is over,

862
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:54,361
Cuba and the revolution
will need you even more.

863
01:15:58,436 --> 01:16:00,700
<i>After the loss of El Hombrito,</i>

864
01:16:01,106 --> 01:16:05,372
<i>Fidel took away your column
and sent you to train new recruits.</i>

865
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:07,875
<i>- Did you feel it was a demotion?
No.</i>

866
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:09,946
<i>Was that what you thought at the time?</i>

867
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:12,884
<i>Even if I had a different opinion,</i>

868
01:16:14,287 --> 01:16:17,415
<i>even if I felt I had been demoted,</i>

869
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,886
<i>I knew Fidel had his reasons,
and you can be sure of that.</i>

870
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,628
<i>And around this same time,</i>

871
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:29,729
<i>many others were trying to do this
in a more peaceful way.</i>

872
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:32,802
<i>Yes, that is why
Fidel backed the general strike.</i>

873
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:34,438
<i>But he always made it very clear</i>

874
01:16:34,606 --> 01:16:38,702
<i>that we were the only ones capable
of defeating the enemy.</i>

875
01:16:38,877 --> 01:16:40,845
<i>A t the outset,</i>

876
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:44,470
<i>a lot of the other rebel groups
didn't share Fidel's belief</i>

877
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:48,244
<i>that agrarian reform was a core principle
of the revolution.</i>

878
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,581
<i>What was the turning point?</i>

879
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:53,918
<i>How did he finally bring them around?</i>

880
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:56,526
<i>After the failure
of the general strike of April 9th,</i>

881
01:16:56,694 --> 01:16:57,786
<i>there was no more doubt.</i>

882
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,058
<i>The 26th of July Movement</i>

883
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:02,791
<i>was the only group
that could defeat Batista.</i>

884
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:06,198
<i>That is what a leader does:
He convinces people to share his vision.</i>

885
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:10,740
<i>Are you a leader?
Do you get people to share your vision?</i>

886
01:17:11,144 --> 01:17:12,941
<i>He wants me to tell you</i>

887
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:16,000
<i>that you have proved one thing
to him for sure:</i>

888
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:19,982
<i>He would rather face a soldier
than a journalist.</i>

889
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,853
They see us rebels as agitators,

890
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:27,046
people who want to gain prestige
by complicating Batista's life.

891
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,852
But we don't see ourselves like that.

892
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:32,859
We see ourselves as a small army
that will become a bigger army...

893
01:17:33,364 --> 01:17:37,698
Fidel has to be the commander
in chief of the entire rebellion.

894
01:17:39,504 --> 01:17:42,735
But we have to propose it with tact.

895
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:48,004
Our relationship with the Communist Party
still makes people nervous.

896
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:53,513
We raised funds by naming Fidel

897
01:17:53,685 --> 01:17:56,518
as leader of our revolution.

898
01:17:57,522 --> 01:18:01,959
Outside of Cuba, he's the only
recognizable figure we've got.

899
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:06,592
No one is saying that
in the plains they screwed up.

900
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:08,925
But what is clear
in the Sierra Maestra

901
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,264
is that defeating Batista doesn't
assure the end of the dictatorship.

902
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,601
We also have to overthrow
Batista's army

903
01:18:16,774 --> 01:18:19,368
in order to prevent another coup.

904
01:18:20,044 --> 01:18:22,376
Being under the command
of the Soviet Union

905
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:26,244
isn't any better than being under
the command of the United States.

906
01:18:26,551 --> 01:18:30,578
Latour, you're still thinking
like a colonized person does.

907
01:18:30,755 --> 01:18:33,656
Cuba won't be under
anyone's command.

908
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,060
Cuba is for the Cuban people.

909
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:41,597
I'll do everything I can
with the Stalinists from the PSP,

910
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:43,757
but I don't think it will be worth it.

911
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:49,929
And we understand it, Faustino.

912
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:52,702
That's precisely why
we always want to include...

913
01:18:52,877 --> 01:18:54,777
"Stalinists"?

914
01:18:55,914 --> 01:19:00,578
From now on, the coordination
of the plains militias

915
01:19:00,752 --> 01:19:06,349
will serve the needs
of the guerrillas in the Sierra Maestra.

916
01:19:06,524 --> 01:19:10,927
Fidel Castro will become commander
in chief of all the armed forces.

917
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:14,822
Long live the revolution!

918
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:30,772
I want to congratulate you, Fidel,

919
01:19:31,716 --> 01:19:35,083
because today you entered the path
of the greatest men of the Americas.

920
01:19:37,055 --> 01:19:39,023
A path that

921
01:19:39,857 --> 01:19:41,791
will prove to the world

922
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:47,359
it's possible to get to power
with an armed struggle

923
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,523
supported by the people.

924
01:19:52,837 --> 01:19:54,634
It's not only me, Ernesto.

925
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:56,968
It's all of us.

926
01:19:57,141 --> 01:20:00,907
This wouldn't be possible
if I were on my own.

927
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:07,378
I want you to organize a new front.

928
01:20:08,987 --> 01:20:10,454
Once we start this offensive,

929
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:13,352
I want to take the war down
from the Sierra Maestra into the plains.

930
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:19,521
You'll have to unite
all the rebel factions.

931
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:24,826
We have to take control of Las Villas
Province, dividing the island in two.

932
01:20:25,203 --> 01:20:29,367
Camilo's going to head in the same
direction, leading his own column.

933
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:34,609
There will be no victory in Havana

934
01:20:35,213 --> 01:20:37,340
without victory in Las Villas.

935
01:20:39,717 --> 01:20:43,949
Getting all the groups to work together
will be difficult, Ernesto.

936
01:20:44,122 --> 01:20:47,614
So I hope you have sharpened
your political skills.

937
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:52,628
And one other thing.

938
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:55,056
I know you are very reckless,

939
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,527
but you can't always
put yourself on the frontline.

940
01:20:59,003 --> 01:21:01,130
You are too important to us.

941
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,066
It's an order.

942
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:15,285
I want to respond
to the Nicaraguan delegate

943
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:20,083
even though I did not understand
his argument about accent.

944
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:23,885
I believe he referred to Cuba,

945
01:21:24,262 --> 01:21:29,222
Argentina and somewhat
to Russia of the Soviet Union.

946
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:31,563
In any event,

947
01:21:31,736 --> 01:21:36,969
I hope the Nicaraguan delegate found
no North American accent in my speech,

948
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:40,105
because that would be truly dangerous.

949
01:21:40,545 --> 01:21:43,946
But one thing is for sure,
we don't commit assassinations

950
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:47,141
like the ones being committed
right at this moment

951
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:51,687
by the political police of Venezuela
who are called DIGEPOL

952
01:21:51,856 --> 01:21:53,721
if I am not misinformed.

953
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:57,155
This police force has committed
a series of barbarous acts,

954
01:21:57,328 --> 01:22:00,593
executions,
which is to say assassinations.

955
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:03,131
The Panamanian delegate,

956
01:22:03,434 --> 01:22:06,028
who has been kind enough
to call me "Che"

957
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,229
as I am called by the Cuban people,

958
01:22:08,406 --> 01:22:11,307
began speaking
about the Mexican revolution.

959
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:15,845
While Cuba spoke about the
North American massacre in Panama,

960
01:22:16,013 --> 01:22:18,038
the Panamanian delegation

961
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:22,619
continued speaking in this vein,
without referring at all

962
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:27,883
to that American massacre for which

963
01:22:28,059 --> 01:22:33,258
the Panamanian government broke off
relations to the United States.

964
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:37,595
On to Mr. Stevenson.
Regrettably, he is not present here.

965
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:43,830
Mr. Stevenson again claims
there is no violation of the law

966
01:22:44,008 --> 01:22:48,707
that neither airplanes nor boats
leave from here and, of course,

967
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,078
that pirate attacks just happen.
They just come out of nowhere.

968
01:22:53,918 --> 01:23:00,789
Due to the demands of imperialism,
our prime minister declared five points

969
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:04,052
to secure peace in the Caribbean.

970
01:23:04,228 --> 01:23:05,786
And these are...

971
01:23:05,963 --> 01:23:06,987
First:

972
01:23:07,498 --> 01:23:12,526
<i>A halt to the economic blockade
and all forms of commercial pressure</i>

973
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:18,300
<i>imposed by the United States
all over the world against our country.</i>

974
01:23:18,476 --> 01:23:21,809
Second: Halt all subversive activities,

975
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:26,908
<i>such as the launch and distribution
of arms and explosives by air and water,</i>

976
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:29,382
<i>organization of mercenary invasions,</i>

977
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,715
<i>infiltration of spies and saboteurs,</i>

978
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:37,190
<i>and all actions carried out
from the territory of the United States</i>

979
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:39,989
<i>or accomplice countries.</i>

980
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:41,823
<i>Third:</i>

981
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:46,068
<i>Halt all pirate attacks
carried out from bases located</i>

982
01:23:46,237 --> 01:23:49,172
<i>in the United States and Puerto Rico.</i>

983
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,179
<i>Fourth: Halt all airspace
and territorial water violations</i>

984
01:23:57,348 --> 01:24:01,045
<i>by U.S. aircraft and warships.</i>

985
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:05,081
Fifth: Withdrawal from
the Guantánamo naval base

986
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:08,916
<i>and return of Cuban territory
occupied by the U.S.</i>

987
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,827
<i>This great mass of humanity has said
"Enough!" and has stepped forward.</i>

988
01:24:20,004 --> 01:24:25,738
<i>This march of giants will not stop
until true independence is won,</i>

989
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:30,142
<i>for which so many died in vain.</i>

990
01:24:31,716 --> 01:24:33,980
All of this, my fellow delegates,

991
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:37,678
is the new stance
of the American continent,

992
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:40,949
a stance captured by the cry

993
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,185
that is shouted
every day by our people

994
01:24:44,362 --> 01:24:47,559
as an expression of our
irrefutable decision to fight,

995
01:24:47,732 --> 01:24:50,360
<i>paralyzing the strikes
of armed intruders,</i>

996
01:24:50,534 --> 01:24:54,971
<i>an outcry that counts the support
of all the people of the world</i>

997
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:59,734
<i>and especially the socialist camp
headed by the Soviet Union.</i>

998
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:03,870
This cry is "Homeland or death!"

999
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:24,591
Che!

1000
01:25:27,571 --> 01:25:30,665
That's Las Villas, behind the clouds.

1001
01:25:40,818 --> 01:25:44,276
Camilo arrived a few weeks ago
and we put ourselves under his command.

1002
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:45,979
Very good.

1003
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:49,251
- I see you received our supplies.
- Yes, thanks.

1004
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:51,554
Of all the groups operating in the area,

1005
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:54,357
the Communist Party
was the only one to send help.

1006
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:56,124
I'm not surprised, Comandante.

1007
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:00,100
Most of these groups
are too busy fighting each other.

1008
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:05,933
Months ago, Menoyo broke from
the Directory, creating a Second Front.

1009
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:08,670
Since then, each one has carved out
its own territory.

1010
01:26:08,846 --> 01:26:11,906
There's been open hostility
between the two factions.

1011
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,416
Where does the 26th of July Movement
stand in all of this?

1012
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,551
Recently,
Menoyo met with Víctor Bordón.

1013
01:26:19,724 --> 01:26:22,921
I think both groups

1014
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,153
are on the brink
of an armed confrontation.

1015
01:26:25,696 --> 01:26:28,961
We're ready to cooperate
with the 26th of July Movement

1016
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,930
in all military maneuvers.

1017
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:35,834
We even agree with agrarian reform

1018
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,238
as long as it's done reasonably

1019
01:26:40,411 --> 01:26:43,107
and brings in money.

1020
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:47,982
Landowners should be pressured

1021
01:26:48,552 --> 01:26:52,579
to sell their idle land to the peasants.

1022
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:55,089
But it should be sold at cost.

1023
01:26:55,626 --> 01:26:58,026
Will you be the one fixing the price?

1024
01:26:58,429 --> 01:27:00,954
How can a peasant
with no money buy land?

1025
01:27:02,566 --> 01:27:06,024
But what do you want?
Just give it to them?

1026
01:27:06,203 --> 01:27:08,831
So they can destroy it
like they did in Mexico?

1027
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:11,804
The owner of the land
is the one who works it.

1028
01:27:12,877 --> 01:27:18,372
Comandante, you have permission
to institute agrarian reform in the region,

1029
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:22,745
but the Second Front will continue
to charge the land taxes.

1030
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:28,218
Menoyo, the region belongs to us all.
What we have to do here is fight.

1031
01:27:29,493 --> 01:27:31,961
The only thing the Directory won't do

1032
01:27:32,196 --> 01:27:36,462
is any kind of deal
with Menoyo's Second Front.

1033
01:27:36,634 --> 01:27:40,297
We'll never do business
with that bunch of bandits.

1034
01:27:40,471 --> 01:27:43,269
We need to attack
all the army garrisons in the area.

1035
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:45,272
But you can't attack
Güinia de Miranda,

1036
01:27:45,443 --> 01:27:46,842
because that zone is ours.

1037
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:51,038
We have more experience
and more weapons than you do.

1038
01:27:51,215 --> 01:27:54,844
Do you think the Americans are just
going to sit and watch this happen?

1039
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,953
No, man, listen.

1040
01:27:59,123 --> 01:28:04,425
We shouldn't be doing things
so openly.

1041
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:09,888
So you're one of those who think
we can make a revolution

1042
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:12,592
behind the backs of the Americans?

1043
01:28:12,937 --> 01:28:17,636
No, man.
A real revolution cannot be hidden.

1044
01:28:17,808 --> 01:28:21,175
I can do more
with the 400 rifles I have

1045
01:28:21,345 --> 01:28:24,337
than you can with your little bazooka

1046
01:28:24,515 --> 01:28:28,884
and all the balls your troops may have.

1047
01:28:30,154 --> 01:28:35,182
Look, Peña, the day I have
to take arms against my comrades

1048
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:37,827
will be the day I stop fighting.

1049
01:28:39,263 --> 01:28:43,825
If you don't take Güinia de Miranda
in five days, we'll do it ourselves.

1050
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:48,834
<i>I am Comandante Ernesto Guevara.</i>

1051
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:54,272
He is Comandante Ramiro Valdés.

1052
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:57,513
And he is Captain Victor Bordón.

1053
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:03,149
I just want to say three things.

1054
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:05,014
First:

1055
01:29:05,556 --> 01:29:10,687
From now on, I am the only one

1056
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:15,025
in charge of the region of Las Villas.

1057
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:17,260
Second:

1058
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:21,428
We will enforce strict discipline.

1059
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:25,040
And third:

1060
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,837
The fighting is going to intensify.

1061
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:35,450
Whoever is not ready to sacrifice
himself for his homeland

1062
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:38,053
can leave his gun on the ground

1063
01:29:38,622 --> 01:29:40,852
and abandon the column

1064
01:29:41,825 --> 01:29:43,349
immediately.

1065
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,466
Fire.

1066
01:30:25,869 --> 01:30:27,734
Give it to me, damn it!

1067
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:43,847
Homeland or death!

1068
01:31:12,316 --> 01:31:13,613
You're ready?

1069
01:31:22,826 --> 01:31:24,293
Thank you.

1070
01:31:33,837 --> 01:31:36,704
Tell Oltuski the money
will be put to good use.

1071
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:38,398
Will do.

1072
01:31:41,578 --> 01:31:43,011
excuse me.

1073
01:31:43,347 --> 01:31:46,976
The police are looking for me
in Santa Clara and want to arrest me.

1074
01:31:47,151 --> 01:31:50,211
I need to stay here.
I'm not going anywhere.

1075
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:54,357
Well, you can stay
and work in the infirmary,

1076
01:31:54,525 --> 01:31:57,221
because we don't allow people
to just hang around.

1077
01:31:58,362 --> 01:32:01,263
I want you to know that
for the last two years

1078
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,593
I've been working
in the clandestine movement.

1079
01:32:03,767 --> 01:32:07,794
I've been taking weapons, bombs
and fugitives all across the province.

1080
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:11,031
I think that gives me the right
to become a guerrilla.

1081
01:32:11,308 --> 01:32:12,400
Okay.

1082
01:32:12,576 --> 01:32:15,602
We've started taxing

1083
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:18,339
some of the largest landowners.

1084
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:21,279
I need someone to collect the money.

1085
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:24,353
You can start with that
and then we'll see.

1086
01:32:24,722 --> 01:32:26,189
Thanks.

1087
01:32:26,623 --> 01:32:28,113
Ramiro.

1088
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,091
- The girl here will collect the taxes.
- Okay.

1089
01:32:43,175 --> 01:32:46,576
<i>Finally, we were working
with the other groups.</i>

1090
01:32:46,746 --> 01:32:48,976
<i>It was like a wave.</i>

1091
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:56,250
<i>When we arrived in the towns,
people received us with open arms,</i>

1092
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,990
<i>and many of them even joined us.</i>

1093
01:32:59,089 --> 01:33:01,649
<i>And you took a lot of towns
in less than a week.</i>

1094
01:33:01,825 --> 01:33:03,850
<i>Isn't it now called
"the lightning campaign"?</i>

1095
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,223
<i>True, but in reality,
the battle had been building steam</i>

1096
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:11,800
<i>for nearly 100 years.</i>

1097
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:17,364
<i>When people hate their government,
it's not very hard to take a town.</i>

1098
01:33:30,554 --> 01:33:33,648
One machine gun, 180 rifles

1099
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,689
and 9,000 rounds of ammunition.

1100
01:33:36,393 --> 01:33:39,624
Victor, we need you to blow
the Cabaiguán bridge.

1101
01:33:39,797 --> 01:33:41,890
The Cabaiguán bridge? Now?

1102
01:33:42,065 --> 01:33:43,965
Yes. Now.

1103
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,894
How did it go?

1104
01:33:48,505 --> 01:33:50,473
I couldn't collect the money.

1105
01:33:50,641 --> 01:33:53,542
In Placetas, the police
are looking for me too.

1106
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:55,200
Rogelio!

1107
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,370
Take the compañeras back to camp.

1108
01:33:57,548 --> 01:34:00,813
Wait a minute. With all due respect,

1109
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:05,314
I know these towns like the back
of my hand. Let me be your guide.

1110
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:07,116
I already have a guide.

1111
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:22,361
Don't worry.
I know you're going to stay with us.

1112
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:26,236
Don't be like that. Calm down, girl.

1113
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:29,511
Don't worry.

1114
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:44,121
Do you know Cabaiguán?

1115
01:34:53,237 --> 01:34:56,729
And tell Milián to have his people ready.

1116
01:34:56,907 --> 01:34:58,670
We'll attack the garrison.

1117
01:34:58,842 --> 01:35:00,605
Perfect.

1118
01:35:10,153 --> 01:35:11,450
Che.

1119
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,647
We have to give you a tetanus shot.

1120
01:35:15,726 --> 01:35:18,820
No, it might trigger
an asthma attack.

1121
01:35:18,996 --> 01:35:21,328
Give me some aspirin.

1122
01:35:28,438 --> 01:35:31,066
Comandante, this is
the Virgin of Caridad del Cobre,

1123
01:35:31,241 --> 01:35:33,801
the patron saint of Cuba,
to help your arrival in Havana.

1124
01:35:33,977 --> 01:35:36,844
I hope it helps us arrive in Placetas.

1125
01:35:37,014 --> 01:35:38,811
Goodbye!

1126
01:35:39,249 --> 01:35:43,185
- How are you? Does it hurt?
- A little, but that's unavoidable.

1127
01:35:46,523 --> 01:35:48,184
Here, for your arm.

1128
01:35:48,926 --> 01:35:50,257
Thanks.

1129
01:35:51,695 --> 01:35:53,720
Long live the revolution!

1130
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,316
Shit, Argentine. You broke your paw?

1131
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:18,215
- It's nothing. I fell off a roof.
- So, what happened?

1132
01:36:18,388 --> 01:36:21,448
- I just spoke to Fidel.
- And?

1133
01:36:21,625 --> 01:36:23,820
Santiago has almost surrendered.

1134
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:26,394
Santa Clara is the only thing
standing between us and Havana.

1135
01:36:26,563 --> 01:36:29,862
Batista's throwing everything
he's got to Santa Clara.

1136
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:31,500
That's why,

1137
01:36:31,668 --> 01:36:34,637
when you take Remedios
and I take Yaguajay,

1138
01:36:34,838 --> 01:36:37,705
we can then take
Santa Clara together.

1139
01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:40,367
Give me a light.

1140
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:50,319
I know what I'm going to do
when we win this thing.

1141
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:52,011
I'll put you in a cage,

1142
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:54,987
tour the country and charge admission.

1143
01:36:55,158 --> 01:36:57,217
We'll be rich, man!

1144
01:37:04,034 --> 01:37:06,332
What made you join the Movement?

1145
01:37:07,337 --> 01:37:12,001
Well, I was in college when Fidel
attacked the Moncada Barracks.

1146
01:37:12,175 --> 01:37:15,702
When I read his defense plea,
"History Will Absolve Me,"

1147
01:37:15,879 --> 01:37:18,848
I knew he was the only one
who could take down Batista.

1148
01:37:19,016 --> 01:37:22,679
And that he would do it fighting,
and I liked that.

1149
01:37:22,853 --> 01:37:24,753
Does your family support you?

1150
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:26,354
Of course.

1151
01:37:26,523 --> 01:37:29,253
My cousin was killed.

1152
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:35,126
The brutality of the army
intensified after the general strike.

1153
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:37,359
I think they got scared

1154
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:40,798
when they saw
so many people against them.

1155
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:48,803
You don't look like a Communist.

1156
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:52,949
- And what do Communists look like?
- Well, not like you.

1157
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:54,913
We come in all colors.

1158
01:38:00,757 --> 01:38:04,488
Do you expect to stay in Cuba
after the success of the revolution?

1159
01:38:05,095 --> 01:38:07,461
My wife and my daughter are in Mexico.

1160
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:09,895
I have to keep them in mind.

1161
01:38:11,068 --> 01:38:12,330
Of course.

1162
01:38:15,906 --> 01:38:18,932
I'm Lieutenant Pérez Valencia.

1163
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:20,940
The rebel army

1164
01:38:21,111 --> 01:38:23,409
is not what you have imagined.

1165
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,208
Hand over your weapons
and no one will be injured.

1166
01:38:27,918 --> 01:38:29,818
Stay on the air, over.

1167
01:38:30,153 --> 01:38:32,314
Santa Clara hasn't sent reinforcements.

1168
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,821
It's a lost cause for these people.

1169
01:38:35,258 --> 01:38:37,089
<i>Attention, Che, attention.
Che, attention, Che.</i>

1170
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,356
Listen, could you resolve the problem
and follow the instructions,

1171
01:38:41,531 --> 01:38:44,796
the instructions, the instructions
you gave me with the man I sent?

1172
01:38:44,968 --> 01:38:49,166
<i>So tell me if you understand, understand,
understand me. Over, Che.</i>

1173
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:51,807
Camilo, I hear you perfectly.

1174
01:38:52,442 --> 01:38:55,843
Your record is broken,
you have to change it. Over.

1175
01:38:57,214 --> 01:39:00,149
How long will you be
in Yaguajay? Over.

1176
01:39:00,317 --> 01:39:03,218
<i>Three days, maybe a week. Over.</i>

1177
01:39:03,386 --> 01:39:05,684
The more time you stay there

1178
01:39:05,889 --> 01:39:09,256
the harder it will be here,
Camilo. Over.

1179
01:39:09,993 --> 01:39:13,588
<i>Don't dare to enter the city
without me, do you hear?</i>

1180
01:39:14,798 --> 01:39:18,029
Camilo, it's fair to share
the glory sometimes. Over.

1181
01:39:18,201 --> 01:39:21,830
Sharing the glory is fine,
but with an Argentine,

1182
01:39:22,005 --> 01:39:24,166
don't do that to me.

1183
01:39:24,674 --> 01:39:26,665
Over and out, Che.

1184
01:39:42,692 --> 01:39:46,025
It's good to have you
in Santa Clara, Colonel Casillas.

1185
01:39:46,696 --> 01:39:49,688
The city's forces are at your disposal.

1186
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,333
Can those forces
get me some coffee?

1187
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:56,432
The best beans in the world, colonel.

1188
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:03,843
Sit down.

1189
01:40:49,659 --> 01:40:53,493
<i>Camilo Cienfuegos
wanted you to wait for him,</i>

1190
01:40:53,663 --> 01:40:54,994
<i>but you kept going.</i>

1191
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:56,894
<i>Why?</i>

1192
01:40:57,436 --> 01:41:00,166
<i>Santa Clara was all they had left,</i>

1193
01:41:00,339 --> 01:41:04,708
<i>the only thing linking Havana
to the country as a whole.</i>

1194
01:41:04,876 --> 01:41:07,037
<i>And though we had not slept for days</i>

1195
01:41:07,212 --> 01:41:11,200
<i>and the army outnumbered us
nine to one,</i>

1196
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:16,550
<i>at that point, safely waiting for Camilo
seemed to us more dangerous.</i>

1197
01:41:17,954 --> 01:41:20,047
<i>People of Santa Clara,</i>

1198
01:41:20,223 --> 01:41:23,192
<i>this is Comandante Guevara speaking.</i>

1199
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:26,921
<i>The enemy wants us to live in fear,</i>

1200
01:41:27,097 --> 01:41:29,065
<i>but it is they who should be afraid.</i>

1201
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:34,960
<i>The situation of the military regime
is getting worse every day,</i>

1202
01:41:36,139 --> 01:41:38,471
<i>because their soldiers
don't want to fight.</i>

1203
01:41:42,145 --> 01:41:43,373
<i>Santa Clara,</i>

1204
01:41:44,147 --> 01:41:49,380
<i>if there has ever been a time
to fight for our freedom,</i>

1205
01:41:49,552 --> 01:41:52,487
<i>that time is now.</i>

1206
01:41:52,656 --> 01:41:55,523
That moment has come.

1207
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:13,634
I want air strikes

1208
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:16,841
all around the neighborhoods.

1209
01:42:18,148 --> 01:42:20,275
Torch those bastards!

1210
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:55,813
He's dead.

1211
01:42:58,555 --> 01:43:00,045
Cover him with that sheet.

1212
01:43:00,223 --> 01:43:01,815
I need more help.

1213
01:43:02,225 --> 01:43:03,692
- Aleida.
- The situation is critical.

1214
01:43:03,893 --> 01:43:06,828
Talk to Camajuani
and ask for more doctors.

1215
01:43:59,315 --> 01:44:00,475
Yes?

1216
01:44:01,418 --> 01:44:04,615
Comandante, it's Rogelio
calling from the station.

1217
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:09,849
Speak to me, Rogelio.

1218
01:44:10,026 --> 01:44:14,258
Comandante, we took the train station.

1219
01:44:14,497 --> 01:44:16,192
Is it safe?

1220
01:44:17,467 --> 01:44:18,593
Good.

1221
01:44:18,768 --> 01:44:23,671
Go with 15 men to the train tracks
between Toscano and San Pedro

1222
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,808
and wait there.

1223
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:27,407
All right.

1224
01:45:27,704 --> 01:45:30,696
The tank is screwing us.
The machine gun doesn't let us get closer.

1225
01:45:30,874 --> 01:45:32,068
For Guile and Ramiro.

1226
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,676
- What's the highest position?
- The church at the end of the street.

1227
01:45:34,844 --> 01:45:37,142
Then you have to take the church,
you must take the church.

1228
01:45:37,313 --> 01:45:38,871
Of course, Comandante.

1229
01:45:41,484 --> 01:45:42,781
Go.

1230
01:45:54,731 --> 01:45:56,130
Hit it hard.

1231
01:46:04,574 --> 01:46:07,042
- How many houses do we have to cross?
- Five.

1232
01:46:08,244 --> 01:46:10,644
Little Cowboy, it's too many.

1233
01:46:12,382 --> 01:46:15,317
Hit it hard.
Fuck. We have to break it down now!

1234
01:47:27,523 --> 01:47:30,492
Get down, Little Cowboy.
You're going to get hit.

1235
01:47:52,515 --> 01:47:53,846
Stay here.

1236
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:40,585
Aleida!

1237
01:48:59,215 --> 01:49:02,207
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The SIM is on the hotel rooftop.

1238
01:49:03,186 --> 01:49:05,177
They hit Little Cowboy.

1239
01:49:08,191 --> 01:49:10,751
Tamayo. What happened?

1240
01:49:13,262 --> 01:49:14,729
They got Little Cowboy, Comandante.

1241
01:49:14,897 --> 01:49:16,330
What happened to him?

1242
01:49:16,499 --> 01:49:19,332
We claimed a rooftop
to get a good position,

1243
01:49:20,002 --> 01:49:24,098
and then he got shot in the head.
They killed him.

1244
01:49:33,416 --> 01:49:35,247
Take him to the medical station.

1245
01:49:42,592 --> 01:49:43,923
Tamayo.

1246
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,860
You are now in charge
of the suicide platoon.

1247
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:50,132
Keep breaking the walls
until you reach the church.

1248
01:49:50,299 --> 01:49:51,891
They need to pay for this.

1249
01:50:03,045 --> 01:50:05,343
The rebels have surrounded the city

1250
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:07,745
and our tanks can't cross the barricades.

1251
01:50:08,618 --> 01:50:10,017
Shit.

1252
01:50:13,856 --> 01:50:16,051
Get Havana on the phone.

1253
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,722
Tell them to airlift men
from Cienfuegos.

1254
01:50:23,032 --> 01:50:26,024
We're going to secure this city
neighborhood by neighborhood

1255
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:28,261
and street by street.

1256
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:30,396
Send a battalion.

1257
01:51:46,382 --> 01:51:47,610
Where are you going?

1258
01:51:47,783 --> 01:51:51,082
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired of this.

1259
01:51:52,955 --> 01:51:54,479
Let me go.

1260
01:52:01,597 --> 01:52:03,792
Anyone else want to leave?

1261
01:52:07,803 --> 01:52:09,964
Cease fire!

1262
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:12,799
Cease fire!

1263
01:52:31,694 --> 01:52:34,254
Tell your men to put down their arms.

1264
01:52:34,463 --> 01:52:36,954
I'm not going to negotiate
with a subordinate.

1265
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,868
You forgot to leave your gun.

1266
01:52:40,036 --> 01:52:43,563
- Give me that gun.
- Take your belt off.

1267
01:52:46,309 --> 01:52:49,676
I said I wouldn't negotiate
with a subordinate.

1268
01:52:49,845 --> 01:52:53,281
That's okay. This isn't a negotiation.

1269
01:52:54,183 --> 01:52:55,810
Comandante,

1270
01:52:56,118 --> 01:52:58,848
I give you my word of honor that
if you let us return to Havana,

1271
01:52:59,021 --> 01:53:01,285
we won't fire another shot.

1272
01:53:01,457 --> 01:53:03,755
I believe your word of honor.

1273
01:53:03,926 --> 01:53:08,226
But I can't let those bullets kill more
Cubans. Here or anywhere else.

1274
01:53:08,965 --> 01:53:12,799
You have 15 minutes
to convince your men to surrender.

1275
01:53:12,969 --> 01:53:17,338
If not, you will be responsible
for any bloodshed.

1276
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:26,571
Shit!

1277
01:53:30,252 --> 01:53:32,914
Send this box to Camilo in Yaguajay.

1278
01:53:33,089 --> 01:53:35,455
Aleida, come here.

1279
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:09,785
Call them on the telephone.

1280
01:54:11,727 --> 01:54:16,664
We agree to a ceasefire
to get our dead and wounded.

1281
01:54:23,606 --> 01:54:26,769
- I advise you to surrender.
- Over my dead body.

1282
01:54:28,277 --> 01:54:31,041
What's wrong with you?
Where are you going?

1283
01:54:36,652 --> 01:54:39,416
Your colonel wants you
to fight to the death.

1284
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:44,650
We don't want more Cubans to die.

1285
01:54:46,095 --> 01:54:48,120
Give up your weapons

1286
01:54:48,931 --> 01:54:50,922
and you will live.

1287
01:54:56,072 --> 01:54:57,835
Turn in your weapons!

1288
01:54:58,808 --> 01:55:00,298
Now!

1289
01:55:18,327 --> 01:55:19,760
Well...

1290
01:55:21,497 --> 01:55:23,590
The colonel and I

1291
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:28,236
are going on a special mission
to check our positions.

1292
01:55:29,672 --> 01:55:32,971
Keep up the resistance
until I return, is that clear?

1293
01:55:33,142 --> 01:55:35,133
Whatever you say, colonel.

1294
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:40,507
Shoot anyone who tries to leave.

1295
01:55:54,697 --> 01:55:56,028
Who is this?

1296
01:55:56,198 --> 01:55:59,065
That's Sánchez, the police captain.

1297
01:56:00,002 --> 01:56:02,664
We found torture instruments
in the station.

1298
01:56:09,478 --> 01:56:12,811
You know,
I have an idea to take the hotel.

1299
01:56:14,216 --> 01:56:15,740
Tell me.

1300
01:56:15,918 --> 01:56:17,476
Leave it to me.

1301
01:57:25,487 --> 01:57:28,422
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
We surrender!

1302
01:57:29,291 --> 01:57:31,088
Turn in your weapons!

1303
01:57:42,204 --> 01:57:44,001
Come on, hurry up!

1304
01:58:00,256 --> 01:58:04,215
Camilo took Yaguajay and he
and his troops are heading this way.

1305
01:58:05,227 --> 01:58:07,491
We just heard the news
on the shortwave.

1306
01:58:07,663 --> 01:58:10,223
It looks like Batista
abandoned the country.

1307
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:14,394
Yes, sir. Right now.

1308
01:58:20,743 --> 01:58:23,871
It's General Cantillo
calling from Havana.

1309
01:58:25,547 --> 01:58:27,105
Okay, leave.

1310
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:30,209
Yes, general?

1311
01:58:30,386 --> 01:58:35,688
<i>I'm negotiating
directly with the U.S. ambassador.</i>

1312
01:58:35,891 --> 01:58:40,521
<i>I'm in command of the army now,
acting on behalf of Fidel Castro.</i>

1313
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:45,030
<i>I authorize you to negotiate a truce,
but not to surrender.</i>

1314
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:48,499
<i>You can't surrender
under any circumstances.</i>

1315
01:58:49,471 --> 01:58:51,405
As you say, general.

1316
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,837
Captain.

1317
01:58:57,146 --> 01:58:58,875
I need to talk to Guevara.

1318
01:59:00,649 --> 01:59:05,086
<i>I've spoken to Fidel Castro. There's
been no deal with General Cantillo.</i>

1319
01:59:06,288 --> 01:59:09,519
This is a revolution, not a coup.

1320
01:59:09,692 --> 01:59:15,130
It's either unconditional surrender
or we'll take the garrison by force.

1321
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:18,061
And you'll be responsible
for the bloodshed.

1322
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:22,669
Be aware of the possibility that
the U.S. government will intervene

1323
01:59:22,838 --> 01:59:24,703
militarily in Cuba.

1324
01:59:24,907 --> 01:59:28,809
If that happens,
it would be an even bigger crime,

1325
01:59:29,311 --> 01:59:32,109
as you will be supporting
a foreign invasion.

1326
01:59:33,048 --> 01:59:35,175
In that case, your only
remaining option would be

1327
01:59:35,351 --> 01:59:38,684
for you to shoot yourself
for committing treason.

1328
01:59:39,755 --> 01:59:43,452
Mr. Guevara, I need to talk
with my superiors about that.

1329
01:59:46,595 --> 01:59:48,927
It's 19 minutes past 10.

1330
01:59:49,431 --> 01:59:54,494
At 11, I'll give the order to attack
using all our forces.

1331
02:00:08,484 --> 02:00:12,386
- Sir, may I return home to my family?
- No.

1332
02:00:12,554 --> 02:00:14,454
But we won the revolution already!

1333
02:00:14,623 --> 02:00:18,286
We only won the war,
the revolution begins now.

1334
02:00:24,466 --> 02:00:27,924
Get all your things,
we're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

1335
02:00:28,103 --> 02:00:29,900
Aleida. You too.

1336
02:00:30,072 --> 02:00:32,199
I'll need a guide.

1337
02:00:32,374 --> 02:00:36,105
- But I don't know Havana very well.
- Neither do I.

1338
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:43,308
- This man wants to say hello to you.
- Thanks for all you've done for Cuba.

1339
02:00:43,485 --> 02:00:47,615
Not me, all of them. All of them.

1340
02:00:50,692 --> 02:00:54,355
Get ready.
We're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

1341
02:01:04,873 --> 02:01:07,706
He told me he was heading to Havana
to participate in a military junta

1342
02:01:07,876 --> 02:01:11,039
which was going to resolve
the problems of the Cuban people.

1343
02:01:11,213 --> 02:01:15,274
I told him murderers like him weren't
going to resolve anything anymore.

1344
02:01:15,784 --> 02:01:17,445
When I told him
I was bringing him to you,

1345
02:01:17,619 --> 02:01:19,780
he pissed in his pants.

1346
02:01:19,955 --> 02:01:22,719
He begged me
to take him to another chief.

1347
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:24,887
What do you want me
to do with this guy?

1348
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:29,360
Keep him as a prisoner of war.
He will be judged by a tribunal.

1349
02:01:29,965 --> 02:01:32,661
Comandante, place him
under special watch.

1350
02:01:32,835 --> 02:01:34,325
Sure.

1351
02:01:37,206 --> 02:01:39,674
- Son of a bitch.
- Bandit.

1352
02:01:40,342 --> 02:01:41,866
I can't see anything,
then I turn around

1353
02:01:42,044 --> 02:01:46,310
and I see Roberto in the jeep,
holding the grenade

1354
02:01:46,482 --> 02:01:48,416
with the pin still in it.

1355
02:01:48,584 --> 02:01:49,642
You're kidding.

1356
02:01:49,818 --> 02:01:53,151
So he's looking at me, smiling,
like I'm stupid.

1357
02:01:53,322 --> 02:01:56,189
But when he came out of the jeep,
I swear to you,

1358
02:01:56,358 --> 02:01:58,155
he stood up,
acting like a tough guy,

1359
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:01,921
still holding the grenade in his hand,
just like this, boy.

1360
02:02:02,097 --> 02:02:05,498
He could barely walk because
his knees were shaking so hard,

1361
02:02:05,667 --> 02:02:10,366
and suddenly his eyes went up,

1362
02:02:10,539 --> 02:02:15,272
and then he fainted with the grenade
in his hand with the pin still in it.

1363
02:02:16,678 --> 02:02:18,305
Good one.

1364
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:27,552
Who has a light?

1365
02:02:27,789 --> 02:02:29,654
Not me.

1366
02:02:33,529 --> 02:02:35,394
Hey, this was mine!

1367
02:02:40,002 --> 02:02:42,527
- Gentlemen.
- So, then?

1368
02:02:42,704 --> 02:02:45,605
I'm going to the capital.
Thanks for everything.

1369
02:02:45,807 --> 02:02:48,469
- See you in Havana.
- Of course.

1370
02:02:49,545 --> 02:02:50,807
Ernesto.

1371
02:03:00,656 --> 02:03:03,352
- Take care.
- Yes, Che.

1372
02:03:03,525 --> 02:03:05,686
Don't worry, my man.

1373
02:03:06,895 --> 02:03:09,830
Ultimately,
what we can say is that the revolution

1374
02:03:09,998 --> 02:03:11,260
has moments of complete madness.

1375
02:03:12,935 --> 02:03:15,335
The attack, for instance...

1376
02:03:15,504 --> 02:03:18,632
The attack, for instance,
against the Moncada Garrison,

1377
02:03:18,807 --> 02:03:21,173
the expedition of the Granma.

1378
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:27,305
The continuous struggle
of the small group of men

1379
02:03:27,482 --> 02:03:29,006
that were left from that exp...

1380
02:03:33,088 --> 02:03:37,684
The resistance against
those last attacks by the dictatorship

1381
02:03:37,859 --> 02:03:40,191
in the Sierra Maestra.

1382
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:44,530
The invasion of Las Villas.

1383
02:03:46,435 --> 02:03:50,303
The taking of the key cities in Cuba.

1384
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,037
If you analyze each one of those things,

1385
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:03,145
you come to the conclusion
that there was craziness involved.

1386
02:04:07,222 --> 02:04:08,746
So, then?

1387
02:04:09,391 --> 02:04:11,120
Are you coming with us?

1388
02:04:12,461 --> 02:04:15,294
Yes. Under one condition.

1389
02:04:15,464 --> 02:04:16,692
Which?

1390
02:04:16,865 --> 02:04:18,833
When we're done in Cuba,

1391
02:04:19,001 --> 02:04:22,061
you let me bring the revolution
to all Latin America.

1392
02:04:23,505 --> 02:04:26,099
You, too, are a little crazy.

1393
02:04:32,114 --> 02:04:34,309
It's a thing that I haven't seen
anybody doing.

1394
02:04:34,483 --> 02:04:37,475
The rice is the most important thing,
if you take...

1395
02:04:39,621 --> 02:04:43,921
Comandante,
do you need my services tonight?

1396
02:04:45,327 --> 02:04:48,091
Son, you're killing me.

1397
02:04:48,263 --> 02:04:51,755
Did I make you angry
with what I said the other night?

1398
02:04:51,933 --> 02:04:55,596
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I was thinking.

1399
02:04:57,506 --> 02:05:01,909
No, son, you are loved,
as they say in Cuba.

1400
02:05:02,077 --> 02:05:04,773
- Thank you, Comandante.
- Do what you need to do.

1401
02:05:04,946 --> 02:05:06,470
Good night.

1402
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:11,000
<i>How does it feel to be a symbol?</i>

1403
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:14,885
<i>- A symbol of what?
- A symbol of the revolution.</i>

1404
02:05:14,926 --> 02:05:17,000
<i>There is one thing I can tell you.</i>

1405
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:20,728
<i>We were very aware
that we represented the hopes</i>

1406
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:23,000
<i>of an unredeemed America.</i>

1407
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:31,000
<i>And all eyes, those of the oppressors
and those of the oppressed,</i>

1408
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:33,268
<i>were fixed upon us.</i>

1409
02:05:33,842 --> 02:05:38,750
<i>In January of 1959, how old were you?</i>

1410
02:05:39,248 --> 02:05:41,682
<i>I was 30 years old.</i>

1411
02:05:47,723 --> 02:05:49,918
See you in Havana!

1412
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:51,759
It's Rogelio.

1413
02:05:51,927 --> 02:05:53,554
Tell him to stop.

1414
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:56,593
- What?
- Rogelio.

1415
02:05:56,798 --> 02:05:58,095
Yes, tell him to stop.

1416
02:06:01,770 --> 02:06:04,034
What are you doing with that car?

1417
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:05,706
I'm driving it to Havana.

1418
02:06:05,874 --> 02:06:07,466
Who gave you authorization?

1419
02:06:07,976 --> 02:06:11,776
I took it. It belonged
to one of the snipers, man.

1420
02:06:11,947 --> 02:06:13,812
Don't "man" me, Rogelio.

1421
02:06:13,982 --> 02:06:18,043
Even if it was Batista's,
this car isn't yours.

1422
02:06:19,421 --> 02:06:23,118
Go back to Santa Clara immediately
and give it back.

1423
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:28,627
And then you will go to Havana
by bus, by jeep or on foot.

1424
02:06:29,231 --> 02:06:32,291
I'd rather walk than drive to Havana
in a stolen car. Let's go.

1425
02:06:56,525 --> 02:06:58,356
Unbelievable

1426
02:06:58,525 --> 02:08:58,356
Please rate it
