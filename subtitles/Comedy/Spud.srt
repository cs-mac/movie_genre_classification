1
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,783
 I'm awake. </ i>

2
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,947
FIRST SEMESTER

3
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,034
I'd been feeling bad. </ i>

4
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,159
 My heart beats like a bongo drum. </ i>

5
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:01,864
 Dad tries to beat neighbor </ i>
 dog to death with insecticide. </ i>

6
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,197
 Mother do not think it is a good idea. </ i>

7
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,121
 Maybe it's not so </ i>
 bad to go to boarding school. </ i>

8
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,572
 I had hoped, </ i>
 that we would fit. </ i>

9
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:36,411
 But it feels like, </ i>
 the circus has come to town. </ i>

10
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:49,456
He is a real little cricket star
and has received a scholarship.

11
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:54,411
And he sings like an angel.
Is not that right, honey?

12
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,743
- Choirmaster.
- I like choirboys.

13
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,742
Look here!

14
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,824
That's fine, what?

15
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:18,036
 My new home. It smells like </ i>
 foot odor and floor polish. </ i>

16
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,867
Calm down!

17
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,617
 I'll never fit. </ i>

18
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,916
 I am after all not the only one. </ i>

19
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,916
There are many blacks here.

20
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,909
Quiet, please.

21
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:51,916
Good morning, boys and your parents.
I am president ...

22
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:56,949
 - Rector. Nicknames "Glock". </ I>
 - My name is mr. Glockenspheel. </ I>

23
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:04,198
 - It is not something to laugh at. </ i>
 - I love you so much! </ i>

24
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,371
Lie never be anything.

25
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,163
Even the Queen must
damn once a day.

26
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,868
Goodbye, darling!
I will miss you.

27
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,450
 Tomorrow it begins. </ i>

28
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:40,823
 Perhaps I die during the night, </ i>
 and get rid of it. </ i>

29
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,700
Turn off the light!

30
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,624
Mother?

31
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,450
What have we here? It looks like
one silkworms with eating disorder.

32
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,366
It looks like a potato,
a small spud! </ i>

33
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,037
 Everybody has a nickname. </ i>

34
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,620
My is Spud. My dick is small, </ i>
 and my nuts are not dropped. </ i>

35
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,075
 If I have to survive here, </ i>
 I have become friends with the other. </ i>

36
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:12,208
 Especially with Robert Black - "Rambo", </ i>
 dormitory self-proclaimed king. </ i>

37
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,412
 He gangs in every sentence-</ i>

38
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,368
 - and demands to be </ i>
 respected and honored. </ i>

39
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:26,116
 I have become friends with Rambos </ i>
 gang, for example, Charlie Hooper ... </ i>

40
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:34,159
 ... "The mad dog". His hobby </ i>
 is destruction and death. </ i>

41
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:41,155
 Or should I be sports star </ i>
 as Simon Brown - "Simon Brown". </ i>

42
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,913
 Or I can get my hands on a lot </ i>
 prohibited girlie-</ i>

43
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,913
 - as Al Greenstein - "barrel". </ i>

44
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:54,040
 He is a sexgalning, </ i>
 which I think is a good thing. </ i>

45
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,700
 Or should I beat </ i>
 school farting record. </ i>

46
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,906
 held by </ i>
 Sidney Sibeko-Scott - "Cool". </ i>

47
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,823
 Thanks for Henry Barker </ i>
 - "Gekko". </ i>

48
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,621
 Vern Blackadder - "Rain Man". </ i>
 Otherwise, they bullied me. </ i>

49
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,742
 My new home is like a war zone. </ i>

50
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,368
I'd been an uncomfortable feeling </ i>
 that soon it's my turn. </ i>

51
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:02,411
 - All calls us "The crazy eight". </ i>
 - What's going on here?! </ i>

52
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,250
Who started it?

53
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,120
- What's your name?
- John Milton.

54
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,326
- John Milton, sir!
- John Milton, sir.

55
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,329
U d with language.

56
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,864
I really do not know.

57
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,915
As you will ...

58
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:48,451
From now on, all
your privileges revoked.

59
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:54,583
Next time I'm not so indulgent.
Go with him to the doctor.

60
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,449
It was not your fault.

61
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:11,994
 It was not good to be seen with </ i>
 Gekko, the school's most stupid guy. </ i>

62
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,874
It's a madhouse.

63
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:25,407
There is always someone who is
after you or mock you.

64
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,537
Do not you think Milton?

65
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,825
This better be serious.

66
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,575
Thank you, Milton.

67
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,242
DIE NOT HERE
IT SHOULD I DO IN HOLIDAY

68
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,663
Check them right there!

69
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,121
I do not recall,
to have invited you, Spud.

70
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,998
He could not tear it off for so
he had tweezers and magnifying glass.

71
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:37,124
- Even if he had a map.
- Balls feel lonely.

72
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:49,448
 It is not fair. </ i>
 Even Gekko has got hair on. </ i>

73
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,538
 I wonder when I can </ i>
 begin to tear it off? </ i>

74
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,324
 - I wonder how suicide feels? </ i>
 - This is my seven tenders: </ i>

75
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,578
 - Mr. Wilson, our teacher. </ i>
 - 1 I must obey the authorities. </ I>

76
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:16,491
 - "rib." </ i>
 - 2 You must not behave indecently. </ I>

77
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,496
 Rambo told that a lion bed </ i>
 half of his shoulder by. </ i>

78
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,906
 doctors had to use a </ i>
 ribs to make it. </ i>

79
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:34,283
5th I do not play with yourself
or with each other.

80
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:40,242
- 6 I can not play darts.
 - There is no dart boards. </ i>

81
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,072
7th Consider not even
To do this ...

82
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:47,580
You must not jump into the water at night.

83
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,618
 school starts. I have no idea </ i>
 where things are. </ i>

84
00:11:54,625 --> 00:12:00,040
 I become terrified when </ i>
 call. I do not know what to do. </ I>

85
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,199
 I felt a lump in my throat, </ i>
 and was about to start crying. </ i>

86
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,281
 - PJ Luthuli, our teacher. </ I>
 - Do not run here. </ i>

87
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,539
 This is the first time I've been </ i>
 orders from a black man. </ i>

88
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,447
- I'm lost.
- This road.

89
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:22,490
 Dad would have reconsidered, </ i>
 the wallet was still there. </ i>

90
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,040
Good God.

91
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,452
Oh horror, oh horror!

92
00:12:54,625 --> 00:13:00,575
The heart can not understand it ...
you are quite dumb ...

93
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,579
Let the trumpets speak!

94
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:08,582
These vocal messengers-

95
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,831
- Of blood and death!

96
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,950
With me, study the literature.

97
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,993
Not the anemic nonsense-

98
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,575
- A self-absorbed literary gay.
Example 1:

99
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,662
Henry James.

100
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:39,498
Example 2:
Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie.

101
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:45,037
Frustrated and sex-mad lesbians
with underarm hair.

102
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:53,950
Not get me wrong, boys.
I have nothing against lesbians.

103
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,080
I would personally
give them a swing.

104
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:03,992
 Mr. Edly - "Head". He is as </ i>
 mad as my family, maybe more. </ i>

105
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:10,283
Either way, I get to
teach you smelly suri cat

106
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,576
- How to become men.
You will learn about women and sex.

107
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:25,034
If I do it well, you become the
kind of men that you envy-

108
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:30,867
- And the kind of men
that women can not resist.

109
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,326
 Literature is my favorite. </ i>

110
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,289
 Just Head teaches me to score girls </ i>
 as mrs. Wilson, rib wife. </ I>

111
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,915
 nickname "Eve" </ i>
 since Eve came from Adam's rib. </ i>

112
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:55,041
 I got almost goosebumps. </ i>
 I was about to pee in my pants! </ i>

113
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,073
- Yes, Robert?
- You lost your pencil.

114
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:20,908
 Thursday is movie night. Today, </ i>
 "Pretty Woman" with Julia Roberts. </ i>

115
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,496
 She plays a sexy prostitute. </ i>

116
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:30,658
 After school, I would drive around and </ i>
 look for prostitutes. </ i>

117
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,287
You can watch the movie later.

118
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,743
 President F. W. de Klerk </ i>
 opened parliament-</ i>

119
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,873
 - with what is described </ i>
, an epoch-making speech. </ i>

120
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:56,032
Among other things, increased ban </ i>
 against African National Congress. </ i>

121
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,871
 Father says that the ANC's communists. </ i>
 I'm terrified of them. </ i>

122
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:08,828
 government has decided </ i>
 to release mr. Mandela. </ I>

123
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,958
 I wonder if </ i>
 Mandela was a Spud? </ i>

124
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,705
There goes the country!

125
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,538
 Pike, the school bully. </ i>

126
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,867
 P. J. Luthuli is my new idol. </ I>

127
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,286
 I suddenly bad </ i>
 guilty about being white. </ i>

128
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,909
 My quest for sporting success </ i>
 do not go so well. </ i>

129
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:57,866
Your defense game is just as
through the hole like a whore panties.

130
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:14,822
In the worst players,
I have been unfortunate enough to train.

131
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:21,993
I have a greater chance of being
pregnant than being cricketers.

132
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,913
It's time for lunch,
so get with you.

133
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,406
Rain Man and Spud,
rode my bed.

134
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:41,575
Spud, do you want all at school
must think you're a sissy?

135
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,367
It did not expect to.

136
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,822
And therefore I with a mission.

137
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:57,536
It becomes dangerous.
It gets crazy.

138
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,870
We can be kicked out of school.
We may even die.

139
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:10,492
Who is on a prohibited
completely mad dip?

140
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,870
I will not.

141
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:26,490
But Gekko,
there must be no witnesses.

142
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,579
One for all, all for one.

143
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:33,330
- Spud?
- No witnesses.

144
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,324
Spud!

145
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,743
Wait!

146
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,707
We did it!

147
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,951
Guys! Where's Cool?

148
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,408
Guys ...

149
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,663
Try to get him free.

150
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,325
Good grief! We get kicked out.

151
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:37,660
Shut up! We will not be thrown out.

152
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:41,455
Do not be such a sissy.

153
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,495
 Rambo saved the day. </ i>

154
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:45,531
 He said that Fede was stuck because </ i>
 he would visit the Holy Spirit. </ i>

155
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,325
It's a miracle!

156
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:11,285
- Well done.
- Establishing!

157
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,073
I know exactly
what I had last night.

158
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:32,617
What do you think? We were sleeping.
Ask anyone of us.

159
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:40,205
Okay? Is it true Milton?

160
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,950
A boy was close to death!

161
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:51,706
Train in a dip, or did not you?

162
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,993
Six strokes for each of you,
when I come back after the weekend.

163
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,115
Take care,
I will think of you.

164
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:12,114
Super ... Thank you, Spud.

165
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,663
 The 158 km long trip home </ i>
 felt infinite </ i>

166
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,117
 - and fattened breath smelled of fish. </ i>

167
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,871
 did nothing, </ i>
 I was on my way home. </ i>

168
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:46,663
Get into the car. Your father is gone
mad. I kill him.

169
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,200
 Mother not exaggerating. Dad has built </ i>
 our house into a bunker. </ i>

170
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:02,035
Open the gate!
What is this all about?!

171
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,699
Marge and Denise from book club will
by! How do they come in?

172
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:11,535
- Remove barbed wire!
- So are we vulnerable to attack!

173
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,413
- From who?!
- Communists!

174
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,659
 Maybe the school is not so bad. </ i>

175
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:30,416
 Dad was mad. He says that </ i>
 we will live in poverty. </ i>

176
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:35,949
 He fired Innocence. </ i>
 He thinks she is a terrorist. </ i>

177
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,493
 Is it really to live in poverty? </ i>

178
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,457
 And then I saw her. </ i>

179
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:13,822
 - There for a lightning bolt through my body. </ i>
 - This is Marge's daughter, Debbie. </ i>

180
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,824
 She said a single word, which almost </ i>
 knocked me over with its beauty. </ i>

181
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,492
I promised Debs,
that she could swim in your pool.

182
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,250
Jump in, Johnny, it's hot.

183
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,742
 I'm in love with a mermaid. </ i>

184
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,826
- I'm really sorry.
- Forget it!

185
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,074
Next!

186
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,198
Think about what you love most,
so overcomes you pain.

187
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,328
Next!

188
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,624
Bend forward.

189
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,783
Jacket.

190
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,374
It's going to hurt.

191
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,117
 Kiss me, John. </ i>

192
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:40,541
If we is </ i> destined to die, it is
enough to constitute a loss to the country

193
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:46,742
And if life's undes, the fewer men,
the greater part of the credit

194
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,784
We few, we happy few, we brothers all

195
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,155
For he who today share his blood with
me shall be my brother

196
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,742
Would you repeat that, sir?

197
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,328
Come on, Johnny!

198
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:14,155
That's my boy!

199
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,489
Do not play smart.

200
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,949
Two rim if you gramser,
five if you take her on breast-

201
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:52,207
- And ten, if you touch her
the most holy place.

202
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:57,745
- It costs five to be with.
- I'm with.

203
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:58,833
I save the worst for last ... </ i>
Stand up, Milton.

204
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,074
This young man is a good example
on what women crave.

205
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:12,991
He is the only one of you fools-

206
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:17,076
- Who has scored more
than 50% of the job.

207
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,995
You can sit down.

208
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,039
I had to write about influence
in modern literature.

209
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:28,365
Is this it </ i> best you baboons
For the?

210
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:36,989
Dumped. Not one of you came in.
the greatest influence of all.

211
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,905
If it were not for sex, adultery-

212
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:46,245
- Fornication, korpulering and knalderi-

213
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:50,497
- There would never have been
written a single book.

214
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:58,203
- But what about the Bible?
- Good question.

215
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,617
Milton! Bible ...

216
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,030
Clean or sexy?

217
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:15,700
Grandma says that it is full of sodomy
and incest, and should be banned for children.

218
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,332
Exactly!

219
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,205
Well, I puberty monkeys.
 Auf Wiedersehen! </ i>

220
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,992
- John ...
- Yes, sir?

221
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,871
Welcome to Paradise Lost.

222
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:37,869
Your grandmother sounds to be
an interesting slut.

223
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:44,326
Yes, sir. She is potty. She calls
me David, and we call her Wombat.

224
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,490
My whole family
is actually quite crazy.

225
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,871
So I have the perfect book for you.

226
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:56,115
It is not really a book,
it's a play.

227
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,655
It's called "The absurd drama".

228
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:06,576
- Thank you, sir.
- Do not thank me, just read it!

229
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,914
So can you tell us what you think.
I think it is fantastic.

230
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:15,872
- Get out now, there is lunch.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:30,078
 I hoped that the play would </ i>
 act on how scores. </ i>

232
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:34,615
 But it is about two tramps, </ i>
 living in a ditch. </ i>

233
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,075
 They are waiting for a man, </ i>
 named Godot. </ i>

234
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:43,161
 But he never arrived. </ i>
 It's creepy strange. </ i>

235
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:59,373
SCHOOL game becomes "OLIVER
TWIST. "TEST TOMORROW

236
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:31,744
 This is it. </ i>
 Robert de Niro, beware! </ i>

237
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:48,781
- Are you satisfied, John?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,579
You can call me "Marion".

239
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:58,327
Who is the
happiest old idiot in the world?

240
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:12,657
- Now you have no more wine!
- Last glasses, I promise.

241
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:21,243
Relax, you're stiff as a stick.
Drink a little wine.

242
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:25,622
- I have not.
- Nonsense. What do you think?

243
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,242
- About what?
- Drama.

244
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,534
I do not know.

245
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,583
Oh, Johnno ...

246
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,120
I guess I do not have to yell at you?
Tell Just.

247
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,739
- Nothing happens.
- Exactly.

248
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,200
It's like life.

249
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:07,787
We are waiting for something to happen,
but it does not.

250
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:13,707
And what are we waiting for?
God? The meaning of life?

251
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,790
Death?

252
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:25,284
Perhaps we are waiting to become adults.

253
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,662
But it will never be.

254
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:33,655
Wise words, young man.
Let's drink to it.

255
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:42,115
Why is it absurd?
The sound normal.

256
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:48,909
We are sitting here surrounded
of a kind of fantasy world.

257
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:55,200
The actual absurd is that most
not seem to notice it.

258
00:38:55,417 --> 00:39:02,368
- The school is the most absurd world.
- And I've taught here for 27 years.

259
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:07,828
An absurd vagrant in a ditch ...

260
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,530
... The wayside.

261
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:24,038
My mother believes that God's greatest gift
to humanity's freedom of choice.

262
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,697
It is not something
one should take lightly.

263
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:41,113
This is undoubtedly
the best book that is written.

264
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:46,407
It is proof
that God indeed exists.

265
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:50,618
These are strong words
from a devout atheist.

266
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,413
To be </ i> or not,
this is the case.

267
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:05,281
Is it a nobler mind that withstands
the wild fate arrows shot ...

268
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,493
John ... You must display home now.

269
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,530
Arrows Target ...

270
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:19,037
- What is it, honey?
- An end, we sincerely may desire.

271
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,824
Pathetic! Next!

272
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:53,247
- Well, Milton, what would you sing?
- Amazing Grace.

273
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:12,659
Thank you! Next!

274
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,491
Thank you, Milton.

275
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:04,866
 I feel just like Hobbit </ i>
 - small and lonely. </ i>

276
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,950
 Just less hairy. </ i>

277
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:23,454
HOLIDAY

278
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:32,583
 holidays. All that before made me </ i>
 happy does not mean anything anymore. </ i>

279
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:37,456
 I needed a plan, </ i>
 but could not find anything. </ i>

280
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:43,158
 Innocence is back. </ i>
 She pulled father in law. </ i>

281
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:46,617
- I told you.
 - Now she sits in power. </ i>

282
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:50,451
Ask them there.

283
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:59,198
 Wombat to eat lunch with us. </ i>
 Father says she is a part of satan. </ i>

284
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,242
She is a part of satan!

285
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:11,371
It's eleven.
You can not be there all day.

286
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:16,119
Have not you got yourself some friends,
you can invite over?

287
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:21,157
I ask Debbie,
if she wants to and baths.

288
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,324
Hey.

289
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,447
 Was it really wise to let </ i>
 mermaid meet my family? </ i>

290
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,830
Get now not busted bitch thick.

291
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:07,416
David is such a pretty boy.
Thank God he looks like not his father.

292
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:11,538
I do not understand,
why you married him.

293
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,575
He looks like scrambled eggs in the face.

294
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,287
What are you doing?

295
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:28,366
 I was sure that the mermaid </ i>
 would never see us again. </ i>

296
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,458
What is it that is so funny?

297
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:43,371
 I talked about school </ i>
 and the crazy eight. </ i>

298
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:48,373
 She laughed really very </ i>

299
00:44:55,083 --> 00:45:01,329
 I just had to kiss her. So </ i>
 I could tell the others. </ i>

300
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,493
 Now it's confirmed. </ i>
 Spud Milton has no balls. </ i>

301
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,324
SECOND SEMESTER

302
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,614
 must change to. </ i>

303
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:18,826
 This semester, </ i>
 where Spud Milton enters into character. </ i>

304
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:38,201
 I had to give Gekko a </ i>
 gift. It is a tradition at the school. </ I>

305
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,698
 I helped </ i>
 making fun of barrel. </ i>

306
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:24,911
 I joined </ i>
 African company. </ i>

307
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:38,041
I'm embarrassed to be white. After
school I will be freedom fighter.

308
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:44,249
Do not be silly. When you have gone out
of school, the battle ended long ago.

309
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:49,157
Thank you, Milton.
We need more of your casting.

310
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,742
 I think I prefer black now. </ i>

311
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:57,247
 Dad would probably call me </ i>
 a damn communist. </ i>

312
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,284
 I will sing again. </ i>

313
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,119
 Although music teacher </ i>
 has written new songs. </ i>

314
00:47:56,417 --> 00:48:02,788
The role of Oliver Twist
be played by John Milton.

315
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,742
Congratulations.

316
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:37,072
Spud, the boys and I just
to congratulate you ... birthday.

317
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:51,497
 I was born 14 years ago. </ i>
 in minutes. </ i>

318
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:58,332
 it was my mother who had </ i>
 endure the pain and the bright light. </ i>

319
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,704
 Now it at least over. </ i>

320
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,870
Are you okay?

321
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:22,998
I am going to run with tight
reins tighter than nun pussy.

322
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:26,371
This is not
a piece of cotton wool school theater.

323
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:31,202
This paragraph should be as well,
that it can be carried anywhere.

324
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:57,000
I require creativity!

325
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,412
Try it, Milton.

326
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,075
Yes, exactly!

327
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:17,911
 - It did not start too well. </ i>
 - Stop, stop, stop! </ i>

328
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,242
 Mr. Richardson - "Viking". </ I>

329
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:28,368
 Last year he had a heart attack </ i>
 in "Pirates of Penzance". </ i>

330
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:34,158
 chief plays Fagin. But he fills </ i>
 his hip flask with real whiskey. </ i>

331
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:38,205
 Eva plays the prostitutes Nancy. </ i>

332
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:42,581
Everyone hopes that she will be dressed
out </ i> like a real whore. </ i>

333
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,743
 Gekko was assistant ... </ i>

334
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,197
 He is probably the infirmary </ i>
 rest of their lives. </ i>

335
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:54,864
 Glock player Sykes, psychopath. </ i>

336
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,905
 Talk about the right for the role. </ i>

337
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:05,865
- Are you okay?
- I just play.

338
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:08,495
Very convincing.

339
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:32,908
- If you say anything, I'll kill you.
- About what?

340
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,783
 Rugby Season. </ i>

341
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,468
 I wonder if "Oliver Twist" </ i>
 get the same response? </ i>

342
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:18,701
 Not like the response to my team. </ i>

343
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:25,538
 But it may be that coach </ i>
 is mr. Lilly, visual arts teacher. </ I>

344
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,787
 He does not believe in tackles. </ i>

345
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:32,740
Much better! More pressure from the rear.

346
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,082
They have arrived!

347
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:27,665
I'll probably all say hello
girls from St. Catherine welcome.

348
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,825
Quiet! - Amanda.

349
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:37,665
Amanda plays Beth.
- John Milton plays Oliver.

350
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,620
 Amanda Lawrence, </ i>
 too beautiful to have a nickname. </ i>

351
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:52,327
 I am totally scared of her. </ i>

352
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:59,241
I know your dirty little minds,
and I do not accept it.

353
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:03,827
Neither flirting, gramseri, petting,
kissing or worse.

354
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,789
- It is the best book I have read.
- Wonderful!

355
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:18,661
What book! More exciting
than a bed full of blondes.

356
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:30,624
- I would ask for another book ...
- I've gotten a monster loose!

357
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:36,578
- "Prophecies" of Nostradamus.
- I know who wrote it.

358
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:42,947
What is this all about? You try well
not to impress private school chick?

359
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:47,243
I saw how you looked at her.

360
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:52,159
I can not let worse.

361
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:57,369
If she read such nonsense,
Do you try to avoid her.

362
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:03,658
If you do not smoke in bed with at least
half, it is too slack of you.

363
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:09,000
- I can not.
- Why not?

364
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:14,124
I'm just a spud. </ I>

365
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:24,781
You must show everyone that you have
down, not is </ i> the only thing that counts.

366
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:37,452
I know a book
that can get you on the right track.

367
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:46,905
This one does matter.

368
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:56,040
- What's it about?
- To give a shit about what others think.

369
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:01,574
People make a choice,
and shit on the consequences.

370
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:09,371
What did I tell you about the wine?

371
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:13,580
It is best that you go now.

372
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,658
Milton ...

373
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:25,455
I was also called Spud at school.

374
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:31,906
But it took me probably not harm?

375
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,540
Hello?

376
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:23,155
 Johnny, is that you? </ i>

377
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:29,995
- Hello.
- Johnny! How are you?

378
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,530
Slip, Spud, I should call.

379
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,412
Johnny?

380
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:05,082
- Have you read?
- Nostradamus is a deluded fool.

381
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:12,197
Why are you called Spud?

382
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:16,581
Does it have anything
with a potato to do?

383
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:21,081
- I have to move.
- Come on, it's us now.

384
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,870
Just vote is not in transition!

385
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:16,409
 No one knows what is wrong. </ i>
 I hope it's over with Spud. </ i>

386
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:32,826
- Four sneeze is like an orgasm.
- Hopefully an orgasm better.

387
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,666
 Gekko's actually pretty cool. </ i>

388
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:44,869
 He has had 42 diseases, </ i>
 six of which are completely unknown. </ i>

389
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,701
 And he takes </ i>
 12 different kinds of medicine. </ i>

390
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:09,365
 To my beloved spud. </ i>
 Come to recover. </ i>

391
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:13,414
 I miss you. Love you. Amanda. </ I>

392
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:31,824
You ... we can well make it clear
she loves you.

393
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:37,827
- Do you believe it?
- Imagine if you score Amanda!

394
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:41,739
 spud is to Tyr. </ i>

395
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:09,989
Spud ...

396
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:13,405
When you sing ...

397
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:18,072
It's as if ...

398
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:25,332
I do not know.
It may sound weird ... </ i>

399
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:31,573
It is as if,
I so know that God might exist.

400
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:56,240
- It's just a cold.
- The voice is not in transition?

401
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,322
He has a long way to go.

402
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:16,699
Hey.

403
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:24,702
- How are you?
- Fine.

404
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:44,907
Once again from the beginning
with a hair dryer and the terminal?

405
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:14,909
She signed with the "love".

406
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:19,619
This does not always the same.
Girls often say "love".

407
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:26,118
"I love the dress, I love
Tom Cruise! I love Bananarama! "

408
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:32,665
- Forget the girls. Who comes first!
- Where are we going?

409
01:04:55,792 --> 01:05:01,708
The view of hell ... </ i> is the
best place to view the school from.

410
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,948
THIRD SEMESTER
(Simpleton PERIOD)

411
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:24,786
 Apparently I am not the only one </ i>
 which is being kulret. </ i>

412
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:31,032
 barrel traded Thursday film </ i>
 out with lesbian porn. </ i>

413
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:41,993
Vern was caught stealing everyone's </ i> 414 undies.
Rambo was crazy. </ I> 01:05:43,750 -> 01:05:48,790

414
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:53,897
 Obese came out for an accident </ i>
 when he would beat his fart record. </ i>

415
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,120
 Gekko was attacked </ i>
 of a rare parasite. </ i>

416
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:07,621
 The Mad Dog says, </ i>
 that he got it from fattened farts. </ i>

417
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:11,143
 Everyone knows that Rambo and Eve </ i>
 have something going. </ i>

418
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:14,496
 Apart from poor rib. </ i>

419
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:18,364
 Pike continues to ravage. </ i>

420
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:29,117
 I could not stop </ i>
 to dream. </ i>

421
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,284
 I'm going crazy! </ i>

422
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:47,791
The big question is:
Which one would you fuck?

423
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,072
I can not fuck any of them.

424
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:56,036
- I'm a spud.
- I know what to do.

425
01:06:56,042 --> 01:07:02,447
Gekko thinks he knows everything about women,
</ i> without ever having received a kiss! </ i>

426
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:08,788
So I should ignore Amanda,
be really part against her-

427
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,037
- And flirting uninhibited with Christine?

428
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:19,908
- Christine's pretty creepy.
- You must win Amanda's respect.

429
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:08,955
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Christine ...

430
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:21,704
See you, honey.

431
01:08:37,917 --> 01:08:41,830
 Why are you so arrogant? </ i>

432
01:08:42,042 --> 01:08:45,580
 You're not who I thought you were. </ i>
 Amanda. </ i>

433
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:52,787
She hates me! And I flirt
with one, I do not know.

434
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,040
I'm the girl incredible that as the
only one has been kind to me.

435
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:03,916
Make it something that I take Christine?
I think she likes me.

436
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:09,708
We have already gramset below the stage.
Is it okay?

437
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:14,616
- Of course, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

438
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,322
- What are you on holiday?
- Nothing. And you?

439
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:26,535
I should be with
my boyfriend - Christine.

440
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:30,447
We need to Mozambique.

441
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,989
- For Christine ...
- Yes?

442
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:38,706
- It's nothing.
- Check out these malaria tablets.

443
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:45,823
I never take a pill again.
My new medicine is love.

444
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:50,665
Where are you going?

445
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,537
Sir?

446
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,369
Sir!

447
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:20,030
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Excuse me for interrupting.

448
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:26,075
- So do it.
- I need your help.

449
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:28,874
What is it about?

450
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:33,530
- Are you all right?
- Excellently.

451
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:39,449
- Where is mrs. Edly?
- She kept me out longer.

452
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,866
What do you want?

453
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:49,205
It is about the book ...

454
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:53,789
- It is strange and gives no </ i> answers.
- Just like life.

455
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,910
I have problems with some girls.

456
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:03,579
I do not know what to do.

457
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:13,656
You need to get some advice about women from a
man whose wife just left him.

458
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:18,873
Honesty, sincerity, honesty ...
Avoid it at all costs.

459
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:24,783
Lie as often as you can.
If you are lucky, so will you.

460
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,165
If you do not make it,
you can always mad-

461
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,291
- And develop a drinking problem.

462
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,665
 It's worse than expected. </ i>
 I look like complete a sheep! </ i>

463
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:36,122
 We've got a new family </ i>
 - Blacky. </ i>

464
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:40,030
- Who is going to feed it?!
- Me.

465
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:44,118
And I give it just what I want!

466
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:55,540
 Innocence is in trouble again. </ i>
 father took her from selling booze. </ i>

467
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:02,707
 But when he discovered that he </ i>
 could earn 50 cents per bottle </ i>

468
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:06,530
 - he decided </ i>
 that he, after all, like black. </ i>

469
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:10,704
 mermaid come to visit. </ i>

470
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:15,990
 Her breasts have grown. </ i>
 They are huge! </ i>

471
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,540
You have a good pair of melons.
Use them wisely.

472
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:46,956
 We went for a walk in the park </ i>
 and she touched me with her breasts. </ i>

473
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,537
 My dick felt weird. </ i>

474
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,989
- What is it?
- A mood ring.

475
01:13:56,208 --> 01:14:01,657
Do you think we get married and have children
and things like that together?

476
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,572
 Girls! The sure path to madness. </ I>

477
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:21,331
 Therefore, Blacky with father </ i>
 vet and have removed the buns. </ i>

478
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:27,287
 Like me </ i>
 - either boy or man. </ i>

479
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:32,076
 last semester and life sailing. </ i>

480
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:39,452
 - The boss is not the same. </ i>
 - Not now, Milton. </ i>

481
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,867
 Eva has made it over with Rambo. </ i>

482
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:54,121
 Rain Man is Pike's new punching bag. </ i>

483
01:14:55,833 --> 01:15:00,247
 Gekko discovered that Christine had </ i>
 lavished with Smith, Greg Anderson </ i>

484
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:04,155
 - Scott Emberton </ i>
 and half of the rugby team. </ i>

485
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:09,499
Hey.

486
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,784
I'm sorry about Christine ... </ i>

487
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:19,621
Someone said that she and
with the gramset on you.

488
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:28,539
Shall we go up the hill and see
how many snakes we can find?

489
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:18,205
Look what I bought in Mozambique.

490
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:28,117
I bought this for you.

491
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:33,407
It is abelort.
It is crazy rare.

492
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:36,537
Thank you, Gekko.

493
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,411
Gekko?

494
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:10,414
- Is he okay?
- We must have him over to the doctor.

495
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:24,489
Good God ... Get him in here, quick!

496
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:42,457
- Where is Gekko?
- We had to drive him to the hospital.

497
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:48,530
- Is he okay?
- He has malaria.

498
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,698
 It's very serious. </ i>

499
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,366
I'm scared.

500
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,245
What are you talking about?
You'll be back in a week.

501
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:32,241
In addition, planning Rambo
a new swimming.

502
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:36,622
You do not always have to do
as Rambo says.

503
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:40,781
That does not mean everything in the world
to impress him.

504
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:48,739
Can not you sing something for me?

505
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:04,745
Sir, I just want to talk with you
on our task: </ i>

506
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:08,030
Another time, Milton.

507
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:14,325
I just wanted to say that Dickens ...

508
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:24,658
... Is a boring old fart,
which is unable to write.

509
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:29,244
His books can not even
used as toilet paper.

510
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:34,790
Listen right here! It is one of the finest
works from the Victorian era.

511
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,117
There was obviously
not much of the time.

512
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:44,158
Be careful, or I'll force you to
read Enid Blyton high public!

513
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:59,995
I have been a terrible
stiff sticks, have not I?

514
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:08,246
Women! You can not live with them, and
you can not send them to Zimbabwe.

515
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,787
Lunch.

516
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:28,915
- Why drink you?
- It keeps the wolves away.

517
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:33,122
I just get upset,
when I drink.

518
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:38,202
The more you drink, the more sad
you become. So you drink even more.

519
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:43,328
- It is a paradox.
- You're right in.

520
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:52,328
- Shoe polish. Eat, and you get a tier.
- Come on, Fatty!

521
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,288
- Never.
- Do not be a chicken.

522
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:11,833
Spud, imitate an animal.

523
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:19,200
- I do not want to.
- "I do not want to."

524
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:33,450
Stop it!

525
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:49,989
Milton! Come with me.

526
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:25,037
Gekko has passed away.
He died half an hour ago.

527
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:34,032
Doctors fought,
but he was too ill.

528
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,657
Andrews?

529
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,698
Ascott?

530
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,657
Bains?

531
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,661
Barker?

532
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:16,908
Barker?

533
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,958
Gekko?

534
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:02,791
Death, be not proud.

535
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:26,245
You'll get over it eventually.

536
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,868
And it makes you stronger.

537
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:40,954
With time.

538
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,287
In the meantime ...

539
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,915
Keep reading.

540
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:57,870
A book never die from one.

541
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:20,040
PREMIERE

542
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:16,953
 For all the new </ i>
 and the opportunities it brings. </ i>

543
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:50,666
 Milton, are you there? </ i>

544
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:03,665
May I?

545
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,616
I will </ i> have to go.

546
01:30:25,542 --> 01:30:27,783
That's my boy!

547
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:31,537
Where is the wig?

548
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:02,537
Bravo!

549
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:23,957
That's my boy! An Oscar winner!

550
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:28,581
- Who were you?
- Oliver.

551
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:38,287
- Johnny, you were fantastic!
- You look beautiful.

552
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:52,871
- What is it?
- Nothing.

553
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:59,329
We gotta go. I promised Marge,
that Debbie would be home before nine.

554
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:03,706
- When I see you again?
- Soon.

555
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:08,208
It was beautiful!

556
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,496
Who was it?

557
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,573
No. Just an ex-boyfriend.

558
01:35:21,792 --> 01:35:25,159
She still likes you.

559
01:35:28,417 --> 01:35:32,365
You were pretty good.

560
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:34,995
Really?

561
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:40,697
We slip.

562
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:52,955
Kiss me, sir Spud.

563
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:57,700
But what about what you said?

564
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:06,370
It does not matter.

565
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,369
Wait!

566
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,665
I can not.

567
01:36:24,917 --> 01:36:27,454
I'm sorry ...

568
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,958
What is it, Johnny?

569
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:52,121
Should I not show you
around the school?

570
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:55,291
We gotta go.

571
01:36:56,292 --> 01:36:59,580
I think we can
be late tonight.

572
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:34,158
Come here!

573
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,745
He's back!

574
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:08,995
Well done!

575
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:15,790
The slut was hot!

576
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:19,121
She was hot!

577
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:33,243
You know what I </ i> think?

578
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:35,908
A swim!

579
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,538
CLOSURE

580
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:09,539
I'd been kept me away from the hill, </ i>
 since Gekko dead. </ i>

581
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:13,322
 last chance to </ i>
 take a look at the valley. </ i>

582
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:17,114
 An opportunity to see and remember. </ i>

583
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:26,159
I had forgotten how beautiful it is here.
</ i> Everything is so vibrant and colorful. </ i>

584
01:40:28,042 --> 01:40:30,579
 I can see the manager's house. </ i>

585
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:35,991
 I remember that he said that </ i>
 God's greatest gift is freedom of choice. </ i>

586
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:44,955
 But in some cases </ i>
 God gives us no choice. </ i>

587
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:49,115
 He shares the cards out, </ i>
 and we play the hand. </ i>
