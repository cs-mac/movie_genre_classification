1
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,936
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:33,499
You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.

3
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,862
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:39,383
You know, kiddo.

5
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:47,223
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:53,621
to know that there's nothing sadistic
in my actions.

7
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:59,222
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,582
But not you.

9
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:07,105
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:17,142
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

11
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:18,899
Bill.

12
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,140
It's your baby.

13
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,022
Coming!

14
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,700
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

15
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,187
What you gonna do now?
What you got?

16
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,464
I got your ass!
Remember that? Remember?

17
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,738
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

18
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:54,503
Come on.
Bring it on.

19
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,816
Mommy, I'm home.

20
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,386
Hey, baby.

21
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,264
How was school?

22
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:41,856
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

23
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,501
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his little ass

24
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,942
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

25
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,416
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

26
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,702
Baby, now,
you can't come in here.

27
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:57,099
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

28
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:05,502
This is an old friend of Mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

29
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,339
Hi, honey.

30
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:10,419
I'm...
What's your name?

31
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:16,017
Her name is Nikki.

32
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,745
Nikki.

33
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:21,339
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

34
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,465
How old are you, Nikki?

35
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,103
Nikki... asked you
a question.

36
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,059
I'm 4.

37
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,024
4 years old?

38
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:40,744
You know,
I had a little girl once.

39
00:08:41,307 --> 00:08:43,741
She'd be about 4 now.

40
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:49,306
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend

41
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,423
got some grown-up talk
to talk about.

42
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:52,701
You go in your room.

43
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:55,620
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

44
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,538
Okay?

45
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,181
Nikkia!

46
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:03,304
In your room.
Now.

47
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,978
You want some coffee?

48
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,696
Yeah. Sure.

49
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,940
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name
is Jeanne Bell.</i>

50
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,587
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

51
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,135
<i>But back when we were acquainted,
four years ago,</i>

52
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,218
<i>her name was Vernita Green.</i>

53
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:39,060
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

54
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:40,739
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

55
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,579
Do you have a towel?

56
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,225
Yeah.

57
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,295
Thanks.

58
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,218
You still take cream
and sugar, right?

59
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,342
Yeah.

60
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,941
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology?

61
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,824
You suppose correctly.

62
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,467
Look, bitch, I need to know

63
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:05,220
if you're gonna start any more shit
around my baby girl.

64
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,537
You can relax for now.

65
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:12,016
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

66
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:14,456
That's being more rational

67
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,697
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

68
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:20,860
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

69
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,903
Not rationality.

70
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,736
Look.

71
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,022
I know I fucked you over.

72
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:32,222
I fucked you over bad.

73
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,901
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

74
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,498
You have every right
to want to get even.

75
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,896
No, no, no, no, no.

76
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,215
No.

77
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,822
To get even, even Stephen,

78
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:50,823
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

79
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,467
then wait for your husband,
the good Dr. Bell, to come home,

80
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:54,980
and kill him.

81
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,942
That would be even, Vernita.

82
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,018
That'd be about square.

83
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,144
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

84
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,058
But I can't.

85
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,820
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.

86
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,546
Oh, great.

87
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:12,697
I don't care.

88
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,618
Be that as it may,

89
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,585
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

90
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:21,580
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

91
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:25,899
Bitch, you can stop right there.

92
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:28,338
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

93
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:29,701
before the eyes of your daughter

94
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:32,142
does not mean that parading her
in front of me

95
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,900
is gonna inspire sympathy.

96
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:38,263
You and I have
unfinished business.

97
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,178
And not a goddamn thing
you've done

98
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,700
in the subsequent four years,

99
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:45,780
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

100
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,062
So when do we do this?

101
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,183
It all depends.

102
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,827
When do you want to die?

103
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,626
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,026
How about tonight, bitch?

105
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,098
Splendid.
Where?

106
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,496
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League

107
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,418
about a mile from here.

108
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,418
We meet there around 2.30
in the morning,

109
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:10,420
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

110
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,021
And we have us a knife fight.

111
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,143
We won't be bothered.

112
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:19,903
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

113
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,296
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

114
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:31,820
with an edged weapon.

115
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:34,102
Fuck you, bitch.

116
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,303
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

117
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:40,266
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass,
Black Mamba.

118
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:42,584
Black Mamba.

119
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,386
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

120
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:46,582
Weapon of choice?

121
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,227
If you want to stick with
your butcher knife, that's fine.

122
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,903
Very funny, bitch.

123
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,019
Very funny!

124
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:53,537
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

125
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:57,542
For that, I'm sorry.

126
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,625
But you can take my word for it.

127
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,260
Your mother had it coming.

128
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:26,695
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...

129
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,938
I'll be waiting.

130
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:38,136
For those regarded as warriors...

131
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,584
When engaged in combat...

132
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:45,986
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

133
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:53,661
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

134
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:04,137
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

135
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:15,779
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

136
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,702
Come on out to Dallas.

137
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:45,462
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

138
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,503
And next, we got some record.

139
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:51,102
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

140
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:29,183
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

141
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:31,735
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

142
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:37,066
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

143
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,940
Give me a figure.

144
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:42,063
Nine dead bodies.

145
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,502
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

146
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,385
Bride. Groom.

147
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,105
Reverend.

148
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,098
Reverend's wife.

149
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:55,142
They even shot that old coloured fella
that plays the organ.

150
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:58,142
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union

151
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,536
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

152
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:08,376
Good gravy, Marie.

153
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,061
What'd I tell you, Pop?

154
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,139
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

155
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:21,060
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

156
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,139
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.

157
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:28,347
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

158
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:33,137
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

159
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,695
Four, maybe five strong.

160
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,345
How can you tell?

161
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:41,056
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

162
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:44,467
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

163
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,505
This is the work of a salty dog.

164
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,545
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

165
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:53,903
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

166
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:57,104
all the colours are kept
inside the lines.

167
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:01,499
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

168
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,298
Who's the bride?

169
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,376
Don't know.

170
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,423
The name
on the marriage certificate

171
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:20,419
is Arlene Machiavelli.

172
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:22,225
That's a fake.

173
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:25,219
We've been calling her "The Bride"
on account of the dress.

174
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,105
You can tell she was pregnant.

175
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,825
Man would have to be a mad dog

176
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:33,695
to shoot a goddamn good-Iooking gal
like that in the head.

177
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,218
Look at her.

178
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,381
Hay-coloured hair.

179
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,423
Big eyes.

180
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,661
She's a little blood-spattered angel.

181
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,660
Son Number One?

182
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:52,862
Yeah?

183
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:57,498
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

184
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,104
I might never have liked you.

185
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:33,023
Point in fact, I despise you.

186
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:38,498
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

187
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:44,304
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

188
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,140
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

189
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:51,186
My gift to you.

190
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:58,855
For fuck's sake.

191
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,302
Hello, Bill.

192
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,858
What's her condition?

193
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:09,017
Comatose.

194
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,220
Where is she?

195
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:14,424
I'm standing over her right now.

196
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,498
That's my girl.

197
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:21,700
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

198
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:22,902
What?

199
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:24,466
We owe her better than that.

200
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:26,219
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

201
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,865
Will you keep your voice down?

202
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,744
You don't owe her shit!

203
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,818
May I say one thing?

204
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,625
Speak.

205
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,664
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

206
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,738
But you didn't kill her.

207
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:40,385
And I put a bullet in her head.

208
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:43,743
But her heart
just kept on beating.

209
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:45,055
Now, you saw that yourself

210
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:49,823
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

211
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:54,143
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

212
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:58,379
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

213
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:01,185
But one thing we won't do

214
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:05,624
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

215
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:09,302
and kill her in her sleep.

216
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,060
And the reason
we won't do that thing

217
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:16,937
is because that thing
would lower us.

218
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:20,060
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

219
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,295
I guess.

220
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,776
Do you really have to guess?

221
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:26,737
No.

222
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:29,660
I don't really have to guess.

223
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,703
I know.

224
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,982
Come on home, honey.

225
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,217
Affirmative.

226
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,503
I love you very much.

227
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,055
I love you, too.

228
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:47,098
Bye-bye.

229
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,943
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

230
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:05,907
Word of advice, shithead.

231
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:09,024
Don't you ever wake up.

232
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:48,781
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

233
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,939
Bill, it's your baby.

234
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:54,703
Oh, my baby.

235
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:21,581
Four years.

236
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,498
Four years.

237
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,781
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

238
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,459
You getting your freak on
or what?

239
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,822
Oh, yeah, boy.

240
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,623
20, 40, 60, 75.

241
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,267
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

242
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,257
Rule number one.

243
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:08,382
No punching her.

244
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,105
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

245
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:11,859
or less some teeth, jig's up.

246
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,336
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

247
00:27:14,427 --> 00:27:16,019
By the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

248
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:17,586
It's a motor-reflex thing.

249
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,339
But spit or no, no punching.

250
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,385
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

251
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:25,584
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No hickeys.

252
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,056
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

253
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,457
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

254
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,340
Her plumbing down there
don't work.

255
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:34,940
Feel free to come in her
all you want.

256
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:36,540
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

257
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:38,424
I'll be back in 20.

258
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:40,780
Yeah.

259
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,619
Oh, shit.

260
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,858
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

261
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:47,780
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

262
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,177
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

263
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,416
Bon appétit, good buddy.

264
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,183
Oh, yeah.

265
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:08,536
Oh, God damn.

266
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:12,222
You are the best-Iooking girl
I've had today.

267
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,420
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

268
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,065
Coming in, ready or not.

269
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:05,503
Hey, buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?

270
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:37,506
Where's Bill?

271
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:40,100
Where's Bill?

272
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,455
Please stop hitting me.

273
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,503
Where's Bill?

274
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:46,660
I don't know who Bill is!

275
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:48,146
Bullshit!

276
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:59,421
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

277
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,544
Jane Doe? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

278
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:04,265
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

279
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:08,659
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

280
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,940
Your name is Buck.

281
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:15,426
Right?

282
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:18,746
And you came here to fuck.

283
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:20,055
Right?

284
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,024
Wait a minute.
Wait.

285
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,424
"Pussy Wagon."

286
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:50,259
You fucker.

287
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:19,220
Texas. Okay.

288
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:03,185
Wiggle your big toe.

289
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,661
Wiggle your big toe.

290
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,615
Wiggle your big toe.

291
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:27,466
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,425
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:35,702
<i>As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,</i>

294
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:38,142
<i>trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...</i>

295
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,945
Wiggle your big toe.

296
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:43,656
<i>I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.</i>

297
00:33:43,747 --> 00:33:46,819
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

298
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:53,743
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.</i>

299
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:56,945
<i>When fortune smiles
on something</i>

300
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,461
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

301
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:03,142
<i>it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,</i>

302
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,297
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

303
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:07,901
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,</i>

304
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:09,739
<i>the first name
on my death list,</i>

305
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:13,706
<i>O- Ren Ishii, was the easiest to find.</i>

306
00:34:13,787 --> 00:34:16,017
<i>But when one
manages the difficult task</i>

307
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:18,621
<i>of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

308
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:22,143
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?</i>

309
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:37,937
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base</i>

310
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,257
<i>in Tokyo, Japan.</i>

311
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,623
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American army brat</i>

312
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,063
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.</i>

313
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:48,978
<i>It was at that age
she witnessed</i>

314
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,785
<i>the death of her parents
at the hands</i>

315
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:56,385
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

316
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,746
Mommy.

317
00:39:11,507 --> 00:39:13,623
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

318
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:19,418
<i>Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto
was a paedophile.</i>

319
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:24,865
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

320
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:30,740
Look at me, Matsumoto...

321
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:35,737
...take a good look at my face.

322
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,822
Look at my eyes.

323
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,783
Look at my mouth.

324
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:47,217
Do I look familiar?

325
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:51,744
Do I look like somebody...

326
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:54,102
you murdered?!

327
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:09,184
<i>By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.</i>

328
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:56,381
<i>At 25, she did her part
in the killing</i>

329
00:41:56,467 --> 00:42:01,587
<i>of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,</i>

330
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:05,706
<i>in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.</i>

331
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:13,057
<i>But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.</i>

332
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,615
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

333
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:20,383
<i>However, before satisfaction
would be mine,</i>

334
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,503
<i>first things first.</i>

335
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:25,385
Wiggle your big toe.

336
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:34,342
Hard part's over.

337
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:38,022
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

338
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,137
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

339
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:15,422
Okinawa.
One-way.

340
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:42,616
Hi.

341
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:45,062
Welcome...

342
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,104
Welcome.

343
00:43:51,907 --> 00:43:53,659
You English?

344
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:55,942
Almost.
American.

345
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:58,666
American.
Welcome, American.

346
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:00,935
Domo.

347
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:03,746
My English very good.

348
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:06,864
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

349
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:07,902
No, no.

350
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:10,945
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

351
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,382
May I sit at the bar?

352
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,743
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

353
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:22,345
What other words did you learn?

354
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,145
Oh, just a minute.

355
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:28,698
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

356
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm watching my soap operas.

357
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,784
Lazy bastard...

358
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:37,224
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

359
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,458
The tea's hot.
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

360
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:41,866
Shut up!

361
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:44,586
Get your ass out here!

362
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,783
Excuse me.

363
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:51,745
What other Japanese do you know?

364
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:53,943
Oh, let's see.

365
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:54,937
"Arigato."

366
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:57,382
"Arigato."
Good!

367
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,505
I already said "domo," right?

368
00:45:01,587 --> 00:45:03,657
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:05,783
"Konn-itch-iwa."

370
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,424
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

371
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,099
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.

372
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:11,336
Konnichi wa.

373
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:14,180
Perfect.
Good, good, good.

374
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,861
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

375
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,346
Now you're making fun of me!

376
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,146
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

377
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:24,264
Pronunciation very good.

378
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:29,546
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

379
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:35,425
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

380
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:38,502
You should learn Japanese.

381
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:40,100
Very easy.

382
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:42,462
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

383
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,583
Most difficult.

384
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,739
But you have Japanese tongue.

385
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,300
Okay, okay.

386
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:57,137
Oh, my God.

387
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:03,824
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?!
Hurry up... goddammit!

388
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:11,297
Lazy oaf...

389
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:17,698
What d'ya want?

390
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:20,062
I beg your pardon?

391
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,738
Drink.

392
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:26,456
Oh, yes.
A bottle of warm sake, please.

393
00:46:26,547 --> 00:46:28,185
Warm sake?

394
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:30,064
Very good!

395
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:31,785
One warm sake!

396
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:34,506
Sake? In the middle of the day?

397
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:39,221
Day, night, afternoon
Who gives a damn Get the sake!

398
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:42,105
How come I always have to get the sake?

399
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:43,620
You listen well...

400
00:46:44,187 --> 00:46:47,020
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

401
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,779
If this were the military,

402
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:52,303
I'd be General by now!

403
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:55,060
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

404
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:58,742
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

405
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:01,580
and you'd still get the sake -

406
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,703
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake!

407
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,015
Do you understand?

408
00:47:05,107 --> 00:47:06,506
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

409
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:08,418
Do you understand me?

410
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:13,503
Sorry.

411
00:47:16,707 --> 00:47:18,777
First time in Japan?

412
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:22,267
What brings you to Okinawa?

413
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:24,542
I came to see a man.

414
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:27,061
Oh, yeah.

415
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,820
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

416
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:31,420
Not quite.

417
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:33,338
Not friend?

418
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:34,542
I never met him.

419
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:36,219
Never?

420
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:38,343
Who is he?

421
00:47:38,427 --> 00:47:40,497
May I ask?

422
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:43,536
Hattori Hanzo.

423
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:58,504
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

424
00:47:59,187 --> 00:48:02,065
I need Japanese steel.

425
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:07,304
Why do you need Japanese steel?

426
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:11,540
I have vermin to kill.

427
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:19,939
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

428
00:48:22,427 --> 00:48:24,338
Huge.

429
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:49,865
May I?

430
00:49:50,427 --> 00:49:52,065
You may.

431
00:49:54,827 --> 00:49:56,260
Wait.

432
00:49:56,347 --> 00:49:58,736
Try the second one down.

433
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,384
Funny.

434
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:54,698
You like samurai swords.

435
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:59,100
I like baseball.

436
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:09,341
I wanted to show you these.

437
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:10,782
However...

438
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,258
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

439
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:21,140
I no longer make instruments of death.

440
00:51:22,187 --> 00:51:23,825
What I have here...

441
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:30,185
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

442
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:34,696
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

443
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:43,103
...I have retired.

444
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:52,458
Then give me one of these.

445
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:55,744
These are not for sale.

446
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:58,582
I didn't say "sell me."

447
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,056
I said "give me."

448
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:05,339
Why should I help you?

449
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:10,660
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

450
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,898
And considering the student,

451
00:52:15,987 --> 00:52:20,856
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

452
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:16,545
You can sleep here.

453
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,266
It will take me a month...

454
00:53:22,507 --> 00:53:23,906
...to make the sword.

455
00:53:24,987 --> 00:53:27,057
I suggest you spend it practicing.

456
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:54,697
I've completed doing...

457
00:54:56,387 --> 00:55:00,096
<i>...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,</i>

458
00:55:01,867 --> 00:55:05,780
to never do again.

459
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:10,945
I have created "something that kills people."

460
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:18,856
And in that purpose, I was a success.

461
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:23,818
I've done this because philosophically,

462
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:30,223
I am sympathetic to your aim.

463
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:38,579
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

464
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,984
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

465
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:46,264
God will be cut.

466
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,102
Yellow-haired warrior...

467
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:02,818
Go.

468
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:04,704
Domo.

469
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:28,822
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

470
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:30,784
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

471
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:32,858
<i>financially
and philosophically in her</i>

472
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:34,983
<i>Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle</i>

473
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,546
<i>with the other yakuza clans</i>

474
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:40,336
<i>over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.</i>

475
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,817
<i>When the final sword
was sheathed,</i>

476
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:46,786
<i>it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse,</i>

477
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:51,019
<i>the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

478
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,544
<i>The pretty lady to O-Ren's right,</i>

479
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:57,141
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

480
00:56:57,227 --> 00:57:00,902
<i>is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

481
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:05,105
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale,</i>

482
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:09,066
<i>another former protge of Bill's.</i>

483
00:57:10,547 --> 00:57:12,742
<i>The young girl in the school-girl uniform</i>

484
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:17,855
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

485
00:57:17,947 --> 00:57:21,303
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

486
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:23,662
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

487
00:57:23,747 --> 00:57:25,977
Do you like Ferraris?

488
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:31,702
Ferrari... Italian trash.

489
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:42,105
Do you want to screw me?

490
00:57:43,787 --> 00:57:46,984
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

491
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,066
Yes.

492
00:57:52,987 --> 00:57:54,545
How 'bout now, big boy?

493
00:57:55,587 --> 00:57:58,226
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

494
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:01,907
...or is it I...

495
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:03,659
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

496
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:06,743
<i>See what I mean?</i>

497
00:58:08,227 --> 00:58:12,425
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

498
00:58:12,507 --> 00:58:16,819
<i>the head general of O-Ren's personal army,
the Crazy 88.</i>

499
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:20,697
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

500
00:58:20,787 --> 00:58:24,666
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

501
00:58:24,747 --> 00:58:30,982
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.</i>

502
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:33,740
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

503
00:58:33,827 --> 00:58:36,341
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

504
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:40,978
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

505
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:43,338
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

506
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:46,146
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

507
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:49,856
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...</i>

508
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,340
Boss Tanaka!

509
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,386
What's the meaning of this outburst?

510
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:57,820
This is a time for celebration!

511
00:58:58,427 --> 00:59:01,385
And what exactly are we celebrating?

512
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:04,457
The perversion of our illustrious council?

513
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:09,458
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

514
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:10,900
I will not tolerate this!

515
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:13,103
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

516
00:59:14,027 --> 00:59:19,465
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

517
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:26,065
My father...

518
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:29,705
...along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.

519
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:31,575
And while...

520
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:33,305
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

521
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:35,059
...they weep in the afterlife...

522
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:36,856
Shut up!

523
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,383
...over the perversion committed today!

524
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:42,577
Outrageous!

525
00:59:42,987 --> 00:59:44,978
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

526
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:46,261
Bastard!

527
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:48,386
Fuck face!

528
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:50,346
Gentlemen.

529
00:59:51,947 --> 00:59:57,943
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

530
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:03,140
By all means, allow him to express it.

531
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:08,419
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

532
01:00:09,387 --> 01:00:11,105
...which I love...

533
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,864
...more than my own children,

534
01:00:14,467 --> 01:00:18,938
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

535
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:45,061
So that you understand how serious I am...

536
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:47,263
...I'm going to say this in English.

537
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:04,296
As your leader, I encourage you
from time to time,

538
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:08,699
and always in a respectful manner,
to question my logic.

539
01:01:08,787 --> 01:01:09,822
If you're unconvinced

540
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:12,296
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

541
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:13,376
tell me so.

542
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:15,025
But allow me to convince you.

543
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:17,177
And I promise you,
right here and now,

544
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:20,577
no subject will ever be taboo.

545
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:24,660
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

546
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,858
The price you pay

547
01:01:27,947 --> 01:01:30,700
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

548
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:34,541
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

549
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:37,778
Just like this fucker here.

550
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:41,662
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

551
01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:46,263
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

552
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:49,786
I didn't think so.

553
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:55,342
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

554
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:57,499
One ticket to Tokyo, please.

555
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:27,821
Moshi moshi.

556
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:43,625
Gogo.

557
01:08:08,947 --> 01:08:10,858
Yeah!

558
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:56,103
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

559
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:57,506
They demand ridiculous things.

560
01:08:57,587 --> 01:08:59,259
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

561
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:00,780
What's gonna happen?

562
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,380
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

563
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:04,179
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

564
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,495
No, I don't want that.

565
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:52,500
Yes, it's me.

566
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:59,103
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

567
01:10:13,867 --> 01:10:16,506
Who do you remind me of?

568
01:10:17,787 --> 01:10:19,345
Charlie Brown!

569
01:10:20,587 --> 01:10:22,657
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

570
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:24,216
Charlie Brown.

571
01:10:24,427 --> 01:10:25,780
Four pepperoni pizzas.

572
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:27,261
That's not on our menu...

573
01:10:27,507 --> 01:10:29,975
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

574
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:33,467
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

575
01:10:34,787 --> 01:10:36,857
O-Ren Ishii!

576
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:40,818
You and I have unfinished business!

577
01:12:06,307 --> 01:12:09,105
Charlie Brown, beat it.

578
01:12:16,467 --> 01:12:17,422
Miki.

579
01:12:34,947 --> 01:12:36,300
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

580
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:08,660
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

581
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,659
Hi!

582
01:14:13,227 --> 01:14:14,626
Gogo, right?

583
01:14:15,747 --> 01:14:17,066
Bingo.

584
01:14:17,147 --> 01:14:19,103
And you're Black Mamba.

585
01:14:20,867 --> 01:14:24,223
Our reputations precede us.

586
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,065
Don't they?

587
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:34,138
Gogo, I know you feel
you must protect your mistress.

588
01:14:34,227 --> 01:14:36,297
But I beg you.

589
01:14:37,027 --> 01:14:38,824
Walk away.

590
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:46,865
You call that begging?

591
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,461
You can beg better than that.

592
01:18:01,587 --> 01:18:03,145
Is that what I think it is?

593
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:05,821
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

594
01:18:05,907 --> 01:18:12,938
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

595
01:18:13,987 --> 01:18:15,545
Silly rabbit.

596
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:16,980
Trix are for...

597
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,102
Kids.

598
01:24:30,987 --> 01:24:35,378
This is what you get for
fucking around with yakuzas!

599
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:38,140
Go home to your mother!

600
01:25:33,947 --> 01:25:36,507
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

601
01:25:36,587 --> 01:25:39,101
...take them with you!

602
01:25:40,907 --> 01:25:42,226
However...

603
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:47,255
...leave the limbs you've lost.

604
01:25:48,427 --> 01:25:51,305
They belong to me now.

605
01:25:55,787 --> 01:25:58,938
Except you, Sofie!

606
01:25:59,027 --> 01:26:02,736
You stay right where you are.

607
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:56,420
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

608
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:03,504
Where was it made?

609
01:27:03,587 --> 01:27:05,464
Okinawa.

610
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:10,742
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

611
01:27:10,827 --> 01:27:12,499
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

612
01:27:12,587 --> 01:27:14,259
YOU LIE!

613
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:28,545
Swords, however, never get tired.

614
01:27:30,107 --> 01:27:33,463
I hope you've saved your energy.

615
01:27:36,827 --> 01:27:38,146
If you haven't...

616
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:42,337
...you might not last five minutes.

617
01:27:44,067 --> 01:27:46,023
But as last looks go,

618
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:49,781
you could do worse.

619
01:30:21,107 --> 01:30:25,623
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

620
01:30:27,907 --> 01:30:31,024
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

621
01:30:33,707 --> 01:30:36,619
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

622
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:07,699
Attack me...

623
01:31:08,427 --> 01:31:09,860
...with everything you have.

624
01:32:02,227 --> 01:32:05,344
For ridiculing you earlier...

625
01:32:07,907 --> 01:32:09,818
...I apologize.

626
01:32:17,787 --> 01:32:19,539
Accepted.

627
01:32:35,187 --> 01:32:36,381
Ready?

628
01:32:40,907 --> 01:32:42,056
Come on.

629
01:33:13,787 --> 01:33:22,377
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

630
01:35:27,267 --> 01:35:29,144
My Sofie.

631
01:35:29,227 --> 01:35:31,457
I'm so sorry.

632
01:35:34,427 --> 01:35:37,783
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

633
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:39,664
No more of that.

634
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:41,465
But still...

635
01:35:41,547 --> 01:35:44,380
But still nothing.

636
01:35:45,587 --> 01:35:48,784
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

637
01:35:48,867 --> 01:35:52,223
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

638
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:55,460
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

639
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:58,505
The first reason is information.

640
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:01,267
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

641
01:36:01,267 --> 01:36:02,939
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

642
01:36:04,227 --> 01:36:08,345
But I am gonna ask you questions.

643
01:36:08,427 --> 01:36:12,181
And every time
you don't give me answers,

644
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,225
I'm gonna cut something off.

645
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:21,219
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!

646
01:36:21,307 --> 01:36:23,775
Give me your other arm!

647
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:30,857
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

648
01:36:30,947 --> 01:36:32,096
If you had to guess...

649
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:33,097
What they've been doing.

650
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:34,302
Why she left you alive...

651
01:36:34,387 --> 01:36:36,184
And where I can find them.

652
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:38,542
What would be your guess?

653
01:36:40,107 --> 01:36:42,780
Guessing won't be necessary.

654
01:36:42,867 --> 01:36:45,017
She informed me.

655
01:36:46,507 --> 01:36:50,978
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

656
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:52,861
As I said before,

657
01:36:52,947 --> 01:36:57,498
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life
for two reasons.

658
01:36:57,587 --> 01:37:02,661
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

659
01:37:02,747 --> 01:37:05,659
everything that happened
here tonight.

660
01:37:06,347 --> 01:37:09,703
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

661
01:37:09,787 --> 01:37:12,938
by witnessing
your deformed body.

662
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:17,179
I want you to tell him all
the information you just told me.

663
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:20,065
I want him to know what I know.

664
01:37:20,147 --> 01:37:24,265
I want him to know
I want him to know.

665
01:37:24,347 --> 01:37:26,497
And I want them all to know

666
01:37:26,587 --> 01:37:32,583
they'll all soon be as dead as O-Ren.

667
01:37:55,707 --> 01:38:00,258
Revenge is never a straight line.

668
01:38:03,107 --> 01:38:04,984
It's a forest.

669
01:38:05,867 --> 01:38:08,745
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

670
01:38:09,947 --> 01:38:12,939
to get lost... to forget where you came in.

671
01:38:16,067 --> 01:38:20,379
That woman deserves her revenge.

672
01:38:24,907 --> 01:38:29,105
And we deserve to die.

673
01:38:32,187 --> 01:38:36,100
She must suffer to her last breath.

674
01:38:48,427 --> 01:38:50,577
How did you find me?

675
01:38:51,387 --> 01:38:53,218
I'm the man.

676
01:38:56,707 --> 01:38:59,301
One more thing, Sofie.

677
01:39:00,107 --> 01:39:04,817
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
