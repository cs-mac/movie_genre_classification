1
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:06,641
Mum? Mum?

2
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,646
Mum?

3
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,284
Mum?

4
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,085
Mum?

5
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,130
Mum?

6
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,642
Mum? Mum?

7
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,205
Mum?

8
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:31,441
You all right?

9
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,410
I was just thinking about Poppy.

10
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,100
She was me only friend.

11
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:44,125
Aw, Mum. I'm your friend.

12
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:50,046
You're not a friend.
You're just a relative.

13
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:52,980
I'm 34 years old!

14
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,420
And I've found someone who likes me,
and I like him,

15
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,260
and I'm going on holiday with him.

16
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,923
You're running away

17
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,889
from your... guilt!

18
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,761
Don't do that with Poppy's lead, Mum.

19
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,180
<i>You've always had lovely hair, Tina.</i>

20
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:25,620
<i>It is quite thick, isn't it?</i>

21
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,060
<i>Yes.</i>

22
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:32,122
<i>I've always admired your hair
being thick, because mine's so thin.</i>

23
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:39,006
<i>I think you might have a few split ends.
Better watch that.</i>

24
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,580
- Any more bags you want taking?
- Well,

25
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:46,843
- I might want a couple more towels.
- No, not in there.

26
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,521
You didn't tell me
your mum was an artist.

27
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,540
What?

28
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,980
Look at these.

29
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,661
Chris, don't go in there.

30
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,741
Why not?
- Come out. Chris.

31
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:58,420
What's going on?

32
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,900
I'm just admiring
your artwork, Carol. It's fantastic.

33
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:03,020
I don't want anyone in my room.

34
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,740
Chris was just saying how talented
he thinks you are, Mum.

35
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,900
It's my private sanctum.
I don't want anybody looking.

36
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,420
Well, no one's looking
in your sanctum, Mum.

37
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,500
So I'll just... Shall I leave you, then,
to look at your brushes?

38
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:16,061
I'll just sit for a few minutes, yes.

39
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,420
- Okay.
- I could do with a cup of tea.

40
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,580
- I'll get you one, Mum.
- That'd be nice.

41
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,220
- I'm shutting the door now.
- That's okay.

42
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,660
Okay, Mum, bye.

44
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:28,525
Bye.

45
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,300
- All right?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,164
Good.

47
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,699
- I've always wanted a boy in my bed.
- Come on.

48
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,339
- Have you?
- Yeah. I was never allowed.

49
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,329
I've always wanted to be in this bed.

50
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,489
- This is Jonty.
- Oh, he's putting me off.

51
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,780
- I like this room.
- Do you?

52
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,962
- Mmm.
- I hate it.

53
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,286
Why?

54
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,220
Well, I like the bits.

55
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,661
Makes me think of you
when you were a kid.

56
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:07,221
At the same time, if it was
all destroyed, I'd be quite happy.

57
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,180
So what were you like
when you were a little kid, then?

58
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,820
- Unhappy.
- You didn't like school?

59
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:14,060
- I know, nor me.

60
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,540
What were you like at school, Chris?

61
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,340
I wasn't like anything.
I was, like, invisible.

62
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,980
<i>What about you being ginger?</i>

63
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,060
<i>Well, that's a problem, yeah.</i>

64
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,860
<i>That's not invisible, is it?</i>

65
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:27,566
<i>No, but I wanted to be.</i>

66
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,020
Oh, I don't think it's safe
going off with him.

67
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,860
It is safe!

68
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:37,620
I know about all kinds of people who've
had very bad experiences in caravans.

69
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,486
Like who?

70
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,339
Well, Louise.

71
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,420
<i>She fell out of it, didn't she?</i>

72
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,980
<i>Oh, I don't know. I mean, you've gone
far too fast with him far too soon.</i>

73
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,129
<i>You hardly know him.</i>

74
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,660
<i>You look like you...
you don't trust him.</i>

75
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:55,179
<i>I don't.</i>

76
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,165
<i>Just let him get on with it.</i>

77
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,299
Well, I'd like to know
what he's getting on with.

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,724
- Well, he's packing.
- How much of our stuff has he got?

79
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:07,682
Mum, he hasn't got any of your stuff.
Don't be silly.

80
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,260
<i>- All right, uh, toothbrush?
- Yeah.</i>

81
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,180
<i>- And a sponge?
- Yeah.</i>

82
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,329
- Umbrella?
- Yes.

83
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,741
- Uh, wash bag?
- Yes.

84
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:22,780
- What's that? What's that?
- Potpourri.

85
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,980
And what are you bringing that for?
We don't need potpourri.

86
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:28,340
I don't think I could cope
without potpourri, Chris.

87
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,699
You're gonna have a woman's touch
on this holiday, Chris.

88
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,261
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

89
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,781
Oh, Chris.
Don't look at my bum.

90
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,860
<i>- I'm not looking at your bum.
- You are.</i>

91
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,206
<i>- Just son' of loomed into my vision.</i>

92
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,045
Milady.

93
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,741
- Bye, Mum.
- You'll be back.

94
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,086
I will, Mum, in a week.

95
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,899
Okay, well, we'll see you then, Carol.

96
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,899
I'll bring her back safe,
don't you worry.

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,085
Hey, I understand
you collect snow globes.

98
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,561
I don't like you.

99
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,282
Okay, well, see you, then.

100
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,059
Show me your world, Chris.

101
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,139
Well, I thought we'd start
with Crich Tram Museum.

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,580
- Great.
- Murderer.

103
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,701
It was an accident, Mum.

104
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,564
So were you.

105
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,402
Don't listen to her.

106
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,726
<i>Ii For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night</i>

107
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,528
That's, uh, 32.99.

108
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,539
- Extra strong.
- How can you?

109
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,600
Ah, sharpens the mind.

110
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,049
Poppy loved mints.

111
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,688
- They gave her the runs.
- Mint me.

112
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,284
- Hold tight, please.

113
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,459
So, ladies and gentlemen,
this is, um,

114
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,060
one of about 1,200 tram cars
of this type, of type E1,

115
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,739
built, um, by London County Council

116
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,579
from about 1912 onwards.

117
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,161
Out of those 1,200 trams,
only two have survived.

118
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:37,620
You know, mobility,
the key to personal opportunity.

119
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,980
It's why I favour the Abbey Oxford
as a caravan.

120
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,684
So I'm the captain of me own fate.

121
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,045
Excuse me, you dropped your wrapper.

122
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,604
Your wrapper.

123
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:04,281
I said, you dropped your wrapper.

124
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,760
You see that? Do you see that?

125
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,739
You just
don't expect to see that, do you?

126
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,619
No. He was a pig, Chris.

127
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,220
He was a pig in clothes.
I don't want this to ruin our holiday.

128
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,741
You expect that of a kid
who doesn't know any better.

129
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,179
- But that's a bloody grown man.

130
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,859
He must be, what, 35,
something like that?

131
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,339
- Yeah, you don't expect it.
- Behaving like that in front of...

132
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,021
- He's setting an example to kids...
- I know, it's terrible.

133
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,341
And we're in a place where there's...
It's a bloody heritage place.

134
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:49,779
- I know. Shh. I know.
- I just cannot...

135
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,179
Maybe you'll feel better
if you have a scone.

136
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,580
- No. No.
- Do you want a scone?

137
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:55,341
No! They've not been preserved
for hundreds of years

138
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:57,100
- so that wankers like that...
- Shh. Shh.

139
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,221
...can use them like a bloody toilet!

140
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,980
<i>Tina Read
to the Visitor Information Centre.</i>

141
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,419
Stop telling me to shush.
It's putting me on edge.

142
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,648
<i>Miss Tina Read,
your mother's on the phone.</i>

143
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,661
I'm gonna have to go
and see what's wrong.

144
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,099
Yeah.

145
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,325
Wait here, won't you?

146
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy
the museum if you're in this state.

147
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,769
I'll have to come home, then.

148
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,899
Chris is up there, he's looking at me.
I don't...

149
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,021
Well, no! I'm gonna have...

150
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:51,514
Well, I'm gonna have to come back, Mum,
'cause I can't leave you in this state.

151
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,381
- Hey, what's up? Oh, come on, what's up?

152
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:06,762
Hey. What's happened?

153
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,379
- What'd she say?
We have to go home.

154
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,204
Why? What, because of her?

155
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,301
Blue John mines tomorrow. Pencil Museum.

156
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,406
I know how much you wanted to see that.

157
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,885
Got some vouchers as well.
Two-for-one restaurant deal.

158
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,609
They expire in a week.
It's now or never.

159
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:37,082
He just stepped out, Chris,
and it wasn't your fault.

160
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,539
Maybe you're right.

161
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,405
I just feel so
devastated for his family, you know?

162
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,499
- Maybe your mother was right.
- About what?

163
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
About everything!

164
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,859
About everything.

165
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,681
- Chris...
- He's ruined the Tram Museum for me now.

166
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:10,528
Mint me.

167
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,581
What?

168
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,646
You heard me. Mint me.

169
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,419
<i>"Dear Mum, I'm not coming home."</i>

170
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,299
<i>"Yorkshire is lovely.
Not like you said at all."</i>

171
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,139
<i>"They can smile,
and they do sell my pasta sauce."</i>

172
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,379
<i>"The caravan bed is quite short,
but Chris is a sensitive lover."</i>

173
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,165
<i>"Hope you can be happy for me.
Love, Tina."</i>

174
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,580
Right, well,
they've only got two spots left.

175
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:28,442
One by the Dingley Dell
and one by the bogs.

176
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,099
Um, he's going for Dingley Dell.

177
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,739
Chris, I want Dingley Dell.

178
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm gonna get this bloody Dingley Dell.

179
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,220
- Can't we go around it?
- Just hold on, I'm gonna do it.

180
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,939
- Go around them. Go around.
- We'll make it.

181
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,900
- Go that way.
- I will, just wait there, wait...

182
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,980
- Just go around it.
- Okay! Hold on.

183
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,459
Oh, Chris! Don't look at them, Chris.

184
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,925
Oh, I just...

185
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,525
Fuck you!

186
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,281
I am the best. Get in.

187
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,539
- Now, see that?
- Yes.

188
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,019
Plug that into that
little hole over there. Right?

189
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,842
Why?

190
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,006
You don't need to know why. Just do it.

191
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,080
- Okay?
- The little hole.

192
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,720
The little hole.

193
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,019
Turn it round so that fits
in that little bit there.

194
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,459
- That hole...
- No, I wanna do it.

195
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,841
- Okay.
- This is a ridiculous plug, this.

196
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,721
Never seen anything like it.

197
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,979
There we go.

198
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,921
- I did it.
- Brilliant.

199
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,527
I'll just sort that out.

200
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,540
Chris?

201
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,979
What?

202
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,059
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

203
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,120
Yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.

204
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,419
I didn't think it would kill him,
did you, Chris?

205
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,261
Well, there's loads of stuff
under a caravan that'll kill you.

206
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
I'll have nightmares
about that tonight now.

207
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,699
Oh, you're not gonna go under a caravan,
are you?

208
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,460
You're gonna be in the driving seat.

209
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,641
In the car, with me.

210
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,059
Well, not driving.
I mean, in the passenger seat.

211
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,404
I'll do the driving.

212
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,568
Bit of a mess, actually.

213
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,204
There we go, good as new.

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,285
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

215
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,648
There's no one sticking their nose in.

216
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,120
No one penetrating the mind.

217
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,760
I'll have to sort
all of this out all again.

218
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,800
Take the noble English oak,
Old Knobbley.

219
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,859
That won't stab you in the back
or belittle your five-year plan.

220
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,739
I mean, where am I supposed to put that?

221
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,339
- That tree won't...
- There isn't anywhere.

222
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,139
- There's just no surfaces.
- ...steal things that belong to you

223
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,779
and put them in another place
just to piss you off.

224
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,521
That tree won't involve itself
in low-level bullying

225
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,005
that means you have to leave work.

226
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,899
I've got a confession to make.

227
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,340
Chris. Not a wheat intolerance?

228
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:06,965
No. It's, uh, it's not just
an erotic odyssey we're on.

229
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,379
Isn't it?

230
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,940
Well, it is.
I mean, that's a big part of it, but...

231
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,980
Er, I'm writing a book.

232
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,459
- Are you?
- Yeah.

233
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,700
I thought I'd just have
a bit of a sabbatical.

234
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:21,299
You know, a bit of time off work
and, you know, find my voice.

235
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,619
But, uh, I've had a bit of a problem
with writer's block.

236
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,340
You know, been...
creative constipation.

237
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,059
I hooked up with you at Capoeira

238
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,939
and I realised you were exactly
what I needed. You know, a muse.

239
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,208
- Am I your muse?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,899
- Chris!
- How do you feel about that?

241
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,499
I've never been a muse before.

242
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,980
No? I've never had a muse before.
It's great. Yeah.

243
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:44,368
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

244
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,099
- What's the book about?

245
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:51,459
Just sort of making inroads into
my own mind and taking notes as I go.

246
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,099
Do you know what I mean? It's fantastic.

247
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,899
I'm really pleased with
what I've come up with so far.

248
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,099
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

249
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,540
Settled in?

250
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,019
Yeah, we have, thanks.
Yeah, lovely spot.

251
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,459
- Not bad, is it?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,579
Just doing my rounds.
Sorry about the racket.

253
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,419
- Yeah.
- Festival in the yurt field.

254
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,299
- Who are they?
- Uh, well, they're shaman.

255
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,699
They're sort of priests. Shamans.
They're from Portsmouth, you know.

256
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,579
- Uh-huh.
- It's just a little festival.

257
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Keeps them all happy, doesn't it?
You know.

258
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,899
And how long are they
gonna be drumming for?

259
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,288
Well, just this evening.

260
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,579
- Okay?
- Thanks a lot, mate.

261
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,819
- All the best.
- Yeah.

262
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,969
- Bye.
- Pleasure.

263
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,805
He seemed nice.

264
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,523
Yurts.

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,939
There's a stream
down here somewhere.

266
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,699
I need some proper boots, Chris.

267
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,459
Yeah,
brought my last girlfriend.

268
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,324
Oh.

269
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:05,289
Yeah, I think this was it.

270
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,320
This is a ditch, Chris.

271
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,379
I thought he said on the phone
we'd be at the Dingley Dell.

272
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,699
- I know, darling.
- We're right by the loo.

273
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,339
- Well, that'll be handy.
- Shall I take some light stuff, darling?

274
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,179
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Sterling Elite 90, isn't it?

275
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,044
Sorry?

276
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,685
Sterling Elite 90.

277
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,124
Yeah. Yes.

278
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,402
How'd you find it
on the petrol consumption?

279
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,459
Uh, not too bad, actually.

280
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,099
Takes her less fuel to pull
than some of the older models.

281
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,258
Yeah, you're probably right, yeah.
We use loads of petrol. Don't we, Tina?

282
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,178
Yeah, we love it.

283
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,939
Hey, do you mind if we have
a little look inside? Is that all right?

284
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,380
Um...

285
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,580
- I'll only be a second.
- A quick look wouldn't hurt.

286
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,579
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fine.

287
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,859
We really appreciate it.
Be fantastic to have a look in there.

288
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,739
Sorry, do you mind
just slipping those off?

289
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,464
- I saw you come out of the toilet block.
- Mmm-hmm.

290
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,539
It's beautiful in here.
It's just like a hospital.

291
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,605
- It's all oak.

292
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,339
What's this, then?

293
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,779
It's a stereo unit.
It's a bit delicate.

294
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,779
- Is it?
- It's German. German.

295
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,778
There's no buttons on it.

296
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,579
Well, it's voice-activated.
Don't... Sorry...

297
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,219
- Poppy.
- You all right, Banjo?

298
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,084
Are you in there?

299
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,499
- Tina?
- What?

300
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,444
Have you had all the Senokot?

301
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,765
- No.

302
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,539
- Hello.
- Hi. My name's Chalid Sulinan.

303
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,419
I work for CACSA,
raising money for child soldiers.

304
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,329
No.

305
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,339
- Aren't you naughty?

306
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,644
Okay. I have got some...

307
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,968
Poppy. Come on!

308
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,779
She's... She's like that.
Come on! Yeah!

309
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,681
You're distracting me now, Poppy.
Go on.

310
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,647
Oh, my God! Tina!

311
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,887
Poppy.

312
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,578
Do you mind not opening that one?
Sorry, do you mind not opening that one?

313
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,444
God... No!

314
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,568
We don't give him junk food!

315
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,058
Poor boy.

316
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,379
- Cheap crisps are full of horrors.
- I know.

317
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,539
It'll be nice when you've
decorated it a bit, this place.

318
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,779
Oh, well, we don't like clutter.

319
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,460
No, no, no, you don't want clutter.

320
00:22:55,461 --> 00:23:01,099
You just want some plants and cushions
and pictures and a tablecloth there.

321
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,365
Yeah, well, that would be clutter,
though, wouldn't it?

322
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,019
I'm really sorry about that.

323
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,818
Sorry, sorry.
That's really embarrassing.

324
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,884
- Never mind.
- Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

325
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,248
It's fine.

326
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:28,400
Uh, you'll have to pop over
to Dingley Dell sometime.

327
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,819
But, uh, if the caravan's rockin',
don't come a-knockin'.

328
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,019
Ha. Um, we're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.

329
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,179
I'm writing a book.
<i>Walks Along the Ley Lines of Britain.</i>

330
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,738
Actually, it's his third, so...

331
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,019
I'm out at the crack of dawn,
having a reconnoitre.

332
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,321
Yeah. Are you?

333
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,288
Do you think they liked us?

334
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,804
Ian and Janice.

335
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,164
Chris?

336
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,605
Are you all right?

337
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,520
I didn't like their caravan.

338
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:01,619
<i>Um, we're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.</i>

339
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,338
<i>- I'm writing a book.
- Chris.</i>

340
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:04,780
Walks Along the Ley Lines
of Britain.

341
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:07,820

342
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:10,420
<i>We're pretty intent

343
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:13,539

344

347
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,567
Chris.

348
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,880
Chris!

349
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:09,768
Poppy!

350
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:27,643
Chris!

351
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,728
My God, what is it?

352
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:50,404
Shamans. They sacrificed
Mr Grant's chickens to the goddess Kali.

353
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,844
Chris, you've got some on you.

354
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:58,300
Oh, sorry, yeah.
No, I'll get cleaned up in a minute.

355
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,441
Hey, Blue John Cavern
opens in 45 minutes.

356
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:03,939
I was thinking we should
give another campsite a go tonight.

357
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:05,923
This one's gone downhill.

358
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,241
So how many chickens have you got?

359
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,338
Now I've only got nine,
but I had twelve.

360
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,883
Barbara, Margot...

361
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,858
and the cockerel...
Ronnie Wood.

362
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,768
Ian!

363
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,887
Ian!

364
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:41,720
We might be able to fit in, uh,
Fountains Abbey.

365
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,604
Banjo! What's wrong?

366
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,681
Where's your mummy?

367
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,919
What's happened? Eh?

368
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,127
Chris, look.

369
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:59,487
What's that?

370
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,339
Banjo says his mummy's
a mean, horrible bitch

371
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,323
and he wants to come with us.

372
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:07,338
Oh, I don't think that would be fair
on Ian and Janice.

373
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:11,199
Banjo?
We don't care about being fair, do we?

374
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:15,367
No. We just care about being happy.

375
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:18,240
Bloody things I do for you, love.

376
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,967
There we go.

377
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,519
Stay!

378
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,080
Say one fucking word and it's...

379
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:40,481
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, Chris. Go, go. Go. Go.

380
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,659
Oh, no, Chris, it's Janice.

381
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,298
No. Banjo, down. Down, Banjo.

382
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:48,163
Ian!

383
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,201
Ian!

384
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,218
Chris?

385
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,698
Chris.

386
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,338
You getting anything?

387
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:52,924
You getting any inspiration?

388
00:30:58,019 --> 00:30:59,698
- Chris.
- Hang on.

389
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:02,339
- Chris. Chris.
- Shut up, will you?

390
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,938
- Taste that.

391
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,698
If you haven't started the book yet,

392
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,898
then you might as well
write it about something else.

393
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,658
- Fuck!
- What?

394
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:13,364
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- What is it?

395
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,460
Every time I think I've found my oeuvre,
someone shits on it.

396
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,219
Well, I wouldn't shit on you, Chris.

397
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,578
Not unless you asked me to.

398
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,258
Everyone else seems to find it
so easy to express themselves.

399
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,140
I mean, even you've got your knitting,
haven't you?

400
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:28,578
But the thing is, Chris,
I'm your muse now.

401
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,498
And we've got Banjo.

402
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,207
So everything will be perfect.
You just need to be a bit more patient.

403
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,608
- There's something in me, Tina.
- I'll help you squeeze it out.

404
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,698
- Choose anything you like, love.
<i>- Anything?</i>

405
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,380
<i>Anything you like,
as long as it's under 10 quid.</i>

406
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:45,243
How much is that?

407
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,699
- 60 quid.
- No, you can't have that.

408
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,378
I need walking boots, don't I?

409
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,779
Well, we'll get
the walking boots as well.

410
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,440
You want a good tread.

411
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,818
Okay.

412
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:02,019
- You heard about the man, didn't you?
- No.

413
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,378
He slipped on the crag
and went off the cliff yesterday.

414
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:08,258
- Did you not hear about that?
- No! Did he hurt himself?

415
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,159
Head smashed like a pumpkin.

416
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,499
That's why I'd never have
stone flooring.

417
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,658
Although I do love
that French farmhouse look.

418
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:18,098
Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it,

419
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,178
when people don't have respect
for the power of nature?

420
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:21,780
Can't find his dog.

421
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:24,898
Well, it probably committed suicide.
Dogs will do that.

422
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,924
Tina, why don't you try these?
Look. Give them a go.

423
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,843
Oh, Chris.
- Eh? Why not?

424
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,138
I've got some sad news.
It's about your father.

425
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,004
He's dead.

426
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,248
Hey. Don't dwell on it.

427
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,407
- How'd it go?
- I had a word.

428
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,899
How'd he take it?

429
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,819
Well, he's all right.
He's a bit shaken but...

430
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,659
- Is he?
- Come on. Come on.

431
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:50,685
This was a 13th-century ruin
founded by monks.

432
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,339
Yeah, maybe I should do
an abbot detective story or something.

433
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,087
What do you think
happened to Ian, Chris?

434
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:00,338
- Chris?
- Huh?

435
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,323
Chris.

436
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,923
- What do you think happened to Ian?
- What?

437
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,963
Do you think Banjo
had something to do with it?

438
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,258
Well, yeah, he's probably capable.
He's an animal, isn't he?

439
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:19,720
Do you think he might have pushed him?
'Cause he was an abused dog.

440
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,139
There might be, uh, blood
on the paws of that dog,

441
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,727
but it's smug complacency
that killed Ian, I tell you that.

442
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:31,285
Janice looked frigid as well,
didn't she?

443
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,404
Chris, look, it's coming out.

444
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,048
<i>I'm a monk.</i>

445
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:53,059
<i>Well, who's this little chap?
Let's have a look.</i>

446
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,498
Oh, Poppy.

447
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:57,418
- Oh, you're sweet, aren't you?

448
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,018
This is Barney.
Barney, come and say hello.

449
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,658
<i>- Barney.
- Come and say hello.</i>

450
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:02,218
Say hello to Barney.

451
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,258
- Aw! They love each other. Don't they?
- Well, they're a bit shy.

452
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,858
Yeah, well, often it's like that
when it's love at first sight.

453
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,459
- Isn't it, Chris?
- What?

454
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,018
- It's like you and me when we met.
<i>- They're not fighting, anyway.</i>

455
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,965
- Speechless. Yeah, speechless.
- Speechless, yeah.

456
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:20,568
Look at that graffiti there.
"Rob loves Kerry."

457
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,298
My husband's researching for his book.

458
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,164
Oh, really?

459
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:35,059
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

460
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,699
Actually, it's his third.

461
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,818
You've certainly picked
an interesting spot.

462
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:40,498
Are you staying nearby?

463
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:42,363
Well, actually we're mobile.

464
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:55,283
Oh, God, Chris,
this is just how I imagined it.

465
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:32,046
For Christ's sake!

466
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:33,899
- Get off!
- What did I do?

467
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,578
Not you. Bloody Banjo.

468
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,058
Poppy!

469
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,404
He's a fuckin' pervert.

470
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,919
Get in there. Get in there.
Go on, Banjo. Get in the bloody car.

471
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:21,244
Chris?

472
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,163
Come on.

473
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,288
- I can fly!
- Whoa!

474
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,604
I can fly, Chris.

475
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,884
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo!

476
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,359
Chris? Which button do I press?

477
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,399
Oh, it's okay, I've done it.

478
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,964
Yeah, Poppy!

479
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:57,520
Chris, there's quite
a nice one of you here.

480
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,443
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

481
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,978
Whoo!

482
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:05,120
Chris, these are a bit saucy,
these ones.

483
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,486
This is not my vagina!

484
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,482
This is not my vagina!

485
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,098
I don't know what you mean.

486
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,727
Janice doesn't look
very frigid to me, Chris!

487
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:30,520
In fact,
she looks like a very happy girl.

488
00:38:30,698 --> 00:38:32,138
No, that's...

489
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,058
No wonder, when you look at Ian.

490
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:38,178
That's not Ian. That's me, that.

491
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:41,058
Were you shagging Janice?

492
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,578
- What are you talking about?
- Were you shagging Ian?

493
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,818
- Don't be stupid.
- Were you shagging both of them?

494
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:47,818
- Ah, come on.
- Are you gay?

495
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:51,137
- What? You know I'm not gay.
- Why are they at a wedding?

496
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:52,218
What wedding?

497
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:55,537
Did you go to a wedding
with Ian and Janice, Chris?

498
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,838
- I didn't.
- Was...

499
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,337
What's going on here?

500
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,443
I wouldn't look. Don't.

501
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,000
Did you kill Ian?

502
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:13,646
Yeah. Well, I mean...

503
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,767
Why'd you do that?

504
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:20,047
I didn't mean to.
It was just an accident.

505
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,578
And that just happened.

506
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,087
Can't do things like that.

507
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,297
It's gonna ruin the holiday.

508
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:31,080
I just did... I did that for you.

509
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:46,417
<i>The council had fought an injunction</i>

510
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,417
<i>to remove Mr Andrews
and begun proceedings to evict him.</i>

511
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,458
<i>The house has been condemned,

512
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,359

513
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,417
<i>Police now think that Ian Worthing,</i>

514
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:59,219
<i>whose body was found at the base
of a Yorkshire crag yesterday,</i>

515
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,648
<i>could have killed himself
because of mounting financial pressures.</i>

516
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,137
- Oh! Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

517
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,298
- No wife?
- No, no, she's, uh...

518
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,019
she's back at the, uh, caravan tonight.

519
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,457
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,898
- Yeah, so's Joan.
- Is she? Yeah, yeah.

521
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:17,537
We both said what a nice couple
we thought you were.

522
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:20,603
Oh, did you? Oh, that's very nice.
Cheers, yeah.

523
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,199
Yeah, no, I love her. Yeah.

524
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,438
<i>Yeah, we're in love.</i>

525
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:29,327
Yeah, I love her.

526
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:47,400
<i>Hi, Chris, it's me. It's... It's Tina.
I'm just, um...</i>

527
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,777
I'm just having fun in the caravan.

528
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,643
<i>Um...</i>

529
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,920
<i>I'm just wondering where you are.</i>

530
00:40:55,658 --> 00:41:00,447
<i>It's very cosy,
and I've made some dinner.</i>

531
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:03,199
<i>Come back?</i>

532
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,178
Ooh, steady. Are you okay?

533
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,619
Yeah.

534
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,963
Got a bit carried away.

535
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,528
- I'll get the car in the morning.
- Come on. There you go.

536
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:35,618
- Thanks for bringing him back, Richard.
- Oh, pleasure.

537
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,377
- You take it easy.
- You're a legend, mate.

538
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,178
Good luck with the ley lines.

539
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:41,403
Yeah. See you, mate.

540
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:48,919
Oh, I think I've got a ley line
running through my head.

541
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,217
I thought you'd gone.

542
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:22,322
Chris, Poppy's stopping.

543
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,079
Poppy's stopping, Chris.

544
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:27,619
Yeah, good girl.

545
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,539
Aw! You having a little poo? Well done.

546
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,897
Excuse me.
You are going to pick that up?

547
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,499
Well, I haven't, I've... Chris?

548
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,818
This is a site of natural beauty
and geographical interest.

549
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:40,599
I think you need to sort that out.

550
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:43,777
- I didn't do that.
- Uh, you need to pick it up.

551
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:47,099
- I can't... Well, I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

552
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,058
Well, I haven't got the proper things
to do it with.

553
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,619
Why didn't you bring the proper things
with you if you're out with your dog?

554
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,377
Well, I did bring the proper things...

555
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:55,339
...but I'm not having a very good day.

556
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,777
- Good morning.
- Chris.

557
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:59,657
- Good morning.
- He's told me I've got to pick that up

558
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:01,977
- with my fingers.
- Well, a dog does a shit.

559
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,777
You know, you can't do much
about that, mate.

560
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:05,537
You can pick it up
and you take it away with you.

561
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:07,978
Well, I would have the bags,
but they're in the bloody car

562
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:10,979
that you've left, drunk,
outside some pub that we can't...

563
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,217
- We don't even know where the pub is.
- Tina, I know where the car is.

564
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:14,819
- No, you don't.
- I do. I know where it is.

565
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,019
- We are lost, Chris! Lost!
- I know where it is.

566
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,697
- I know... Look, Tina.
- You don't.

567
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:21,057
Look, I'm sorry, but if you don't
pick up this excrement immediately,

568
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:22,697
then I'm gonna have to inform
the National Trust.

569
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:25,057
Actually, do you know what?
I don't think you are sorry, mate.

570
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:26,697
I don't think you're sorry, either.

571
00:43:26,698 --> 00:43:28,759
- Did he touch you?
- What?

572
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:31,960
- Don't know. Wasn't concentrating.
- Have a think.

573
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,297
Can you remember everything?

574
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:38,658
Uh, yes. Yes, he did touch me.

575
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:42,202
- Oh... This is preposterous!
- What else did he do?

576
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:45,217
He, urn...
- Details.

577
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:49,977
...tried to put
Poppy's bails in his mouth.

578
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:53,257
- Did you go to a private school?
- That is totally irrelevant, but yes.

579
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,617
Yeah, I thought so. It's the tone.
It's the entitlement you got...

580
00:43:55,618 --> 00:43:57,059
I'm entitled to walk
in the countryside...

581
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,657
- Yeah, you're superior.
- ...without having to encounter

582
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:00,137
- dog excrement.
- You're not entitled

583
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,337
- to be a bloody bully, mate...
- Put your stick down, for starters.

584
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,977
- ...bullying my girlfriend.
- Leave the turd where it is.

585
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,419
I will point this stick at you!

586
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,857
They still think
it's their country, don't they?

587
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,777
It should be for people
that at least respect the countryside.

588
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:10,338
See how far his A level
in Classics gets him

589
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:13,063
- when China owns the whole of the UK.
- People like you...

590
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,964

Report that to the National Trust, mate.

599
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:57,057
You know, 300 years ago

600
00:44:57,058 --> 00:45:00,699
his ancestor would have strode
down a path just like this, you know,

601
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,299
and he'd have seen some common strumpet
like you and he'd have gone,

602
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,058
"I'm gonna have a bit of that."

603
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,617
And I'd have had to have stood by
and watched him.

604
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:11,259
'Cause I'd have been a serf and he'd
have been the bloody lord of the manor.

605
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,459
And they call them "the good old days".

606
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,442
<i>I suppose.</i>

607
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:20,238
If you look at it that way,
you were defending my honour.

608
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,883
Oh, don't thank me,
thank the democratic process.

609
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:30,497
Never thought about murdering
innocent people like that before.

610
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:34,326
Ah, he's not a person, Tina,
he's a <i>Daily Mail</i> reader.

611
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:37,806
Perspective.
Grab it with both hands, it's free.

612
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,842
See if he's got any sandwiches.

613
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:46,362
Oh, thank Christ.

614
00:45:47,698 --> 00:45:49,878
Fucking hell.

615
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:55,603
I know, get your notebook out.

616
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:58,198
- Huh?
- Get your notebook out.

617
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,177
Come on, write down your ideas.

618
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:04,097
Just write down what's happened and
all your feelings and stuff like that.

619
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:05,777
- Yeah?
- Mmm!

620
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,737
- All right.
- Go on, get it down.

621
00:46:07,738 --> 00:46:09,680
Oh, my God, Chris.

622
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:12,078
I'm musing.

623
00:46:12,498 --> 00:46:16,762
I'm musing right now. Do you feel it?

624
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,083
My God, I feel amazing.

625
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:23,539
Christ, that was hard.

626
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,097
I don't think I'll get
anything more out today.

627
00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:29,238
I think you've found your oeuvre, Chris.

628
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,004
You're not gonna tell, are you?

629
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,560
No.

630
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:47,167
What are you looking at me
like that for?

631
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,087
This will put 'em off the scent.

632
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:53,399
Come on, give us a hand.

633
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,087
Mother Shipton's Cave!

634
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:48,402
If you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

635
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:51,927
Well, if I tell you, Chris,
it won't come true.

636
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,883
I just wanna be feared and respected.

637
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,404
It's not too much to ask
from life, is it?

638
00:48:09,258 --> 00:48:11,799
Can't look at that any more.

639
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:16,897
<i>The man found dead
yesterday at the Kimberly Stone Circle</i>

640
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:19,817
<i>has been identified as Anthony Breal.</i>

641
00:48:19,818 --> 00:48:22,497
<i>Police are treating the death
as suspicious</i>

642
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:25,537
<i>and are looking for a culprit
that they are describing</i>

643
00:48:25,538 --> 00:48:28,602
<i>as a dangerous sexual predator.</i>

644
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:32,446
Now be good,
because Mummy and Daddy are going out.

645
00:49:32,898 --> 00:49:34,898
What do you think of this?

646
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:39,478
Ah, that is very nice.
Very nice indeed.

647
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:42,497
Hey, turn round. Turn round.

648
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:44,363
Why?

649
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:50,658
- There you go.
- Ooh!

650
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:52,617
- What do you think? Eh?
- It's an owl.

651
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,526
It's nice, innit?

652
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:01,726
Excuse me.

653
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:04,737
Sorry, mate.

654
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:07,966
Guys! Dinner in five minutes!

655
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:39,137
All right, mate?
Not seen one of these before.

656
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:40,737
It's a prototype.

657
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,297
Yeah, all the things that...
You know, all your practical stuff,

658
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:45,098
you keep down at the end by your feet.

659
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,817
Do you? Is that where you've got
your toolbox and stuff?

660
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:49,537
Yeah, yeah, I keep it down there,
like our wind-up torch and that,

661
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:51,337
- and, uh, my stove.
- Yeah?

662
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:53,247
Chris!

663
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:54,897
I'm ready!

664
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,057
...glass fibre epoxy struts,
as used in spacecraft extendable masts.

665
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,498
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

666
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:01,377
- I'm Chris, by the way.
- I'm Martin. Nice to meet you.

667
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:03,137
- Yeah, nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Yeah, you.

668
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:05,097
- Yeah, I was in plastics.
- Was ya?

669
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:06,658
Yeah, extrusion blow moulding.

670
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,538
No. Cor, they're given an hard time,
ain't they?

671
00:51:08,538 --> 00:51:10,817
But, here, let's face it,
they're here to stay, mate.

672
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,297
Yeah, preaching to the choir, mate.

673
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:15,122
Right, yeah, yeah. Nice one. Yeah.

674
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,338
It looks like an alien's coffin.

675
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:20,338
I call it the Carapod. You know,
what with the ground displacement

676
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,617
of persons due to the instability
of geopolitics,

677
00:51:22,618 --> 00:51:26,538
I'm hoping that this will become a whole
new way of living for economic migrants.

678
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:28,978
We're trying a whole new way of living.
Aren't we, Chris?

679
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:30,658
- Oh, are you?
- Tina hasn't travelled much.

680
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:34,577
Right, right, yeah. I hear you.
Hey, uh, you back later for a beer?

681
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:36,177
Oh, I don't really drink much but, um,

682
00:51:36,178 --> 00:51:37,658
always up for a bit of smoke,
if you know what I mean.

683
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,257
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Great.

684
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:40,697
- Nice one.
- Cheers, Martin.

685
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,137
- Cheers. Chris?
- Yeah.

686
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:44,046
Yeah. Take care.

687
00:51:45,698 --> 00:51:47,727
Right.

688
00:52:00,098 --> 00:52:03,057
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
One in the pink,

689
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:04,538
- one on the sink!
<i>- One on the sink!</i>

690
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,897
- It's crazy, this.
- Thank you.

691
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:08,937
- Madam.

692
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:11,617
Thank you very much.
Uh, can I just ask you, actually,

693
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:13,617
I've got this, er...
I've got this voucher

694
00:52:13,618 --> 00:52:16,159
- that I picked up about a week ago.
- Oh, right.

695
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:21,039
Hey, that dress looks a lot better
on you than it did on your mother.

696
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:25,842
I haven't got any knickers on.

697
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:32,038
Oh, dear, it looks like
your knife's fallen off the table.

698
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:35,643
I'll just have to go and pick it up.

699
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:38,682
I might be five minutes or so.

700
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:48,925
Can't see anything.

701
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:51,777
Well, I'm wearing tights.

702
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:53,737
You know all that stuff
that's been happening, you know...

703
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,418
It's all right, Chris.

704
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:59,847
It's all right,
because I understand you.

705
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,897
- And I know you...
- Do you?

706
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:06,337
...and I get it, 'cause it's just about
personal empowerment, isn't it?

707
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:10,417
It's just expressing yourself
and thinking outside the box.

708
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:14,880
And I've been in a box.
I don't wanna go back to the box, Chris.

709
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:18,199
I'd rather die. Do you know that?

710
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:20,098
You'd rather die?

711
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:24,456
Yeah. How romantic would that be?
If we both just died together.

712
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:29,018
Well, I mean, going to salsa's romantic.
We could maybe try that first.

713
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:32,377
What you're doing is
you're giving to the world.

714
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:34,297
Take carbon footprints.

715
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:37,737
By reducing people's lifespans,

716
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:40,639
technically,
you're reducing their emissions.

717
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:46,682
What, so you're saying that...
murder is green?

718
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:51,683
Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Thanks.

719
00:53:57,178 --> 00:54:00,242
- This beard turns me on, Chris.
- I love it when you do that.

720
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:04,523
- Ginger-minger!

721
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:09,017
What's the favourite thing I like to do?

722
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:11,526
Yeah. With me.

723
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,497
- Oh, well, that's obvious, innit?

724
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:16,247
- Put the bins out.

725
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:21,642
I like to put the bins out... in my pants
and then have you come over

726
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:24,217
and rub bin juice all over me leg.

727
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:26,176
What's bin juice?

728
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:27,777
You know, that bit that you get
at the bottom of the bin

729
00:54:27,778 --> 00:54:29,928
- when all that stuff drips out.
- Oh, yeah.

730
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,050
- That was Dave!
- Wasn't his real name...

731
00:54:43,057 --> 00:54:44,999
Don't be sick.

732
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:47,363
You Okay?

733
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:05,358
Nine, eight, seven,

734
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:10,686
six, five, four, three, two, one!

735
00:55:15,778 --> 00:55:17,806
Do you wanna have sex with all us?

736
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:22,798
Ooh!
It's just a bit of fun.

737
00:55:24,057 --> 00:55:26,925
Get off, that's enough. That's enough.

738
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:29,337
Getting married, are you?

739
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:30,776
- Yeah.
- Are you?

740
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:32,599
I am. Aren't we?

741
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:36,417
What would your fiancé
think of this, then, eh?

742
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:38,359
He'd love it.

743
00:55:40,898 --> 00:55:42,657
- I'm gonna go and pay the bill now.
- No, let me pay.

744
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:44,762
Sit down! Sit!

745
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,842
Stay!

746
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:56,281
<i>In a minute!</i>

747
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:52,217
Nine, eight, seven, six,

748
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:56,439
five, four, three, two, one!

749
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:33,842
I'd never do that.

750
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:37,177
Do what?

751
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,938
Chailey!

752
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:40,737
Chailey Morris!

753
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:42,558
Chailey!

754
00:57:42,977 --> 00:57:45,037
- Chailey!
- Chailey!

755
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,765
She's not texting back.

756
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,638
- Chailey!
- Chailey!

757
00:58:41,857 --> 00:58:45,358
Oh, for Christ's sake, Banjo,
you've pissed the bed.

758
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:48,322
Poppy.
- Disgusting.

759
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:06,646
Where's that necklace?

760
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:10,038
I'm sure I had it
when we got back from the restaurant.

761
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:11,938
Well, that's what happens
when you go off schedule.

762
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,137
Chris, are we going
to the Pencil Museum now?

763
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:16,578
Actually, I told Martin
I'd help with modifications

764
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:18,016
to the Carapod this morning.

765
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,936
But we scheduled the Pencil Museum.

766
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:22,338
Well, it's my turn to go off schedule.

767
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:24,201
Fine.

768
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:27,966
Come on, Poppy.

769
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:30,839
Come on. Come on, Poppy.

770
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:33,322
Come on, Poppy.

771
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:37,137
Poppy! Poppy! Poppy!

772
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:41,239
Come on. Come on, Poppy.

773
00:59:46,537 --> 00:59:48,761
Well, fuck you, then.

774
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,338
How long have you two
been together, then?

775
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:02,683
Uh, about three months.

776
01:00:03,618 --> 01:00:05,418
Still getting on all right?

777
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:08,137
Yeah.
Sex life's fucking fantastic, mate.

778
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,938
- Is it?
- Better than ever.

779
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,617
- Fair play, mate.
- Yeah.

780
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:15,298
She don't mind you smoking a bit
of the old herb every now and again?

781
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,958
No, she don't care about that.

782
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:19,496
She doesn't like me drinking

783
01:00:19,497 --> 01:00:22,201
and she doesn't like me doing her
up the bumhole.

<i>Legend has it
that in the early 1500s,</i>

785
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:30,417
<i>a violent storm
in the Borrowdale area of Cumberland</i>

786
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,578
<i>led to trees being uprooted</i>

787
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,439
<i>and the discovery
of a strange black material underneath.</i>

788
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:39,801
<i>This material turned out to be graphite.</i>

789
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:45,096
<i>A cottage industry of pencil-making
soon developed,</i>

790
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:51,139
<i>culminating in the formation of
the UK's first pencil factory in 1832.</i>

791
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:54,765
<i>The factory has had various owners...</i>

792
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:59,319
And then like this, sort of disco style.

793
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:12,256
Excuse me. How much is that big pencil?

794
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:14,121
£24.

795
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:29,319
Go. Fast as you can.

796
01:01:31,777 --> 01:01:35,399
- Oh, mate. You all right?

797
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,042
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Bloody hell, mate.

799
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,816
- Banjo. Banjo, get away.
- Ugh!

800
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:45,877
Go!

801
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:52,719
<i>...becoming
the Cumberland Pencil Company in 1916.</i>

802
01:01:53,057 --> 01:01:57,296

Is that you, Tina?

812
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:48,642
Oh, Mum.

813
01:02:50,457 --> 01:02:53,237

Yes.

01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:57,559
Yeah, a bit, sort of.

816
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:02,376
Shall I come? No, I can't. I'm too ill.

Oh, they're all the same.

819
01:03:07,257 --> 01:03:09,696
Whatever you give him,
he'll want the opposite.

820
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:12,696
I've done things.

821
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:15,205
Ooh, Tina. What?

822
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:18,005
What have you done, love?

823
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,776
Sex things?

824
01:03:21,777 --> 01:03:23,806
And other stuff.

825
01:03:24,537 --> 01:03:29,325
Because I thought that was what
he wanted to see me do, you know?

826
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,538
But now I'm not sure.

827
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:35,962
You didn't let him see you do
number twos, did you, Tina?

828
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,241
Never.

829
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:42,438
Mystery, Tina, is a woman's sanctuary.

830
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:47,202
Bye, now,
'cause I've got stuff to do.

831

Mum.

832
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:29,322
Poppy's with the babysitter.

833
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,736
Don't call him that.

834
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:34,081
Make love to me, Chris.

835
01:04:35,058 --> 01:04:37,496
No, I can't. I'm still processing.

Please.

837
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:43,202
That poor girl. She was getting married.

838
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,297
Just the thought of that
just makes me feel...

839
01:04:46,297 --> 01:04:48,161
Sexy.

840
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:52,479
Ruined that restaurant for me.

841
01:04:53,537 --> 01:04:56,001
I've been very bad, Chris.

842
01:04:57,138 --> 01:04:59,766
I think you should punish me.

843
01:05:00,777 --> 01:05:02,377
With your cock.

844
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:06,085
Tina. It's not sexy. It was wrong.

845
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:08,522
You're not qualified.

846
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:11,201
Fine!

847

848
01:05:24,738 --> 01:05:27,397

01:06:09,497 --> 01:06:12,096
Morning, Chris.
- Pull over now!

01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:14,006
- Oh.
<i>- What the hell are you doing?</i>

856
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:15,536
I thought I'd give you a lie-in.

857

01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:26,602
Oh, Christ.

860
01:06:27,698 --> 01:06:31,257
Aw. It reminds me
of the first day of the holiday.

861
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:32,696
No, that was an accident.

'cause, you know,

863
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:37,936
it's the first one we've done together,
isn't it?

864
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:39,936
- Ah, you're sacked.
- What?

865
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:41,377
- You're sacked.
- What?

866
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,616
Look...
...this isn't working.

867
01:06:43,617 --> 01:06:45,696
Look, I don't... I don't need you.
I don't need a muse.

868
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,964
I'm not a bloody writer, am I?

869
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:50,336
No, you're not. You're a serial killer.

870
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:52,097
- That's what you are.
- I am not. Look, Tina,

871
01:06:52,098 --> 01:06:55,456
I need structure. Organisation.
This is just chaos.

872
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:58,176
It's not my style!
Just... All this...

873
01:06:58,177 --> 01:07:00,926
Oh, I can't open the fucking door now!

874
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:08,442

875

<i>You done it to yourself.</i>

876
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:12,856
- I need justification.
- Really?

877
01:07:12,857 --> 01:07:15,697
- This is just murder.
- Well, maybe this is my style, Chris.

878
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,096
- Yeah, great style.
- Maybe this is my style.

879
01:07:18,097 --> 01:07:20,217
You are really bloody stylish,
aren't you?

880
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:23,402
- I know.
- Look at that! That's your style?

881
01:07:23,537 --> 01:07:25,176
Look, it's nothing personal.

882
01:07:25,177 --> 01:07:27,776
It's just,
you're a negative influence on me.

883
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:29,216
Do you know that?

884
01:07:29,217 --> 01:07:32,017
I've done more murders

885
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,576

886
01:07:34,577 --> 01:07:36,758
- Redundant?
- Yes.

887
01:07:36,977 --> 01:07:38,936
You said you'd taken a sabbatical.

888
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:41,016
It doesn't matter.
You can't help it, you're evil.

889
01:07:41,017 --> 01:07:44,126
Maybe even a witch.
Yeah, you're a witch.

890
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:46,524
You're a bloody witch.

01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,376
- Sorry, it's a bit squished in here.
- Sorry. Um, just...

932
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:38,857
Yeah, he's a lovely bloke, isn't he?

933
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:41,896
Oh, honestly, I'm so happy
I bumped into you guys.

934
01:12:41,897 --> 01:12:44,536
You know, I really need
a business partner, you know,

935
01:12:44,537 --> 01:12:46,296
'cause I come up with the ideas

936
01:12:46,297 --> 01:12:49,056
but I'm not good
at the organisational end of things.

937
01:12:49,057 --> 01:12:53,097
So, you know, and, uh, I really bonded
with little Banjo over here.

938
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:54,776
Who?

939
01:12:54,778 --> 01:12:59,095
That's his name, isn't it?
It's just that Chris said it was...

940
01:12:59,096 --> 01:13:00,856
Did he?

941
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:03,399
So did I get that wrong?

942
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:11,456
Do you know what it's like
to be a woman, Martin?

943
01:13:11,456 --> 01:13:14,280
Uh, no. No.

944
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:16,336
I do.

945
01:13:16,337 --> 01:13:17,776
Fine.

946
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:20,285
It's not too bad, actually.

947
01:13:20,337 --> 01:13:21,777
Yeah, I imagine, yeah, yeah.

948
01:13:21,778 --> 01:13:24,216
He can be very controlling.

949
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:27,137
- Really? Right. I...
- Very domineering.

950
01:13:27,138 --> 01:13:30,856
- Well, he's... Yeah.
- But you're not like that, are you?

951
01:13:30,857 --> 01:13:34,055
No, no. Me, I'm a pretty
easy-going guy really, yeah.

952
01:13:34,056 --> 01:13:36,336
Haven't you got lovely eyelashes?

953
01:13:36,338 --> 01:13:38,175
- Have I?
- Mmm.

954
01:13:38,176 --> 01:13:41,404
- Thanks very much. Yeah.
Kiss me.

955
01:13:44,018 --> 01:13:46,404
Martin, did you hear me?

956
01:13:48,818 --> 01:13:50,255
- Kiss me, Martin.
- Um...

957
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:52,285
Just quickly before he comes back.

958
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:58,678
- All right, mate?
- All right?

959
01:13:58,776 --> 01:14:00,695
- What?
- Cheers.

960
01:14:00,696 --> 01:14:02,965
- Cheers, yeah.
- Cheers. Here's to you.

961
01:14:06,377 --> 01:14:08,121
What?

962
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,576
Martin just said
some filthy things to me, Chris.

963
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:15,257
Yeah? Well, do tell.

964
01:14:15,258 --> 01:14:18,561
He said I was a dirty, slutty bitch.

965
01:14:19,697 --> 01:14:21,561
And he wanted to fuck me.

966
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:25,684
And he said he wanted to shit
in my mouth and in my underwear,

967
01:14:26,137 --> 01:14:31,415
and he said he wanted to shit in my hand
and make me use it as a brown lipstick.

968
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:35,124
Mate, I... I...

969
01:14:35,617 --> 01:14:39,477
You know,
if Martin really said these things,

970
01:14:40,378 --> 01:14:44,135
then I've got no objection, in theory.

971
01:14:44,136 --> 01:14:46,523
- In theory?
- Yeah.

972
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:52,118
What about practice, Chris?

973
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:58,676
- Right. Um...
- Chris.

974
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:02,457
- Um, I'm gonna go to bed now, all right?
- I'm...

975
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,496
Yeah, it's probably best,
actually, mate. Yeah, yeah.

976
01:15:04,497 --> 01:15:06,416
Yeah, it's been a long day.
Yeah, yeah, so I'll just...

977
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,096
Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna turn in, too. So...

978
01:15:08,098 --> 01:15:11,717
Yeah, can I just...
Yeah, can I just, uh...

979
01:15:12,136 --> 01:15:14,197
Will you let Martin out, please?

980
01:15:18,937 --> 01:15:21,521
Right, cheers then, yeah.
See you in the morning.

981
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:26,457
Why are you behaving
like that in front of Martin?!

982
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:28,855
Why can't I have a friend?
You've got that bloody dog, Banjo!

983
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:32,056
- Poppy!
- It's called Banjo!

984
01:15:32,057 --> 01:15:34,456
- Poppy!
- Banjo!

985
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:36,897
Just stop saying that
in front of the dog.

986
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:38,537
You're giving him an identity crisis.

987
01:15:38,538 --> 01:15:42,921
How is he gonna have an identity crisis,
Chris, when he's a stupid fucking dog?

988
01:15:51,776 --> 01:15:54,318
Hello? Hello? Hey!

989
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,804
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

990
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:24,284
Well, that solves that problem.

991
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:31,057
Oh, fuckin' God, no.

992
01:16:31,058 --> 01:16:32,920
No!

993
01:16:37,976 --> 01:16:39,797
Martin?

994
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:42,004
Martin?

995
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:46,765
Martin!

996
01:16:50,176 --> 01:16:53,076
You are a fucking liability, you are.

997
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:55,295
You're a liability.
You're just like your mother.

998
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:57,837
You can't... Ow, fucking hell.

999
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:16,564
- Oh, you are a powder keg.

1000
01:19:41,216 --> 01:19:43,175
So have you had a nice holiday?

1001
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:47,485
Yeah.
I've had a brilliant holiday.

1002
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:51,124
I'm sorry about
calling you a witch and that.

1003
01:19:53,696 --> 01:19:57,241
What do you reckon?
You sure this is what you want?

1004
01:20:01,177 --> 01:20:03,135
- Three...

1005
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:04,956
- ...two...
- Two...

1006
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,324
- ...one.
- ...one.

1007
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:09,597
Go.
