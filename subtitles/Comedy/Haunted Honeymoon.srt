1
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,961
Help!

2
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,894
It's not what you think.

3
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:38,365
Well, it's partly what you think, but, er...

4
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,368
Oh, it's so complicated.

5
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:47,985
Oh, God, help me! Please!
You can't be the man I'm about to marry.

6
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:52,282
Don't tell me that my fianc is...
that my fianc is a...

7
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:59,499
Haunted Honeymoon, starring Larry Abbot,
will continue after this news update.

8
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:06,589
Stay tuned for the chilling conclusion of this
week's tale from Manhattan Mystery Theatre.

9
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:11,136
- Don't touch that dial. We'll be right back.
- You're off the air.

10
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:14,391
OK, boys. You've got two minutes. Go.

11
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:20,814
Listen, pal, I'm not a boy and I don't want
to be referred to as one of the boys.

12
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:30,033
Hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys! Gal...
One at a time, huh?

13
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,412
- Are you two getting married Sunday?
- Only if it rains.

14
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,603
I got tickets for the World Series.

15
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:39,336
- When did he ask you?
- After strangling me in Curse of the Mummy.

16
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,797
- Say yes right away?
- Bet your sweet patoot.

17
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,966
- How do you spell "patoot"?
- Any way you like.

18
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:50,015
You've been in lots of shows that went bust.
How's it feel to own a hit?

19
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,768
I don't own her, I'm just marrying her.

20
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,020
No, I mean the radio show.

21
00:04:55,186 --> 00:05:00,775
Sure, I'm on top of the world 'cause I got
the number one show. That's just luck.

22
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm head-over-heels in love
with the best girl in the world.

23
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,867
That's not luck, that's God smiling on me.

24
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,954
When Vickie said yes to me...

25
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,420
From the minute Vickie said yes...

26
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:29,642
He bought a double mattress and a new stove.

27
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,565
- How's her cooking? Have you tasted it yet?
- Sure, but we're getting married anyway.

28
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,986
- Vickie, how'd he ask you?
- Give us a break.

29
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:43,533
Your fans love this stuff.
Come on, Vickie. Was he romantic?

30
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,453
It was like in the movies. Honest to God.

31
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,872
We're walking along in the moonlight.

32
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,334
He gets down on one knee,
looks at me and says...

33
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,298
It's almost airtime, gentlemen.

34
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,343
OK, boys, that's it.

35
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,888
We're giving you a page of coverage here.

36
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,183
Give 'em a break, will ya?

37
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:10,314
Can we have a level first violin, please?

38
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,777
- Well, Larry's certainly in good form today.
- The show isn't over.

39
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:19,491
- You can see he's fine today, Charlie.
- The show isn't over yet.

40
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,747
Eddy, are you there? I don't see you.

41
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:29,961
Could we hear a little bit of the storm, please?

42
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,618
That's fine, Eddy.

43
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,039
Ten seconds, everyone.

44
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,792
- Say, Eddy...
- Huh?

45
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,586
- Is my tie straight?
- What?

46
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,633
- My tie, is it straight?
- Your tie's fine.

47
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,555
- No, but is it straight?
- Yeah, your tie is straight.

48
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:21,228
- Say "I swear to God your tie is straight".
- I swear to God.

49
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:22,980
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Sh!

50
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:30,113
Ralston Purina Checkerboard Square,
makers of Purina Dog Chow, presents

51
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,574
Manhattan Mystery Theatre.

52
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,370
Hello again. Still there?

53
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,247
This is your host speaking.

54
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:44,295
And now, friends, brace yourselves
for the chilling conclusion...

55
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:47,882
to tonight's tale of horror, entitled...

56
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,097
Haunted Honeymoon.

57
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,063
Lady Wolfington is speaking on the telephone...

58
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,400
to Inspector Carp of Scotland Yard.

59
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,947
Inspector, I'm terrified.
I tell you, it's gone beyond all reason.

60
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:13,119
Lady Wolfington, there's only one way to tell
if a man has werewolf in his blood.

61
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:16,582
He'll give himself away
by stammering ever so slightly...

62
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,584
on all words beginning with "w".

63
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,252
"W"?

64
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:26,384
If you suspect your fianc, put him to the test.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

65
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:31,849
Oh, Freddy, you startled me.

66
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,579
Startled?

67
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,895
- By me?
- Yes, I'm sorry, I...

68
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:39,753
All words beginning with "w".

69
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:43,696
All words beginning with "w".

70
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,325
Darling, what a lovely sweater.

71
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,578
Is that cotton or wool?

72
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:52,373
This? Oh, it's woo... wool.

73
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,042
- What?
- Um...

74
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,131
I say, uh... I don't know.
Must be some sort of a cotton.

75
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,431
Oh, I think another storm's brewing.

76
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:19,654
Seems so. Doesn't it?

77
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:30,833
- Listen to that wind.
- Ooh-hoo!

78
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,671
Oh! It's frightening, isn't it?

79
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,674
- Why's he laughing?
- I don't know.

80
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,885
- Is that how you rehearsed it?
- No, but that's Larry.

81
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:48,019
- Darling, I'm going to have a sherry.
- Oh!

82
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:52,607
- Would you or wouldn't you like some?
- Oh, I wou... I wou...

83
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:56,445
Um... yes, I'll have some.

84
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,121
- Here's your drink, darling.
- Thanks. Cheers.

85
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,750
- To Wolfington Castle.
- To Woo... Woo...

86
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,043
To Woo-woo-woo...

87
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,215
To Woo-woo-woo-woo...

88
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,945
Woo-woo-woo...

89
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,742
To Woo-woo-woo...

90
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:21,807
Woo-woo... To Woo-woo-woo...

91
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:26,938
To Woo-woo-woo-woo... Wolfington Castle.

92
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,789
- He's out. He's fired.
- No!

93
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:47,086
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr Paul Abbot.

94
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:51,175
Oh, Doctor, thank God you're here.
Please come in.

95
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:53,427
This is our sponsor, Mr Tarlow.

96
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:57,056
Charlie, this is Larry's uncle,
the famous psychiatrist.

97
00:10:57,222 --> 00:11:00,602
- I asked him to come meet you.
- What's he laughing at?

98
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:05,064
- This is a mystery, not a comedy.
- He's laughing because he's afraid.

99
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,068
- Afraid?
- Tomorrow it might make him cry.

100
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:11,614
That's what he did last week.
What's he afraid of?

101
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:14,117
Thunder and lightning? A wind machine?

102
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:18,706
We have that stuff every week.
Why now? We were number one!

103
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,376
Because three weeks ago
he got engaged to be married.

104
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:26,547
- The Curse of The Mummy.
- What's that got to do with it?

105
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:29,759
The engagement has opened
a crack in his psyche,

106
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:34,890
so hideous to Larry's mind
that he must lock it out.

107
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,686
- But I do know that I can cure him.
- How?

108
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,733
By scaring him...

109
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,065
to death.

110
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,948
- You want to scare him even more?
- How do you cure hiccups, Mr Tarlow?

111
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:50,678
- Well, you...
- Listen...

112
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:53,494
I've been working in Zurich
with a brilliant scientist...

113
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:56,331
who has discovered
the cure for Larry's condition.

114
00:11:56,498 --> 00:12:03,005
Dr Strickland has proved the cure is to increase
the pressure of the fears, not lessen it.

115
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:08,387
- Like going faster around a dangerous curve?
- Exactly.

116
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:12,099
This weekend, starting tonight,
the entire Abbot family...

117
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,978
is gathering for the wedding
at the estate of Larry's great-aunt.

118
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:18,731
We have him in an ideal situation,

119
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,486
a lonely estate, miles from anywhere.

120
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,327
- Have you told Vickie?
- No, not Vickie, that'd be too risky.

121
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,247
I'm afraid she couldn't be objective.

122
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,667
Are you promising you can cure Larry?

123
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:40,756
I, Paul Abbot, promise that
I can cure Larry within 36 hours.

124
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:44,886
- Just by scaring him?
- By scaring him to death.

125
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:53,187
I don't know. I can be feeling swell, then
something sets it off and I'm scared to death.

126
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:56,733
So you acted nutty for a few shows, so what?

127
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,157
You're the best actor in New York,
with the hottest show, and you still got me.

128
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,535
So, listen, cookie, if something scares you
before Sunday, just say,

129
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,331
"Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?"

130
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,062
You think that'll work?

131
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,422
Always in all ways rely upon me...

132
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,349
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?

133
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:29,854
That's my guy. Did you hear what the bug
said to the windshield?

134
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,566
- What?
- That's me all over.

135
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:37,362
Sweet. Don't you get it? If a bug splattered...

136
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,282
- Honey, is my tie straight?
- What?

137
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,494
- Is my tie straight?
- Your tie's fine.

138
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:47,082
- Yeah, but is it straight?
- Yeah, it's straight.

139
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:48,811
Oh, good.

140
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,326
Someone in this family is trying to kill me.

141
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,205
What? You don't know what you're saying.

142
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:28,170
Larry's the only one I trust.
Please give me the pen. I haven't much time.

143
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,757
- They'll all be here any moment.
- I love you, Kate.

144
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:35,636
I respect you as if you were my own mother.

145
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,889
Oh...

146
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:42,936
You're the dearest person I know.
I'd even die for you, Kate.

147
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:47,942
But darling, never mind
that I'm a member of the family,

148
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,446
before you sign, there's one 
thing you haven't considered.

149
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:55,826
- What's that?
- What if Larry dies before you do?

150
00:14:55,993 --> 00:15:02,208
If Larry should die, you can all share 
the money equally, just as it was before.

151
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:07,715
Francis, you're the only living person
that knows I've changed my will.

152
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:13,096
If you ever tell anyone
may your soul rot in hell.

153
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,942
What a cosy place for a wedding.
Who lived here before? Count Dracula?

154
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:29,865
- Will you lay off that? I grew up here.
- No wonder you turned out so normal.

155
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:34,537
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry. Must be delightful by daylight.

156
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,128
- Run for it, sweetie. I'll get the bags.
- OK.

157
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,896
Go on, honey, knock on the door.
I'll be right there.

158
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:31,059
I'm... I'm engaged to Larry Abbot
and he... said he grew up here.

159
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:34,771
Oh, you know... He...

160
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,945
He was just... You know him, he says he...
Maybe I'm at the wrong house.

161
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:42,239
I can come back, thank you.

162
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:45,076
Sorry, honey. Oh, I see you've already met.

163
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:47,724
I am Pfister, the family butler.

164
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,645
And I'm the little boy you used
to tuck into bed...

165
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:54,920
and bring milk and cookies to
just before you kissed me good night.

166
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,298
- Your name, please?
- My name?

167
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:01,593
- Is he kidding?
- Come in, Mr Kidding. I'll take the bags.

168
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,264
Won't you follow me, please?

169
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,643
- Poor Pfister, his memory's going.
- I wish we were.

170
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,275
This way, please.

171
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:22,534
- Holy smokes. You grew up in this place?
- I learned to ride a bike in this room.

172
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:27,873
- He gives me the willies.
- Be nice to him. He seems strange but he isn't.

173
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,837
- What'll I talk about?
- Talk about a minute, that'll be enough.

174
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:36,008
Be very careful of that 
magnificent vase on the landing.

175
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,929
There are only three like it in the entire world.

176
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, what kind is it?

177
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,602
Twenty-five past seven.

178
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:49,816
- A little hard of hearing...
- What?

179
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:54,529
- A little hard of hearing. It comes and goes.
- What?

180
00:17:54,695 --> 00:17:57,116
My fiance, she's a little hard of hearing.

181
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,909
- Come and goes, eh?
- Yes.

182
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:02,705
I'll remember that. This way, miss!

183
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,958
This is gonna be some weekend.

184
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,896
Toby! Toby, shush!

185
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,111
Who is it? Who's there?

186
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,989
What? Pfister!

187
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:38,787
Why are these windows still open?
Do I have to do everything? Drunken sot!

188
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,415
Hold your horses! Where's Pfister?

189
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:45,378
Where is he? Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

190
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:56,891
Who are you? What do you want?
This is just for the family. I don't know you.

191
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,730
Why are you looking at me?
What do you want? Are you selling something?

192
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,078
Oh, please, forgive me.

193
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:20,585
Is there any way I can help you, sir?

194
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:26,175
I'm Montego. My wife is Susan Abbot.
She should be here any moment.

195
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:31,139
I came from Philadelphia by train.
I believe the family's expecting me.

196
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,309
Won't you come in?

197
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:50,327
- Have you got any luggage, sir?
- Just this one case.

198
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:53,206
Oh, it's a large one, isn't it?

199
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:56,292
Would you like me to...?

200
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,632
I prefer to handle it myself, thank you.

201
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,824
Now if anything frightens you,
anything at all, you just holler.

202
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:28,453
- I'll be right down the hall, OK?
- OK.

203
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:45,014
Just practising.

204
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:51,062
I love you, cookie.

205
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:54,817
- See you in 20 minutes.
- OK.

206
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:56,548
Da-da-da

207
00:20:57,361 --> 00:21:00,615
- Master Larry!
- Pfister, you do remember me.

208
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:06,080
- Of course. When did you get here?
- About 15 minutes ago.

209
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,541
If I'd known, I'd have greeted you.

210
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:12,921
Yes, that would have been nice.
Well, we can't have everything.

211
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:16,008
- Come along, you're in your old room.
- Oh, good.

212
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:22,056
- So what do you think, honey?
- Wow, what a snazzy little nook.

213
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:25,935
Rachel, Rachel, you're a 
sight for sore eyes, baby.

214
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,147
Oh, Rachel...

215
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:36,155
- She usually plants a big, wet one on me.
- I do not!

216
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:38,324
She must be shy.

217
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:44,498
Rachel, I'd like you to meet a very old friend
of mine from school, Sylvia Beecham.

218
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,376
Pleased to meet you, Rachel.

219
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:50,046
Rachel, you look wonderful.
Not a day over seventy...

220
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:54,135
- three? Four? Seventy-five... Six. Oh, Rachel.
- You need a haircut.

221
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,764
Oh, same old Rachel. Love you, baby, love you.

222
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,600
- Where's Larry?
- He's upstairs.

223
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:05,480
Come on, I'll take you on the grand tour, huh?

224
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:16,243
Rachel, did you get the note
about the connecting rooms?

225
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:20,163
- What? What's that?
- I knew that would get to her.

226
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:30,007
If you don't mind me saying,
your uncle Francis is a strange man.

227
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:33,470
You're telling me.
He scared me to death as a kid.

228
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,806
- Is he still married?
- Widower.

229
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:38,267
- Widower than what?
- What do you mean?

230
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,895
- You said he was widower.
- He is.

231
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:43,399
Widower than what?

232
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:45,860
What? He isn't widower than anything.

233
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:48,321
- He's just a "wittle" man?
- That's right.

234
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:51,282
That's all I was asking.

235
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,955
I see.

236
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:01,084
Well, the old room looks just about the same.

237
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:03,170
Nothing's changed since you left, sir.

238
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:06,966
- Rachel still cleaning up?
- Never stops, sir.

239
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:11,221
- I'd like to see Aunt Kate before dinner.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

240
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:13,891
Your Aunt Kate has just concluded some business

241
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:17,938
and asked to be excused until 
the family assemble downstairs.

242
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:20,273
Ah... OK.

243
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,026
Well, it's lovely to see you again, Pfister.

244
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,322
It's lovelier to see you, sir.

245
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,685
Ah.

246
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:56,049
Holy baloney, here we go again.

247
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:58,426
Coming, darling.

248
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,229
Coming, Larry.

249
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:10,106
- Did you hear it, too?
- It's my fianc.

250
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:12,234
Hello, I'm Larry's uncle.

251
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:14,195
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

252
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,154
- Fine.
- Can I help you?

253
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm sure it's nothing. He's just 
been nervous about the wedding.

254
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:23,664
Look, why don't I go in with you?

255
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,629
Larry?

256
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:33,425
Honey? Where are you?

257
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:37,012
Larry?

258
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:42,226
Don't be afraid. The lightning's all gone.

259
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,358
He can't just have vanished.

260
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:54,699
- Larry?
- Don't move. You're risking your lives.

261
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:59,913
Don't even raise your voices.
There's a deadly snake in that closet.

262
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,292
Call the zoo. Ask them if they're 
missing a seven-foot cobra.

263
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,796
- Larry, I don't think...
- Don't argue.

264
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:08,526
- Hey, steady!
- Honey...

265
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:11,593
Larry, I'll take a look in the closet.

266
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,096
No, no, listen to me. Call the zoo.

267
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:18,684
- Where'd you see the snake?
- In the top drawer.

268
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:22,856
I know my cobras.
You'll be dead within seconds.

269
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:28,487
Is this your snake?

270
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:34,076
By the way, Uncle Francis, I'd like you
to meet my fiance, Vickie Pearle.

271
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:36,663
Vickie, this is my...

272
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,293
Uncle Francis.

273
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:05,528
- Your mommy and daddy are right next door.
- Makes it more exciting.

274
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:10,159
But supposing they walk in 
and see us, how would I look?

275
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:13,330
Like a million bucks.

276
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:16,208
Charlie, why do you reduce everything to money?

277
00:27:16,374 --> 00:27:19,003
Because I don't have any.

278
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:26,364
- But I'd be happy if you only had 100 dollars.
- So would I.

279
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:33,769
Listen, I can't take much more of this.
Either marry me, or let's call it quits.

280
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:38,484
I can't afford to marry you. Not yet.

281
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:42,612
And don't threaten me, honey.

282
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,577
- I need a little more time.
- I may not wait around, Charlie.

283
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:53,000
Did you hear me, Charlie?
I said I may not wait around.

284
00:27:56,878 --> 00:28:00,341
We'll talk about it at the end of the week.

285
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,605
What? Drinking! Don't think I didn't see you.

286
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:17,777
You'd better be sober tonight
or you don't get into my bed.

287
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,740
See who's at the door. Hurry!

288
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:26,078
Do I have to do everything? Drunken sot!

289
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,800
- Hello, Pfister.
- Ma'am.

290
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:42,222
- Boy, it's cold out there. Everyone here?
- You're the last one, Miss Susan.

291
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,977
Hello, Toby. What's the matter?

292
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,270
Aren't you going to say hello?

293
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:51,191
Come on, boy. Say hello to Aunt Susan.

294
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:55,111
You remember me, don't you? Good boy.

295
00:28:56,153 --> 00:29:00,577
I know you love me.

296
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,665
- I'll have a whisky and soda.
- Certainly.

297
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:09,252
- Is my husband upstairs?
- Yes, Miss Susan.

298
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:11,797
There's a bag in the car. You can get it later.

299
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,675
Very well.

300
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:25,979
- Larry, wow! Come to mama.
- Sylvia.

301
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:28,608
Oh, darling!

302
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:34,448
- What are you doing here?
- Can't speak now. See you later.

303
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:39,788
- Honey, I was just coming to get you.
- Am I glad to see you.

304
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:43,833
- Yikes. Who's been kissing you?
- Oh, Rachel.

305
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,338
- Who's Rachel?
- Pfister's wife. She went crazy.

306
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:50,090
She was so happy she started kissing me.

307
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,928
Well, this is some colour.
She must be quite a hot tamale.

308
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,433
She is, but you'd never think it.
She's just a little thing.

309
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:09,529
Rachel! We were just talking about you.

310
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:12,241
- This is Rachel.
- How do you do?

311
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:16,995
"As ye sow, so shall ye reap".

312
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,584
Oh!

313
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:26,257
Stop that! You're gonna get me
in trouble with my fiance.

314
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:30,928
It's sad, really. She just can't
keep her hands off of men.

315
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:36,018
- How do I look?
- "Boffo socko", according to Variety.

316
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,104
"Montego Magic Spells Dollars".

317
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,440
- Hmm. How much did we make?
- 12,000.

318
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:46,738
- Did you gamble this week?
- 'Fraid so. You look beautiful in that gown.

319
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:49,490
- How much did we lose?
- 14.

320
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:54,205
- This can't go on, Monty.
- I know, darling. I know.

321
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,083
- What's that?
- Diamond necklace.

322
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,337
- Where did you get it?
- Magic.

323
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:03,632
- It's lovely.
- Everything's gonna change, I promise.

324
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:06,302
So long as you have faith in me.

325
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:11,015
- You're a very persuasive man.
- It's all done with mirrors.

326
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:24,781
Champagne?

327
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:27,451
- Thank you, Pfister.
- Thank you, Pfister.

328
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:35,146
Champagne?

329
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,843
- Where's your son?
- I don't know.

330
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,014
- He was supposed to be here.
- I hope this isn't a stupid prank.

331
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:50,602
- I don't want anything to go wrong.
- Does Aunt Kate know?

332
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:53,939
- What she needs to.
- You know what you're doing?

333
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:57,485
Take care of your part, I'll take care of mine.

334
00:31:57,652 --> 00:32:01,031
The Montego? You're kidding.
You're Montego the magician?

335
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:03,617
- That's my husband.
- I don't believe it!

336
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:07,663
You're kidding me! Are you 
doing some magic tonight?

337
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:12,543
- I always come prepared.
- You don't know what this means to me.

338
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,803
- Since I was a little girl I used to dream...
- Sylvia, darling. Come here, please.

339
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:24,808
- Larry, you remember your old girlfriend?
- Larry, wow! What a surprise.

340
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:29,104
Sylvia, I didn't know you were going
with Charlie. What a surprise.

341
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,524
- Wow.
- Sylvia, I'd like you to meet...

342
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:34,193
- Champagne, miss?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

343
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,530
- Sylvia...
- Champagne, miss?

344
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:39,157
Thank you.

345
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,348
Sylvia, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Vickie.

346
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:42,576
- Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:46,123
- I love your lipstick. What's it called?
- Pink Passion.

348
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,293
Oh, yeah. Well, quit "passion" it around.

349
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,023
What?

350
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:53,257
- Has Larry been flirting with you?
- Charlie.

351
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:55,842
- Charlie, I'm engaged.
- Larry, you want her back?

352
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:58,472
- Charlie!
- I've got my own girl, Charlie.

353
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,767
Just like the old days, cuz?
But we love each other, huh?

354
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:05,563
Madam Katherine!

355
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,234
This house is cursed!

356
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:20,621
They were all godless here.

357
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:24,541
They used to bring their women to this house,

358
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:28,130
brazen, lolling creatures
with their silks and satins.

359
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:32,218
Oh, they filled this house
with laughter and sin.

360
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,513
Laughter and sin...

361
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:41,227
Wicked, blasphemous men
with their painted women.

362
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,982
They revelled in the joys of fleshly love.

363
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,944
Oh, I can still,

364
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:54,660
still hear the echoes of the past.
Oh, what memories!

365
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,206
Hello, darling.

366
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,960
Aunt Kate, this is my fiance, Vickie.

367
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:07,341
- How do you do, Aunt Kate?
- Oh, charming. Charming.

368
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,469
I'm starved. Let's eat.

369
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:13,806
I want you next to me during dinner.

370
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:24,527
Oh, you remind me of me
when I was a little girl.

371
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,991
You're a good girl. I can see it in your eyes.

372
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:32,495
Not like the others. He's chosen wisely.

373
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,332
- Thank you, Aunt Kate.
- You're welcome.

374
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:44,758
I know that one of you is a werewolf.

375
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,146
I saw you in the garden this afternoon.

376
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:10,537
Don't be frightened, dear.
She's a little bit eccentric.

377
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:13,874
Of course, I'm only speaking
to the Abbot family.

378
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,548
My brother John, from whom
you are all descended,

379
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:24,970
was bitten on the back of his neck
by something half animal, half human.

380
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:29,726
From that moment on he was hairy all over.

381
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,060
Oh.

382
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:36,817
I had hoped all these years that 
his disease would not be passed on,

383
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:40,780
but now I see that it was.

384
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:47,455
One of you is preying upon 
the fears of an old woman.

385
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:52,209
Whoever you are, may God strike you dead.

386
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:55,881
Now let's have coffee and 
dessert in the music room.

387
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:19,741
Sh, Toby!

388
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:27,709
Stop it now. Quiet!

389
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,299
What's the matter with you?

390
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,719
There's no one there.

391
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,307
What's got into you?

392
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:48,815
Marriage is a wonderful thing.

393
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,611
My mother never...

394
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:58,576
What I'm about to tell you...

395
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:00,307
First...

396
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:06,252
First, you put your two knees close up tight.

397
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,300
- You mean, you swing them to the left?
- Yes.

398
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:15,762
- And then you swing them to the right?
- Oh, my dear...

399
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,267
You step around the floor,

400
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,061
kind of nice and light.

401
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,815
One, two...

402
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:31,030
And then you twist around and 
twist around with all of your might.

403
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:34,992
Spread your lovin' arms clear out a space.

404
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,539
You do the eagle rock with style and grace.

405
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,749
You put your left foot out

406
00:37:40,915 --> 00:37:42,480
and bring it back

407
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:46,298
and that's what we call "Ballin' the Jack."

408
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:37,773
Spread

409
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:41,193
your lovin' arms way out in space.

410
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,363
Do the eagle rock with style and grace.

411
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:48,284
You put your left foot out and bring it back

412
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,788
and that's what we call "Ballin' the Jack."

413
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:56,293
And that's what we call

414
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,046
Ball...

415
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,632
"Ballin' the Jack"

416
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:05,011
"Ballin' the Jack"

417
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,766
"Ballin' the Jack"

418
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:33,627
Oh, yes, port. Thank you, darling.

419
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,446
Where's Francis Junior?

420
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:42,053
I don't know, Kate. He said
he was coming this aftemoon.

421
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:48,645
- I thought he'd be here for dinner.
- One of my dresses is missing.

422
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:55,194
- Has he been at it again?
- No. No... I...

423
00:39:56,278 --> 00:40:01,993
My son does a wonderful impression
of Aunt Kate. He's got her voice to a T.

424
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,874
And, well... Sometimes he likes to put on
one of Aunt Kate's dresses...

425
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,127
- to entertain at family gatherings.
- I see.

426
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:13,298
You should have seen him 
last Christmas. Such fun!

427
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:18,303
Yes. And when the police dragged him
out of the ladies' room at Saks Fifth Avenue,

428
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:21,349
that was fun.

429
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,321
- Power failure.
- Larry?

430
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:36,053
- Here, honey.
- How exciting!

431
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:38,243
- Who's got a lighter?
- What's that?

432
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,119
Don't touch me!

433
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:45,835
The lights have gone out, madam.

434
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,921
Good old Pfister, soon figured that one out.

435
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,095
Electricity is the work of the devil.

436
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:58,599
I don't trust it at all.

437
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,519
God's paying me back for putting it in.

438
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:05,899
- Come on, Kate. You can't live in the past.
- Oh, shut up.

439
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:09,862
Why am I always being talked 
into things I'll regret later?

440
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:14,950
We should go to bed. We're going 
to be busy, what with the wedding.

441
00:41:15,118 --> 00:41:19,247
- You ready to call it a night, Monty?
- Yes, I'm ready.

442
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:21,376
- Francis?
- I'm ready.

443
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,794
- Susan?
- I'm ready.

444
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:28,925
- Charles?
- Oh, sure, Dad. Count me in, yeah.

445
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:32,846
Sylvia, honey, you ready to go to bed?

446
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,225
I sure am.

447
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:43,108
- How about you, honey?
- Sure, yeah.

448
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:48,197
- How about you, Pfister?
- I'm ready.

449
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:53,036
Pfister, have arrangements been made
in case a blackout should last all night?

450
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:56,999
Miss Rachel is upstairs now
lighting the candles, sir.

451
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:02,213
Thank you for a lovely evening, Kate.
Shall we see you in the morning?

452
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:08,470
Who knows if any of us
shall ever see the morning.

453
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:31,246
Don't let that werewolf business frighten you.

454
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:34,457
She's had werewolves on 
the brain since we were kids.

455
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,585
Wha!

456
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,966
If I get scared I'm getting right into your bed.
I don't care about the rules.

457
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:45,679
So if you wake up with somebody, 
don't worry, it's me.

458
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:49,767
OK. And if I'm not there,
I'll be in Sylvia's room.

459
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,686
Oh, you...

460
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,817
And if you get scared, just remember,

461
00:42:56,982 --> 00:43:00,654
I'm down the hall and nothing'll 
happen to you while I'm here.

462
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,386
OK.

463
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:04,533
Good night, sweetie.

464
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:07,495
- Good night, cookie.
- Good night, my angel cakes.

465
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,586
Larry! Oh, honey...

466
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:17,840
Well, I can't sleep. How do you like that?

467
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:23,680
I have been in there tossing and turning
for hours. How about you, Sylvia?

468
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:27,434
Yeah, I was thanking Larry
for a wonderful evening...

469
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:32,524
and just saying how happy I am for you both.

470
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,693
- Anyway... good night, Larry.
- Good night.

471
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:38,405
- Good night, Vickie.
- Good night, Sylvia.

472
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:40,824
See you in the morning for breakfast?

473
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:42,869
- Yeah.
- Bye.

474
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:44,600
Bye.

475
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,333
Good night, honey.

476
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:50,063
Good night, sweetheart.

477
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,612
Beat it, while you're still healthy.

478
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,000
- Jesus!
- Sh!

479
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,254
Where you been? You're late.
I came looking for you.

480
00:45:06,422 --> 00:45:09,341
I couldn't get away. Where's the body?

481
00:45:09,508 --> 00:45:11,885
- I didn't know where to put her.
- Him.

482
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:15,057
Him. He's in an empty bed on the second floor.

483
00:45:15,222 --> 00:45:19,102
Are you crazy? I can't have the police
snooping around this place.

484
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:22,981
That's your problem. This is too risky.
Just pay me, I'm going.

485
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:26,903
- You goofed up once today.
- Don't blame me.

486
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:30,741
He was in a dress and a wig. How could I know?

487
00:45:30,907 --> 00:45:35,330
- You'll get your money when the job is done.
- I'll get my money tonight.

488
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:39,459
Or I'll tell your whole family
what you're up to.

489
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:44,006
You wouldn't know about the change
in the will if I hadn't told you.

490
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:48,970
- I want Larry Abbot dead.
- Kill him yourself.

491
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:55,352
You wouldn't have to hire people 
like me if you had the guts to kill...

492
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,461
I'm all by myself and I'm very, very scared.

493
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,091
Gee, ain't you a swell little duck?

494
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,971
Are you afraid of werewolves?

495
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:29,683
Are you kidding? The werewolf will eat me up.

496
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:32,769
Would you like to give me a little kiss?

497
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:35,355
I'm a little shy, but OK.

498
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:43,656
Aren't you scared to be
in this great big house?

499
00:46:43,823 --> 00:46:49,621
What? Scared? Are you kidding? 
I'm not afraid of anything.

500
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:54,210
- Uh-oh.
- Sh. Don't be frightened, Vickie.

501
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:57,004
I need your help.

502
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:15,588
Yuck.

503
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:26,205
It's cold in here. Oh, what a day.

504
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:33,464
Why, you little devil. You did it, didn't you?

505
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:39,553
I didn't think you'd have 
the nerve. Oh, darling...

506
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:44,017
What a great gift you're giving to me.

507
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,772
I'll cherish this night for the rest of my life.

508
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:55,739
Say, you're very quiet, aren't you?
What's the matter, honey?

509
00:47:55,905 --> 00:48:01,120
Are you shy? You want me 
to make the first move?

510
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,373
Come here, cookie.

511
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:08,586
Oh, honey...

512
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:15,970
Want to play Donald?

513
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:19,015
Oh, baby, oh...

514
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:23,103
Go slow. Go slow, honey.

515
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,314
Oh, sweetheart.

516
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:33,865
Honey, your little body is frozen.

517
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:36,994
Your legs are like ice.

518
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:42,667
Well, maybe this'll warm you up.

519
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:52,887
Pfister, thank goodness.
Something terrible has happened.

520
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:56,225
- I found cousin Francis in my bed.
- Wearing a dress?

521
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,600
Yes, he was.

522
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,687
Ask him to leave. Say you have a headache.

523
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:04,567
No, you don't understand.
Francis Junior is dead, do you hear?

524
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,195
- He's dead.
- You must be mistaken, sir.

525
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,906
No, come in here, please. I'll show you.

526
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:28,135
- Do you see him?
- I think you'd better take a look, sir.

527
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:37,020
- This can't be.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

528
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:42,944
I'm telling you I felt a cold dead body
lying beside me in bed. Do you understand?

529
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,948
I feel that every night. Warm brandy helps.

530
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:58,670
- Are you sure you'll be all right, sir?
- Mm-hm.

531
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:00,922
Good night, sir.

532
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:04,384
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.

533
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,973
- Beg pardon, sir?
- Nothing, Pfister, thanks. Good night.

534
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,643
Good night, sir.

535
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:19,067
Pleasant dreams.

536
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:30,331
All right, no more nonsense.

537
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:33,793
You were right, honey.
It was just my imagination.

538
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:46,848
Now, you'd think this would frighten me.

539
00:50:47,975 --> 00:50:55,171
Well, it doesn't. Because I know that this is
just a filthy figment of my diseased imagination.

540
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:04,995
And all I have to do to prove it
is simply reach out my hand...

541
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:14,380
and touch it.

542
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:29,231
Don't be a scaredy-cat. There's nothing there.

543
00:51:29,397 --> 00:51:31,734
Just touch it.

544
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:30,654
Larry...

545
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:52,409
Larry...

546
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:47,472
Larry...

547
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:56,398
Larry...

548
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,761
What the hell's going on over there?

549
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:02,598
- That's the Abbot place, isn't it?
- We better take a look.

550
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:31,214
Ah! Who's that?

551
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:33,758
- Pfister!
- Master Larry.

552
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:37,138
Oh, thank goodness. Look, it's cousin Francis.

553
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,388
He's dead!

554
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:44,687
- That's what I was trying to tell you.
- You killed your own cousin.

555
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:48,066
What? Remember I tried to show you a body?

556
00:55:48,232 --> 00:55:50,652
You're the werewolf. I've gotta tell your aunt.

557
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,531
Wait a minute. Will you listen to me?

558
00:55:53,697 --> 00:55:57,952
- Somebody killed him and dragged him here.
- You did, you fiend.

559
00:55:58,118 --> 00:56:01,539
Are you crazy? Will you let me explain to you?

560
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:05,169
There's something fishy
going on here and I don't like it.

561
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:09,131
Now please stop eating
and tell me if everything's all right.

562
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:12,218
- Murderer!
- Yes, everything's fine.

563
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:16,724
- What was that?
- My husband in the cellar, drunk as usual.

564
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:21,353
Oh, yeah? Well, I think we'd better
take a look ourselves.

565
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:26,693
Thank you for the cake, ma'am.

566
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:30,197
You've got the disease,
the curse of the werewolf.

567
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:32,991
The beast is in your blood.

568
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,723
Ow!

569
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:44,463
- Hold it right there.
- What?

570
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:48,802
- Just keep sitting right where you are.
- Sitting?

571
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:51,429
Oh... All right.

572
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:53,724
We heard some hollering down here.

573
00:56:53,889 --> 00:56:55,726
Oh, you mean...

574
00:56:58,436 --> 00:57:04,402
You filthy beast! I'll kill you! Murderer!

575
00:57:06,154 --> 00:57:12,036
- You some kind of crackpot?
- No, I was just going over my lines.

576
00:57:12,203 --> 00:57:15,415
- Who are you?
- Larry Abbot. My aunt lives here.

577
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:20,378
Larry Abbot? Holy smokes.
You mean the radio actor?

578
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:24,134
Yeah, that's me. I was just going over my lines.

579
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:31,225
Murderer!

580
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:36,189
You have to get it right
or the audience won't believe you.

581
00:57:36,356 --> 00:57:39,233
- That was you we heard?
- That was me.

582
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:45,866
I didn't want to disturb the folks upstairs
so I came down here to sit and relax and...

583
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:52,291
...go over my lines.
- What brings you here, Mr Abbot?

584
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:53,707
Getting married.

585
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,086
- Really?
- Yeah, finally gonna do it.

586
00:57:56,253 --> 00:58:00,758
- You boys must know her. Vickie Pearle.
- Hey, that's exciting.

587
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:06,890
Yes, sir. It's the biggest thrill of my life,
I can tell you that. What the...?

588
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:10,853
- What are you doing, Mr Abbot?
- Rats. Something terrible.

589
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:14,106
It's the only drawback really
to rehearsing down here.

590
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:17,861
Have you seen the butler?
He's supposed to be down here.

591
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,990
No, no... I haven't seen him.

592
00:58:21,156 --> 00:58:24,827
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Forget your 
troubles, come on, get happy.

593
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,415
We're gonna chase all your blues away.
Boo, boo, shout hallelujah.

594
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:31,167
Come on, get happy. Get...

595
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,171
ready for the judgement day.

596
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:40,220
Oh. I have to sing in next week's program.

597
00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:45,059
If you don't mind, I'll take a look around
before we go, for safety's sake.

598
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:47,769
- Sure.
- Well, good night for now.

599
00:58:47,936 --> 00:58:49,185
Good night.

600
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:53,193
- Night, Mr Abbot.
- Good night, nice of you boys to drop by.

601
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:54,923
Murderer!

602
00:58:56,195 --> 00:58:59,450
That was phoney. Murderer...

603
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:01,326
Mmm... better.

604
00:59:01,493 --> 00:59:03,870
Why, you filthy beast.

605
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:06,792
- Come on, Bill.
- I'll kill you. Murd...

606
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:19,138
That was a close call. Poor old Pfister.

607
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:23,936
Sorry I had to hit you, old fella.
How you doing?

608
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:28,941
Pfister, do you know where Vickie is?
Pfister, can you hear me?

609
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:32,905
- Pardon.
- Oh, dear.

610
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:23,003
Who is it? Who's there? Is someone there?

611
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:25,380
Pfister, is that you?

612
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:41,941
Madam Kate was right. I saw it.

613
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:45,403
- You saw what, you drunken sot?
- The werewolf.

614
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,656
- What?
- It wasn't Master Larry.

615
01:00:47,823 --> 01:00:51,952
What are you babbling about?
The police were here. Did you know that?

616
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:54,330
- I've got to hide Master Francis.
- What?

617
01:00:54,496 --> 01:00:57,041
Master Larry's innocent. I must hide that body.

618
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,211
- Give me that.
- It's mine.

619
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:02,297
- Give it to me.
- It's my last one.

620
01:01:02,463 --> 01:01:04,258
Pull free.

621
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:09,723
"When the wine runneth red,
it biteth like a serpent".

622
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,031
Vickie!

623
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:40,425
Vickie!

624
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:42,259
Larry...

625
01:01:42,426 --> 01:01:44,553
Ow, this thing's pinching my butt.

626
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,475
Just hang on for a minute, 
Vickie. Hang on. God!

627
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:52,771
I should never have let your 
father talk me into this.

628
01:01:52,938 --> 01:01:58,695
Vickie, would you hold still, please?
I can't control this if you move around.

629
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,367
If you want my opinion, I think
this Strickland thing is a lot of baloney.

630
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,244
Ow!

631
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:08,539
- Could you let me down for a minute?
- Why?

632
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:11,668
- I gotta go to the powder room.
- Vickie!

633
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:15,297
I gotta go to the can. What should I do?

634
01:02:15,463 --> 01:02:18,091
Hold still. Just hold still.

635
01:02:18,257 --> 01:02:20,761
All right. This is gonna be some wedding.

636
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:24,807
A loony for a husband
and Peter Pan for his wife.

637
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:22,164
- Isn't it nice Mr Abbot's getting married?
- Shut up and keep your eyes open.

638
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:25,126
What are they looking for?
They could ruin things.

639
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:29,048
- Dr Strickland didn't have the police, did he?
- I could kill them!

640
01:03:29,213 --> 01:03:33,595
- Don't worry, Dad. There's plenty of time.
- There is not.

641
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,848
- That's my lightning machine.
- Where's Vickie?

642
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:18,145
- She's in the powder room.
- What is that supposed to mean?

643
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,355
I assume she's powdering her nose.

644
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,698
- There's something fishy here.
- That came from the garden.

645
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,824
Come on.

646
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:56,187
- Pfister!
- Master Larry, you did frighten me.

647
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,731
- What have you got there?
- The other body.

648
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:01,444
- What other body?
- He was under your cousin.

649
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,529
I was about to bury them.

650
01:05:03,697 --> 01:05:09,535
- Hey, what's going on over there?
- Get rid of the bodies! They'll think I did it.

651
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:13,999
- They must be around here somewhere.
- There!

652
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,545
Hey, who are you people? What are you doing?

653
01:05:17,712 --> 01:05:21,716
- Stay right where you are.
- We got you covered, so no fast moves.

654
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,388
What the...?

655
01:05:26,013 --> 01:05:30,059
- Mr Abbot.
- Hello there. What a beautiful night, isn't it?

656
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,520
Isn't it romantic?

657
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:37,317
Drifting shadows write the oldest magic word

658
01:05:37,483 --> 01:05:41,781
Oh, to be dancing with the woman 
you love, just before the wedding.

659
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:45,076
Darling...

660
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:53,878
The woman you love? You mean, this is...

661
01:05:54,044 --> 01:05:56,965
Boys, meet Vickie Pearle.

662
01:05:57,131 --> 01:06:02,013
How do you do, Miss Pearle?
Holy mackerel, wait till I tell the kids.

663
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:04,640
Gosh, could I trouble you for an autograph?

664
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,184
Well...

665
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:11,857
- Am I imposing too much, Mr Abbot?
- No, that's all right.

666
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:14,526
- Do you have pencil and paper?
- Sure.

667
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:17,739
- What's your name?
- Bill.

668
01:06:17,905 --> 01:06:20,116
All right.

669
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:25,371
Could you hold the pad steady,
please? There you go, Bill.

670
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:29,294
Thanks, Mr Abbot. That's awfully nice of you.

671
01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:35,132
- Quite all right, Bill.
- We'll leave you two lovebirds alone now.

672
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:42,392
Come on, Mickey. Weren't they nice?
I love show folks. They're so full of life.

673
01:06:45,395 --> 01:06:48,231
I'm ready, Charles.

674
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:55,322
Charles?

675
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:59,118
Charlie? Hey, where'd everybody go?

676
01:06:59,285 --> 01:07:03,332
I woke up in the woodbin
and saw you go to the kitchen.

677
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:06,418
Then this fiend crossed straight in front of me.

678
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:08,421
He couldn't have been more than...

679
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:11,069
Oh my! Pfister!

680
01:07:13,384 --> 01:07:14,885
Help! Someone help!

681
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:17,723
He couldn't have been more than what?

682
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:43,669
Paul! Francis!

683
01:07:46,339 --> 01:07:48,842
Charles!

684
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:29,054
Whoever your werewolf is, he's gone now.

685
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:33,935
I saw him just a few moments ago.
He was standing right here.

686
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,898
Aunt Kate, don't start again
about one of us being a werewolf.

687
01:08:38,064 --> 01:08:41,276
This is the 20th century.
People don't become werewolves.

688
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:44,113
Are you so sure?

689
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,242
- Excuse me. I want to see who they are.
- Don't!

690
01:08:48,409 --> 01:08:52,456
I'm sorry, Francis. Your son is dead.

691
01:08:52,623 --> 01:08:56,669
- He's been murdered.
- Oh, my God.

692
01:08:58,253 --> 01:09:02,467
- Oh, dear God in heaven!
- I'm so sorry, Francis.

693
01:09:02,634 --> 01:09:05,553
- Who was the other man?
- We don't know, Francis.

694
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:09,684
Dr Abbot. Where's Larry?

695
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:14,355
- Aunt Kate saw him here with a werewolf.
- Cut the bullshit.

696
01:09:14,523 --> 01:09:18,485
I just want to know where Larry is.

697
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:24,325
I don't know where Larry is.
If I did I'd tell you, I swear to God.

698
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,131
- There's a homicidal maniac loose.
- Where are the police?

699
01:09:37,297 --> 01:09:40,552
- They're gone. I saw them leave.
- Should I call them?

700
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,346
Yes, you'd better. All right, let's spread out.

701
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:48,852
- Men check the grounds, the women inside.
- Come with me while I call the police.

702
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:51,272
- Kate.
- Go on, find Larry.

703
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,984
I'll stay here with Pfister. Go on.

704
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:56,695
- Are you sure?
- Go on, go on.

705
01:10:27,606 --> 01:10:31,735
Larry, stop whimpering.
Stand up straight like a big boy.

706
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:35,447
You've got to help Mummy.
This is a very special day.

707
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:38,285
Look at your tie. It's all twisted again.

708
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:41,745
Try to keep it straight, honey.
Just a little while longer.

709
01:10:41,913 --> 01:10:46,001
I don't want anything to go wrong today.

710
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:52,633
What are you afraid of? That old lightning?

711
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,598
Lightning can't hurt you, honey.
Everyone knows that.

712
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:50,866
I know it's late, Officer,
but this is an emergency.

713
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:55,955
No. No, I'm not imagining things.

714
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:01,712
I don't care how many times
you've been out here already!

715
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:03,839
Two people have been murdered.

716
01:12:04,006 --> 01:12:08,678
Is that important enough for a phone call
in the middle of the night?

717
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:14,393
Get out here or I'm calling the mayor.
You'll be looking for a job by the morning.

718
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,439
OK. We'll see you in a few minutes, then.

719
01:12:21,777 --> 01:12:26,448
That guy got me angry.
Still, they'll be here in a couple of minutes.

720
01:12:26,616 --> 01:12:29,077
So why don't you just relax, huh?

721
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:34,499
What's the matter? What are you staring at?

722
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:40,881
- Nothing. You were so angry. Good for you.
- Oh, yeah. Here.

723
01:12:56,564 --> 01:12:59,820
Larry isn't the only actor in the family.

724
01:13:09,372 --> 01:13:14,544
- You filthy, murdering skunk.
- I was just trying to earn a buck.

725
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,977
I'm the good boy, not cousin Larry.

726
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:46,190
I'm smarter than cousin Larry.

727
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:51,530
I'm better-looking than cousin Larry.

728
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:56,243
And I'm gonna be a hell of a lot richer.

729
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:16,475
That vase cost me 5,000 dollars.
There are only three like it in the world.

730
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:20,479
- Two.
- You... Two.

731
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:22,982
Hold this. Oh, well.

732
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,673
Oh.

733
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:32,451
- Darling...
- Let's get on with this wedding, my dears.

734
01:15:33,702 --> 01:15:37,916
And do you, Vickie Pearle, take this 
man to love, honour and cherish...

735
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:41,211
- until death do you part?
- I do.

736
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:47,718
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

737
01:15:53,766 --> 01:15:56,145
Wait! Oh, wait.

738
01:15:56,311 --> 01:16:00,399
Before this moment is over
I want to say that this house...

739
01:16:00,566 --> 01:16:06,615
has been under a cloud of 
darkness for so many years...

740
01:16:06,782 --> 01:16:11,621
and now, at last, the cloud has pissed...

741
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,666
passed.

742
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:19,629
Passed.

743
01:16:19,795 --> 01:16:24,468
Yes, oh... I mean... Ah, I mean...

744
01:16:24,635 --> 01:16:28,473
the cloud has passed away.

745
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:34,647
Oh, it's gone, it's finished.
The cloud has just really passed.

746
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:37,358
- Run along, you two.
- Goodbye, Aunt Kate.

747
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:42,196
- We love you.
- And have a happy, happy honeymoon.

748
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:47,410
Tune in next week when Manhattan Mystery
Theatre presents Your Mummy's Calling,

749
01:16:47,578 --> 01:16:51,916
brought to you by Ralston Purina,
makers of Purina Dog Chow.

750
01:16:52,082 --> 01:16:54,502
We're a little late, so good night, folks.

751
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:58,048
OK, you two lovebirds,
let's get this show on the road.

752
01:16:59,174 --> 01:17:03,721
I said "pissed". Did you hear?
I said "pissed" on the radio.

753
01:17:04,763 --> 01:17:09,520
- Here you are.
- Thank you. Bye.

754
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:15,109
Oh, you... Goodbye, goodbye. Oh, goodbye.

755
01:17:15,274 --> 01:17:21,575
I don't believe it. They got married on the radio
and now they're getting married in real life.

756
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:25,371
- Call me tomorrow, honey!
- Get the hell outta here!

757
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:32,213
Sometimes in small ways

758
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:34,214
We may not agree

759
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:37,510
But we will weather 
Our chips together

760
01:17:37,676 --> 01:17:39,888
Wait and see

761
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:45,685
Before you all settle back into
the cosy comfort of a happy ending,

762
01:17:45,853 --> 01:17:48,563
let me ask you one question.

763
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:52,401
Are you so sure that our story has ended?

764
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,654
Mmm?

765
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:58,033
Until next time, this is your host

766
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:03,498
wishing you pleasant dreams.

767
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:48,560
And then you twist around and 
twist around with all of your might.

768
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:52,522
Spread your lovin' arms, clear out a space.

769
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:56,068
You do the eagle rock with style and grace.

770
01:20:56,234 --> 01:20:58,279
You put your left foot out

771
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:00,009
and bring it back.

772
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:03,826
And that's what we call "Ballin' the Jack".

773
01:21:51,214 --> 01:21:55,302
Spread...

774
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:58,723
Your lovin' arms way out in space.

775
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:01,893
Do the eagle rock with style and grace.

776
01:22:02,058 --> 01:22:05,814
You put your left foot out and bring it back.

777
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:09,318
And that's what we call "Ballin' the Jack".

778
01:22:09,483 --> 01:22:13,823
And that's what we call

779
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,576
Ball...

780
01:22:16,742 --> 01:22:19,162
"Ballin' the Jack".

781
01:22:20,455 --> 01:22:22,541
"Ballin' the Jack".

782
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,296
"Ballin' the Jack".
