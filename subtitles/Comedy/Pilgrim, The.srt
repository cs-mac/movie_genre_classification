1
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:40,475
Scott Pilgrim is
dating a high-schooler?

2
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:42,781
Really? Is she hot?

3
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,182
How old are you now,
Scott? Like, 28?

4
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:47,083
I'm not playing your
little games, kids.

5
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:49,554
So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.

6
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:52,285
I'm 22.

7
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,761
And you're dating a high-school
girl. Not bad, not bad.

8
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:58,829
Thank you, thank you.

9
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,268
So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?

10
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:05,701
We have done many things.

11
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,240
We ride the bus together.

12
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,671
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

13
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:14,839
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

14
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:16,681
Have you
even kissed her?

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,150
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

16
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,550
Well, aren't you
pleased as punch.

17
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:21,781
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,913
So, what's her name?

19
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:25,625
Knives Chau.

20
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:27,587
She's Chinese.

21
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,423
Wicked.

22
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,691
So, when do we
get to meet her?

23
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,323
Oh, please,
let it be soon.

24
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,261
That's for me.

25
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:39,905
Hi.
You promise to be good?

26
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,168
Of course I'll be good.

27
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,502
Seriously,
please be good.

28
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,175
Am I normally not?

29
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,906
Hey, Knives, this is Stephen
Stills. He's the talent.

30
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,276
Hey.

31
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,074
Is she gonna
geek out on us?

32
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,278
She'll just sit
in the corner, man.

33
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,418
I mean, I want her
to geek out on us.

34
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,720
She'll geek. She geeks.
She has the capacity to geek.

35
00:01:58,792 --> 00:01:59,952
Okay.

36
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,353
You're good.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,858
Wow.

38
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:08,959
Here, let me
get your coat.

39
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,264
Hi.

40
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:11,804
Knives, that's Kim.

41
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:14,067
Sorry,
what was your name?

42
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,397
Kim.

43
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,103
And you play the drums?

44
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:18,869
Yes.

45
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,811
That is so awesome.

46
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,642
Knives, that's Young Neil.

47
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,211
Hi.

48
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,679
Hi.

49
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,548
What do you play?

50
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:34,323
<i>Wow, Zelda, Tetris.</i>

51
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,922
That's kind of
a big question.

52
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,231
<i>Okay, let's start
with Launchpad McQuack.</i>

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,790
That's not
the actuaI title of the...

54
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,632
We are Sex Bob-Omb!

55
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,137
One, two, three, four!

56
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,477
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:55,838
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

58
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,847
<i>Laminate the stasis</i>

59
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,752
<i>Mama, mama serpentine</i>

60
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:04,416
<i>I got a breathalyzer</i>

61
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,925
<i>And my body's clean</i>

62
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,094
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

63
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:43,252
<i>Thank you!</i>

64
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:06,576
<i>Get ready</i>

65
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,714
<i>Yeah</i>

66
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,030
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

67
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,609
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

68
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:37,411
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

69
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,849
<i>Yeah!</i>

70
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:46,989
You guys are so

71
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:51,227
amazing.

72
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,731
She seems nice.
Yeah.

73
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,891
Yeah, she seems awesome.

74
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,157
Yeah.

75
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,726
Scott, if your life had
a face, I would punch it.

76
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,863
Yeah. Wait, what?

77
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,875
I mean, are you really happy
or are you really eviI?

78
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,307
Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?

79
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,539
I'm offended, Kim.

80
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,807
Wounded, even?

81
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:09,406
Hurt, Kim.

82
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,950
You? Hurt?

83
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,450
Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome. "

84
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,220
Yeah, she seems awesome.

85
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,552
Yeah.

86
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:24,693
Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,

87
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:26,323
yes, I'm dating
a 17-year-old.

88
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,958
Oh, is he cute?

89
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:31,366
Does this mean we have
to stop sleeping together?

90
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:33,736
You see another bed in here?

91
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:36,876
Yeah. You're totally
my bitch forever.

92
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,018
So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.

93
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,818
Hey, you know me.

94
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,085
I mean, don't tell my sister.

95
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,053
You know me.

96
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:56,355
Who are you texting?

97
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,932
Seventeen years old?
ScandaI!

98
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,696
That's not true.
Who told you?

99
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:03,793
Wallace. Duh.

100
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,132
That gossipy bitch.

101
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,597
You know me.

102
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:07,662
Wallace!

103
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,800
Who is this
mystery child you date?

104
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,071
Her name's Knives Chau.
She's Chinese.

105
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,341
A 17-year-old Chinese
schoolgirI? You're ridiculous.

106
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,975
It's a Catholic school, too.

107
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:20,349
With the uniform
and everything?

108
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:21,784
Yeah. The whole deaI.

109
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:24,447
Oh, my God.
You guys haven't...

110
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:27,254
No, no, no, no. We haven't
even held hands yet.

111
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,352
I think she hugged me once.

112
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,488
Scott,
why are you doing this?

113
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:35,228
I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.

114
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,735
It's been over a year
since you got dumped

115
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,067
by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named.
So...

116
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,835
Are you
legitimately moving on

117
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,603
or is this just
you being insane?

118
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,638
Can I get back
to you on that?

119
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,650
I do not wanna
be here at all.

120
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:52,742
This school
has boys, too.

121
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:57,349
I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.

122
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:58,618
Well, she's only
allowed out

123
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,751
when the sun is up,
so I wouldn’t call it dating.

124
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,160
It's more like...
Playtime?

125
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,891
That doesn't sound so good, either. No.

126
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,125
Scott!

127
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,555
Hey, Knives.

128
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,727
This is my cool, gay
roommate, Wallace Wells.

129
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:10,963
Hi.
He's gay.

130
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:13,739
Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?

131
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,331
Yes, does he wear glasses?

132
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:17,639
Wallace, you go now. Begone.

133
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,707
You're too good
for him. Run.

134
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,116
<i>Get ready!</i>

135
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,812
<i>Here we go!</i>

136
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,355
<i>Did you know that the original
name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?</i>

137
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,694
You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

138
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,199
<i>but it actually comes from the
Japanese phrase "paku-paku, "</i>

139
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,997
which means, "to flap one's
mouth open and closed. "

140
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:45,830
They changed it
because they thought that

141
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,669
<i>"Puck-Man" would be
too easy to vandalize.</i>

142
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:48,867
You know,
people could just scratch off

143
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,569
the "P" and turn it
into an "F" or whatever.

144
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:54,238
Oh, my God! Like, wow!

145
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,643
<i>Combo!</i>

146
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,276
Yeah. Wow.

147
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,412
<i>Continue?</i>

148
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:06,858
<i>Nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,</i>

149
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,258
<i>three...
Oh, I got it.</i>

150
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:09,556
<i>...two, one.</i>

151
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,425
I don't listen
to that much music.

152
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:18,630
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

153
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,307
You guys rock.

154
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,899
Well, I knew
I personally rocked,

155
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:25,570
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

156
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,805
So, thank you, Knives.

157
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,144
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

158
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,982
Well, we're already
pretty big,

159
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,575
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

160
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,882
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

161
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,684
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:40,090
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

163
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,596
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

164
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,130
Thank you, Julie.

165
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,755
Are you coming
to my party Friday,

166
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,700
or will you be
busy babysitting?

167
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,465
Thank you, Julie.

168
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,097
You don't want
to listen to her.

169
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,974
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

170
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,738
Oh, I heart them so much.

171
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,339
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major labeI,

172
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,147
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

173
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,743
But that's just me.

174
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:11,257
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

175
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:12,882
Sorry, you were
saying about me?

176
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,894
I mean, I've never gone
out with anyone so talented.

177
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,289
Go out with
a lot of guys?

178
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,353
No.

179
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,760
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

180
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,699
I've never even
kissed a guy.

181
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,734
Hey,

182
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,770
me, neither.

183
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,419
Here you go.

184
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,855
So, this is
your secret lair?

185
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:46,654
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

186
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,720
My secret lair
is one of those

187
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,559
"No girls allowed"- type
deals.

188
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:52,890
Okay.

189
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,456
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

190
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,126
Sure!
Come on.

191
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,395
There you go.

192
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,204
Wow.

193
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,565
Yeah.

194
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,908
Wow.

195
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:14,920
Oh, God.

196
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,184
So alone.

197
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,226
You're not alone.

198
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,724
What?

199
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,527
You're just having
some idiotic dream.

200
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,195
Does that mean
we can make out?

201
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,066
Oh, God!

202
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:32,161
What is it, Scott?

203
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,399
I had this
totally weird dream.

204
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:34,701
Oh, God.

205
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:36,002
What is it,
Other Scott?

206
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:39,407
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

207
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,741
But there was this girl.

208
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,143
Girt?

209
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,705
Was this
an Envy-related dream?

210
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,375
We don't use
the E-word in this house.

211
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:48,512
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

212
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,579
Yay for that.

213
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,851
Speaking of new,

214
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,825
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

215
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:55,486
to the library
a half-hour ago?

216
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,059
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

217
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,259
Shh!

218
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,933
It's weird.

219
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,562
What's weird?

220
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,403
Libraries remind me
of grade school.

221
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,909
That must seem like
a really long time ago.

222
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,605
Yeah, let's talk
about something else.

223
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,196
Do you know that girl?

224
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,202
Scott!
What?

225
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:40,071
You only played one note
for that entire song.

226
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,166
My hand slipped.

227
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,971
Is your girlfriend
distracting you?

228
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,839
My girlfriend?

229
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,243
I'll be quieter.

230
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,609
Let's do that one again.

231
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,977
Sorry, what are we doing?

232
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,382
I told you, like, 50 times!

233
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,283
We're going
to this party, retard.

234
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,515
Party?
At Julie's.

235
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,614
I thought
you guys split up.

236
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:00,159
We did, but there might be some
labeI guys there, so, you know...

237
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,126
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

238
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,356
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

239
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:05,523
Oh, man!

240
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,725
This sucks!

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,892
Sucks!

242
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,994
I'm gonna go pee
due to boredom.

243
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,572
I have to pee.

244
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,232
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

245
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,775
and I think that you
should market your sound

246
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:19,334
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

247
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,401
Hey, Comeau.

248
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,311
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

249
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,213
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

250
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,581
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

251
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,018
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

252
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,453
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

253
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,581
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

254
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,348
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

255
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,859
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

256
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,919
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

257
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,294
What?
Oh, Scott.

258
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,492
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

259
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,000
I hear that she's
a little hardcore.

260
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,040
Hey, what's up?

261
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,467
Nothing.

262
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,877
<i>Hey, you know Pac-Man?</i>

263
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,437
I know of him.

264
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:33,083
<i>Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.</i>

265
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,681
They changed it because...

266
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,882
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

267
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,391
<i>"Paku-paku" means
"flap your mouth,"</i>

268
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,020
and that they were afraid
people would change...

269
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:46,896
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

270
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,763
Yeah, that's amazing.

271
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,326
Um...

272
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,700
Am I dreaming?

273
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,767
I'll leave you alone
forever now.

274
00:13:58,845 --> 00:13:59,903
Thanks.

275
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,444
Dude!
What?

276
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,783
She's totally reaI!
Who?

277
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,414
Ramona Flowers.
What?

278
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,550
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

279
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,287
AII I know is
that she is American.

280
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,419
American.

281
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:17,929
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

282
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,055
They know a lot more.

283
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,259
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

284
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,631
I heard she has
a boyfriend.

285
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,101
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

286
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:25,895
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

287
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:28,406
I heard she kicks
all kinds of ass.

288
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,000
She's on another leveI.

289
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,977
She has men
dying at her feet.

290
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,674
She's got some
battle scars, dude.

291
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,272
What about Ramona Flowers?

292
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,339
You know her?
Tell me now.

293
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,407
She just moved here.

294
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,044
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

295
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,110
Does she really?

296
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,849
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

297
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:44,981
Did she really?

298
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,320
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

299
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,381
Did they really?

300
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,860
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

301
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,897
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

302
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,160
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

303
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,361
even if you haven't had a
reaI girlfriend in over a year.

304
00:14:57,537 --> 00:15:00,665
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

305
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,699
He's totally dating
a high-schooler.

306
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,744
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

307
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:05,971
She's got a point.

308
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,137
I thought
you guys broke up.

309
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,977
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

310
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,609
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

311
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:14,152
That's completely untrue.

312
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,017
That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.

313
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,023
That time with Hollie? That
wasn't what it looked like.

314
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,149
That time you
dumped Kim for...

315
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,988
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

316
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:25,822
Whatever! Ramona's out of your
league. Let's just leave it at that.

317
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,197
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

318
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:30,429
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

319
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:31,970
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

320
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,366
Forget it, Scott!

321
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,772
Guess who's drunk?

322
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,073
I guess Wallace.

323
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:42,939
You guess right.

324
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:47,984
So, that girl
from my dream...

325
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:49,351
GirI. Okay.

326
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:50,855
I saw her at the library.

327
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,552
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

328
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,493
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

329
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:57,825
Hey, there he is.

330
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:58,886
I think she's...

331
00:15:58,965 --> 00:15:59,989
I think he's...

332
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,227
I think she's
the girl of my dreams.

333
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:03,291
Mmm.

334
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,767
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

335
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,568
I've never been
so sure about something.

336
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,131
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

337
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:11,500
What's that?

338
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:14,547
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

339
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:15,945
I'm not getting it, friend.

340
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:18,945
You're thinking of
juggling two chicks?

341
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,076
Not even!

342
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,485
Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

343
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:23,613
Wait, who told you?

344
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,987
Wallace. Duh!

345
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,787
He's not even conscious.
Whatever.

346
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,795
You of all people should know
how sucky it is to get cheated on.

347
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,023
Don't you have
a job to do?

348
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,861
You're right. I should send
out a mass text about this. Bye.

349
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:39,032
Wallace,
how do you do that?

350
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:40,402
Wallace!

351
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,332
Amazon. ca,
what's the website for that?

352
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:45,870
"Amazon. ca. "

353
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,243
I have to order
something really cool.

354
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,975
<i>You've got mail.</i>

355
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,448
Dude, this thing
claims I have mail.

356
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,015
It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.

357
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,549
Dude, now I'm reading it.

358
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:56,987
So happy for you.

359
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:59,625
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, it
has come to my attention

360
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,023
"that we will be
fighting soon.

361
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:04,120

362
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:09,359
<i>"Fair warning... Mano y mano...

363
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:15,234
This is...
This is... This is...

364
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,668
What?

365
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,643
This is boring.

366
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:20,705
Delete.

367
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:25,675
Scott,

368
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,110
are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?

369
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,817
Maybe.

370
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,950
It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.

371
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,460
You were saying?

372
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:37,654
Attack hug!
Hey!

373
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,790
Attack hug. That's so cute. So cute.

374
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:41,856
You don't remember?

375
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,529
You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

376
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:46,266
How could I
possibly forget?

377
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,739
Yearbook club
is so boring.

378
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,074
I cannot believe the music
they put on while we work.

379
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,170
That's sucky.

380
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,410
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

381
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,781
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

382
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:00,876
I tell you.

383
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:03,646
<i>Bad!</i>

384
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,516
<i>Bad!</i>

385
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,318
<i>Bad!</i>

386
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:09,586
<i>Bad!</i>

387
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:11,387
<i>Bad!</i>

388
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,659
Okay. I'm sorry,
that was all me.

389
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,062
<i>Solo round!</i>

390
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,924
Uh-oh.

391
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:18,529
Nega ninja.

392
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,094
<i>Nega ninja!</i>

393
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,498
I can never get
past that guy.

394
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,567
Don't beat
yourself up about it.

395
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,838
<i>Game over!</i>

396
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:28,210
Do you want
to keep going?

397
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,681
<i>Continue? Nine, eight,</i>

398
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,810
<i>seven, six, five...

399
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:34,944
<i>...four, three...</i>

400
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,352
I think that we should...

401
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,356
<i>...two, one.</i>

402
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,164
<i>Game on, everybody.
Game on.</i>

403
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,561
<i>I got us a show.</i>

404
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:50,897
Oh, my gosh, when?

405
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,299
Wednesday.

406
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,034
The Rockit. And even
better, it's the T.I.B.B.

407
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,097
Whoa!

408
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,699
The Toronto InternationaI
Battle of the Bands?

409
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:58,766
That's right.

410
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,405
This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"

411
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,210
And I was like,
"I'm in a band. "

412
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:04,943
And he was like,
"You're in a band?"

413
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,350
And I was like, "Yeah,
I am totally in a band. "

414
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,512
Great story, man.

415
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:09,953
Is there a prize
or something?

416
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,450
Only a record deaI
with G-Man Graves.

417
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,990
Who's that?
You don't know?

418
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,858
Indie producer
of the millennium.

419
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,085
Oh.

420
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:22,964
If we win, it won't just be
Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

421
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,630
It'll be the cool kids, too.

422
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:26,729
I promise

423
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:30,572
I will do everything I can to get
out of the study group and come.

424
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:33,206
I have to pee.

425
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,871
Oh, my gosh,
who are you battling?

426
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:36,641
Crash and the Boys.

427
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:39,446
That one band
with Crash, and those boys?

428
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,679
Yeah, that's the one.

429
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:41,913
I hate them.

430
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,285
Oh, my gosh,
I hate them, too.

431
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,380
Yeah, they suck.

432
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:45,446
They suck bad.

433
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:13,917
Hey!

434
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,422
Hey!

435
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,668
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

436
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,363
Hi, I was thinking
about asking you out,

437
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,201
but then I realized
how stupid that would be.

438
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:35,805
So, do you want
to go out sometime?

439
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,975
No, that's okay. You can
just sign for this, all right?

440
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:41,013
I just woke up, and
you were in my dream.

441
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,913
I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?

442
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,242
It's not weird at all.

443
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,342
It's not?

444
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,716
No, it's just that you
have this really convenient

445
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,812
subspace highway running through
your head that I like to use.

446
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,413
It's, like,
three miles in 15 seconds.

447
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,480
Right, right.

448
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,321
I forgot you guys
don't have that in Canada.

449
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:55,616
You don't
remember me, do you?

450
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:56,821
We met at the party
the other day.

451
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:58,893
<i>Were you the Pac-Man guy?
No.</i>

452
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,956
Not even.
That was some total ass.

453
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,657
I was the other guy.

454
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:04,965
You know, you need to sign
for this, whatever this is.

455
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,197
But if I sign for it,
you'll leave.

456
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:07,398
Yeah, it's how it works.

457
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:09,407
Okay, well, maybe,

458
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,273
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

459
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,313
You're the new kid
on the block, right?

460
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,613
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

461
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,553
You want me to
hang out with you?

462
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,714
Yeah, if that's cool.

463
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:29,059
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

464
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:31,961
So, yeah, 8:00?

465
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:37,061
Why are you just
standing there?

466
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,237
Dude, I'm totally
waiting on you.

467
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:41,796
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

468
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,705
Oh, you assumed wrong.

469
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:47,107
So, how did you
end up in Toronto?

470
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,511
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

471
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:49,979
Yeah.

472
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,676
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

473
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,242
Toronto was one of
the great cities, so...

474
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,345
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

475
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,419
He's a friend.

476
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,188
Was he your boyfriend?

477
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,723
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

478
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:07,163
It's so not
interesting to me.

479
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,999
So, what about you?
What do you do?

480
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,094
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.

481
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,263
Between what and what?

482
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,437
Well, my last job was a
long story filled with sighs.

483
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,642
I know plenty of those.

484
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:22,976
Is that why you
left New York?

485
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,641
Pretty much.

486
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,742
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

487
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,947
Well, it's certainly
chilled here.

488
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,215
Yeah.

489
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,621
It's chilled, as in cold.

490
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,154
Yeah.

491
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:39,622
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, ApriI?

492
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,791
I know.

493
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,834
I can barely see you.

494
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,598
This whole thing is
an unmitigated disaster.

495
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:49,505
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

496
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,440
So this is a date, eh?

497
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,477
Did I say date?

498
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,470
Slip of the tongue.

499
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,106
Tongue.

500
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:59,708
Anyway,
night's not over yet.

501
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,719
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

502
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:02,811
A thingy?

503
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,518
A door.

504
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,056
Come on.

505
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,007
What kind of tea
do you want?

506
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,575
There's more
than one kind?

507
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,340
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

508
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:33,544
green tea,
green tea with lemon,

509
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,143
green tea with lemon and
honey, liver disaster,

510
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,552
ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

511
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,590
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

512
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,956
vanilla-walnut,
Constant Comment

513
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,591
and EarI Grey.

514
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,462
Did you make
some of those up?

515
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,964
I think I'll have
Sleepytime.

516
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,632
That sounds good to me.

517
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:51,929
Let me get you a blanket.

518
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,206
That would
actually be awesome.

519
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:07,011
Dude, I'm changing.

520
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,883
Sorry. I'm just cold.

521
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:12,014
Here, does that help?

522
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:14,753
Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

523
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,528
Okay.

524
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,747
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

525
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,078
I guess.

526
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,712
Maybe we should both get
under it, since we're so cold.

527
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,047
What about our tea?

528
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,326
I can

529
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,126
not have tea.

530
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,664
I changed my mind.

531
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,369
Changed it to what?
From what?

532
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:07,935
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

533
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,844
Okay.

534
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,213
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

535
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,808
You can sleep in my bed.

536
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:16,787
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

537
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:20,451
Well, this is nice.
Just this.

538
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,994
It's been, like,
a really long time,

539
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:25,496
so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,

540
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:27,657
so thank you.

541
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,502
You're welcome.

542
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:37,965
Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?

543
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,739
For one thing, I didn't even
get any. That was a joke.

544
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,941
What did you
have in mind?

545
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,016
Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.

546
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,313
You have a band?

547
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:48,683
Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?

548
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:50,652
Sure.

549
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,920
Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?

550
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:57,462
Wow. GirI number.

551
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,027
See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.

552
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:01,966
Hey, it's tonight. At the...

553
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,700
Hey. You totally came.

554
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,838
Yes. I did totally come.

555
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,643
Please excuse my brother.
He is chronically enfeebled.

556
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,152
I'm Stacey.
Hey.

557
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,813
This is Wallace, his roommate. Hey.

558
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,151
This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.

559
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:26,213
Hey.

560
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,316
Oh, and this is Knives.

561
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,123
Hey!
Hey!

562
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,426
So, do you like?

563
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,493
Well, I...

564
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,575
Have to go.

565
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:57,147
<i>Okay, this next band
is from Brampton,</i>

566
00:26:57,223 --> 00:27:00,784
<i>and they are
Crash and the Boys.</i>

567
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:03,928
God! This is a nightmare.

568
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,262
Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

569
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,732
Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.

570
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:12,237
We were just on stage for sound
check, and the sound guy hated us.

571
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:15,535
It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.

572
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:16,768
People love us, right?

573
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,104
Oh, man, this is bad.

574
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:20,669
This is so, so bad.

575
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:23,972
Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?

576
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:27,544
They have not
started playing yet.

577
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,185
<i>That was a test, Jimmy.
One, two.</i>

578
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,821
You passed.

579
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,322
Okay.

580
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:34,654
<i>Good evening.</i>

581
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:37,059
<i>My name is Crash.
These are the Boys.</i>

582
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,824
Is that girl a boy, too?

583
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:39,887
<i>Yes.</i>

584
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,162
They have a girl drummer?

585
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:47,797
<i>This song is called I Am So
Sad, I Am So Very Very Sad.</i>

586
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,272
<i>Goes a little
something like this.</i>

587
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,569
<i>So sad!</i>

588
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,939
<i>Thank you.</i>

589
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:59,412
It's not a race, guys.

590
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:00,975
<i>All right, this next song
goes out to the guy</i>

591
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:02,543
<i>who keeps yelling
from the balcony.</i>

592
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,747
<i>It's called
We Hate You, Please Die.</i>

593
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:06,688
Sweet. Love this one.

594
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:19,331
<i>I can feel
ya, I can hear ya...</i>

595
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:36,113
<i>Thank you.</i>

596
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,951
So, how do you know Scott?

597
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,585
He's a friend.

598
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:45,154
It's hard for me
to keep track sometimes,

599
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,357
because he has
so many friends.

600
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:52,066
Knives,
how did you meet Scott?

601
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,365
Well...

602
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:55,299
<i>Oh, no.</i>

603
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:59,843
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

604
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:03,813
We need to play
now and loud.

605
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:04,940
Okay.

606
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:08,384
So, I was on the bus
with my mom...

607
00:29:10,322 --> 00:29:12,347
Is that seriously
the end of the story?

608
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:13,851
Oh, my gosh!

609
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:14,915
<i>Okay.</i>

610
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:16,086
They're on!

611
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:18,061
<i>This next band
is from Toronto.</i>

612
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,693
<i>And, yeah.
Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

613
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,634
I heart you,
Sex Bob-Omb!

614
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:29,569
Scott, are you ready?

615
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,109
Okay. Kim? Are you...

616
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:34,873
We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!

617
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:45,690
<i>I'll take you for a ride</i>

618
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:48,858
<i>On my garbage truck</i>

619
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,553
<i>Oh, no</i>

620
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,863
<i>I'll take you to the dump</i>

621
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,466
<i>'Cause you're my queen</i>

622
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,898
<i>I'll take you uptown</i>

623
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:09,003
<i>I'll show you the sites
You know you wanna ride</i>

624
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,978
<i>On my garbage truck</i>

625
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,176
<i>Truck, truck, truck</i>

626
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:18,656
<i>We'll pass the mansions by</i>

627
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:22,160
<i>Drive right through
the needle's eye</i>

628
00:30:22,227 --> 00:30:23,319
<i>Oh, my</i>

629
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:24,487
<i>Oh, no... My...</i>

630
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,689
<i>My, my, my, my</i>

631
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,926
<i>I've got a stereo</i>

632
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:36,064
<i>You've just got
to turn the knob</i>

633
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:39,406
<i>And maybe we'll go</i>

634
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:41,673
<i>As far as we can</i>

635
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:44,744
<i>I'll be your garbage man</i>

636
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:48,617
<i>I'll take out your junk</i>

637
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,016
<i>And I'll crush it...</i>

638
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,786
Mr. Pilgrim.

639
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:59,961
It is I, Matthew PateI.

640
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,666
Consider our fight begun.

641
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:06,536
What did I do?

642
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,865
What do I do?

643
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:12,837
Fight!

644
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:27,221
All right.

645
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,355
All right.

646
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,989
Watch out!
It's that one guy.

647
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,358
Well, well, well,

648
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:11,425
you're quite the opponent,
Pilgrim.

649
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,970
Who the hell
are you, anyway?

650
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,007
My name is Matthew PateI!

651
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:21,812
And I'm Ramona's
first eviI ex-boyfriend.

652
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:24,738
Her what?

653
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:27,785
Anyone need another drink?

654
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:41,289
Wait. We're fighting
over Ramona?

655
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,728
Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?

656
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,161
I skimmed it.

657
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:47,460
Mmm-mmm.

658
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,007
You will pay for
your insolence!

659
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,797
Hey, what's up
with his outfit?

660
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:19,668
Yeah, is he a pirate?

661
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:21,598
Are you a pirate?

662
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,106
Pirates are in this year.

663
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,975
You really went out
with this guy?

664
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:36,884
Yeah.

665
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,981
In the seventh grade.

666
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,184
And?

667
00:33:45,497 --> 00:33:48,398
It was football season
and for some reason,

668
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,128
all the little jocks
wanted me.

669
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:54,866
<i>Matthew was the only
non-white, non-jock boy in town.</i>

670
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,603
<i>So, the two of us joined
forces and we took 'em all down.</i>

671
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:02,272
<i>We brawled and scrapped
and fought for hours.</i>

672
00:34:02,347 --> 00:34:04,508
<i>Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers.</i>

673
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:07,274
We only kissed once.

674
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:10,515
After a week and a half,
I told him to hit the showers.

675
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:13,188
Dude, wait.
MysticaI powers?

676
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:19,119
You'll pay for this, Flowers.

677
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:22,900
<i>If you want to fight me</i>

678
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,026
What?

679
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,829
<i>Ha! You're not the brightest</i>

680
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:32,103
<i>You won't know what
hit you in the slightest</i>

681
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:38,442
This guy's good.

682
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:40,849
<i>Me and my fireballs</i>

683
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:43,650
<i>My Demon Hipster Chicks</i>

684
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,253
Tell him, Matty.
Tell him, Matty.

685
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,491
<i>I'm talking the talk</i>

686
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,585
<i>Because I know I'm slick</i>

687
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:51,924
<i>S-L-ick</i>

688
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:54,296
<i>Fireballs</i>

689
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,734
<i>Take this sucker down</i>

690
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:05,073
<i>Let us show him
what we're all about</i>

691
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,310
That doesn't even rhyme.

692
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:13,712
<i>This is impossible.
How can this be?</i>

693
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:16,982
<i>Open your eyes,
maybe you'll see.</i>

694
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,948
<i>K-O!</i>

695
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:30,761
Sweet! Coins.

696
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,630
God, is that allowed?

697
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,367
Well, it was nice
meeting you.

698
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,909
Tell your gay friends
I said bye.

699
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,444
Gay friends?

700
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,840
Wallace! Again?

701
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:45,179
Get a room, guys!
Oh, my God!

702
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,579
Oh, man, $2.40? That's not
even enough for the bus home.

703
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:51,849
I'll lend you
the 35 cents.

704
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:55,484
<i>Yeah, so, Sex Bob-Omb wins.</i>

705
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,294
Sex Bob-Omb won?

706
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:09,929
So, what was
all that all about?

707
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:14,068
I guess

708
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:18,339
if we're gonna date, you may
have to defeat my seven eviI exes.

709
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,679
You have seven
eviI ex-boyfriends?

710
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:20,945
Seven eviI exes, yes.

711
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,577
And I have to fight...
Defeat.

712
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:27,148
Defeat your seven eviI exes if
we're going to continue to date?

713
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:28,283
Pretty much.

714
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,059
So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?

715
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,424
I guess.

716
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:37,627
Does that mean
we can make out?

717
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,959
Sure.

718
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:41,164
CooI.

719
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,112
Someone's happy.

720
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:55,551
Well, someone got to
second base last night.

721
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,885
And someone has
a second date tonight.

722
00:36:58,957 --> 00:37:00,515
Someone's lucky, then.

723
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,791
You know when I say
"someone," I mean "me," right?

724
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,261
I got to second base
last night.

725
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:07,791
Maybe first-and-a-half.

726
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:14,897
So, I invited Ramona over for
dinner tonight, so you can't be here.

727
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,497
I don't want you
gaying up the place.

728
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,172
Okay, Scott.

729
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:22,905
But in return, I have
to issue an ultimatum.

730
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:24,648
One of your
famous ultimatums?

731
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:26,581
It may live in infamy.

732
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:31,647
You have to break up with
Knives, that poor angeI, today.

733
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:35,888
But it's hard.

734
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,429
If you don't, I'm going to
tell Ramona about Knives.

735
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:39,521
I swear to God, Scott.

736
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:40,656
What? You...

737
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,490
Hi. Morning.

738
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,228
Hey, Jimmy.
Double standard!

739
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:45,735
I didn't make up
the gay rulebook.

740
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,203
You got a problem with it...
Stop.

741
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,772
Take it up with
Liberace's ghost.

742
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,898
You're a monster.

743
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:51,670
Give me the bacon,
and go do your dirt

744
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:52,937
while I watch
the Lucas Lee marathon.

745
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:54,205
Who's Lucas Lee?

746
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:55,301
Oh!

747
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:57,548
He was this
pretty good skater.

748
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:59,015
Now he's this
pretty good actor.

749
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,109
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.

750
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:02,278
They make movies
in Toronto?

751
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,512
Yes.

752
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,146
I'm stalking him later.

753
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:06,212
So, this Lucas Lee...

754
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,350
Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.

755
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:12,523
You suck.

756
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:13,791
Out.

757
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:15,023
Surprising no one.

758
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,089
Out.

759
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:21,134
<i>Now, you listen close,
and you listen hard, bucko.</i>

760
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:23,640
<i>The next click you'll
hear is me hanging up.</i>

761
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:27,974
<i>The one after that is
me pulling the trigger.</i>

762
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,708
Hey, Knives.

763
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:36,548
Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?

764
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:41,854
<i>Are you wearing a tan jacket,
like, a spring jacket, and a hoodie?</i>

765
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,528
<i>And a dorky hat?</i>

766
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:46,689
It's not dorky.
Why are you psychic?

767
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:47,823
Hey!

768
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,127
Hey. Hey.

769
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:51,961
Hey.

770
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,267
Oh, my God.

771
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,333
I can't believe TCAD's coming to
town. Will you take me to the show?

772
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:01,709
Yeah, listen...

773
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,238
Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.

774
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,313
Like, Chinese food?

775
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:10,149
To meet my parents.
It's my birthday dinner.

776
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,782
I think that's
a really bad idea.

777
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,716
No, it's okay. Why?

778
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,386
I'm too old for you.

779
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:20,727
No, you're not. My dad is
nine years older than my mom.

780
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,996
Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?

781
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:27,036
I don't care. I'm...

782
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:29,772
I'm in...

783
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:37,375
Uh...

784
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,482
Listen,

785
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:42,481
I was thinking

786
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:47,155
we should break up
or whatever.

787
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,385
Really?

788
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:51,990
Yeah.

789
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:55,065
It's not gonna work out.

790
00:39:57,836 --> 00:39:58,825
Oh.

791
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:30,457
Where's Knives.
Not coming tonight?

792
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:31,559
No, we broke up.

793
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:34,230
<i>Hey, check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy II.</i>

794
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,578
Scott, you are
the salt of the earth.

795
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:42,670
Thanks.

796
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:44,545
I meant scum
of the earth.

797
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:45,973
Thanks.

798
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:47,416
You broke up with Knives?

799
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,282
Yeah, but don't worry.

800
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:51,845
Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.

801
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:52,947
New-new.

802
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:59,459
Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.

803
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,192
Whether they're old, new, or

804
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,392
New-new.
New-new.

805
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,799
We were lucky to
survive the last round.

806
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,496
It's sudden death now, okay?

807
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:07,765
Okay.

808
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,781
That's for me. That's
for me. That's for me.

809
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:19,510
Hey, you're here.

810
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:22,314
Yes, like you said.

811
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:25,012
You know your hair?

812
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,114
I know of it.

813
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,351
It's all blue.

814
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:30,588
I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.

815
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:33,063
So...

816
00:41:34,332 --> 00:41:35,765
How do you guys
all know each other?

817
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:39,065
High school, I guess.

818
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:40,434
What Neil said.

819
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:41,698
I'm Neil.

820
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:44,469
Believe it or not, I actually
dated Scott in high school.

821
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:46,267
Got any embarrassing stories?

822
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:47,971
Yeah, he's an idiot.

823
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:50,042
Okay, bye.
See you guys tomorrow.

824
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,139
What about rehearsaI?

825
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,306
Neil knows my parts.

826
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,876
I'm Neil.

827
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:05,151
You doing okay, there?

828
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,857
Yeah, good, good, good.

829
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:11,261
She changed her hair.

830
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,597
So? It looks nice blue.

831
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,103
Yeah, I know, but she
did it without even making

832
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,298
a big deaI of it
or anything.

833
00:42:15,373 --> 00:42:18,069
She's fickle. Impulsive. Spontaneous.

834
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,776
God, what am I gonna do?

835
00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:24,003
Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.

836
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,016
So, how's dinner
coming along?

837
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:27,949
Yeah, good, good, good.

838
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,514
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave you lovebirds to it.

839
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,219
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

840
00:42:36,294 --> 00:42:37,318
Don't go!

841
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:38,794
Will you man the hell up?

842
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:40,262
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

843
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:41,457
You think so?

844
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,434
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

845
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:45,794
If I strike out?

846
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,201
Okay, when. See you in 60.

847
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,710
This is actually
really good garlic bread.

848
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,370
Garlic bread is
my favorite food.

849
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,176
I could honestly
eat it for every meaI.

850
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,940
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

851
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:01,076
You'd get fat.

852
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,311
No, why would I get fat?

853
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:03,445
Bread makes you fat.

854
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:04,749
Bread makes you fat?

855
00:43:07,592 --> 00:43:08,820
I wrote a song about you.

856
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,985
You did?

857
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:11,153
Yeah, it goes like this.

858
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,890
<i>Ramona</i>

859
00:43:18,403 --> 00:43:21,338
<i>Ramona</i>

860
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,441
<i>On my mind</i>

861
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:30,603
<i>Ramona</i>

862
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:37,453
Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.

863
00:43:38,223 --> 00:43:39,315
Finished?

864
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,531
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

865
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,590
Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?

866
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:50,656
What?

867
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:51,997
No, sorry. I just...

868
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,862
I got a bad haircut right
before me and my big ex broke up,

869
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,465
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

870
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:01,307
<i>Scott is acutely aware
that his last salon haircut took place</i>

871
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:05,213
<i>exactly 431 days ago, three
hours before his big breakup.</i>

872
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>He's been cutting
his own hair ever since.</i>

873
00:44:07,552 --> 00:44:08,644
So long ago.

874
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:11,350
Sounds like a bad time.

875
00:44:11,422 --> 00:44:13,253
Bad time? Not really.

876
00:44:13,324 --> 00:44:14,416
<i>It was.</i>

877
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:15,720
It was a mutuaI thing.

878
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:16,885
<i>It wasn't.</i>

879
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:19,930
I mean, she told me it was mutuaI.

880
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,398
<i>She dumped him.
It was brutal.</i>

881
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:23,695
What was her name?

882
00:44:23,768 --> 00:44:25,065
She was Nat,
when I knew her,

883
00:44:25,136 --> 00:44:27,229
but she stopped
liking that name.

884
00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:28,966
Then she stopped liking me.

885
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,940
Your hair is cute.
I like it long.

886
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:32,806
But it would be cuter
short, wouldn’t it?

887
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:34,742
What?
What?

888
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:36,470
Why are you
wearing that hat?

889
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,776
I thought we could go
for a walk.

890
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:40,950
Tell me we didn't
come out here in the cold

891
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,316
so you could cover
your hair with that hat.

892
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:45,015
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

893
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:50,083
Just putting one leg in front
of the other, like this. Walking.

894
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,129
You seem
a little heightened.

895
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:54,262
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

896
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:56,926
I just sort of feeI like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

897
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,525
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

898
00:44:58,603 --> 00:45:00,503
in which case
I do drugs all the time.

899
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,596
Every drug.

900
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:05,342
Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,

901
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,140
things sort of seem
a little brighter.

902
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:09,236
What is this place?

903
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:10,838
It's a totally
awesome castle.

904
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:12,540
They're shooting this
movie here right now.

905
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:15,245
<i>Okay, everybody, let's
do this. Lots to do, everyone.</i>

906
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,309
Lots to do.

907
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:18,150
Did you find the guy you were stalking?

908
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,883
I think I'm about
to right now.

909
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,550
Mr. Lee is traveling.

910
00:45:21,626 --> 00:45:22,650
Mr. Lee?

911
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:24,058
Lucas Lee.

912
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:25,151
Oh.

913
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:26,652
Oh?

914
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,364
<i>And roll sound.</i>

915
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:37,472
I wanna have his
adopted babies.

916
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:39,768
<i>Here we go.</i>

917
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,308
<i>All right,
on your marks, everyone.</i>

918
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:44,712
Oh, man, we got to go.

919
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,075
What? Why?

920
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,448
I used to date that clown.

921
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,543
And...

922
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,679
Action.

923
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:52,614
Oh, my God.

924
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,850
Hey.

925
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:56,287
The only thing keeping me and her apart

926
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:58,659
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

927
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,425
You dated a famous guy?

928
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:02,193
In ninth grade.
We had drama.

929
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:03,563
Actually,
it might have been math.

930
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:05,032
I just remember there
being a lot of drama.

931
00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:06,092
Hey!

932
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,104
He was a snot-nosed little
brat. He just followed me around.

933
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:10,902
He had snot in his nose?
But he's famous.

934
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:13,500
Hey! I'm talking to you,
Scott Pilgrim.

935
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,170
He's famous and
he talked to me.

936
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:17,381
The only thing keeping me and her apart

937
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:20,008
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

938
00:46:20,218 --> 00:46:22,778
Can I have your... Can I
have your autograph, please?

939
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:27,282
What's up?

940
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:29,553
How's life?
He seems nice.

941
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:34,395
Boom!

942
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,960
<i>And that's a cut!</i>

943
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:44,399
Scott, eviI ex. Fight.

944
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:47,137
<i>Let's get ready to go again,
please. Let's get ready to go again.</i>

945
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:48,803
<i>Hey, hombre.</i>

946
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:52,816
You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?

947
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:58,955
Some competish you are.

948
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:01,514
Hey!

949
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,586
Hey!

950
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:06,696
Hey, I'm not done with you.

951
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,891
Oh!

952
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:12,201
Looks like
you're seeing double.

953
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:15,194
He's good, right?

954
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,235
Sometimes I let him do
the wide shots

955
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:20,907
when I feeI like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.

956
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:27,245
What can I say?

957
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:30,844
I'm nothing without
my stunt team.

958
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,697
Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.

959
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:40,753
How does it...

960
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,158
Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?

961
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:19,066
No, I just ate.
Negative.

962
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:28,438
That's actually hilarious.

963
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,104
Ah.

964
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:31,614
Hilarious.

965
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,408
Mr. Lee!

966
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,090
You're needed back on set.

967
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,109
Prepare...

968
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:14,982
Prepare to feeI the wrath
of the League of EviI Exes.

969
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:16,785
The League of EviI Axes?

970
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:18,692
You really don't know
about the League?

971
00:49:20,097 --> 00:49:23,123
The seven eviI exes?
Coming to kill you?

972
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:26,535
Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?

973
00:49:26,604 --> 00:49:27,764
No.

974
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,500
Oh, well, hey, listen, man.
Don't worry about it.

975
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:31,465
Really?
Yeah. Let's go get a beer.

976
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:32,531
That's great...

977
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,941
Boom!

978
00:49:37,548 --> 00:49:39,243
You are a pretty
good actor.

979
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,648
I'm going for
the Oscar this year.

980
00:49:41,919 --> 00:49:43,887
But are you
a pretty good skater?

981
00:49:43,955 --> 00:49:46,116
<i>I'm more than
pretty good, ese.</i>

982
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:48,222
I have my own skate company.

983
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:52,752
But can you do
a thingy on that raiI?

984
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,029
It's called a grind, bro.

985
00:49:57,101 --> 00:50:00,935
So, can you do
a grindy thingy now?

986
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:04,370
Are you serious?

987
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:09,205
There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.

988
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,407
Well, hey,
if it's too hardcore then...

989
00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:15,450
You really think you can goad
me into doing a trick like that?

990
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:16,986
There are girls watching.

991
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:21,987
Somebody get me my board.

992
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,388
Hi. Big fan.

993
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:28,591
Why wouldn’t you be?

994
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:44,637
Wow.

995
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:48,540
Wow.

996
00:50:50,888 --> 00:50:51,877
Wow.

997
00:50:58,029 --> 00:50:59,018
Wow.

998
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,820
Yes!
He totally bailed.

999
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:03,430
Ah! I didn't get
his autograph.

1000
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:04,559
No.

1001
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,899
<i>And that's
a wrap, everybody.</i>

1002
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:09,838
Hey, where's Ramona.
Is she still here?

1003
00:51:09,907 --> 00:51:12,205
No. She totally bailed.

1004
00:51:12,276 --> 00:51:14,801
What's the deaI? Seriously.

1005
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:16,813
<i>Let's move, people,
the sun is coming up.</i>

1006
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:23,043
Hey, it's me again. Scott. Give
me a call when you get this.

1007
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,849
Scott Pilgrim.

1008
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,357
What's the deaI?
Seriously.

1009
00:51:28,426 --> 00:51:30,690
Yep. You said that
last night.

1010
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:31,989
You know what
really sucks, though?

1011
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:33,485
What?

1012
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:35,560
Everything.

1013
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,267
Come on, guy.

1014
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,667
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

1015
00:51:39,737 --> 00:51:40,761
What?

1016
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,239
What did you
think these were?

1017
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:47,811
Kisses?
Seven little kisses?

1018
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:50,938
Seven deadly X's.

1019
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:56,881
Why does everything
have to be so complicated?

1020
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,184
If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.

1021
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:01,956
Step up your game, Scott.

1022
00:52:02,193 --> 00:52:03,524
Break out the L-word.

1023
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:04,788
"Lesbian?"

1024
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:06,256
The other L-word.

1025
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:08,563
"Lesbians?"

1026
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:11,294
It's "love," Scott. I
wasn't trying to trick you.

1027
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,599
Hey, buddy, look,

1028
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:16,964
if she really is
the girl of your dreams,

1029
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,508
then you have to
let her know.

1030
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:22,239
You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.

1031
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:25,413
You can do it. Be with her!
It's your destiny!

1032
00:52:26,484 --> 00:52:28,452
Plus, I need you
to move out.

1033
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,611
What?
Yeah.

1034
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:31,018
I'm kind of banking
on her calling you back

1035
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:33,420
so I don't have to evict you
and feeI all guilty and shit.

1036
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:35,923
I have a feeling
that's for you, guy.

1037
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:38,550
Hey.

1038
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:39,686
<i>Hey, Scott.</i>

1039
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:41,561
Envy?
Oh, shit.

1040
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:43,392
Been a while.

1041
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:44,456
Yeah.

1042
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:45,729
A year, I think.

1043
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,134
Approximately.

1044
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:48,463
How are you?

1045
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,938
I'm not doing
so good right now.

1046
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:54,437
Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?

1047
00:52:54,512 --> 00:52:58,539
What? No. I've been... It's
been different. You have no idea.

1048
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:01,176
<i>Probably not. Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

1049
00:53:01,252 --> 00:53:03,277
<i>Should I be jealous?</i>

1050
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,618
Yes, you should. I have this
totally awesome girlfriend

1051
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:08,249
who calls me all the
time and she's America.

1052
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:09,349
She's American.

1053
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:10,587
What's her name?

1054
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:12,390
I'm not telling you that.
Ramona.

1055
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:13,452
Oh.

1056
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:14,822
What? Do you know her?

1057
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:16,298
What? No.

1058
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:18,200
It sounded like you did.

1059
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,829
I got to go. It's been
nice chatting with you.

1060
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:22,031
Wait.

1061
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:29,073
Okay.

1062
00:53:31,482 --> 00:53:32,608
Everything does suck.

1063
00:53:32,783 --> 00:53:35,411
Or does it? Hello?

1064
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:37,345
Hey, Knives.

1065
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:40,986
What's that?
You're outside?

1066
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,560
Is Scott here?

1067
00:53:43,627 --> 00:53:46,255
You know what? He just
left.

1068
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,188
Really?

1069
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,357
Yeah.

1070
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:53,663
Sorry.

1071
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,037
<i>Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

1072
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:01,135
<i>Seven deadly X's.</i>

1073
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:03,845
<i>You may have to
defeat my seven evil exes.</i>

1074
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:07,142
<i>It's sudden death now, okay?</i>

1075
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,479
<i>She's got some
battle scars, dude.</i>

1076
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:11,418
<i>You can't say you
didn't see this coming.</i>

1077
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:15,652
Dude.

1078
00:54:18,762 --> 00:54:19,786
Please.

1079
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:22,391
I'm really not
in the mood for this.

1080
00:54:24,802 --> 00:54:26,030
Okay, enough!

1081
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,343
You punched me
in the boob!

1082
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:38,006
Prepare to die, obviously.

1083
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:40,346
Look, I've had it today.
Can we not do this right now?

1084
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,510
I'd love to
postpone, darling,

1085
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:44,884
but I just cashed
my last rain check.

1086
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:46,587
What's that from?
My brain!

1087
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:50,188
I'm really, really not up
for this. Whatever it is.

1088
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:53,719
Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.

1089
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:55,492
But you won't see me,

1090
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:59,195
because next time, I'll be
deadly serious next time.

1091
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:00,526
What?

1092
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:01,730
Never mind!

1093
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,501
Man. Someone help me.

1094
00:55:06,744 --> 00:55:08,075
<i>Hello.
It's Scott.</i>

1095
00:55:08,145 --> 00:55:09,339
What did he do this time?

1096
00:55:09,413 --> 00:55:10,971
No, it's Scott.
It's actually me.

1097
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:12,106
What did you do this time?

1098
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,844
I didn't do anything. It's
everyone else that's crazy.

1099
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:15,943
Look, I'm having a meltdown or
whatever. Are you still working?

1100
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,146
I'm literally
about to leave.

1101
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:18,381
Cool, I'm coming in.

1102
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:26,352
I think I'll make it
a decaf today.

1103
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,692
Scott Pilgrim!

1104
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,496
What did you do
with my sister?

1105
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,533
Sorry, I had to go.

1106
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,867
So, what can I
get you?

1107
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:36,201
Is there anywhere
you don't work?

1108
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:39,401
They're called jobs. Something a
like you wouldn’t know anything about.

1109
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:41,706
And by the way, I can't
believe you asked Ramona out

1110
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:44,339
after I specifically told
you not to do that.

1111
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:45,780
How are you doing
that with your mouth?

1112
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,908
Never mind
how I'm doing it!

1113
00:55:47,985 --> 00:55:49,350
What do you have to say
for yourself?

1114
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,154
Can I get
a caramel macchiato?

1115
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:54,716
You know what, maybe it's high 
time you took a look in a mirror

1116
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:56,487
before you wreak
havoc on another girl.

1117
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,686
Me? Wreak havoc?

1118
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:58,955
And speaking of
which,

1119
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:00,189
I hear the girl that
kicked your heart in the ass

1120
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:01,856
is walking the streets
of Toronto again.

1121
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,792
So, I can just get
my coffee over here?

1122
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:09,471
Sorry that got
a little crazy last night.

1123
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:11,807
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

1124
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,704
Yeah, I do that.

1125
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,807
Listen, I know I can be
hard to be around sometimes.

1126
00:56:20,317 --> 00:56:22,512
I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.

1127
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:24,611
No, no, I want to hang.

1128
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:26,819
You know, the whole
eviI ex-boyfriend thing...

1129
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,914
Exes.

1130
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:28,981
It's no biggie.

1131
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:32,152
I know it's early,

1132
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:34,697
but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...

1133
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:35,857
Shit!

1134
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:38,360
It's my ex.

1135
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:39,663
A big one?
Mmm-hmm.

1136
00:56:40,471 --> 00:56:41,802
Envy.

1137
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:45,735
I'm gonna...

1138
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:48,410
Excuse me.

1139
00:56:50,914 --> 00:56:51,972
Your hair is
getting shaggy.

1140
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:53,073
Yeah?

1141
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,708
So, that's Ramona.

1142
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:55,809
Yeah.

1143
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:57,519
Okay, I'm jealous.

1144
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,612
You're jealous?

1145
00:56:58,856 --> 00:56:59,914
I'm allowed.

1146
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,319
You left me for
that cocky pretty boy.

1147
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:04,088
You haven't even
seen him.

1148
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,490
I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.

1149
00:57:06,563 --> 00:57:09,396
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

1150
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:12,299
You should
so totally come.

1151
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:14,894
That's so not
going to happen.

1152
00:57:14,972 --> 00:57:16,872
Great, you're
so on the list.

1153
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:22,176
Caramel macchiato
for Pilgrim.

1154
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,313
So, that was Envy.

1155
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:25,405
Uh-huh.

1156
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:27,016
What happened
with the two of you?

1157
00:57:27,084 --> 00:57:29,052
Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

1158
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,609
She wanted to move
to Montreal,

1159
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:32,121
because she missed
her best friend.

1160
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:33,989
This guy, Todd.

1161
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:36,049
And two weeks later, they were
sleeping together, I guess?

1162
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:37,718
Basically.

1163
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:40,958
Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.

1164
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:44,762
I can see how it sucks. Having
the past come back to haunt you.

1165
00:57:45,135 --> 00:57:47,569
Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

1166
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,162
What do you want
to think about?

1167
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:51,566
How warm
my place is right now.

1168
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:52,631
Oh.

1169
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:56,808
And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?

1170
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:59,639
I couldn’t stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

1171
00:57:59,717 --> 00:58:01,184
Is that
the Uma Thurman movie?

1172
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:05,585
Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

1173
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:07,715
Double negative.
It's tricky.

1174
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,691
It's over. Move on.

1175
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,749
Word.

1176
00:58:10,828 --> 00:58:13,524
Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

1177
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:15,890
From this moment on,

1178
00:58:15,966 --> 00:58:18,730
I will think of
Envy Adams no more!

1179
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:21,331
I have distressing news.

1180
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:24,374
Is it news that we suck, because
I really don't think I can take it.

1181
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:27,467
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

1182
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:29,637
and Envy asked us
to open for them.

1183
00:58:29,713 --> 00:58:30,771
I hate you.

1184
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:33,009
A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.

1185
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,482
Maybe you can put
your history aside

1186
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:36,382
until we get through
this thing, for the band.

1187
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,449
For the band?
For the band?

1188
00:58:38,522 --> 00:58:39,887
Can't we do our...
For the band?

1189
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,117
Can't we do our
own secret shows?

1190
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:42,886
All our shows
are secret shows.

1191
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,129
We're doing it.
G- Man might be there.

1192
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:48,096
We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.

1193
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:51,532
We have to get some buzz
going. We need groundswell.

1194
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:53,126
We need stalkers.

1195
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:02,036
What would you do
if your ex was in a band

1196
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:03,807
and they wanted you
to open for them?

1197
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,709
If my ex was in a band?

1198
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:06,772
Mmm-hmm.

1199
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:08,874
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

1200
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:10,613
it's the grown-up
thing to do.

1201
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:13,549
Yeah. We're all
adults here, right?

1202
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,854
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1203
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:18,924
He's dating
a fat-ass hipster chick!

1204
00:59:18,996 --> 00:59:20,520
I hate her stupid guts!

1205
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:25,835
He only likes her because she's
old. She's probably, like, 25!

1206
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,536
She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

1207
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:30,539
I think you mentioned
she was fat.

1208
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:31,938
She's got a head start.

1209
00:59:32,009 --> 00:59:35,410
I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!

1210
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,537
Hey, this really burns.

1211
00:59:36,613 --> 00:59:37,637
You should rinse.

1212
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:41,374
When I got this idea, I just
thought, "I have to do it!"

1213
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,283
I can't hear
anything you're saying.

1214
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:46,248
Oh, God! I look so

1215
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,585
good.

1216
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,526
Ramona Flowers
stole my Scott.

1217
00:59:52,863 --> 00:59:55,661
But I know
how to get him back.

1218
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:57,190
How?

1219
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:10,973
<i>Come on, come on</i>

1220
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:17,884
<i>Thank you,
we were Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

1221
01:00:17,955 --> 01:00:19,422
Yeah!

1222
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,685
<i>We have some merch
at the back, so...</i>

1223
01:00:23,093 --> 01:00:24,754
Okay, bar? Now?

1224
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:31,697
LeveI with me.
Did we suck?

1225
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:33,895
I don't know. Did you?

1226
01:00:35,672 --> 01:00:38,334
She has to go.
She knows we suck.

1227
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:43,977
Hey, Ramona.

1228
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,244
Hey.

1229
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:50,212
What the hell?

1230
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:00,527
Hey.

1231
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:01,996
Hey, Scott.

1232
01:01:02,065 --> 01:01:04,192
What the hell?

1233
01:01:04,268 --> 01:01:06,031
Look who Knives is
hanging out with.

1234
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,830
Who is
that girl again?

1235
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:08,894
Scott dated her.

1236
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:10,030
Briefly, briefly.

1237
01:01:10,507 --> 01:01:11,735
How old is she?

1238
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:17,474
I gotta pee on her.

1239
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,415
I mean, I gotta pee.
Pee time.

1240
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:25,355
<i>And then it was time</i>

1241
01:01:25,422 --> 01:01:29,119
<i>for Toronto to drown
in the sweet sorrow</i>

1242
01:01:29,192 --> 01:01:33,322
<i>of The Clash at Demonhead!</i>

1243
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,532
Envy! Envy!

1244
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:43,270
That guy on bass...

1245
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,602
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1246
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:46,006
...that's Todd.

1247
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:47,168
I know.

1248
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:48,734
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1249
01:01:49,746 --> 01:01:50,940
You know?

1250
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:53,244
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1251
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,511
Oh, no.

1252
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:59,583
<i>Hello, again,
friend of a friend</i>

1253
01:01:59,656 --> 01:02:01,487
<i>I knew you well</i>

1254
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:05,461
<i>Our common goal</i>

1255
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:10,023
<i>was waiting for
the world to end</i>

1256
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:13,235
<i>Now that the truth</i>

1257
01:02:13,303 --> 01:02:17,831
<i>is just a rule
that you demand</i>

1258
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:20,840
<i>You crack the whip</i>

1259
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:25,177
<i>Shape-shift and trick
the past again</i>

1260
01:02:25,248 --> 01:02:29,548
<i>Send you my love on the wire</i>

1261
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,953
<i>Lift you up, every time</i>

1262
01:02:33,023 --> 01:02:35,685
<i>Everyone</i>

1263
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:38,792
<i>pulls away</i>

1264
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:43,561
<i>from you</i>

1265
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:46,399
That was...
That was devastating.

1266
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,438
Oh, my God.
Just, oh, my God.

1267
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:51,531
Yeah, you should see them
live. They're much better live.

1268
01:02:51,608 --> 01:02:52,836
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1269
01:02:55,212 --> 01:02:56,770
I can't even believe
I'm saying this,

1270
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:59,611
but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.

1271
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:01,048
All of us?

1272
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:02,583
Did I stutter?

1273
01:03:06,356 --> 01:03:08,381
Wait, how do you know Envy?

1274
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:09,550
Scott dated her.

1275
01:03:14,631 --> 01:03:15,893
Hey, Ramona.

1276
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:17,995
Hey, Todd.

1277
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:20,026
It's been awhile.

1278
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:21,493
Mmm-hmm.

1279
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:22,994
Mmm-hmm?

1280
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,137
I think we should
get out of here.

1281
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,176
So, how was the tour? You
guys play with the Pixies?

1282
01:03:27,244 --> 01:03:28,768
You're like a superstar now.

1283
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:31,541
Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.

1284
01:03:31,615 --> 01:03:32,639
Um, Envy...

1285
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:35,351
I read your blog.

1286
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:38,711
So, Scott and Ramona, eh?

1287
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:39,881
What of it?

1288
01:03:39,956 --> 01:03:41,082
You guys make a cute couple, you know?

1289
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:43,451
Suit each other.

1290
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:45,791
You're my role modeI, Envy.

1291
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:48,092
Ramona, I like your outfit.
Affordable?

1292
01:03:48,165 --> 01:03:50,156
Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?

1293
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:52,428
I'm talking to
Ramona right now.

1294
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:53,927
Ramona lived in New York.

1295
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:55,095
Did she?

1296
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:58,570
I was just there. Played the
Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.

1297
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:00,168
You know him, right?

1298
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:03,240
I've kissed the lips
that kissed you!

1299
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:09,279
Knives!

1300
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:11,245
What?

1301
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:12,515
I'm not afraid
to hit a girl.

1302
01:04:14,424 --> 01:04:15,982
I'm a rock star.

1303
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:17,219
Oh, my God!

1304
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,593
You punched the highlights
out of her hair.

1305
01:04:22,299 --> 01:04:24,824
He punched the highlights
out of her hair!

1306
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:26,967
You are incorrigible.

1307
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,138
I don't know
the meaning of the word.

1308
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:35,841
So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?

1309
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,779
Fun? In Toronto?

1310
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:42,112
That's it! You cocky cock!

1311
01:04:42,586 --> 01:04:44,816
You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.

1312
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:58,462
My neck.

1313
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:00,761
Your hair.

1314
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:03,203
Didn't you know?

1315
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,668
Todd's vegan.

1316
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:11,436
Vegan?

1317
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:14,814
It's not really
that big of a deaI.

1318
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,851
No kidding.

1319
01:05:19,856 --> 01:05:21,346
Anyone can be vegan.

1320
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:24,285
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

1321
01:05:24,494 --> 01:05:25,586
Ovo-what?

1322
01:05:26,196 --> 01:05:30,428
I partake not in the meat, nor
the breast milk, nor the ovum

1323
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,593
of any creature with a face.

1324
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:33,863
Short answer,

1325
01:05:33,937 --> 01:05:36,428
being vegan just makes you
better than most people.

1326
01:05:36,506 --> 01:05:37,564
Bingo.

1327
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:42,511
Hey, man, question.

1328
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:45,381
I always wondered, how does
not eating dairy products

1329
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:47,279
give you psychic powers?

1330
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,840
Okay.

1331
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:51,319
You know how you only use
10% of your brain?

1332
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:53,686
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

1333
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:55,884
Did you learn that
at Vegan Academy?

1334
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:57,392
Go ahead and
get snippy, baby.

1335
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,894
If you knew the science, maybe
I'd listen to a word you're saying.

1336
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:07,498
If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?

1337
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:08,629
It's not raining.

1338
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:09,694
Oh.

1339
01:06:09,973 --> 01:06:11,600
Then why don't you
give me the Cliff Notes

1340
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,303
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

1341
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:15,708
Is that really
important right now?

1342
01:06:15,779 --> 01:06:17,747
Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory

1343
01:06:17,814 --> 01:06:21,079
that's gonna help me out in a
criticaI moment of not dying, yes.

1344
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:26,184
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

1345
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,486
<i>Guess that's not very nice, but
I used to be, kind of like that.</i>

1346
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:34,595
<i>We hated everyone. We
wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.</i>

1347
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:36,825
<i>He punched a hole
in the moon for me.</i>

1348
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,765
<i>It was pretty crazy.</i>

1349
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:40,029
<i>A week and a half later
he told me</i>

1350
01:06:40,103 --> 01:06:41,900
<i>his dad was sending him
to Vegan Academy,</i>

1351
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:44,004
<i>so I dumped him.</i>

1352
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:46,872
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

1353
01:06:46,943 --> 01:06:48,808
You've never been
the dumpee?

1354
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:52,007
Look, I've dabbled
in being a bitch.

1355
01:06:52,082 --> 01:06:53,879
It's part of the reason
I moved here.

1356
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:57,249
I was really hoping to
just leave it all behind me.

1357
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,719
Hey, lovebirds...

1358
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:02,021
We have unfinished business,
I and he.

1359
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:03,921
He and me.

1360
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:05,484
Don't you talk to me
about grammar.

1361
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:07,462
<i>I dislike you, capisce?</i>

1362
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,259
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1363
01:07:09,332 --> 01:07:10,424
What?

1364
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,990
Because you'll be dust
by Monday.

1365
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:13,726
Um...

1366
01:07:13,803 --> 01:07:15,862
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

1367
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:19,170
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1368
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,333
She dusts.

1369
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:24,945
So, what's on Monday?

1370
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:30,112
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

1371
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,654
Monday. Right?

1372
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:34,688
Basically, you can't
win this fight.

1373
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:35,918
You're gonna have
to give up this girl,

1374
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:37,323
because Todd's
gonna kill you.

1375
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,627
You used to be so nice!

1376
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,901
Scott, we're gonna go
to Pizza Pizza for a slice.

1377
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:56,411
Call us when you're done.

1378
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:59,073
He'll be done.
ReaI soon.

1379
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:05,716
Sounds like someone
wants to get funky.

1380
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:32,968
I can read your thoughts. Your
will is broken. You're through.

1381
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,341
What say we drink
to my memory?

1382
01:09:35,478 --> 01:09:37,378
Fair trade blend
with soy milk?

1383
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:39,881
I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

1384
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:41,974
Dude, I can see
in your mind's eye.

1385
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,179
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1386
01:09:44,254 --> 01:09:46,484
in an attempt to
make me break vegan edge.

1387
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:48,353
I'll take the one with soy.

1388
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:52,991
Thanks, tooI.

1389
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:57,595
<i>Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.</i>

1390
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:00,500
But I thought reaI hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1391
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,471
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

1392
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,031
What are you talking about?

1393
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:07,542
You just drank
half-and-half, baby.

1394
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:10,676
Freeze! Vegan police!

1395
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:11,941
Vegan police!

1396
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:15,542
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

1397
01:10:15,618 --> 01:10:18,849
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

1398
01:10:19,422 --> 01:10:20,514
That's bullroar!

1399
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,524
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

1400
01:10:22,592 --> 01:10:24,753
But it's only
my first offense.

1401
01:10:24,828 --> 01:10:25,988
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

1402
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:27,427
Take it.

1403
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:30,959
At 12:27 a. m.
on February 1st,

1404
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,331
you knowingly
ingested gelato.

1405
01:10:33,203 --> 01:10:34,329
Gelato isn't vegan?

1406
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,837
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1407
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:39,033
On ApriI 4th, 7:30 p. m., you
partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

1408
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:41,871
Chicken isn't vegan?

1409
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:44,570
The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.

1410
01:11:00,697 --> 01:11:02,187
Oh, my God!

1411
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:04,790
No. No.

1412
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:08,269
You once were a vegone,

1413
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:10,533
but now you will be gone.

1414
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,866
Vegone?

1415
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:28,984
Yeah!
Yeah!

1416
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:36,922
Sorry, I guess.

1417
01:11:38,134 --> 01:11:39,931
Sorry?

1418
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:43,468
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

1419
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:48,136
You kicked my heart in the
ass, so I guess we're even.

1420
01:11:49,612 --> 01:11:51,102
Natalie.

1421
01:11:52,048 --> 01:11:56,280
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

1422
01:11:57,987 --> 01:11:59,079
Maybe they should.

1423
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:03,820
Let's get out of here.

1424
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:14,302
For the record, I am so
pissed off for you, right now.

1425
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,201
Shut the up, Julie.

1426
01:12:16,272 --> 01:12:17,569
Okay.

1427
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:20,436
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

1428
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,307
I'm not sure there's
going to be much of a party.

1429
01:12:22,378 --> 01:12:24,039
I think a third of the band
just went "poom. "

1430
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:26,775
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1431
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:29,613
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the labeI guys.

1432
01:12:29,686 --> 01:12:31,654
Then why would we... Oh.

1433
01:12:31,721 --> 01:12:33,814
Neil, you down?

1434
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,187
Scott, you're in, right?

1435
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:37,318
You wanna go?

1436
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:40,692
Well, I kind of
almost died back there.

1437
01:12:40,763 --> 01:12:41,821
I'm not saying
I want to go.

1438
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:43,023
Yeah. We can totally go.

1439
01:12:43,099 --> 01:12:44,123
I'll do whatever
you want to do.

1440
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,189
So, let's go.

1441
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,165
We really don't
have to go to this thing.

1442
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,035
It'll probably be
a bad scene all around.

1443
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:52,631
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

1444
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:54,142
It's just...
Well...

1445
01:12:55,378 --> 01:12:58,438
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1446
01:12:58,514 --> 01:13:00,243
So far,
you're not a total ass.

1447
01:13:00,316 --> 01:13:01,510
But I'm part ass?

1448
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:03,711
If it makes you feeI better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1449
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:04,810
Wait, is that good?

1450
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:06,047
It's what I need right now.

1451
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:07,146
But not later?

1452
01:13:07,223 --> 01:13:09,054
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1453
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,855
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

1454
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:13,520
I'd just like to live.

1455
01:13:13,963 --> 01:13:15,430
Look, I know
Todd was bad news,

1456
01:13:15,498 --> 01:13:16,931
but are you saying
Envy wasn't?

1457
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,365
We all have baggage.

1458
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:21,494
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

1459
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,436
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

1460
01:13:23,506 --> 01:13:24,837
Exes.
Whatever.

1461
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:27,068
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1462
01:13:27,143 --> 01:13:29,703
What about you and that girl,
Knives? Who broke up with who?

1463
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:32,373
I believe
I broke up with her.

1464
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:33,745
And was she cool with that?

1465
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:36,307
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

1466
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:37,375
You sure about that?

1467
01:13:37,453 --> 01:13:39,011
Yeah, she's very mature
for her age.

1468
01:13:39,088 --> 01:13:40,350
We had a very
healthy breakup.

1469
01:13:40,423 --> 01:13:41,617
We're all peaches and gravy.

1470
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:42,986
No!

1471
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:44,649
What about you and Kim?

1472
01:13:44,727 --> 01:13:46,888
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

1473
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:48,954
It was high school.
She had freckles.

1474
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,223
That's it?

1475
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,292
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

1476
01:13:53,369 --> 01:13:54,495
That's really
the whole story?

1477
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,435
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1478
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:59,134
I fought a crazy,
80-foot-tall, purple-suited dude

1479
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,335
and I had to fight
96 guys to get to him.

1480
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:04,039
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1481
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:06,547
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1482
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:09,050
Does that make
you feeI any better?

1483
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:11,916
Well, now you are being a
total ass. Welcome to the club.

1484
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:14,952
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

1485
01:14:15,024 --> 01:14:18,551
Hey, don't worry. I don't even
know what I'm like anymore.

1486
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:22,260
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

1487
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,731
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

1488
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:32,934
<i>The girl from earlier?</i>

1489
01:14:33,576 --> 01:14:35,510
Roxy?
You know this girl?

1490
01:14:35,578 --> 01:14:38,604
Boy, does she know me.

1491
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:41,010
What is she talking about?

1492
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:42,809
He really doesn't know?

1493
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,244
Wait.

1494
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:47,144
Hmm?

1495
01:14:50,059 --> 01:14:52,027
You and her?
It was just a phase.

1496
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:53,756
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

1497
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,320
It meant nothing. I didn't
think it would count.

1498
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:56,456
It meant nothing?

1499
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:57,760
I was just
a little bi-curious.

1500
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,392
Well, honey,

1501
01:14:59,469 --> 01:15:02,336
I'm a little bi-furious.

1502
01:15:14,016 --> 01:15:16,109
Do that again
and I will end you.

1503
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:17,652
Back off, hasbian.

1504
01:15:18,154 --> 01:15:20,622
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.

1505
01:15:22,358 --> 01:15:24,383
The League has spoken.

1506
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:27,592
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

1507
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:30,291
because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.

1508
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,045
Wallace?
Uh-huh?

1509
01:15:46,616 --> 01:15:48,208
This is happening, right?
Oh, yeah.

1510
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,908
Kick her in the balls.

1511
01:16:12,608 --> 01:16:13,836
I'm sending you
back to Gideon

1512
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,775
in a thousand pieces,
you slag!

1513
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
Ha!

1514
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:26,278
I'd rather be dead
than go back.

1515
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:27,720
He's a creep,
you're a bitch,

1516
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,950
and you all deserve
each other.

1517
01:16:29,025 --> 01:16:31,220
Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.

1518
01:16:31,294 --> 01:16:32,386
Meaning?

1519
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:36,057
Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.

1520
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:41,432
I don't think I can hit
a girl. They're soft.

1521
01:16:41,504 --> 01:16:42,630
You don't have a choice.

1522
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:03,925
Fight your own battles,
lazy ass!

1523
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,626
Lazy ass!

1524
01:17:18,608 --> 01:17:20,599
Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.

1525
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,572
Some sooner than others.

1526
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:29,581
Your BF's about to
get F'd in the B.

1527
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:32,747
Her weak point is
the back of her knees.

1528
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:34,517
Wait, how does that work?

1529
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:37,192
Whenever we were making
out I would just...

1530
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:38,726
Okay, enough.

1531
01:17:47,136 --> 01:17:52,665
You'll never be
able to do this to her.

1532
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:07,816
So...

1533
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,323
Two gin-and-tonics, please?

1534
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:10,586
I thought you didn't drink.

1535
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,458
Only on speciaI occasions.
Why? Did you want one?

1536
01:18:14,163 --> 01:18:16,529
Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?

1537
01:18:16,599 --> 01:18:19,591
Maybe you could just give
me a list of all of your exes

1538
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:21,296
so that I can at least
know who's going to

1539
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,962
beat my ass
into the ground next.

1540
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:25,701
Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.

1541
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:27,265
Maybe we could
exchange our information.

1542
01:18:27,343 --> 01:18:29,709
Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern

1543
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:31,041
for my mortaI well-being,

1544
01:18:31,113 --> 01:18:34,139
is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?

1545
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:40,583
I think we should split.

1546
01:18:40,656 --> 01:18:43,090
As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?

1547
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,649
I'd hope you could
figure that out.

1548
01:18:44,727 --> 01:18:46,695
Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?

1549
01:18:46,762 --> 01:18:49,492
How could I? I feeI like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.

1550
01:18:49,565 --> 01:18:50,793
Dirty laundry.
You're drunk.

1551
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:52,157
I had, like, one drink.

1552
01:18:52,234 --> 01:18:55,931
I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.

1553
01:18:56,005 --> 01:18:56,994
I thought you might be
more understanding.

1554
01:18:57,206 --> 01:18:58,264
I just...

1555
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:00,866
You're just another eviI ex
waiting to happen.

1556
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:05,479
That was harsh.

1557
01:19:06,882 --> 01:19:08,816
That was not good.

1558
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:12,011
That was embarrassing.

1559
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:14,417
One more.

1560
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,481
P.S. Here's your stupid list.

1561
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,152
Matthew PateI, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.

1562
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,926
Who the hell are
the Katayanagi Twins?

1563
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,126
Oh!

1564
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:27,700
You don't know?

1565
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:29,164
The Katayanagi Twins

1566
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:31,638
just happen to be
the next band in the battle.

1567
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:35,439
They are totally bad-ass.

1568
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:37,502
Ramona dated twins?
Apparently.

1569
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,638
At the same time?

1570
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:39,738
You know what?

1571
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:41,180
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

1572
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,980
Good. Because you know how I feeI
about girls blocking the rock.

1573
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:45,680
Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.

1574
01:19:45,755 --> 01:19:46,881
If it's gonna be
an issue though,

1575
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:48,014
Young Neil can
fill in for you.

1576
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,421
It's not an issue.
You know bands,

1577
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:50,925
I know battles.
We got it covered.

1578
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:52,924
But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.

1579
01:19:52,995 --> 01:19:54,292
Not only do I
want to take part

1580
01:19:54,363 --> 01:19:56,160
I want to take them apart.

1581
01:19:56,599 --> 01:19:58,624
Okay, I'm getting tingles.

1582
01:19:58,701 --> 01:19:59,793
Whoa!

1583
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:03,335
Okay, we're doomed.
Oh!

1584
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:05,704
That poster needs
more exclamation marks.

1585
01:20:06,308 --> 01:20:07,775
Oh, man,
we're gonna get killed.

1586
01:20:07,843 --> 01:20:09,435
Come on, we're going
on in five minutes.

1587
01:20:09,912 --> 01:20:11,903
Wait, aren't the Katayanagis
going on first?

1588
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:14,449
I think
you're both on first.

1589
01:20:14,717 --> 01:20:17,049
Wait, "Amp versus amp"?

1590
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:18,746
We're going on stage
at the same time?

1591
01:20:18,821 --> 01:20:20,049
That's impossible.

1592
01:20:21,657 --> 01:20:22,885
Okay, my bad.

1593
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:25,017
Your bad is
saying, "My bad. "

1594
01:20:25,461 --> 01:20:29,022
We shouldn't even be
here. We shouldn't even be here!

1595
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:31,464
Come on, man! I put my
problems aside for the music.

1596
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:32,899
If I can do that,
we can do anything.

1597
01:20:32,968 --> 01:20:34,492
Did you speak
to Ramona, then?

1598
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,437
What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.

1599
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,564
Oh.

1600
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:39,903
She's totally here.

1601
01:20:42,845 --> 01:20:43,937
Scott?

1602
01:20:44,947 --> 01:20:46,346
Not that I care,

1603
01:20:46,415 --> 01:20:48,474
but you should go talk to her
before she's gone.

1604
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:50,075
Thanks, Kim.

1605
01:20:50,152 --> 01:20:51,244
And I really don't care.

1606
01:20:53,155 --> 01:20:54,622
I didn't mean to
put you through all that.

1607
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,215
I only did it because I
love you. You know that.

1608
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:36,527
Okay, gang,
can we do this?

1609
01:21:37,133 --> 01:21:38,361
I mean,
we can do this, right?

1610
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,526
Right.

1611
01:21:39,602 --> 01:21:40,830
Scott?

1612
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:43,830
Scott!

1613
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,353
They tore the roof off!

1614
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:08,725
<i>We are Sex Bob-Omb</i>

1615
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:11,767
<i>and we're here to make you think
about death and get sad and stuff!</i>

1616
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:16,495

of the song.</i>

1617
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,135

<i>The crème de la crème</i>

1619
01:22:21,644 --> 01:22:23,168
<i>The feminine abyss</i>

1620
01:22:23,245 --> 01:22:26,737
<i>And reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind</i>

1621
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,251
<i>My body's stupid</i>

1622
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:31,684
<i>Stereo putrid</i>

Let's just break
up now and get it over with.

1630
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:12,418
We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!

1631
01:23:12,494 --> 01:23:14,428
Gideon's here? Where?

1632
01:23:14,496 --> 01:23:16,589
That geeky guy
next to your girlfriend.

1633
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:20,325
That's Gideon?

1634
01:23:20,402 --> 01:23:22,597
Gideon is G-Man?

1635
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:24,972
All right, let's do this.

1636
01:23:27,409 --> 01:23:29,877
<i>Reaching my threshold</i>

1637
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:38,418
<i>My threshold</i>

1638
01:24:24,466 --> 01:24:25,626
We're out.

1639
01:24:30,306 --> 01:24:31,568
What are you doing?

1640
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,868
Getting a life.

1641
01:24:46,555 --> 01:24:48,921
I just came to
see your show.

1642
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:53,289
I have to...

1643
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:02,795
Ramona.

1644
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:06,439
Ramona, I need to
tell you something.

1645
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:07,839
Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.

1646
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,935
Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof

1647
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:11,445
just to avoid getting hurt.

1648
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:15,609
I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.

1649
01:25:15,684 --> 01:25:19,347
I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff

1650
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,321
because
I'm in lesbians with you.

1651
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:22,814
What?

1652
01:25:22,891 --> 01:25:24,256
I really, really mean it.

1653
01:25:26,662 --> 01:25:28,254
Oh! Okay.

1654
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,854
It's your turn. What
did you want to tell me?

1655
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:33,191
That we have to break up.

1656
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:35,463
What?

1657
01:25:35,537 --> 01:25:37,004
It's Gideon.

1658
01:25:37,873 --> 01:25:39,500
I just can't...

1659
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,377
I can't help myself
around him.

1660
01:25:43,445 --> 01:25:45,310
That's the bad news.

1661
01:25:46,115 --> 01:25:47,343
Hey.

1662
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:50,817
The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.

1663
01:25:50,886 --> 01:25:52,478
Bob-Omb.
Three-piece rock outfit

1664
01:25:52,554 --> 01:25:54,954
with a smoking hot
red-head on drums.

1665
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,855
Music to my ear-holes.

1666
01:25:57,993 --> 01:25:59,927
You know what?
I'm not even going to wait

1667
01:25:59,995 --> 01:26:01,462
to see how you guys
do in the finaI.

1668
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,964
I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.

1669
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,467
See? I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

1670
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,865
You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.

1671
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:14,238
No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.

1672
01:26:14,777 --> 01:26:16,472
Ow! Scott.

1673
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:19,641
You got to try and keep
your emotions in check, man.

1674
01:26:19,715 --> 01:26:22,411
Don't let what's past
ruin your future.

1675
01:26:22,484 --> 01:26:24,076
The people need
to hear us, Scott.

1676
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,747
Then you're gonna have to
find someone else to play bass.

1677
01:26:28,557 --> 01:26:29,546
Whoops.

1678
01:26:30,592 --> 01:26:34,358
Sign, sign, sign,
and we are all set.

1679
01:26:34,763 --> 01:26:36,856
Sweetie, shall we?

1680
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:45,630
Oh! Scott.

1681
01:26:46,141 --> 01:26:48,405
You know, we really should
be thanking each other.

1682
01:26:48,477 --> 01:26:51,173
I mean, if it wasn't for me, Ramona
would never have been with you

1683
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:53,271
but if it wasn't for you she
wouldn’t have gotten back with me,

1684
01:26:53,348 --> 01:26:55,213
so I guess
it all shakes out.

1685
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:58,516
Scotty, buddy,

1686
01:27:00,856 --> 01:27:04,587
between you and I, the whole
League of EviI Exes thing?

1687
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,559
I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...

1688
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:10,828
Forgiven?

1689
01:27:11,266 --> 01:27:13,097
All right, let's go.

1690
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:15,030
Yes!

1691
01:27:15,838 --> 01:27:18,898
This is it, guys.
We are on our way.

1692
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:24,306
I said "lesbians. "

1693
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:54,299
Scott.

1694
01:27:55,377 --> 01:27:56,708
Was she really the one?

1695
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:58,639
The what?

1696
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:01,012
I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?

1697
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:05,552
Like, with jetpacks.

1698
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,520
Time heals all wounds,
little brother.

1699
01:28:14,596 --> 01:28:19,056
Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 eviI ex-boyfriends.

1700
01:28:19,368 --> 01:28:20,392
Seven.

1701
01:28:20,536 --> 01:28:21,594
That's not that bad.

1702
01:28:23,906 --> 01:28:25,635
Hey. Yeah, I know.

1703
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:28,207
It's so pathetic!

1704
01:28:31,914 --> 01:28:32,938
Turn off the light!

1705
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:38,614
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk

1706
01:28:38,954 --> 01:28:40,182
and I apologize for that.

1707
01:28:40,255 --> 01:28:41,279
Okay.

1708
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:43,085
And he apologizes, too.

1709
01:28:43,158 --> 01:28:44,216
Sorry.

1710
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:48,528
Scott,
you know I love you.

1711
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:51,189
But I'm gonna need
my own bed tonight.

1712
01:28:51,733 --> 01:28:53,394
It's for sex.

1713
01:28:53,936 --> 01:28:55,130
Right.

1714
01:28:55,871 --> 01:28:58,931
I may need it for
the rest of the week, too.

1715
01:28:59,241 --> 01:29:00,469
Right.

1716
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:01,634
And the year.

1717
01:29:02,277 --> 01:29:03,539
I get it.

1718
01:29:03,612 --> 01:29:05,307
Maybe you can
move in with Ramona.

1719
01:29:06,782 --> 01:29:08,044
She's with Gideon.

1720
01:29:08,116 --> 01:29:09,378
Oh, man.

1721
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:11,510
That's probably just because
he's better than you.

1722
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:12,679
Mmm.

1723
01:29:12,754 --> 01:29:15,723
Either way,
this fight is over.

1724
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:17,180
Mmm-hmm.

1725
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:27,232
It's for Scott.

1726
01:29:27,436 --> 01:29:29,461
It's for you, big guy.

1727
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:32,529
Hello.

1728
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:33,802
<i>Hey, pal.</i>

1729
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:36,734
<i>I just want to say I feel
terrible about earlier.</i>

1730
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:38,803
<i>I don't want
any hard feelings.</i>

1731
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,316
<i>So I figured, why not be the
bigger man and just give you a call.</i>

1732
01:29:42,384 --> 01:29:43,874
Is Ramona with you?

1733
01:29:44,653 --> 01:29:47,383
I don't know.
Are you with me?

1734
01:29:48,957 --> 01:29:50,015
Yeah.

1735
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:54,154
Geez, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.

1736
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:57,020
No, I just spilled
hot cocoa on my crotch.

1737
01:29:57,099 --> 01:29:58,191
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1738
01:29:58,267 --> 01:29:59,666
<i>Listen,
as you know,</i>

1739
01:29:59,735 --> 01:30:01,760
<i>I'm opening a new
Chaos Theatre in Toronto.</i>

1740
01:30:01,837 --> 01:30:04,067
And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.

1741
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:07,006
It would feeI really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.

1742
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:10,875
They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!

1743
01:30:10,946 --> 01:30:12,277
Yeah?
Maybe I'll see you there.

1744
01:30:12,414 --> 01:30:13,745
<i>I hope so, amigo.</i>

1745
01:30:14,082 --> 01:30:16,516
I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.

1746
01:30:16,585 --> 01:30:17,643
What do you say?

1747
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:18,743
Mmm.

1748
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,082
Okay, laters.

1749
01:30:20,656 --> 01:30:22,146
What a perfect asshole.

1750
01:30:24,693 --> 01:30:27,560
Forget what I said earlier.
Finish him.

1751
01:30:52,054 --> 01:30:53,214
Password?

1752
01:30:53,288 --> 01:30:54,380
Whatever.

1753
01:30:54,923 --> 01:30:55,981
CooI.

1754
01:31:00,395 --> 01:31:01,760
Second password?

1755
01:31:04,566 --> 01:31:05,590
CooI.

1756
01:31:09,805 --> 01:31:12,330
<i>We're not having
no fun We're not having no fun</i>

1757
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:15,865
No. The first album is much
better than the first album.

1758
01:31:15,944 --> 01:31:18,037
<i>Fun</i>

1759
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,410
<i>No fun</i>

1760
01:31:26,621 --> 01:31:28,782
Scott! Let it go.

1761
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:31,015
Don't give him
the satisfaction.

1762
01:31:31,093 --> 01:31:33,220
What if I want
the satisfaction?

1763
01:31:33,295 --> 01:31:34,626
Scott Pilgrim!

1764
01:31:36,398 --> 01:31:38,696
Buddy, welcome to
the Chaos Theatre.

1765
01:31:39,067 --> 01:31:42,594
Somebody get this man a
drink. A Coke Zero, right?

1766
01:31:48,143 --> 01:31:49,838
I'm not here to drink.

1767
01:31:50,045 --> 01:31:52,206
Whoa, I've got
no beef with you.

1768
01:31:53,014 --> 01:31:55,778
What if I have
a beef with you?

1769
01:31:56,084 --> 01:31:58,951
Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?

1770
01:31:59,221 --> 01:32:00,381
You mean The League?

1771
01:32:00,455 --> 01:32:02,889
The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.

1772
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,619
I'll show you how
ancient of history it is!

1773
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:05,921
Wait, wait, wait!

1774
01:32:06,428 --> 01:32:09,124
There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.

1775
01:32:09,197 --> 01:32:13,827
The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.

1776
01:32:13,902 --> 01:32:15,870
Well, I ain't moving, buddy.

1777
01:32:17,005 --> 01:32:20,270
You wanna fight me for her?

1778
01:32:20,342 --> 01:32:22,173
Was that not clear?

1779
01:32:24,746 --> 01:32:25,974
Was that not clear?

1780
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:27,139
I don't know.

1781
01:32:27,215 --> 01:32:32,380
Now, why on earth
would you want to do that?

1782
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:34,449
Because I'm in love with her.

1783
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,492
Aw! I think this
deserves a song.

1784
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:49,798
Kimberly!

1785
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:52,106
<i>We are Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

1786
01:32:52,174 --> 01:32:55,507
<i>We are here to make money
and sell out and stuff.</i>

1787
01:32:55,577 --> 01:32:56,805
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

1788
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:55,764
Your club sucks,
by the way.

1789
01:33:55,837 --> 01:34:00,433
Well, if my cathedraI of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest

1790
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:03,307
for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,

1791
01:34:03,378 --> 01:34:07,644
then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.

1792
01:34:09,317 --> 01:34:12,218
And a fast entrance
into hell!

1793
01:34:12,287 --> 01:34:14,255
Scott!

1794
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,927
Knives?

1795
01:34:19,995 --> 01:34:21,292
That's priceless.

1796
01:34:21,363 --> 01:34:23,228
You'll pay for
what you did to him.

1797
01:34:23,298 --> 01:34:25,323
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,

1798
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,233
your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.

1799
01:34:28,303 --> 01:34:31,101
He was warned plenty of
times, but did he listen? No.

1800
01:34:31,172 --> 01:34:33,663
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!

1801
01:34:34,943 --> 01:34:36,001
What?

1802
01:34:36,077 --> 01:34:37,806
You broke the heart
that broke mine.

1803
01:34:37,879 --> 01:34:40,177
Get ready to Chau down!

1804
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,648
You're kidding, right?

1805
01:34:49,925 --> 01:34:51,017
Wow!

1806
01:34:51,092 --> 01:34:54,255
I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?

1807
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,728
That's incredible.

1808
01:35:06,841 --> 01:35:08,638
What the hell is your deaI?

1809
01:35:11,012 --> 01:35:12,377
You stole him!

1810
01:35:13,915 --> 01:35:15,075
Stole him!

1811
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,947
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1812
01:35:17,018 --> 01:35:19,486
You liar! Liar!

1813
01:35:19,754 --> 01:35:23,155
I didn't steaI your boyfriend!
I didn't steaI Scott!

1814
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,650
I didn't steaI anyone!

1815
01:35:33,401 --> 01:35:35,835
You steaI
my boyfriend!

1816
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:37,098
Wait! Wait!

1817
01:35:37,172 --> 01:35:40,141
Can we please stop all this
fighting? Nobody stole anybody.

1818
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:43,041
Knives, I dated you
and then I dated Ramona, okay?

1819
01:35:46,715 --> 01:35:49,377
Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.

1820
01:35:50,418 --> 01:35:51,885
You cheated on me, Scott?

1821
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:55,614
You cheated on both of us?

1822
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,385
You cheated on me
with Knives?

1823
01:35:57,459 --> 01:35:59,051
No,

1824
01:36:00,362 --> 01:36:02,887
I cheated on Knives
with you.

1825
01:36:03,365 --> 01:36:04,457
Is there a difference?

1826
01:36:05,233 --> 01:36:06,427
You weren't wronged?

1827
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,062
Right?

1828
01:36:10,538 --> 01:36:13,063
Game over.

1829
01:36:17,979 --> 01:36:19,207
Scotty,

1830
01:36:19,714 --> 01:36:22,683
you can cheat on these
ladies all you like.

1831
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:25,951
But you can't cheat

1832
01:36:27,222 --> 01:36:28,314
death.

1833
01:36:35,563 --> 01:36:37,155
Oh, man.

1834
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:41,426
Sorry.
Dying's got to suck.

1835
01:36:41,803 --> 01:36:45,136
You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.

1836
01:36:46,441 --> 01:36:48,033
Why him?

1837
01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:49,701
It's complicated.

1838
01:36:49,778 --> 01:36:51,905
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

1839
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:55,239
so now might be
a good time to get into it.

1840
01:36:56,551 --> 01:37:00,453
Truth is, it was me
who was obsessed.

1841
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:05,523
I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.

1842
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:10,688
I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.

1843
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:13,926
That's why I had to leave.

1844
01:37:14,035 --> 01:37:17,129
And that's when
he started paying attention.

1845
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:18,838
So, why go back?

1846
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,767
I can't help myself
around him, Scott,

1847
01:37:20,842 --> 01:37:24,778
he just has this way of
getting into my head.

1848
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,910
Well, that's
legitimately disappointing.

1849
01:37:28,283 --> 01:37:30,148
I really will leave
you alone forever now.

1850
01:37:30,218 --> 01:37:32,743
No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.

1851
01:37:34,289 --> 01:37:36,280
That is eviI.

1852
01:37:37,959 --> 01:37:41,156
I didn't mean for you to
get dragged into this, Scott.

1853
01:37:41,796 --> 01:37:44,196
I just wanted
something simple.

1854
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,693
I'm sorry
it had to end this way.

1855
01:37:48,336 --> 01:37:50,304
Well, I really
fought for you.

1856
01:37:50,472 --> 01:37:53,305
Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.

1857
01:37:56,211 --> 01:37:58,111
What? Wait.

1858
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,882
But I feeI like
I learned something.

1859
01:38:04,486 --> 01:38:06,477
Which would be great
if I wasn't dead.

1860
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:11,883
So alone.

1861
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,188
<i>You're not alone.</i>

1862
01:38:15,964 --> 01:38:17,056
Right!

1863
01:38:26,941 --> 01:38:28,203
Your hair looks stupid.

1864
01:38:30,512 --> 01:38:31,877
Second password?

1865
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,842
Yeah, I saw it.

1866
01:38:36,918 --> 01:38:39,045
It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.

1867
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,485
<i>No fun</i>

1868
01:38:41,389 --> 01:38:42,913
Scott! Let it go.

1869
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:44,322
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

1870
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:45,552
Stephen,
the new lineup rocks.

1871
01:38:45,627 --> 01:38:46,992
You guys sound
way better without me.

1872
01:38:47,295 --> 01:38:48,990
Young Neil,
you have learned well.

1873
01:38:49,063 --> 01:38:52,430
From this point forward
you will be known as "Neil. "

1874
01:38:52,767 --> 01:38:53,893
And, Kim,

1875
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:56,964
I'm sorry about everything.

1876
01:38:58,239 --> 01:38:59,706
I'm sorry about me.

1877
01:39:01,042 --> 01:39:03,237
Scott Pilgrim!
Hey, buddy!

1878
01:39:03,311 --> 01:39:06,769
Save it! You're
pretentious! This club sucks!

1879
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:08,372
I've got beef.
Let's do it.

1880
01:39:08,449 --> 01:39:10,110
Wait, wait, wait!

1881
01:39:11,553 --> 01:39:15,148
You want to
fight me for her?

1882
01:39:15,423 --> 01:39:16,515
No.

1883
01:39:17,225 --> 01:39:18,590
I want to fight you for me.

1884
01:39:24,866 --> 01:39:26,390
Um...
Kim!

1885
01:39:26,467 --> 01:39:28,958
We are Sex Bob-Omb
and we are here to watch

1886
01:39:29,037 --> 01:39:31,471
Scott Pilgrim
kick your teeth in!

1887
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:32,699
One! Two! Three! Four!

1888
01:39:53,695 --> 01:39:55,287
How's it going back there?

1889
01:39:56,564 --> 01:39:58,725
You dick!

1890
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:01,066
Knives?

1891
01:40:01,135 --> 01:40:02,693
I know you're in here.
Don't attack...

1892
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,465
Scott!

1893
01:40:06,674 --> 01:40:08,437
SteaI my boyfriend!

1894
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:09,806
Taste my steeI!

1895
01:40:10,845 --> 01:40:11,869
Enough!

1896
01:40:11,946 --> 01:40:13,038
No, Scott.

1897
01:40:13,448 --> 01:40:16,042
This fat-ass hurt me
and I will have my revenge!

1898
01:40:16,117 --> 01:40:19,951
No, Knives, I hurt you.
I cheated on you.

1899
01:40:21,623 --> 01:40:23,614
I cheated on both of you.

1900
01:40:25,593 --> 01:40:27,356
I'm really sorry.

1901
01:40:27,962 --> 01:40:29,429
And you're not a fat-ass.

1902
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:31,896
She didn't mean that.

1903
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:35,667
So, are we all good?

1904
01:40:38,907 --> 01:40:40,374
Never felt better.

1905
01:40:40,441 --> 01:40:41,874
Yoo-hoo!

1906
01:40:42,944 --> 01:40:45,504
Are we done with
the hugging and learning?

1907
01:40:46,781 --> 01:40:48,840
I thought we had
a fight going on here!

1908
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:50,482
You've got a fight,
all right!

You made me

tract for seven years.

Yeah, still my girl.

to get all the eviI exes'

a lot in common.

It is?
Yeah.

01:46:04,799 --> 01:46:07,097
You should probably
get it cut.

Yeah, you're right.

1972
01:46:09,637 --> 01:46:10,865
I should get it cut.

1973

I should probably disappear.

After all that?

1979
01:46:23,951 --> 01:46:25,942
I still need a new life.

1980
01:46:26,754 --> 01:46:30,246
I came here to escape, but
the past keeps catching up.

getting hurt because of me.

For what?

1987
01:46:50,211 --> 01:46:53,180
For being the nicest guy
I ever dated.

1988
