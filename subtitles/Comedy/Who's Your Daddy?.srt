1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,038
Ready? Ok.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,000
Be agressive!
Be agressive!

3
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh Chris, show me your spirit dick.
- I love your pampams, baby.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,000
You're my number 1.

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,000
You like that?
- Oh yes.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,800
Oh yes.

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,350
You score like a quarterback.
- Yea, I know baby.. I just.. yea, right there.

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,076
Easy baby, watch the face.
It's not big jerky.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,478
Pigs in a blanket, baby?
- Uh yeah mama, stick that pig in the blanket.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,468
You want the little piggies in the blanky?

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,637
Suck my big fat hog.

12
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:16,558
Chris dear, were you dreaming about
breakfast?

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,548
Oh sweetie, you're boiling up with sweat.
Your sheets are soaking wet.

14
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,349
Oh honey.
- Mother!

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,500
Mom, look, a big giant spider!

16
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,072
A spider?
Honey, I don't see anything over there.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Chris, are you okay?
Your penis is purple.

18
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,000
Mom, you can't look at that.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,599
Sweetheart, please, I'm your mother.
I've seen your penis plenty of times.

20
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,313
Ofcourse I've never seen it so lumpy
and purple.

21
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,200
Maybe you broke it when you fell out of bed.
I think I should call somebody.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,878
Mom, leave. I didn't break anything. I think
I would know. Just go!

23
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,551
I can't just leave, you've broken your mister
penis puppet. Now let mommy look at it again.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
I think I'm gonna be sick.

25
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,299
What in tarnation are those red bumps
on your back?

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
O Jesus, please strike me with lightning.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
What's up with the retard?

28
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:06,040
Your brother may have broken his penis.
- No way!

29
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,354
Ok, everyone out.

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,836
Dude, you totally spooched instant pudding in your
own bed. And you're still sporting Maj. Wood.

31
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,276
Now at the bat, Mark McGuire..
McGuire..

32
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,675
I will kill you. If not today, I will hunt you
down, you'll be very much dead. Mom!

33
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:26,348
This is unbelievable. I don't even know who
to tell first. Thank God for E- mail.

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
Danny, leave him alone.
He's not well. Let's go.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,830
Honey, what's "spooched"?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,559
Oh, man..

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,110
Sorry about that!

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,699
Buster, you bad dog, you.

39
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:17,199
Have a nice day.

40
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:45,877
Young man..

41
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,437
Young man! You planning on taking the
motorcycle this morning?

42
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,800
Are you? Yes or no!
- Yes sir, but it's..

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,436
Helmet! No but's about it!

44
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,751
It's for your own safety, dear.

45
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:01,752
Hundreds of thousands of people here cracked
their skulls like mellons riding motorcycles.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,980
Your mother's right.
The statistics don't lie.

47
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,000
Helmet, or no motorcycle.
End of discussion.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,799
Hey, looking good baby!

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,199
You're gonna have to beat the girls
off you with a stick.

50
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
Nice helmet, loser!
Get a life!

51
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,000
Nerd!

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Nice scooter, sissy.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Come on guys, come on.
Citizen needs a rest, ok?

54
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,500
Are you okay, little fella?

55
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't touch me!

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
Watch the face!
No, not there!

57
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,797
Hughes, you're late.
- No, I finished it last night, ok?

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, well, that line was yesterday at 5 o'clock,
not last night.

59
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry, I meant to call you.
I was working late at the store.

60
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,672
Hughes, you are the best writer on my staff.

61
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:15,754
Next to me. I mean, your attention to
detail is amperaveled in high school journalism.

62
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,555
But if you want to be a reporter.. No, if that
is what you want, above all else in this world..

63
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,500
It is all about dead lines and dedication.

64
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:34,500
If I ever make out as a senior, and find myself writing for a paper, rather
than for anyone, I'm sure this little peptark will have additional meaning.

65
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,399
Late, look, no. I have a paper to write, ok?

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
I have a circulation department that counts on me
to deliver them the goods, day in, day out.

67
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,949
If I deveate just once, the entire ecosystem
collapses..

68
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,995
Ok, it's not a job. Beeing the editor of Xenia
Porcupine Harold is an extra-collicular activity.

69
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,838
You know, you should line up and start having
some fun.

70
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,276
Are you ok?
- Yeah.

71
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,427
I should've seen that coming.
Eight graders are getting pretty consistant.

72
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,278
Ok, well, moving on.

73
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,148
I was wondering if you would...

74
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,750
if we went to the Spring Fling?

75
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,956
Spring Fling?
- Together.

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,596
Not like as a date or anything.

77
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,507
No, we could do double-coverage there.

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,987
Who's wearing what, who's dating who..

79
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,350
Spring Fling..

80
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,668
I was already planning to ask someone..
As a date.

81
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:07,033
But thanks, I'm sure it would've been fun.

82
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,632
Hey, no problem.

83
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:15,798
I assumed that you were solo, so..

84
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,350
No, this will actually work out much better for me,
because I am terrible at picking out..

85
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,110
Ok, well.. good chat.

86
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,875
I think I'm gonna vomit again.
- What happened to you?

87
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,200
Erin happened. I did everything you told me
to.

88
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
I stood tall, shoulders back, buff my package,
and in she walks.

89
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,552
A vision! I'm feeling the vibe, I get ready to
ask her to the big dance, then BAM..

90
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,788
I vomited what I ate two nights ago.
- I get it. Did you puke on her?

91
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,278
No, I think I hid it from her really well.
I turned and I pretended I was gonna cough,

92
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,153
and I cough in my hand, just since I was
going to the bathroom.

93
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,673
Most of it.. She probably just thought I
was nervous or something, you know..

94
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,518
Shy..

95
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,514
Good morning, girls.

96
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,748
That's the one that totally threw up all over
himself infront of Erin.

97
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,000
Afterwards, she started to cry and had to
go home sick.

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,878
You can still smell it on him.

99
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,514
What about you? Today's the big day.
Brittany van Horn..

100
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,431
I don't think I can go through with this.
- Shut your mouth. Brittany has a major ass.

101
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,998
Three different guys in colleges have proposed
marriage to her. They're doctors, they know good ass.

102
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,274
I'm afraid to ask her to the dance.
- Afraid of what? That she might laugh at your face?

103
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,269
That the other popular kids might mock and criticise
you, like that spooky girl with warts last year?

104
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,197
Guys like us are immune to those
daily rituals.

105
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:15,153
Brittany.

106
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,835
Chris...

107
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:44,509
Oh no.. no, not here.

108
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,548
Not now, please no.. not here!
- Take me now, Chris.

109
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,115
Grandma's naked.. wrinkly.

110
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,346
First base: kissing Brittany.
- Maize.

111
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:03,235
Second base: touching Brittany.

112
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,715
Third base..
- Fingering Brittany!

113
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:20,032
Brittany...
Would you want to go with me to Spring Fling?

114
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,990
It was harsh!
Even Prof. Torkenbush started laughing.

115
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,033
Why even asking her out? Why?
This is your fault, you're the one who made me.

116
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,913
These sort of things happen all the time.
- To who?

117
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,634
To you, that's wh... and me...

118
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,596
Does it concern you, that our memories of our
time spent in high school suck?

119
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:52,798
Does it bother you that in the future, when people
refer to the losers they went to high school with,

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,239
they will be in fact refering to us?

121
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,514
High school is about what you learn.

122
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,714
For instance, I've learned you can keep puking on
yourself, long after you think you're done.

123
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,471
And with diarreia.
- What are you talking about? I am serious, Adam.

124
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:16,600
This is supposed to be it, the time of our lives,
and It's not.

125
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,994
It's not even the half time of our lives.

126
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,594
Who are we? What do we stand for?
How will we be remembered in fine post graduation?

127
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,791
Cool, potatoe fries.

128
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,312
Hello ladies. It's the big day for the home team.

129
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,067
Adam threw up on Erin, and Chris
humiliated himself in History class.

130
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,000
I didn't throw up directly on her..
Mostly on my hand.

131
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,389
And it was Algebra, not History.

132
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,879
Well, that changes everything. Hurray,
we really are the popular kids now.

133
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,432
Assholes!
I thought we voted on Goth.

134
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,350
What the hell are you wearing?
- It's goth, man.

135
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:03,995
You look like a hairy ugly chick, man.
Is that your mother's make-up?

136
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,479
Eric, what gives?
- Last week? The meeting?

137
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:14,432
We talked about dressing Goth, to strenghten
our identity by the end of the year.

138
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,153
We talked about it, we didn't vote.
- Actually, we didn't talk about it. Murphy did.

139
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,499
We ignored him.
- Ok, let's get it on right now. Let's vote.

140
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,152
All those who favor dressing Goth,
raise your hands, raise them high!

141
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:37,995
So Chris, your folks going out of town this weekend?
- What? The clock says 15min till the party!

142
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:51,870
Hudson Reed.

143
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,918
Does everyone else see them walking... slow?

144
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,158
What is it about that guy?
He's spent his whole life coming in first place.

145
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,067
And I spent mine as runner-up.
Will it ever change?

146
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,716
No, maybe I was popular in the past life.
Maybe in some perlo universe.

147
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:44,913
I'm Hudson Reed, and he's me.
- Yea, like in an ultra time continued.

148
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,912
When is it my turn to be Hudson?
- You guys up for a trading session?

149
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,509
What are you doing?
Not here, dammit! Never here!

150
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,793
That is it!
I'm getting sick and tired of this.

151
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,916
We are not losers. I bet in other schools, we
would be the cool guys.

152
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,158
I am not about to graduate as a wimper.

153
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,798
I'm going out with a bang.

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,072
You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Probably not, but let me tell you this.

155
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,354
Chris Hughes is gonna have the mother
of all high school parties.

156
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,307
The grandmother of all high school parties.

157
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,759
One small problem..
A cool party requires alcohol.

158
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,994
For us, it would require huge quantities
of alcohol.

159
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,110
Boys, while we're away:
Chris, you're in charge of the store.

160
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,594
And no monkey business.

161
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,839
I'm proud of you. When you grab this
party thing by the balls.

162
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,038
I mean look at you. Stealing alcohol, just
to further up our popularity.

163
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,947
This is so decent of you.
- Thanks, you're doing a good job in clearing my consciousness.

164
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,469
Now, will you help me start filling these
jugs?

165
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:22,673
You crazy? I'm not going to jail, just because
you want to be popular for a day.

166
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,634
"Alcohol fame.
Drinks, drinks, and more free drinks."

167
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,596
"Party like It's still 1999! Come enjoy free
drinks and food at Chris Hughes' house!"

168
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:38,110
How many fliers did you give to people?
- I don't know. Maybe a thousand.

169
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,552
1000!? No, we can't have 1000, ok?
I'm definetly gonna get grounded for 1000.

170
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,389
We should cancel. We are cancelling, no more.
- Holy shit, chicks!

171
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,028
Hey Brittany.. and friends.
- OTR? On the rack?

172
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,754
Inventory. New sample.
It's washed.

173
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,509
You going to the party tonight?

174
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:17,150
There's no party tonight. Trust me, I would've
heard that long before you would.

175
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,711
Murphy, educate the ladies.

176
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,509
Who's Chris Hugges?
- Chris Hughes, that's me.

177
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,678
Your name's Chris?
- Yea...

178
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,873
You kids are gonna want to get there early.
We're expecting overflow by 9.

179
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:45,074
Is there going to be liquor?
- Which part of "free drinks" on the flier didn't you understand?

180
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,586
Are you talking to me?
- No.

181
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,190
We're outta here.
Grab me a pack of cigarretes.

182
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:01,519
So you'll stop by the party?
Get jiggy with it?

183
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,394
Jiggy.. party...
Right...

184
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:07,826
Later.

185
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:17,471
Nice move, she'll definetly be there, man!

186
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,115
Put on a condom, I'll get you some.
And some biscuits, for later.

187
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,471
No.

188
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,391
Doyle, bad born guy.
No donkey.

189
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,875
Let's get this show on the road!
- What show? I said no band.

190
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:45,710
No, the show. My dad's huge monster truck
porn collection.

191
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,756
The folks went bowling last night,
and he forgot to lock his closet.

192
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,476
Your dad locks his closet?
- So I pulled a total Bond, sneaked in and grabbed it.

193
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,634
A little pre-party gig, gentlemen.

194
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,096
Slide over, bitch!
- You slide over, bitch!

195
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,394
Who are you calling a bitch?
- Bitch, I'm calling you bitch, bitch.

196
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:14,278
Girls, do I need to separate you?
- Ok, let's just batten down the hatch, cause here comes the snatch.

197
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,670
This is awesome.
- Hello there, cowboy.

198
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,826
Time to settle up. Is that a gun in your pocket sheriff,
or are you just looking to bone me?

199
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,957
It looks like your sweet ass needs Brandon.
- Adam.. you got this from your dad's closet?

200
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,836
Yeah...
- That adds a whole new meaning to raw hide.

201
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,316
Your dad's playing with the wrong end of
the food.

202
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:49,788
Yo, pimp daddies! The Murph is ready for the party.

203
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,553
These are my new tailless leather pants.
- Cool! Come-small. Now this is a classic.

204
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,278
Party's blazin'? Wall to wall losers.
What are you boys watching?

205
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:08,836
Nothing.
- Bro, that's a dick-flick.

206
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:14,717
- No, no, this is on..
- "Why don't you grab onto my sattle- horn?"

207
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,471
..Discovery Channel. - And what did they discover?
That some guy shot the pulp up their ass?

208
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,509
That's a high hard one.
- Where are you going anyway?

209
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,872
To get light... by a girl.

210
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:32,631
I'm not willing to watch gay orgy like my
brother. But thanks.

211
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:38,392
"I don't believe I got your name, cowboy?
- They call me the rump rangler."

212
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,989
"A male pig has a corkscrew shaped penis,
which he slowly winds into the female piggy."

213
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,548
I don't understand. Free drinks, free food,
free drinks. Nothing. Where are the teenagers?

214
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:13,479
Boys! We've got someone coming!
- Turn on the music.

215
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,875
Hi... okay.

216
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,115
No.

217
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,471
Kate, wait up.

218
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,557
Thanks for stopping by. You don't have to go,
you can stay.

219
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,509
That's ok. Big crowds kinda make me
claustrofobic.

220
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,028
Yeah, me too.
The fire Marshall was gonna shut us down.

221
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,075
But he felt sorry for us.
- That makes two of us.

222
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,516
You look..

223
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,757
different tonight.

224
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,634
Different? Really? Different how?
Different bad, good, creepy?

225
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:17,625
Good.. different. Yeah, different good.

226
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,269
About the Spring Fling..
If the offer still stands..

227
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,634
and you haven't asked anyone yet,
I was kinda wondering if you..

228
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,750
I'd love to.
- Really? You would?

229
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,913
Then it's...
- It's a working day.

230
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:53,875
Umm, well... good chat.

231
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,307
So Danny, how was your weekend?
- Great father. I read the last Harry Potter book.

232
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,875
It was magical.
- Reading? Can't go around there.

233
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:13,865
And Chris?
- I just worked at the store.

234
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:18,548
Delivered papers, babysat my kid brother.
The usual.

235
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:25,518
The usual? That's interesting, because as usual,
I was at the store today, doing inventory.

236
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,640
And much to my amazement, the considerable
ammount of stock was missing and not paid for.

237
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:35,432
Now I find that highly unusual.

238
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,153
Chris, care to explain yourself? I mean,
were you feeding the homeless again, son?

239
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:43,035
Is that why all my potatoe chips, party dips
and pot pies are missing?

240
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,471
Or perhaps did the lord Jesus himself drop by
and turned all my alcohol into water?!

241
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,595
Father, you might also wanna question Chris
about the hardcore man-on-man gay porno..?

242
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,432
You see, there was a...
- A party?

243
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,476
Is that what there was, son? A bunch of underaged kids
running around through our house, no adult supervision?

244
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,355
Alcohol, condoms... gay porn!!?

245
00:24:12,557 --> 00:24:16,553
He wishes. - You're grounded. I've already
deducted the money from your bank account.

246
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,625
"Loser."
- I'll get it.

247
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,957
Carl.
- Harry Potter, huh?

248
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,750
I'm looking for Chris Hughes.
- You're looking at him.

249
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,067
I'm sorry to inform you that your parents are dead.
- I was just wishing that. -Excuse me?

250
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,557
I hate to break it to you, but everybody's breathing
here. Thanks for stopping by and creeping me out though..

251
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,038
Your biological parents, Chris.
There was an accident.

252
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:55,038
I never met them.

253
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:57,432
They're good people. Decent, hardworking.

254
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,028
I was their lawyer. Hunt, Michael.
- Mike Hunt.

255
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,038
I prefer Michael.

256
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,269
I'm so sorry for your loss, Chris. There'll be a reading
of the will in Los Angeles, 3 days hence.

257
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,634
And my law-firma provides you with 2 airline tickets.
Chris, loss is never easy.

258
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:19,150
I'm reminded when the super group Lamb broke
up, I was devastated.

259
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:24,229
Sweetie, we love you very much.
We tried to give you a better life.

260
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:32,230
You did. You have. I guess I never really
thought about them or who they were.

261
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,000
They weren't church-going folk.
- What does that mean?

262
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,999
Son, your parents were..

263
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,151
Tell him Carl! - Tell me Carl!
- Your mother was a stripper,

264
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:45,798
and your father was a bouncer in a club, where
she shook her moneytree.

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,516
Club Pussay Whipped, I think that's what it was
called. Isn't that right, Carl?

266
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,316
My parents worked in a club called Pussy Whipped?
- Puss-ay Whipped, dear. It's french.

267
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,913
Your mother's right. Puss-ay is the correct pronounciation. -We
didn't wanna tell you for until you had low self of steam issues.

268
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:04,700
I mean afterall, your biological mother beeing a
stripper and practically a prostitute,

269
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,990
and your biological father having no more ambition
than to be a bouncer.

270
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,796
It's Spring break, you wouldn't miss school.
We want you to be there for the reading of the will.

271
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
Your father has agreed to postpone you beeing
grounded.

272
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,471
It's the christian thing to do.

273
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:24,913
But I didn't know them, I mean, you're my parents.
- Yes dear, but we're not dead. They are.

274
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,911
You disgust me!
- Can you hear me now?

275
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:41,556
Ok, we're lost.
- Move it!

276
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:58,115
Chris Hughes?
- Present.

277
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,595
I'm Brookes.
Mr. Hunt sent me to retrieve you and your..

278
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,430
..travel companion. Got any other baggage?

279
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,951
My dad's a gay alcoholic porn freak.

280
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:27,355
Sweet ride!
Yo Brookes, do you know Ice Cube?

281
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,035
How about Destiny's Children?
- Get in!

282
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,276
Let's get down to business.
Chris, your biological parents had only one child.

283
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,996
They provided you with their future and an estate.
- Great, they left you with the string and a pole.

284
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,919
Are you familiar with the adult magazine Heaven?
- Your mother showed her beaver in Heaven?

285
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:31,384
I masturbated at that magazine.
- I apologize for Adam. He's the village idiot. Any village, just pick one.

286
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:34,951
Well, nevertheless, he's correct. Your mother
did indeed pose for the magazine.

287
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,394
Dude, you're gonna be in therapy forever. I got my
dick wet by looking at your mother. How wrong is that?

288
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:50,230
Did my old man sell my mom in the prostitution?

289
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,951
Pardon?

290
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,711
Even though I didn't know my white trash parents,
I take full responsibility for teir death.

291
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,708
What's the damage?
- Close to 87 million dollars.

292
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,355
Fair enough. I mean a paper-out, I have money
saved from working at my parents' grocery store.

293
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:10,509
I can work out some sort of payment plan..
Did you just say they left me in debt of $87mil!?

294
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,788
No, they left you $87mil to spend.

295
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:21,596
But that's just available cash. The real empire
is the magazine.

296
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,153
What magazine?
- Heaven.

297
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:35,913
Chris, your father was Peter Mack.
- The founder and publisher of the entire Heaven Empire?

298
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:39,317
Yes, that Peter Mack.
That means your mother was..

299
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,115
Honey Mack.
- As in the biggest breasts on the planet? Angel of the decade?

300
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,392
That would be Chris' mother.

301
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:55,438
What does all this mean?
- Chris, you're the owner and publisher of Heaven.

302
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,393
That's not possible, I'm just a kid.
- Just a kid with a rather large bank account,

303
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:07,038
which my law firma would be very happy to continue
to administer, at your father's request.

304
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,865
Administer away.
- Chris, I have some paperwork for you to sign.

305
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:18,114
Not so fast. We're not signing anything,
until we have a lawyer look over it.

306
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:24,190
I am a lawyer.
- Well, excellent. Chris, go and sign.

307
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,153
Are you ready to go home, sir?
- To Xenia?

308
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:38,875
No, better. The mansion.
- Where the naked angels are?

309
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:44,632
Wipe your mouth. Chris, prepare to
get your freecone.

310
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,634
Young Mr. Hughes just signed.

311
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:03,152
Who is this? Oh, sorry, wrong number.

312
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:10,192
Pull my finger.

313
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:19,680
Nice one.
- That's what a millionaire smells like.

314
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,548
We've died and gone to..
- ..Heaven.

315
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,795
Are you ready, little man?

316
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,432
Come.

317
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,428
Don't be scared.

318
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,190
Oh my god. Hi, my name is Adam.

319
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,307
I'm Chris' right hand man.

320
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,756
Oh my god.. Let me take a look at you.

321
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,755
Oh, look at you.

322
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:32,788
You're hung like your daddy, and you have
eyes like your mother. Bless their souls.

323
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,394
You knew my parents?
- Oh, very well.

324
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:42,307
Yes, Miss Harding was your father's personal
secretary for 15 party- filled years.

325
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,951
But there's no time for chit chat. I have several
items that need your immediate attention.

326
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,469
Sir.

327
00:33:56,076 --> 00:34:00,517
After you, sir.
- No, I insist, sir.

328
00:34:01,115 --> 00:34:02,439
Boys..

329
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,990
Hi Chris. - Hey baby!
- Well, we're most likely.. -Dead.

330
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,315
It's important to us that you understand that we've..
- ..always loved and adored you.

331
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:18,911
And the only reason we gave you up for adoption
is because we didn't have any money.

332
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,594
Your mother was a stripper..
- Exotic dancer..

333
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,710
I was just a bouncer, trying to scrape enough
money through life.

334
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,913
He always had his eyes turned up for management.

335
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,637
But we've found you a great home, with lovely
and caring nice people.

336
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,277
Your new mom won't be showing her plumbing
to the whole world.

337
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,677
Son, I'm a moron, and I made millions and I
turned those millions into a billion dollar empire.

338
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,556
You, Chris, on the other hand,
you're smart, talented,

339
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,355
..you're charming. You're a natural born leader.

340
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,076
And son, the sky is the limit in what you'll
turn this legacy into.

341
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,594
And remember, sweetheart: When going down on a
lady, always isolate the little man in the boat.

342
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,268
Kisses!

343
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,389
Those are my parents?
- How awesome is that!

344
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,753
Which one of you fine young men is Chris?
- Me.

345
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,309
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!

346
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,918
Danger! Danger!
Alert! Alert!

347
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,077
Let me look at you.

348
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,398
It's like having a mirror into the soul.

349
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,637
Can I help you?
- It is I, little one, that has been left alone in the cruel world, to help you.

350
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,516
Look upon me as your spirit guide. Call upon me
for anything, count upon me for everything.

351
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,077
I am Duncan Mack, your father Peter's brother.

352
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,831
Please, call me Duncay.
- Uncle Duncay! I have an uncle.

353
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:25,036
Adam, look, I have a new uncle.
- When do we get to see the naked girls?

354
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,871
We have a lot of catching up to do. But first, the press has
been beating down our doors, waiting for a statement from you.

355
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,277
Never abuse the press, dear boy. They get far too
much pleasure out of it. Your father taught me that.

356
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,958
Ladies and Gentlemen. Today marks a new birth for
Heaven,

357
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,114
as the Mack wings have been passed on to their
only child:

358
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,117
Chris Hughes Mack.

359
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,518
Just Chris Hughes, no Mack.

360
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,748
Ladies and Gentlemen, let me present to you
the new king of the Heaven empire,

361
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,306
and more importantly, my nephew,
Chris Hughes Mack.

362
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,710
Come on.

363
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,476
Hi.

364
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,159
Thank you all for coming out. Good night.

365
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,916
Hey, Chris, Patty Landry, Enertainment tomorrow.

366
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,391
The big question: does the newest, most elegable
billionaire bachelor have a girlfriend?

367
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,911
Girlfriend? Well, I..
- Brittany Van Horn.

368
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,715
Brittany Van Horn?
- Brittany van Horn? Well, she's one lucky girl.

369
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,835
Speaking of lucky girls, let me introduce to you
this month's centerfold

370
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,159
and Angel by any other name:
Miss Elissa Bauer!

371
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,717
Mr. Mack, are you still a virgin?

372
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,195
Hello America. As this month's Angel, I can assure
you,

373
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,030
that Chris will be in very capable hands.

374
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,797
And don't forget. This month's issue will be
out this monday. I'll see you when you see me.

375
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,672
Thank you! Thank you everyone, thank you
for coming!

376
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,099
I left several messages for Mr. Mike Hunt. I'm
starting to worry.

377
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,155
Don't worry about it. Danny, pass the country
squash, will you?

378
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,875
Holy fuck!
- Danny, what did you just say!?

379
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,436
"Young Chris Hughes Mack, raised
right here in the heartland of Xenia,

380
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,271
was crowned king of the greatest pornography
empire on the planet."

381
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,039
This can't be good.
- Mack? What in god's name..

382
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,597
Satan be that name!
- "..the adopted son of local grocers, Carl and Beverly Hughes."

383
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,835
I need a drink.
- Honey, you don't drink.

384
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,077
You're right, maybe I just need an aspirine for
this irritating pain.

385
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,956
SLEE-P-TIME
(Remedy for Sleepness)

386
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,271
Mom! Dad!

387
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,670
Only the losers are working for spring break.
- We're working overtime for the kids!

388
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,478
We are the kids.
- Ok, fine, forget about it. I don't need you, I'll print the damn paper myself.

389
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:11,389
Just go party, drink, fornicate.

390
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,994
But let me remind you of this, ok? No high school student has
ever just woken up one day and suddenly become a millionaire.

391
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:26,594
"The local Xenia High School Senior, Chris Hughes
Mack, inherited a whopping $87mil today."

392
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,829
Check you out, bro.

393
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:57,032
Tonight is your night. You're the boss;
anything you need, you just ask for it.

394
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,072
Brittany Van Horn?

395
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,030
This is just so exciting! He's worth billions and
I'm his girlfriend.

396
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,472
We've been dating ever since 3rd grade.
- I can't believe he said your name on TV.

397
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,514
That's huge. You're so lucky.
- Tell me about it.

398
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:21,112
We're gonna get married and I'm gonna get out
of this stupid town.

399
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,233
Frank is such a cutie-pie.
- Chris.

400
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,628
What? - His name is Chris. Your future
husband's name is.. Chris..

401
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,152
...Hughes.
- Whatever, like that matters.

402
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:51,478
So how does it feel?
- Like leaning back too far in a chair.

403
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,911
If you are anything like your father,
you will be just fine.

404
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:03,070
I just wish I would've known him.
- He was smooth as soak.

405
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,596
He was the one who got me take off all my
clothes.

406
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,476
Good old dad. So, Angel of the Month, are your
folks proud of you for..

407
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:18,500
..taking off my clothes?
- Something like that.

408
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:23,112
They're ok with it. Plus, it's artistic nudes,
not those lame beaver shots.

409
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,791
You see, most of the mags want you all oiled
up,

410
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,119
and spread wide eagle.. maybe going down
with some girl.

411
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,197
Which is cool and all, but where's the art in it?

412
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,835
Would you excuse me one second?
I have to use the men's.. room..

413
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,831
Excuse me.
- Elissa!

414
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,717
Chris!

415
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,030
Looking good, baby.

416
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,952
You're Heather McKay, Angel of February! You're the most
limber woman I have ever seen, including Ricky Martin.

417
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,835
I've jerked at your pictures so many times, that
my blisters have blisters,

418
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,353
and I just didn't say that out loud, did I?
- It's ok. I've heard it all before.

419
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,869
You must have gotten my letters.
You must have gotten my letters.

420
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:40,876
This? This isn't real. It's a new fad.
I can get you one.

421
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,833
Really? No thank you.

422
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,717
We've got a lot in common; turn on's, sunsets,
long walks on the beach.

423
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,277
Manhood riding motorcycles.
You're a Pisces, I'm a Leo.

424
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,349
You were a high school cheerleader.
I currently attend high school.

425
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,838
The name's Adam, but my friends call me..
- Dumpy!

426
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:11,353
I need to talk to you.
- Chris? Hi. I'm your february Angel.

427
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,155
Heather.
- Chris, buddy!

428
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,956
You two aren't friends, are you?
- I need to talk to you now!

429
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,032
Hey! I was looking for you.
- Hey. Something came up.

430
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,552
Come on Mr. Chairman, are you ready for your
"shake-your- booty" dance? - I'm the son of Peter Mack.

431
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,628
My booty was born ready to shake.
- Well, let's go.

432
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,992
It's just bad luck.
If they died before he was 18,

433
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,159
this estate would have automatically belong
to you.

434
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,353
It's dreadful! Just thinking about him puts me into
coma. I mean, where the hell is Xenia, Ohio, anyway?

435
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,108
It's near Columbus.
- I know where it is.

436
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,152
I've lived for 10 years under the shadow of
my idiot brother,

437
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,590
and now, everything's in the hands of this
idiot child.

438
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,759
I don't know how long I can keep up with this
"uncy duncay" routine, before I break his head!

439
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,114
The important thing here is to make sure he does
not catch wind with your fancy math with the books.

440
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,552
I don't wish to go to jail for embezzlement.

441
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,512
Consuelo, hold it!

442
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:41,157
Nobody is going to jail.
Especially not me.

443
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,277
And if anybody has to go to jail, it will be you. So put this
on your legal post-it's: "never mention embezzlement again!"

444
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,829
Let's just focus on trying to keep it together
for a few weeks.

445
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,157
I can convene the board of directors the minute
he misses the issue's dead line.

446
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,070
Then, the entire empire is all ours.
- It's mine! It's mine!

447
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:07,913
It's mine!

448
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,318
I spoke to your mother this morning.
- How is she doing?

449
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:15,829
Is she gonna be medicated?
- No, why? -Never mind.

450
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,800
It seems like everybody in Xenia, Ohio, are a
little baddy over this whole incident.

451
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,355
She's concerned that all this pressure will
get to you.

452
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,233
Pressure?

453
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,753
You have next month's issue to get to print, not to mention
the preparations for the next board of directors meeting.

454
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,148
And let's see.. the real estate approvals..

455
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,989
Can't you do all that?
- I'd love to... help you out.

456
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,751
But It's not my company, Chris.
It's yours.

457
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,429
I am simply here to smooth the transition to you.

458
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:58,512
Does Chris get to pick the nudy girls?
- Ofcourse. To run Heaven is to be the final say, and who becomes an Angel.

459
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,476
I love this job already.
- Good, because today, I thought we could begin with financial quotion reviews.

460
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:10,675
Financial quotion reviews?
- I love hard work.

461
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,114
There was a reporter on the phone, calling
from Xenia Porcupine.

462
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,514
Kate!
- Psycho- lesbo.

463
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,675
Hello Kate.
- Chris, I saw it on the news. Everybody did.

464
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,079
I know, I still can't believe it.
- Chris, I hope you grant the Porcupine Exclusive.

465
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,114
Yeah, sure.
- So, I guess I'll see you in a couple of days then.

466
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:41,347
The Spring Fling. I wouldn't miss it.
- Good morning boys.

467
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,757
Guess what, my mom went out and got me a
new dress.

468
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,273
I hope you'll like it.

469
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,918
Hello?
- Good morning. -Good morning.

470
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,193
What are you doing here? - Hello?
- We live here.

471
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,478
For a few months at least. All the Angels that live
in the mansion were promoting the magazine.

472
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,994
Chris, your dad was a fucking Einstein!

473
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,034
Would you guys like to come out with us to the pool?
- A refreshing dip in the water? Yes!

474
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,835
No, we can't. We have to work.
- Work? But you're the big boss.

475
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,713
Couldn't we do this later?
- The issue has to get to print,

476
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,677
and you have a lot of catching up to do.
But you're the big boss, it's your decision.

477
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,510
Chris, might I conference with you for the
moment? Excuse us.

478
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,550
Two hot chicks who seemingly have no issues
with nudity want to hang out with us.

479
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,992
This is our chance to lose virginity.

480
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,398
Uncle Duncay, time for a lunch break.
Books and charts are gonna have to wait.

481
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,237
By order of the big boss.

482
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,831
That's it!

483
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,110
It's cool.

484
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,074
Let's play.

485
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,833
I am so glad that we spent time getting
to know you.

486
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,635
Yeah Chris, I'm happy that your folks died.

487
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,311
Mind if I come in?
- Yes, I do. Can you please leave?

488
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,472
Can I offer you something to drink?

489
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,268
Why Mr. Bond, aren't we a little too young to drink?
- Age has no power over style.

490
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,588
Slow down, stud. - Care for a bubblebath?
- I don't think so.

491
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,027
Oh, please..

492
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,958
What are you doing?
- Nice.

493
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,878
Cheesy..

494
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,353
Oh, give me this.

495
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:35,675
I just stopped by to check on you.
And all this week has been pretty crazy.

496
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,998
I mean, you're just a kid, and now you..
- Wait.. I'm not a kid..

497
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,318
I'm a man.
- I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.

498
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:49,434
But you know, no matter how old someone is,
this kind of change in lifestyle can be pretty jolly.

499
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,552
I guess I'll try my hardest getting used to
be a multi- millionaire.

500
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,675
If you ever need anybody to talk to, I just
want you to know that I am always here.

501
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,668
By "talking", you mean..
- You are barking up the wrong tree, cowboy.

502
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,715
Look, I'm a rich 18 year old virgin.
That makes me grade A prime USDA Beefcake.

503
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,835
We're talking zero chances of mad cow desease, baby.
- Well, this is not going to happen.

504
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:18,590
You are a great guy, and there's some great
girl out there for you.

505
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:25,034
Me.. I'm just a fantasy.
And you know all that for the right girl.

506
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,914
Can we snuggle?
- Sure.

507
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,398
Make it?
- What did I just tell you? Give me this remote.

508
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,472
I was wondering when you'd show up, big boy.
- Then tonight's your lucky night.

509
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,309
Adam? You surprised me.

510
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:02,559
I saw the way you eyed me at the club.
Maybe it's time I bump you.

511
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,715
That's really sweet, I'm overwhelmed.

512
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,230
Do you believe in love at first sight?

513
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,594
Or at the very least, you can stalk someone
enough until they panic and give it up.

514
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,679
Where's Chris?
- Who knows? Who cares?

515
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,635
Tonight's about us.
Una noche de I'amour.

516
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,436
I saw Titanic a bunch of times.
I cried.

517
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:34,393
Did you?

518
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:39,958
If I gave you a good night kiss..

519
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,592
..would you tell me what Chris' favourite gifts
might be?

520
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:52,309
Yes, I think that's an excellent trade.
- Come on then, before I change my mind.

521
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,552
I think that's mine. I'm so sorry.

522
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:25,306
How's it going?
- Like sucking on anaconda's dick.

523
00:54:25,518 --> 00:54:32,277
Where's your uncle?
- Thankfully, he's meeting with the board of directors on my behalf.

524
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:39,079
You let uncle Duncay go by himself?
- No, Mike Hunt volunteered to go with him.

525
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,628
Chris, It's not my place to say anything,
but your uncle and Hunt..

526
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,119
Brookes, say whatever you want to say.
- They're a couple of bitch- ass thieves.

527
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,914
Duncan wants Heaven for himself, he's
just waiting for you to fuck it up.

528
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,592
You're wrong, this is my uncle we're talking about. My
dad trusted him, and I don't see no reason why I shouldn't.

529
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:06,670
Yea, well, you're the boss.
- Yea I am! And don't you forget that!

530
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,797
Hey Chris. Are you.. indecent?

531
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,911
I bought you a little present.
- That's totally cool of you.

532
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,512
I didn't get you anything.
- It's ok, you will.

533
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,358
I hope you'll like it.

534
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,751
You don't see this every day.
- I do. Oh Chris!

535
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,112
What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready to show you how to use your dick.

536
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:51,952
Let's watch a movie.
- Get your man thing out and let's get down to business.

537
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,630
Wait! Stop it! Shouldn't I meet your parents
first?

538
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,469
Kinky.. me like it..
You're not legit to anything, are you?

539
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:07,597
Why did you ask that?
- I like to use a lot of props. Come to mama.

540
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,239
Chris... Chris? Chris!

541
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,516
Heather, what the hell did you do?

542
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,554
What do you think I did?
- You should be ashamed of yourself, he's just a boy.

543
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:32,393
A boy worth a billion dollars.
Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.

544
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,197
I cannot believe you had sex with him,
especially with his condition.

545
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,159
Condition? What condition?

546
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,672
Herpes, measles, crabs, hepatitis, ... pink eye.

547
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,474
Pink eye? Gross.

548
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,195
Actually, nothing happened.
He passed out on me, thank god.

549
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,710
If he asks for me, tell him I've..

550
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,947
You know what? Why don't you just go, okay?
We'll take care of it.

551
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:20,438
Are you sure? Thank you.
You guys are the best.

552
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,907
WELCOME HOME CHRIST

553
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:38,351
Beverly, remember. When Chris gets home, no
special treatment. He's still grounded.

554
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,791
Yes dear, we should consider cutting his allowance.
That'll teach him a lesson.

555
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,753
Spring Fling

556
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,510
Hello? Hello?

557
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:03,789
So lovely you could make it.

558
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,389
Hi! I didn't know you're gonna be here.

559
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,672
Hi. Bonjour. Guttentagen.

560
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,713
You're looking fine. You're
looking hot. Whazzup biatch?

561
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:24,349
The magazine looks great. I was thinking, maybe
I could help you out with it when we get married?

562
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,309
Hi Chris, I love you so much.

563
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:32,512
You're so cute, and sexy.

564
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,715
Chris, I'd love to go to Mexico with you.

565
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,597
Chris, I'm so glad I met you cousins.

566
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,313
Hi.
I was just..

567
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,231
You look great.

568
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,275
Love crousages. Did you know "crousage"
is french?

569
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,797
Ok, don't forget to have your pictures taken.
Go Porcupines!

570
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,199
Good chat.

571
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,396
Stand on the X, chin up, smile.

572
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,873
Next.

573
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:56,311
Stand on the X, chin up, smile.

574
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,710
Geeks!
- Yea, I want you baby, yea!

575
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,268
Ok, next song.

576
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,628
Everyone, check out the football field!
You're not gonna believe it!

577
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:24,516
Oh, awesome. Since I have your attention,
my name's Murphy.

578
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:26,835
Who cares?

579
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,396
I've pretty much gone to school with all of you
since elementary school.

580
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,831
And I thought tonight might be a good time
to get to know eachother.

581
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,192
Hello Xenia!

582
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:25,347
Anyone else see them walking slow?
- What's up, Chris? - Good to see you!

583
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,315
Thanks for the drive-by.

584
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:36,389
Hey Chris. You're looking good.
- Tell me something I don't know, Chiquita.

585
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,672
I've been thinking about you ever since you said my
name on TV. Do you really think of me as your girlfriend?

586
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,713
Did I stutter when I said it?

587
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,713
Welcome back, Hughes. I see we've moved
just beyond blowing off dead lines.

588
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,277
Hey Katie. It's all good to be back and keeping
it real with my people.

589
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,699
How does it feel to be a smud-peddler?
New prince of porn.

590
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:08,389
Artistic nudes. And you wanna know something?
It feels pretty damn good.

591
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:14,469
Maybe with your money, you can buy yourself
some common sense.

592
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:18,195
What's wrong with you, Katie?
- Gee, I don't know.. ASSHOLE!

593
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:25,429
You were supposed to be her date tonight.

594
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,791
Smooth move, Mr. Iglesias.

595
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:43,552
Chris wants to dance with women, who have
dumps like a truck.

596
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,358
I thought you'd never ask.
- Chris wants the other Angels to join us.

597
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,873
Good idea! Ladies, Chris and I would like you to join
us on the dancefloor to help celebrate our togetherness.

598
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,715
Oh, and feel free to bring your little
black buddy.

599
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,639
How about I feel free to hang my foot out of
your ass?

600
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,192
Go Chris!
Go Chris! Go Chris!

601
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,791
Thank you, Jesus.

602
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,438
Get up off the floor, son. Have you lost
your marbles in your mind?

603
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,918
Hi boys. I'll be out in a minute.
- No problem.

604
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,476
And you would be..?
- Naked, wet and soapy.

605
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,793
Danny, invert your eyes, son!
Get out! Danny, stop looking!

606
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,471
Sorry, Miss..?
- May. Now, if you don't mind..

607
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,829
Ofcourse.

608
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:39,637
By the way, there's towels there if you
should need them.

609
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:45,070
And a hairdryer there.
- Bye.

610
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:51,996
I got in last night. They needed a place to sleep, so
I said they could stay here. Shoot me for beeing kind.

611
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:58,878
Son, we're just glad you're home, safe and sound. Now maybe
we can put all this pornography business behind us and..

612
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:03,311
..start all over.
So, you're back to beeing grounded.

613
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:09,117
Anyone for panacakes? - Grounded!?
Sometimes, you both are so very.. Xenia.

614
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,027
Good morning, girls.

615
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:17,313
What can I make you? Would you like some
bacon and cheese omlettes?

616
01:06:17,518 --> 01:06:21,195
Why don't you ease up on your SLEE-P-TIME,
now that your flu is over?

617
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:26,474
Honey, stop screwing like a one legged eskimo,
you're not the one to criticise.

618
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:33,032
Angels, time to go. I'll drop you off at the airport on the way to school.
- Mr. Mack, the car's ready when you are.

619
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,757
Who the hell are you? What the hell are you all
doing in my house, and since when were you Mr. Mack?

620
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,478
This is Brookes, he works for me.
And I was born Mack.

621
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:57,400
This package came from the board of directors
and it is marked "urgent".

622
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,199
Yes, about the up-comming issue.

623
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,677
I'll make sure he gets it.
- I prefer to give it to him myself.

624
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,351
Young Chrissy will get his package.
I promise you.

625
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:28,429
I gotta go, I'll see you in class. Can your little
Britney get some cash?

626
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,076
Working on your big words, Brittany?

627
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,679
Thanks.

628
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,233
Hughes, you promised a school paper interview.
Is this afternoon ok?

629
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,556
Interview.. right.. this afternoon?
- No good. How about next tuesday?

630
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,994
Chris, I realize who you are and all, but I have
a paper to run here.. dead lines..

631
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:59,753
Katie, I'd like to help, really, but certainly you can appreciate
that while you have a subscriber base of 300 free readers, and I have..

632
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:06,512
You do the math. So, today's a no go.
But I can send you a couple of signed photos.

633
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:12,670
I'm wearing a turtle neck. - You're pathetic.
What was I thinking?

634
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,636
You tell Mr. Mack to forget about the interview.
And also, he's fired from the newspaper.

635
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,877
What did she say? Fired? That's funny. Katie,
I can buy your crappy paper.

636
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:28,198
I can buy this town, this school.
I can buy you.

637
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:35,635
You're wrong. I think I'm the only thing around
here that's probably not for sale.

638
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,755
And for the record, I haven't been Katie since
6th grade, when you kissed me on the sea.

639
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,952
It's Kate!

640
01:08:48,078 --> 01:08:50,752
That went well.

641
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,511
Chris.

642
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:01,712
Chris!

643
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,234
My parents will be out of town tomorrow night. Why
don't you come over and check out my new bikini?

644
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,590
I'll pencil you in.

645
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:20,715
If we take a fraction of the number and
divide it into quarters.. Mr. Hughes?

646
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,229
Beats me. Algebra has never really been
my thing.

647
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:27,828
I'm a lover, not a calculator.

648
01:09:28,037 --> 01:09:32,800
Mr. Hughes, this is important.
Perhaps you might wanna apply yourself here,

649
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,951
you'll find Algebra to be an important part
of any business.

650
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:42,917
I agree. That's why I pay the people
to know it. I'm a big picture guy.

651
01:09:43,118 --> 01:09:45,680
Leave the details to the math club losers.

652
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:51,233
Mr. Hughes, I understand that your life has
undergone some significant changes,

653
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:58,595
but without an education, son, the ability that you
really succeed in this world is greatly hampered.

654
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:05,988
Define success. I'm worth half a billion dollars. I'm chairman
of one of the largest media conglomerates on the planet.

655
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:12,594
All without passing your lousy algebra class.
I'm set for life, that's success.

656
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:19,234
Time's up.
Good lecture though.

657
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:24,036
By the way, I noticed your subscription
to Heaven was getting ready to laps.

658
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,390
Next year's on me.

659
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:35,719
Can I get some Washington's,
Franklin's and Nixon's?

660
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,515
Jane wants to do a feature on you.
- If it's a cover story, I'll pass.

661
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,500
Well, Miss Harding left a couple of messages.
She says it's urgent.

662
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:50,192
Miss Harding doesn't tell me what's urgent,
I tell her what's urgent.

663
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,551
Besides, It's all lame paper work bullshit anyway.
Uncle Duncay and Mike Hunt have to deal with it.

664
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,515
Your mother, not the dead one, but the one in
her sleepy time.. her birthday is today.

665
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,350
Organise a dinner, send flowers, get a present.
Make it personal.

666
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,953
Chris, this is the best chinese-american birthday
I've ever had.

667
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,078
Happy birthday to you!

668
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:51,237
Happy birthday to you!

669
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,953
Happy birthday, Beverly!

670
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,189
Happy birthday, mother.

671
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,917
My favourite: summer sausage.

672
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,318
Yummy, yummy!

673
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,149
Dildo.

674
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,960
You gave my mom a dildo?
- You said "make it personal".

675
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,787
Jesus, what is this?
- Dad, relax, it's on me.

676
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,269
Chris, that is absolutely unacceptable. Money
does not grow on trees. -Relax, Carlie.

677
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:48,390
Let the bill at him.

678
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,877
Your credit card is no good.
- That's impossible, I'm a billionaire.

679
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:59,791
You are broken. Who will pay for meal?
- This is a mistake. Run it again.

680
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,594
Here, I'll pay.

681
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,997
This one's on dad.
- Thanks dad.

682
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,430
Someone is gonna get fired for this.
- It's not gonna be me, I'm your dad.

683
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:17,430
Shit! I was gonna go see Brittany tonight.
- Watch your language! -Happy birthday mom.

684
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,796
Look at you, little man. You're looking good.

685
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,594
Show what a man you are.

686
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:48,274
Those are "Magnum's".
Don't loose yourself in there.

687
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:10,506
Hey sexy.

688
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:18,430
I was getting worried you weren't coming.

689
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,555
Chris Hughes Mack never misses a chance
to.. come.

690
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,310
Anytime, anyplace.
- Great.

691
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:33,037
Sucker?

692
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,229
I have the whole place set up.

693
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:45,037
This is gonna be a night that neither one
of us will ever forget.

694
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:51,395
And I'm just so glad it's with you.

695
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,832
So I think you know everyone.

696
01:15:19,037 --> 01:15:22,112
So I thought we'd take a few preliminary
photos here..

697
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,198
..and I guess you'll fly me out to Los Angeles
for my main photo shoot.

698
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:31,599
Do I need an agent?
- This is all about your modelling career?

699
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,837
No, silly. Modelling leads to acting, and acting
leads to be on a game show.

700
01:15:36,037 --> 01:15:41,555
I gotta go.
- What about my photo shoot?

701
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,509
Fix it! If you don't fix it, start looking for
another job!

702
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,832
Chris, I need to talk to you.
- Morons! I am dealing with complete morons.

703
01:15:56,037 --> 01:16:00,988
Apparently, next month's issue has been scrapped.
It's not gonna make it to the stands on time.

704
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,069
Someone forgot to get their shit together and
authorize all the photographic and editorial content.

705
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:11,229
I was thinking a lot about us.
- Those assholes are blaming me.

706
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:17,229
Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
- They froze my accounts.

707
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:22,752
I don't have any access to any of my money.
I could lose everything.

708
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,792
Would that be so bad? A few weeks ago, you
didn't have any of it.

709
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,912
Life is ok. You, me, Scooter, Murphy, even
Doyle. We had some good times.

710
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:38,828
I'm about to lose a major financial empire,
and you're here to remember me about the past?

711
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:45,229
That's the difference between you and me. I
see the big picture, you don't see any picture!

712
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:52,198
You really are an asshole.
- Chris, over here, I saved you a seat.

713
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:57,474
i'll be right there, ok?
- No, no! You better hurry up.

714
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,434
I don't want to take your hard earned
popularity.

715
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,518
You're the new Hudson.

716
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,872
I left messages for my uncle repeatedly, ok?
I don't give a shit, find him!

717
01:17:18,078 --> 01:17:21,117
It's my company, ok? It's mine!

718
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:26,029
So sorry, Mr. Hughes will have to call you
back.

719
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:31,595
He's in a big meeting discussing merging his
big ass with my foot.

720
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,676
No deal! No deal!

721
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,756
Guess this is one of those fancy new digital
phones, huh?

722
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:49,234
Fight! Fight!
- Get up, pussy, fight!

723
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,354
Get up! Come on, richy bitch, get up before I
piss all over your face.

724
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,350
You might wanna get up, Chris. Someone
pissing on your face is never pleasant.

725
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,880
Where's the helicopter now, huh?
- Don't be stupid, ok? Just lie there.

726
01:18:10,078 --> 01:18:14,470
You get up this second and kick Hudson's ass!
You're embarassing me. - Shut up, Brittany!

727
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:20,073
Yea, shut up Brittany!
- Just get up, dick-lick!

728
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:24,229
Aaa, mommy!

729
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:29,274
Mr. Mack, was this pussy trying to clown you?
- As a matter of fact, he was.

730
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:34,837
Stop, you're breaking my hand, man.
- You see, Mr. Mack is a good friend of mine.

731
01:18:35,037 --> 01:18:43,152
So stop bullying him. Now, If I hear that you even look at Mr. Mack
again, I'm gonna come into your house, late at night, while you're asleep,

732
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:49,515
rip off your little dick and fuck you with it!

733
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,631
Are we clear?

734
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,426
Goot talking to you, bitch-ass.

735
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,109
Chris!
- Not now, Brittany.

736
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,555
Ah, young Chris, just the lad we were
hoping to see.

737
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,957
Uncle Duncay, Mike Hunt..
What are you two doing here?

738
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,073
A hasty trip, an emergency board meeting.
We need your signature.

739
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:38,154
They have asked me to step in as chairman.
- But you can't, I'm already chairman.

740
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:42,831
Technically, Chris, you're not anymore.
- Technically my ass. This is my company.

741
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:47,988
No, this is my company now, as it was always
meant to be.

742
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:54,546
You are a teenager. How should I say this? Who's mommy
and daddy did not love him quite enough, got rid of him,

743
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:00,470
and out of foolish guilt, left you a company,
over which you are not equipped to preside.

744
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:06,993
Party's over, dude.
- Who gives a royal shit? I don't care, I run the damn company.

745
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:11,908
I'll spend my money.
- About the money..

746
01:20:12,118 --> 01:20:18,957
The stipulation in the will stipulates, that the money and
assets are yours, as long as you're running the company.

747
01:20:19,158 --> 01:20:25,952
Which, clearly as of now, you are not.
- I'm sorry, Cindefella, back to your pumpkin.

748
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:31,996
From the looks of it, going from the mansion to
here is like living in a penthouse without an elevator.

749
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:35,988
Oh well, It's too bad, so sad.

750
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:40,078
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Wait! That's it?

751
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,394
You want a hug?
No, wait, Elissa..

752
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:50,072
Elissa wanted me to say that she's very
disappointed in you.

753
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:53,511
Get the hell out of my house.

754
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,837
Brookes, to the plane.

755
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,712
Hey.
- Hey. I left you a little something in your room.

756
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,707
Your parents want you to have it someday.

757
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:20,957
Keep it real, little man.
- I'll remember you most of all, scarecrow.

758
01:21:21,158 --> 01:21:25,390
And I'll miss you too, Dorothy.

759
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:28,515
Miss Daisy is getting impatient.

760
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:42,229
Young Chris Hughes, formerly Chris Hughes Mack,
of Xenia, Ohio, has lost his lofty wings of flight.

761
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:49,073
The King of pornography has been given a vote
of "no confidence" by the board of directors,

762
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,395
thus ending this short lived rain.

763
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,912
Trade places with me. Please?

764
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,069
CHRIS HUGHES MACK
"Our Boy"

765
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,279
My son, the sky's the limit in what you'll
turn this legacy into.

766
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:35,234
Kate? Hello, Kate, are you here?

767
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,350
"Be careful what you wish for"
by Kate Reeves.

768
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:53,475
"Once upon a time, they used to say 'what a
nice boy', and it was true."

769
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,434
"He represents the best of Xenia, also true."

770
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:01,756
"If you ever had just one friend, it should be him.
True again."

771
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,828
"He's smart, sweet and funny, and will make
some girl very happy."

772
01:24:07,037 --> 01:24:10,077
"True words were never spoken."

773
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:14,033
"I know because I grew up in Xenia,
wishing that I would be that girl."

774
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,470
"But then, one day, something happened."

775
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:24,630
"On his journey to fame and fortune, Chris Hughes left his
road, littered with the broken hearts of those who loved him."

776
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:32,310
"And the process showed that in the best of
people can hide the worst of men."

777
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,515
It doesn't get any better if you read it.

778
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,154
Well written, nicely done.

779
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:49,278
Explain, why are you here?
- I was just in the neighbourhood.

780
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:57,358
So, when does the article run?
- It doesn't.

781
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,234
I re-read it.

782
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,752
Boy meets money, boy loses money,
or becomes a total mess,

783
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:14,350
hoping his old friends will remember him.
I think it's pretty played out.

784
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,712
Kate, look, I know I've been a jerk to you,
and I have been for a long time.

785
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:23,868
The thing is, I've waited my whole life for
something magical to happen..

786
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:26,832
..and when it did, I lost sight that my life was
already full of really special people.

787
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:32,478
A family who loves me, friends that are there
for me.

788
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,389
And you.
- Me?

789
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:43,988
For as long as I can remember, you've been
sniffing Brittany van Horn's grass.

790
01:25:44,198 --> 01:25:49,274
I like clarity to see that someone wonderful
was already in my life.

791
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,996
I'm sorry Kate. For everything, I'm sorry.

792
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:07,796
I don't know if your answer will be yes, but I
really need your help.

793
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,518
I need your double D's.

794
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:15,712
No, not those. Those are nice.

795
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,957
If this has anything to do with your trashy porno
magazine, the answer is... no.

796
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:29,916
Before you blow me off, think about it. Heaven
subscription base is huge.

797
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:35,148
You literate horny men. - Well, better to be
exposed to the brilliant radiance of Kate Reeves?

798
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:42,078
Award-winning Kate Reeves.
- Award winning, yes..

799
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:46,877
What's in it for me, Mack?

800
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:53,154
Platform for issues, your concernes, your
stand on feminism,

801
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:57,796
and it's Hughes, not Mack.

802
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:14,836
Does this mean you're not mad at me anymore,
or you are mad and that's the way of expressing..

803
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,033
You forgot "fumo".
- Bite me! I'm such a lame-ass.

804
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:54,676
No, it's really good. Not even a real stoner
could have pulled that off.

805
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:00,033
Thanks man. I'll take my marijuana wisdom
seriously. - What are you doing here?

806
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:05,511
I came by to..

807
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,591
I came by to apologize.

808
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,395
I was so concerned about finding an identity, and
wanting to be remembered for something in high school,

809
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:23,948
and I forgot the most important thing; It's not
what you're remembered for, but who remembers you.

810
01:28:25,078 --> 01:28:30,871
And I don't want any of you guys to forget me,
because I'll never forget you.

811
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,594
Come here, buddy.

812
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:47,435
But I do know both of you taught me about my
own responsibility. -You already are, son.

813
01:28:49,118 --> 01:28:52,635
I'm so proud.
- Get here to the future owner of the store.

814
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,354
We'll be there.

815
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:01,430
Angels..

816
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:06,551
We've got a mission.

817
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:19,113
OFF-SHORE BANKING BELIZE FEDERAL BANK
CONFIDENTIAL

818
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,470
LUQUIDATION PLANS

819
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,390
Welcome to Xenia.

820
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:46,795
Little man! Miss Harding sends her love.

821
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,993
Hi! So good to see you!

822
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,037
Good! Beautiful! Really beautiful!

823
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,912
Guys!

824
01:30:20,118 --> 01:30:21,997
Who's the pretty girl?

825
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:26,554
Good.

826
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:56,595
And thus, with our diversification into film on
TV, and ofcourse, the internet.

827
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,636
The new millenium for Heaven, under my command,
looks brighter than ever.

828
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,305
Any questions?
- I have one.

829
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,880
My question, uncle Duncay, is whether or not
you made it known to the board

830
01:31:14,078 --> 01:31:19,676
your plan to sell off the Heaven empire?
Bit by tiny bit, at insider prices.

831
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:24,872
That is absolutely not true.
Security?

832
01:31:25,078 --> 01:31:30,234
According to this documentation, the only liar
with the dull face seems to be you.

833
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:35,113
But I'm curious, uncle Duncay. How long have
you been embezzling from this corporation?

834
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:38,390
Embezzling! Embezzling? That is an outrage!

835
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:44,390
Boy, you are way out of line, and you do not have
the floor. These are all false accusations.

836
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,314
I'm yielding the floor to young Mr. Hughes.

837
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:56,671
Betsy, sweetheart, only a majority stock holder,
which I happen to be,

838
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,270
can even be on the floor in order to yield it,
during the board of directors' meeting.

839
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:06,076
You should have read the will a little more
closely, Duncay darling.

840
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:10,113
Your brother left me a shit load of stock.
- You still need to suck it.

841
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:17,555
I'll suck in it. - Don't tell me, please. My brother
made you a majority stockholder?

842
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,716
Duncay, I could retire of the stock he left me,

843
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,390
but if I did, there'd be no one to keep tabs on
Mike Hunt in your ass.

844
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,435
Ok, eyes front people. This little freak show is
a waste of your valuable time.

845
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:37,478
It is now my sad duty to inform you that your novice
publisher, Mr. Hughes, has ignored his responsibilities.

846
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:43,037
The result beeing, that for the first time in its
history, Heaven magazine will miss its publishing date.

847
01:32:43,238 --> 01:32:49,076
And lose subscribers, angry advertisers, and zero
profit. -That's what I wanna talk about.

848
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:55,469
According to our by-laws, anyone wishing to address
the board of directors, must file a petition.

849
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,515
Additionaly, 100 signatures is required, just to be..
- It looks to me to be 100 signatures.

850
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:04,710
Don't it, bitch?

851
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,229
Oh look at that! 100 signatures!

852
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:14,993
I still have the floor.
- Duncan, on behalf of the board of directors, please, sit down.

853
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:19,078
I haven't cast my vote yet.

854
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,274
Let the boy talk.

855
01:33:25,479 --> 01:33:28,756
What do you have to say for yourself?

856
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,313
Hello.

857
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,430
I baked some cookies.

858
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,555
As you all know, I inherited the
Heaven Corporation.

859
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,197
My father never missed the dead line,
and neither will I.

860
01:33:57,399 --> 01:33:59,630
Ladies.

861
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:11,395
What the hell is going on?

862
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:20,671
Enjoy reading this month's issue of
Heaven.

863
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,117
We had a lot of fun putting it together.

864
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:29,518
Guess the look is new and fresh, but so am I.

865
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:34,510
With this issue, as of today, we are right on time
for the market place,

866
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:37,837
and under budget, which spells "profit".

867
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:44,715
Order! Order!
- I had about enough out of Mike Hunt.

868
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,711
All in favor re-instating my man Chris as chairman
of Heaven, can I get a wog- wog?

869
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:59,274
As my first official act, I would like to appoint Miss Betsy
Harding and Mr. Andy Brookes to see over the editorial staff.

870
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:04,429
Until I graduate college,
Heaven is in their hands.

871
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:12,036
Let's get a freak on!

872
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:16,912
What?

873
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:14,313
Was it as good for you as it was for me?

874
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:30,000
