00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,280
Why did you set yourself
ablaze? - And pulse?

move everyone.

78
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,480
Can you tell us how
you feel after getting burnt?

79
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
How do you feel from within?
- Move.

80
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,400
Should I set you on fire? Then
you'll know. Now back off.

81
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,400
Fix the camera.
- Clear the path.

82
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Ma'am, please
get out of the way.

83
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
Security.
- Ma'am, please move aside.

84
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
Mr. Majumdar, why did you
try to commit suicide?

85
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
Ma'am!
Please move out of the way.

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Why did you try
to commit suicide?

87
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,760
It's not a suicide attempt.

88
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,080
It's my redemption.

89
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
My penance!

90
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
Kunal, take the patient inside.

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,400
What exactly happened to you
that you're seeking redemption?

92
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Penance!

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
Redemption!

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Never in our wildest dreams

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
had we thought, we'd have to
use these words in our lifetime.

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
Life was easy.

97
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
We were four friends.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
Since we were kids.

99
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
When we were school kids,
we'd tried to be like men.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,400
And during college, we didn't want
to shave. Who shaves every day?

101
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,560
All of us knew
what we wanted to do.

102
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
But how..

103
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
We were still trying
to figure that out.

104
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
But one point was clear.

105
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Life was on speed
and we loved it.

106
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
"Fugly!"

107
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
"Fugly!"

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,560
"Don't be selective."

164
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
"Take whatever you get."

165
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
"The ones with bad intentions"

166
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,960
"don't speak in your
so-called English."

167
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,760
"Be a gentleman
and entice the girl."

168
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,400
"Don't keep staring at girls."
Why don't you dance on my head?

169
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,960
"In this party
full of guys and girls.."

170
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,920
"In this party
full of guys and girls"

171
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
"there's a lot of thumping."

172
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,960
"There's a lot of thumping."

173
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,400
"In this party
full of guys and girls.."

174
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,400
"In this party
full of guys and girls"

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,600
"there's a lot of thumping."

176
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,360
"There's a lot of thumping."

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,000
Sorry, ma'am. - "In this party
full of guys and girls.."

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,280
People bump into each other
in a crowd.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,680
You scoundrel.

180
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
The party is over now.

181
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
Let's go.

182
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
Now, say something.

183
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,400
I'm a girl from Delhi.

184
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,560
I know the difference between
a bump and feeling someone up.

185
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Got it?

186
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,960
Mister, are you alright?

187
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,360
I mean, it doesn't
hurt that bad, does it?

188
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
Tell me. Should I?

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,520
This is Cheeni. Bhura Cheeni.

190
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
The kingpin of every
in-house party in Delhi.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,600
Our problem was
that we took him lightly.

192
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
Mr. Cheeni, run.
The cops have come.

193
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,000
Run. Mr. Cheeni, run.
The cops have come.

194
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Cheeni, I'm going to beat
the heck out of you.

195
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,640
Let's go, let's go.

196
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,760
Let go of me, Dev.
- Let's go.

197
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,560
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Gaurav, come on, move.

198
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Devi, are you crazy? Why did
you have to mess with Cheeni?

199
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,240
Koki was the best!

200
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,840
He asked, It doesn't
hurt that bad, does it?

201
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,560
Listen, guys, we all have to
leave for Leh tomorrow morning.

202
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
Leh!

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,960
It's done.

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Those foreigners had called.

205
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
They're coming
to inspect the camp

206
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,320
and if they like the camp,
then we're going to be set for life.

207
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,120
Man, that's awesome.

208
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
You're going to be
our very own tour guide.

209
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,720
Shut up, Gaurav.

210
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,640
Adventure camp organizer.
Okay?

211
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
Shut up!

212
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
Dev, stop the car
near the sidewalk.

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,240
First give me a sip.
- No. First stop the car.

214
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,400
At least give me one sip.

215
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,600
No, stop the car!
- Okay.

216
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,200
Hang on. - Did the thought
of going to Leh scare you?

217
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,680
Pansy!
- I'm not a pansy!

218
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
Shut up!

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,440
Adi, listen.
- Stop bothering him.

220
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,960
Shut up! Hulk, why do you
keep doing this to him?

221
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,560
Because of his weak bladder,
he can't hold it for too long.

222
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm going to go and help him out.
Hey, wait up for me.

223
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,600
Dev, I have a question.
- Yes?

224
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,960
What is the one thing that
gives us a sense of identity?

225
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,960
The flag! Okay?

226
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
What do you feel
when you look at the flag?

227
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,480
Holiday, dry day.

228
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,600
It's our national flag.
You're supposed to feel proud.

229
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
I feel betrayed.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,080
Ah, got it.

231
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,960
Are you guys crazy?

232
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,440
What if the cops show up?

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
So what?

234
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,680
He says that America is the reason
behind all the problems in the world.

235
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,640
I'm going to bring down
America for my brother.

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
But for now,
you climb back up here.

237
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,720
Come on, hurry up.

238
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,280
Adi, don't go back.
- The cops are here.

239
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,960
What the heck are you doing?
- Quiet, everyone.

240
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
Dev, tell them to stop.
- Devi, relax.

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,840
Okay, now come here.

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,520
What the heck is going on
in the middle of the road?

243
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Kids, what are you
doing out here at this time?

244
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Have you got cotton buds
in your ear?

245
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960
I asked what you are doing
here at this time of the night.

246
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,200
We were watching
the constellations.

247
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
Reproduce.

248
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,600
What!

249
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Answer the question I'm asking.

250
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,600
You know, the stars.

251
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
So, you like looking
at the stars.

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
Why don't you do this?

253
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,760
Go straight, take a right.
You'll find Nehru Planetarium.

254
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,480
You can look at the stars
for as long as you like.

255
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,680
Now, get out of here.

256
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Where did this monkey
come from?

257
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
He messed it all up.

258
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,320
Okay. Now,
get down from there.

259
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
No.

260
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
If you're not coming down,
then I'm coming up.

261
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,080
Why are you bothering us,
innocent kids? Let us go.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,120
Let you innocent kids go! Why?

263
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Are you the Prime Minister
that I have to listen to you?

264
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
Are you coming down or do you
want me to come up?

265
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,600
Alright, I'm coming down.

266
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm going to tell you who the
Prime Minister of this country is.

267
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,560
Bring my jacket.

268
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Sir.

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,480
So, what were you asking
about the Prime Minster?

270
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,840
Let's do this.

271
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Take everyone into custody.
- Sir!

272
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
Then I'm going to tell them..
- Sir.

273
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Quiet. What's wrong with you?

274
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
He's Mr. Ahlawat's son.

275
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,520
Hariram Singh Ahlawat?
- Yes.

276
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
The Cabinet Minister.
- Yes.

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
It's his son. It's his..
- Yes.

278
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,520
Why didn't you tell me before?

279
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,520
SHO Jagmohan.

280
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,600
Please convey
my greetings to sir.

281
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,520
Sir doesn't know me by name
but he remembers my face

282
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,760
as I have a memorable face.
Please go.

283
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
Thank you.

284
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Come on.

285
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Quickly, sit in the car.

286
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,160
Sir, why are you
taking the American flag?

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,440
What are you
going to do with it?

288
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Sir, I'm going to make
an underwear out of it.

289
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,960
An All American
Indian underwear.

290
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Let's go before he decides
to take my measurements!

291
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
Underwear.

292
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,280
I don't understand this
stupid idea.

293
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,080
But who cares?

294
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Write a report.

295
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,960
One American flag missing.

296
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Here you go!

297
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Let's go!
- What happened, son?

298
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,320
Long live!
- Long live!

299
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,720
"The nomads
are wandering around."

300
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,040
"They roam from lane to lane."

301
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,520
"Don't know which way to go"

302
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
"and what will happen next."

303
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,160
"Hey!"

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
"Hey!"

305
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,040
"The nomads
are wandering around."

306
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
"They roam from lane to lane."

307
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,840
"Don't know which way to go"

308
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,800
"and what will happen next."

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
"Hey!"

310
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,760
"Hey!"

311
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,440
"We ran away from our homes
without telling anyone."

312
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,680
"We are half-asleep,
half-awake."

313
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,960
"The outside world is cruel."

314
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
"Only God knows
what'll happen next."

315
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,880
"We ran away from our homes
without telling anyone."

316
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,240
"We are half-asleep,
half-awake."

317
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,640
"The outside world is cruel."

318
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
"Only God knows
what'll happen next."

319
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
"The truth is that we are
facing lots of difficulties"

320
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,960
"as the whole world is false,
everybody is fake."

321
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,200
"Don't know which way to go"

322
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,200
"and what will happen next."

323
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
"The nomads
are wandering around."

324
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,440
"They roam from lane to lane."

325
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,840
"Don't know which way to go"

326
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,920
"and what will happen next."

327
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,200
"All four of us are crazy
and carefree."

328
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,680
"We came leaving behind all
other friends and family members."

329
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,120
"We used to spend
extravagantly at home"

330
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,440
"but now,
our pockets are empty."

331
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,840
"All four of us are crazy
and unstressed."

332
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,320
"We came leaving behind all
other friends and family members."

333
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
"We used to spend
extravagantly at home"

334
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,960
"but now,
our pockets are empty."

335
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
"Betting made our lives
difficult."

336
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,840
"Now, only God can save us."

337
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,280
"Don't know which way to go"

338
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,840
"and what will happen next."

339
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,080
"The nomads
are wandering around."

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,440
"They roam from lane to lane."

341
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,800
"Don't know which way to go"

342
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,640
"and what will happen next."

343
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,040
"Hey!"

344
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
"Hey!"

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,840
"Hey!"

346
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,600
"Hey!"

347
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,880
"When our pockets
started getting empty"

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,480
"we started thinking of home."

349
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
"We uncorked the bottle"

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,040
"in order to forget all
the hardships of life."

351
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,400
"When our pockets
started getting empty"

352
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,920
"we started thinking of home."

353
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,240
"We uncorked the bottle"

354
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,560
"in order to forget all
the hardships of life."

355
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
"The tears stopped flowing."

356
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,520
"We don't want to live
as if we are dying every day."

357
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,800
"Don't know which way to go"

358
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,480
"and what will happen next."

359
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,640
"The nomads
are wandering around."

360
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,200
"They roam from lane to lane."

361
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,320
"Don't know which way to go"

362
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,400
"and what will happen next."

363
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,680
"Hi, it's all about life."

364
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,440
"It's all about friends
and friendship."

365
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
"It's all about my friend's car."

366
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
"Hey!"

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,640
"Hey! Friends forever"

368
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
"and ever."

369
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,880
Guys, they liked our camp.
Which means, we did it!

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Hey, you alcoholics, do you
mind if I ask you a question?

371
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,320
Great, another
questionnaire to answer.

372
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,720
Then, answer me.

373
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,440
What is the one thing that you
see every day but can't break?

374
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Gaurav's face!

375
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,000
That is something
you'll never be able to break.

376
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,200
Guys, seriously. Come on,
Gaurav, you answer.

377
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,480
Ask me.
- Let's play dumb charades.

378
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,040
I'll enact it out. You guess.

379
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,760
Football?

380
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,520
Straw? Soaking?
- Disgusting!

381
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,080
Coconut..

382
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,400
Who drinks from a coconut?

383
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Stars!

384
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Stars!

385
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,680
Exactly!

386
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,080
I was about to say it.
Adi distracted me.

387
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,280
Really? Then tell me.
What's written in the stars?

388
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I have no idea.
Why don't you tell me?

389
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Future!

390
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,240
It's an interesting thought.

391
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,680
But it's all nonsense!

392
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,360
Excuse me?

393
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
The stars have got nothing
to do with us.

394
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,240
How can they tell
you your future?

395
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,120
Excuse me, but there is something
called as using one's imagination.

396
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,560
Try to use it!

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,960
Devi, forget about him.

398
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,280
He's not going to understand.
Explain it to me.

399
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,600
He's an idiot.

400
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
Look. Look carefully.

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,960
Okay. - In these stars, you can see
your dreams come true.

402
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,520
See, you're going
to be the world champion.

403
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,080
Can you see that?

404
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,680
Presenting
the World Boxing Champion

405
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,320
in the under 75 kgs category.
Gaurav Singh Ahlawat from India!

406
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,040
Thank you, Devi. You've made me
a world champion. - Come on.

407
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,720
Dev, my pal. Why don't you look up?

408
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,200
You just might see
your own dreams as well.

409
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,120
Wow.

410
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
But, Gaurav..

411
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,920
I can't see anything

412
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
and probably never will.

413
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,520
That's because your dreams are not
up there but right in front of you.

414
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,960
Devi, what did you just say?

415
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,560
Because of the high altitude,
there are chances of low levels of oxygen.

416
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
Why don't you take a deep breath!

417
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,120
Let go of my hand.

418
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,080
I didn't mean, as in here.

419
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,240
Right here. Dev's camp.

420
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
This!

421
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,840
I thought you were trying to say something
else, my dear. - My dear.

422
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,360
Why don't you tell us
what your dream is.

423
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,360
My dream is really simple

424
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,520
and that's to see my mother happy.

425
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,000
She lost a lot very early
in her life.

426
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,000
And I can see those dreams
coming true very soon.

427
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,560
Alright, moron, it's your turn.

428
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
What's your dream?

429
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,960
What are you looking up for?

430
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,120
Your dream is not up there
but floating in the sewers.

431
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,200
Besides going to the toilet, you
don't think about anything else.

432
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,680
This time, you're not
going to get away.

433
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,080
This is the only chance
for you to run for your life.

434
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,440
You're not going to
get away with this.

435
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,040
Oh, God! Look at these guys,
they're at it again. - Run, Adi, run.

436
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,720
That hurt..

437
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Witch!

438
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Thank you.

439
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
What are you doing?

440
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,480
Uncle! There is a tall but
quiet girl waiting for you.

441
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,080
The silent kind!

442
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
And she hasn't moved
in the last two hours.

443
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Come on..

444
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Yes..

445
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,680
Listen, ma'am.

446
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm not really into
this traditional nonsense.

447
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,680
And to be honest,
I really can't be your typical

448
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
conservative hero
that you want me to be.

449
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,520
Thank God!
Well..

450
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,360
I almost died wearing this.

451
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,680
What a relief.

452
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Give me that.

453
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,680
The thing that you are sitting on.

454
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,080
On your left, pal.

455
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
Get it? A cigarette.

456
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
By the way, my name is Payal.

457
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm going to be a doctor.

458
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,760
And I'm definitely not your
typical conservative types either.

459
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
Light it.

460
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,560
Like you and my family.

461
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,400
It's quite upsetting.

462
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,840
This arranged marriage..

463
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
It's all a game for these old folks.

464
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,800
Just like match fixing but
for legitimate organized joy.

465
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm telling you.

466
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,400
You know their mentality, right?

467
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
Oh, God! It is really disgusting.

468
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,720
What are you looking at?

469
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
You don't like?

470
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Speak up.

471
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,840
Come closer.

472
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
Are you a virgin?

473
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,520
Listen. I was just kidding.

474
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
Come on, give me a high five.

475
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,160
Nunu, please get the stuff I asked for.
Okay?

476
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,840
Yes! Yes! I'll order it.
- Alright.

477
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
Okay, bye.
- Bye..

478
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,480
Devi.

479
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,480
Nunu, hello..
- Hello.

480
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
Your products
are of top quality.

481
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,240
They get sold the moment they arrive.

482
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,960
Nunu, help me out. I can't find
what I'm looking for. - Hold on!

483
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
I'm coming..

484
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,400
I'll attend to a customer

485
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,880
and join you soon.
What?

486
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
Where's the drinking chocolate?
- Drinking chocolate..

487
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,480
It keeps shifting from one
place to another. - Here!

488
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,000
Is this the one?
- Yes, indeed. How much?

489
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,720
I'll take the money from your wife, Kiran.
- Take it now.

490
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
I said I'll take the money from her.

491
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
Alright.
- Tell me.

492
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,440
These are 16 packets, 4000 from before,
which makes it 5000 in total.

493
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,200
Come on, don't worry about
the money when it comes to me.

494
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
Even though it's really cold outside

495
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
I'm feeling really hot right now. Why don't
you come in for something cold to drink?

496
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,920
Come home..
Come.

497
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,840
Even my wife is not
home right now.

498
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,320
So what?

499
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,640
I will get you something
refreshing to drink.

500
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,840
At the moment, just give me
the money that you owe me.

501
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,480
Come on, money..

502
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,120
The money's not going to run off.

503
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
One, two, three, four..

504
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
It fell down..

505
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,720
My back's paining.
Could you get that for me?

506
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
Hey, Nunu.

507
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,920
Sir!

508
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm glad that you showed up.

509
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
See, she was trying to trick me
into going inside with her

510
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,560
and was blackmailing me to either
pay up or she would falsely accuse me

511
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,320
of trying to molest her.

512
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,120
Ma'am, would anyone do
this to a respectful man?

513
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
It's easy to know
what her intentions are

514
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,960
looking at the way she's dressed.

515
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,720
Ma'am, I'm a family man.

516
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,800
Got it?

517
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Why the heck are you
trying to ruin my reputation?

518
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,720
I'm a respected man in this society.
Get it?

519
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,240
Mr. Nunu, why are you
arguing with a woman like her?

520
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
Just take her things and throw them out.

521
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,480
Just get rid of her.

522
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
Come on, ma'am, leave immediately.

523
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
Go, pick it up.

524
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,440
Get out and tell your mother to find
another vendor. Do you get it?

525
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,280
This is what they learn
from the media. Extortion!

526
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Else, one gets falsely framed.

527
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,320
Thank God that you all showed up.

528
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,520
I got saved.

529
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,600
Hail the Goddess.
Hail the Goddess! Please come in, sir.

530
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,160
Yes, ma'am!
What were you looking for?

531
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
It's easy to know what her intentions
are looking at the way she's dressed.

532
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,200
Mr. Nunu, why are you
arguing with a woman like her?

533
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,920
Why the heck are you
trying to ruin my reputation?

534
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,080
Get out and tell your mother
to find another vendor.

535
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
Did you get it?

536
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm coming.

537
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,320
Hang on, I'm coming.

538
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,480
What happened?
Was the shop closed?

539
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,280
Did you get into an argument?

540
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,840
Every time you go somewhere,
you get into an argument.

541
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,960
When was the last time, you didn't
get into an argument with someone?

542
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Devi, I'm talking to you.

543
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,560
Even when you go to collect
your father's pension, you get into

544
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,040
an argument with the clerk.

545
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
Even at the bank.

546
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,840
Your father gave his
life for the country

547
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,080
and you're bent on
ruining his legacy.

548
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Turning on the tap
won't drown out my voice.

549
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,200
Devi, don't worry about how
this house is functioning, okay!

550
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,880
You think that everyone else is
evil and you're the perfect one.

551
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,200
She's always mad at everybody.

552
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,120
Nunu is a decent man.
At least, he pays us on time.

553
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,040
If you did get into an argument
with him, just apologize.

554
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm not going to apologize.

555
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,080
Devi, I'm not going to listen
to anything that you've to say.

556
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,040
You're going to come with me
and you're going to apologize.

557
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,480
There is no way that I'm
going to apologize to him.

558
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,480
Do you have any idea how
I'm managing the household?

559
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,800
You're always angry with
something or the other. - Devi..

560
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
What's wrong, ma'am?

561
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,920
Temperature!

562
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,680
This much, this much.

563
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,440
This much..

564
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
I'll check it out.

565
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,160
You slapped him?

566
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,480
Did I do anything wrong
by slapping him?

567
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,200
Don't patronize me and stop preaching!

568
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
It's not a joke.

569
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,760
It's getting fugly
out there for women.

570
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,560
Men are just animals.

571
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,560
You ride a bus and they
try to misbehave with you.

572
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,280
Get on the metro and
they brush against you.

573
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,960
Is there any place that's safe?

574
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,960
They buy a ticket assuming that a
woman's dignity comes along with it!

575
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,720
Eve teasing has become
a hobby in this country.

576
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,880
And you're so proud of this country.

577
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,120
I love my country!

578
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,960
I hate this country.

579
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Devi..
- Let go.

580
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,160
My father gave his life
protecting this country from terrorists!

581
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,160
Politicians made big promises.

582
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,960
Everyone was ready to point the
finger at our neighboring country.

583
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,280
The news channels got what they wanted!

584
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,280
TRP! Headlines!

585
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,560
The darn media ran the story like..

586
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,200
Everyone benefited from my
father's death, except us.

587
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,960
What did we get?

588
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,840
A pat on the back.

589
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,960
Those delinquents..

590
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,560
Nunu, that son of a gun.

591
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,120
How dare he..

592
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,280
Forget it, pal.

593
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,840
Let's go and teach him a lesson.

594
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,920
Come!

595
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
Devi, listen.
Devi..

596
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Let's show him who his maker is.
Come on.

597
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,040
No..
- Come on, let's go. Let's go..

598
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
The shutter is up,
he must be inside.

599
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,280
Shut up, moron.

600
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Hail the Lord..

601
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,240
Did he leave?

602
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,320
Hail the Lord..

603
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Shut up.

604
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,200
You two, stay put.

605
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm definitely going to
teach this guy a lesson.

606
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Let's go.

607
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,880
Mr. Nunu..

608
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Gaurav, calm down.

609
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,960
Come on, get in.
Come.

610
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,400
Come on, get in.

611
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
What the heck are you doing here?

612
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,960
I want that imbecile Nunu to know
who is beating him up and why.

613
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,680
Now, get back in there.

614
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,640
Someone is coming.
Hide! - Move!

615
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Beat the daylights out of him!
- Wanted to touch me?

616
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,240
You wanted to serve me something
refreshing. Here you go!

617
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,080
Devi, did you call
Nunu and tell him that

618
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,840
Dev and I were coming over
to beat the heck out of him?

619
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,600
Are you insane?

620
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,200
Nunu!
- Then, who the heck is this?

621
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,600
Dev! It's me..

622
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,080
What the heck are you doing here?

623
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,720
I told you to sit in the car, right?

624
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,320
What the heck are
you guys doing here?

625
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,720
Get out of here!
Get going!

626
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,360
Dev, turn off the lights.
- Okay.

627
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Not bad, dude.

628
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,360
Hulk.
- Hey, what are you doing?

629
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,080
If I don't cut the tape,
how is he going to eat?

630
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Like this!

631
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,520
That's a good idea.

632
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,040
Hey, sexy.

633
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Have some chips.

634
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,560
Apologize to her and going forward,
you're going to go to her home

635
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
and collect the stuff. Come on!

636
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Hey!

637
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,120
Leave the girl behind.

638
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,440
Else, I'm gonna come to your
homes and beat the pulp out of you.

639
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,720
Got that?

640
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,640
You're a funny guy.
- Get off me!

641
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,960
Dev, 100 bucks say that
you can't break this guy!

642
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,320
Dev, let's leave.

643
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,240
I'm gonna break this imbecile.

644
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Move, Gaurav.
- Careful, pal.

645
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,720
You will beat the pulp out of us?
- No..

646
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
No, Dev!
- Move!

647
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,080
Why are you putting me
in the trunk of your car?

648
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,080
Dev, have you lost it?
Dev!

649
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
Dev!
- I feel suffocated in here.

650
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
Dev, at least listen to Devi.

651
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,880
This is going too far.

652
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,200
Hulk, you are laughing!
Have you lost it?

653
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
Make him understand!

654
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,520
"O' uncle, let me tell you
the feeling of my heart.."

655
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
"On your silly looking face,
I want to make a bee fly."

656
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,160
"Don't touch me, even by mistake."

657
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
"Run someplace, save your life."

658
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,240
"I'll cut up your Armani suit
and make it into my underwear."

659
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,240
"Hit him on the behind with a stick."

660
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,400
"Beware of fraud."

661
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,680
"I'll place a rocket behind you
and then ignite it."

662
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,080
"Hit him on the behind with a stick,
hit him hard with a stick."

663
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,920
"Hit him with love."

664
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,320
"Hit him on the behind with a stick,
hit him hard with a stick."

665
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,960
"Hit him with love, it's a lot of fun."

666
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,560
What the..

667
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
Gaurav, be careful, he's a cop.

668
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,200
Check it out.
- Okay.

669
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,440
What is this cop going to do?

670
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,080
I've dealt with his kind before.

671
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Sir..

672
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,160
We kids made a mistake,
I apologize.

673
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Goodbye.

674
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,840
Let go.

675
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
You don't know who my father is.

676
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,720
Your mother came over last night.

677
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,200
Even she doesn't know
who your father is.

678
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,840
Why don't you tell me?

679
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,040
Move away. Don't touch him.
- Gaurav!

680
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,120
Stay back!

681
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,120
Dev, stop it, let go of him.
What are you guys doing?

682
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,320
Devi, get back in the car.
- Have you guys gone crazy?

683
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,120
Adi, get in the driver's seat.
- Dev..

684
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,080
How dare you, moron!

685
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,760
Dev, let go of me.
Let go. I'm gonna..

686
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,440
Come on! Come back, let's go.

687
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Start the engine, Adi!
- Come on! - How dare he..

688
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,960
Make haste!

689
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,280
Quick, start the car.

690
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,720
Let's go.. Fast!

691
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
Your mother..

692
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,800
Get out of the car.

693
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Get out!

694
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,760
Come out.

695
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,800
Come on, get out.

696
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,680
Get out.

697
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,360
Move!

698
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,680
Lie down on the ground.

699
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,640
On the ground.
Do it.

700
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,200
Come here.

701
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,600
On the ground.

702
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,160
Ma'am! Come here
and lie down on the ground.

703
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
On the ground, I said!

704
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,760
Is anyone there!

705
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,080
Please, open..

706
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,920
Open the trunk.

707
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,040
Open up.

708
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,960
Open up, you..

709
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,320
Are you going to kill me?

710
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
I made a mistake.

711
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,760
I won't touch her again.

712
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,200
I swear on Mother India,
she's like a sister to me.

713
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,960
Not only will I not touch her,
I won't pass by her house either.

714
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,400
Sir, please forgive me.

715
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,080
Guys, if you wanna beat me up, do so.

716
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
But I beg of you to let me go.

717
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,080
Dude, you won the bet.

718
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,040
Remember to take the 100 from me.

719
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,120
You really taught this guy a lesson.

720
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,840
Please forgive me, sir.

721
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,280
Please, sir.

722
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:18,120
Mr. Policeman, let us go or
you'll have to pay for this.

723
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Let us go.

724
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Thank you, sir!

725
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,920
Thank you! Thank you!

726
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,640
Catch it!

727
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,080
Go tell whoever your father is

728
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,120
that Chautala is the
wrong cop to mess with.

729
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,560
Ma'am, I asked you to make them wait outside.
Please show them out.

730
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,440
Wait for two minutes,
they will leave.

731
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,320
If the administrators find out that
they are here, I will lose my job.

732
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,680
Okay, I'll talk to you.

733
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,000
Come with me.

734
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,440
Ma'am, I told you that the visiting
hours are from 4 to 6 in the evening..

735
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,400
How about you and I meet between 4 to 6?

736
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Do you get it?

737
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,640
Do me a favor. Don't allow
these reporters to come inside.

738
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
You got it, right?

739
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,800
Let's meet later.

740
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,960
I have breaking news.

741
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,760
Put this as headline!

742
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,400
A slap on the nation
and its police force.

743
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,200
This is Dev Mazumdar's story.

744
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,240
This wasn't the first time.

745
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,240
We'd used Gaurav's fathers' name to
get away from the cops in the past.

746
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,480
But, this was Chautala..

747
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,840
Alpha zero, zero. Do you copy?

748
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Senior inspector has discovered new
evidence regarding the perpetrators.

749
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,280
The dead body will soon be sent over
to Ganga Ram hospital for the post-mortem.

750
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,840
There are four suspects that
we are currently in pursuit of.

751
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,040
Any further information will be
relayed to you immediately. Over and out.

752
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,880
Hey, ma'am.
You don't have a lot of time.

753
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,280
If he wanted to arrest us, we
would have been in jail by now.

754
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,800
The man is trying to break us.

755
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,280
We should wait for the police.

756
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,360
Guess what, ma'am!

757
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,760
He is a cop.

758
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,400
He just killed someone right in
front of our eyes and you think..

759
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
Darn it.

760
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,440
Gaurav, can't you get
your father to save us.

761
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,240
This is a cold blooded murder.

762
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,400
If my father finds out about this

763
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
he would take you to
task in such a way

764
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,360
that you won't be able to
recuperate for days together.

765
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,600
Did you forget that we were
the ones who picked up Nunu?

766
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,200
Imple!

767
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,560
Yes, sir!

768
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,920
Quickly get rid of the evidence.

769
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,040
Bring that skinny one and a sack.

770
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,080
What are you staring at?

771
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,640
We don't want to disturb the
people out here relieving themselves.

772
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,400
We'll put him into
the sack and shoot him.

773
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,680
As you say, sir.

774
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,760
Get ready, pal, you are the
skinniest amongst the 4 of us.

775
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Dev

776
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,320
I don't want to die.

777
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,160
Devi, save me.

778
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,000
Devi, I don't want to die.

779
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,520
Dev, save me.

780
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,200
I don't want to die.

781
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,240
Do something, pal.

782
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,640
Chautala!

783
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,360
All the evidence was against us
and on top of that, Chautala..

784
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,760
Sir, this is a really good car.

785
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,960
Then, keep it.

786
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,000
File an FIR for a car that's missing.

787
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,640
Minister!

788
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,880
Shall we proceed?

789
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,480
A voting citizen has been murdered

790
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,160
which means that according to
section 302, you'll be hung till death

791
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,160
or receive 20 years in jail.

792
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,280
The bail amount is 2.5 lakh.

793
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,800
You'll get the money. He will
get the money, right, Gaurav?

794
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,960
Shut up!

795
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,240
Aren't you a dog on heat..

796
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,600
Down, boy.
There's more to add.

797
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,160
That shopkeeper probably
bribed cops like us

798
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,960
and that's the guy
who's been murdered.

799
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,560
Which means, it's a kick in
the teeth of our income.

800
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,600
Jot down Rs. 1 lakh.

801
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,720
Rash driving, which in section
279 only amounts to Rs. 500.

802
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,080
Only 500!

803
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,520
There are 26 charges for
kidnapping a citizen, 26!

804
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,040
So, that comes to around
Rs. 10,000.. Write that down.

805
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,960
Six lakh,
ten thousand and five hundred..

806
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,120
Aren't you the regular shylock!

807
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,280
Imple! - Yes. - Didn't you get
smacked around as well?

808
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,320
Assaulting a police man on duty,
and the charges are only Rs. 6000.

809
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,760
Write it down.

810
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,920
6,16,500..

811
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,840
Your father's gonna add the VAT..

812
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,160
Hey!

813
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,520
This isn't any VAT!

814
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,320
This is Chautala's tax.

815
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,200
Multiply the amount by ten.

816
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,080
Now, tell me the total.

817
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,960
61,65,000.

818
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,440
Imple!
- Sir!

819
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,160
Is it too much?

820
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
No, sir.

821
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Is it too much?

822
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,600
65 discount, okay.

823
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,160
Sixty one lakhs in cash,
this evening.

824
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,360
For your salvation.

825
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,680
Getting sixty one lakhs from a
minister's son wasn't really a big deal.

826
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,960
Once we had the money, we had to
figure out, how to deal with Chautala.

827
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,720
Who doesn't take a bribe these days?

828
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,360
And why the heck
are we into politics

829
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,440
if someone cannot be bought off!

830
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,960
You're absolutely right, dad.
- Hello, dad.

831
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,800
Come, my son.
My dear!

832
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,240
Are you returning after a workout?
- Yes.

833
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,280
Just give him something to eat

834
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,600
and keep him away from all of this.

835
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,480
That son of a gun!

836
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,760
Everything that we
have is on the line..

837
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,480
Brother, my friends and
I needed some money.

838
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,280
Forget about your friends.

839
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,600
What do you need the money for?

840
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,120
Rajbeer, call up
your uncle right away.

841
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,600
I'll call him.

842
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
There's nothing to worry about, right?

843
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,600
If the government told me that it
got the money, what's the problem..

844
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,200
Then they asked me to hand
in my resignation, so I did..

845
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,760
Rajbeer!
- Make him wait.

846
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,120
That scoundrel accepted
my resignation..

847
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Call him.

848
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,520
Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

849
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,200
How are you doing?

850
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,800
Things are getting
way out of hand, uncle.

851
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,880
That Ramlal played a dirty game.

852
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,080
The high command has
accepted father's resignation

853
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,720
and now he's out of the government.

854
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,760
I told you not to form a
coalition with that man

855
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,400
but you didn't listen to me.

856
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,880
Bear the brunt now.
Hold on for a second!

857
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,360
You oaf! Leave the phone behind.

858
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,240
Go and take the money from your
grandmother's room and listen..

859
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
Well..

860
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,000
You're seeing the situation
within the household, right.

861
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,360
What the heck are you showing me?

862
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,440
I want a picture of me
holding my hands..

863
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,520
Now, don't get yourself into trouble.

864
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,560
Things are already pretty intense.
Go now.

865
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,160
Hail the Lord!

866
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,600
Open up!

867
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,960
10..

868
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,960
20..

869
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,920
30..

870
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,680
40..

871
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,720
Did you find yourself
a fair lass? Tell me

872
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,320
Stealing money, I see..

873
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,160
You're going to run away to get married?

874
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,200
Without your permission,
can I even do that, grandma?

875
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,560
Sit..

876
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm investing the money
in some business venture.

877
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,640
Go ahead..

878
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,320
You're the only educated
one in this house..

879
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,960
The rest just constantly bark like dogs.

880
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,640
Grandma, you're only one
who understands me.

881
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,720
Now, everything is fine.
Get some sleep.

882
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,760
Gaurav, where are you?
Did you get the money?

883
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,840
Yes, Devi, I'm leaving..

884
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh my!
- We're from the Income tax department.

885
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,360
We've come to raid the premises,
here's the warrant.

886
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,920
What the heck is this?

887
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,680
The Income Tax Officers
have come to raid the house.

888
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,280
If I don't get out of here,
then we all will go to jail.

889
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
This is that moron Ramlal's doing.
I'm going to get him.

890
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,240
Come on, guys, quickly go inside
the house and start searching.

891
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,480
Move!
Look over there..

892
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,600
Hey, you!

893
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,440
Where are you from?

894
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,120
From Rohtak.

895
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Then touch thy elder's feet?

896
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,280
You can't be from Rohtak?
- Why?

897
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,200
Everyone in the world knows

898
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,280
that there is always money kept
underneath an old woman's bed.

899
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,440
See for yourself.

900
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,480
Come on, bend down.

901
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,960
Bend down some more.
Some more. Come on.

902
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,680
What's this lying here?

903
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,520
Did you find anything?

904
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,880
I lost that slipper one year back.

905
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,400
You found it.

906
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,360
One more thing.

907
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:58,440
Last year, the rats nibbled
two sacks full of money.

908
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,080
In this day and age, no one keeps
their money underneath a bed.

909
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,600
Everyone keeps their money
locked away in a safe.

910
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,800
I have to check the safe.

911
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,480
Sir!
Yes!

912
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,840
Sir, I've found some papers. Can't
seem to understand what's on them.

913
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm coming.
Just hold on for 2 minutes.

914
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,960
Sir!
I'm coming..

915
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,640
They're like flies.
They're everywhere..

916
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh my!

917
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Stop! What's in the basket?

918
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,640
Why don't you see for yourself?

919
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,680
Hey, this is cow dung,
get the heck out of here!

920
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,320
Had your fun!

921
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,360
Hey!
Stop him.

922
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,320
Stop him..

923
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,280
What did you find in that basket?

924
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,880
Sir, all I could find
was some cow dung.

925
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,960
Cow dung!

926
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,040
What is the money laced with?

927
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,840
Don't irritate me right now.
This is what I could manage.

928
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,040
How much is it?

929
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,920
Almost 20 lakhs..

930
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,760
This is my 25,000.

931
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,040
Here, four lakhs, count them.

932
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,920
Dev, you sold off the camp?

933
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Will make more!

934
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,480
My two lakhs.

935
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,960
You oaf, where did you
get two lakhs from?

936
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,200
I got the money from the engagement.
- You accepted the dowry?

937
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,920
I didn't want it and I was
going to give it back.

938
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,720
Hey! Now, let's not get
all moralistic right now.

939
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Gaurav!

940
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,280
Is it my fault?

941
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,080
How did I know that
there was going to be a raid?

942
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,600
At least, I tried.

943
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,280
I couldn't get everything.

944
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Sorry!

945
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,640
Dev!

946
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,840
Look at Koki and Cheeni.

947
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,440
They're loaded.

948
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,320
There is a lot of money in
in-house parties and it's tax free.

949
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,880
This is the only way out from
our problems. In-house party.

950
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,800
Let's do it.

951
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,440
Let's go.
- Okay.

952
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
Stop..

953
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,960
Come!

954
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,680
Sit down..
- What happened?

955
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,120
Sit! You're gonna organize
a farmhouse party.

956
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,960
You want to be like
Cheeni and Koki, is that it?

957
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,160
We're going to sell drugs!

958
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,920
If anyone from our household finds
out about this, we'll be ruined.

959
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,040
This is not an option, pal.

960
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,400
Hey, moron, if you've got a
better suggestion, then say it.

961
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,520
Being a party organizer
is not an option.

962
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,360
We've got 26 lakhs.

963
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,040
We'll buy some time from
Chautala for the remaining 35.

964
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,040
And then, he'll say, why are you
just giving me 26 lakhs..

965
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,400
Pay for my home loans as well.

966
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,720
So far, he hasn't said
anything of that sort.

967
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,720
We have an option. Let's use it.

968
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,880
Better than being a glorified dealer.

969
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,160
12, 13, 14

970
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,040
15, 16, 17..

971
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,960
Imple..
- 18..

972
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,480
Imple, these are
really artistic pictures.

973
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,440
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

974
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,920
Anyone who sees these

975
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,400
will suggest that you bribed a
cop to bury this murder case.

976
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,400
Imple..

977
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,960
Let's go.
Get going..

978
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
See you!

979
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,960
How much did you give me?

980
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,240
26!

981
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,320
And the rest?

982
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,760
35!

983
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,040
35?

984
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,880
Where is that? You don't have it?

985
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,960
You want more time?

986
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,640
Then, it's yours.

987
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,080
More time calls for an interest.

988
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Alright..

989
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,000
45!

990
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
Done?

991
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,160
45 lakhs.

992
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,000
Hey, you!

993
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,520
You have 3 days to give me my money.

994
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,120
Otherwise, judgment day..

995
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,600
Okay, Devi ma'am.

996
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,080
Sir, he is Alhawat's son.
He will take some action.

997
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,840
Understand one thing..

998
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,840
The Delhi government has
no jurisdiction on us.

999
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,040
Only the home minister has.

1000
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,280
Besides, Ahlawat has got
his own set of problems.

1001
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,280
If this case ever sees the light
of day, he will be ruined.

1002
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,080
Sir, you're really a funny guy.

1003
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,720
I'm a Jat..

1004
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,120
Can't help. It comes naturally.

1005
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,080
We had no choice but to go back to the
one person that we were trying to avoid.

1006
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,400
Do you have Koki's number?

1007
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,320
Listen, I never take a risk

1008
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,800
when it comes to giving out loans.

1009
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,120
And if I ever had to
give such a huge amount

1010
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,200
I might as well stick
my head down a sewer.

1011
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Scratch my back and
I'll scratch yours. Simple!

1012
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,200
But there is a risk in that as well.

1013
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,960
The thing is that I have a share
in every party that Cheeni throws.

1014
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,000
He gives me ten percent.
Ten percent!

1015
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,960
From you, I'll take..

1016
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,080
Twenty five percent!

1017
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,400
In a night, you can mint
around 40 to 45 lakhs.

1018
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,720
But.. But, strictly with me.

1019
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,080
So, the first order of business
to throw a party is a Tilla..

1020
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,920
I mean, a farmhouse.

1021
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,120
You know what, guys?
We all have our responsibilities

1022
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,960
to do something for the youth.

1023
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,640
What do you say, girls?

1024
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,680
This place, all of us,
are all yours, darling..

1025
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,920
Don't be shy.

1026
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,280
All this without any price attached.

1027
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,320
Thank you, sweetheart.

1028
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,040
So, tell me something.

1029
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,760
Who amongst the three of you
is going to stay back here?

1030
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,920
Oh! Good choice.

1031
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,920
There are massage parlors for
the exotic items that are special!

1032
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,760
Let's go or are you going to
keep staring at this girl..

1033
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,720
How many times have I told
you to ask for more money?

1034
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,280
Why do you keep agreeing to these terms?

1035
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,560
Hey, I've been waiting for my waxing.

1036
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,880
Hold your horses.
Just do his waxing.

1037
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,600
Oh, God!
Even the hotel rooms are so filthy.

1038
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,800
I can't do it in this amount.

1039
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,720
I get it, but just go this time.

1040
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,480
The client is filthy rich!

1041
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,280
Fine! Call me in an hour or so.

1042
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,360
Give me a hug at least before you go.

1043
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,200
Okay..
Bye, mom!

1044
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,520
Bye..
Mom!

1045
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,960
Do you guys have any problem?

1046
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,280
I had kept her in
my womb for 9 months.

1047
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,480
She's got to do what she's got to do.

1048
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,400
Dealers operate
from the G.B Road.

1049
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,600
We are event managers.

1050
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,800
You know, event managers.

1051
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,240
And the sole agency
for lads is with Chhaya.

1052
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,280
"What's this Fugly?"

1053
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,520
"What's this Fugly?"

1054
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,840
"What's this Fugly?"

1055
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,440
"This Fugly.."

1056
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,160
Hi!
- Hi.. I'm missing you a lot!

1057
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,240
Hi, my orange bar.

1058
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
My cutie pie!

1059
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,640
Want to have some action?

1060
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,200
Oh my goodness!

1061
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,960
What's gotten into you?

1062
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,840
What are you doing?

1063
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,480
You're aggressive!

1064
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,080
That's amazing!

1065
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
Passion, baby, I love it!

1066
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,800
Wanting you, baby.

1067
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,120
Tell me something.

1068
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,800
What are you wearing?

1069
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,040
What? What are you wearing?

1070
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,360
Shirt and pant!

1071
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
Should I take them off?

1072
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,000
8 packs, 6 above and 2 below the belt..

1073
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,160
I'm not like that!
I'm not!

1074
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,320
Oh, I got carried away.

1075
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,560
No!

1076
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,240
Stop giving excuses
about the phone, darling.

1077
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,400
Have the guts to say it.

1078
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,680
Come on, say it
that you want a man.

1079
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,640
Hello?

1080
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,960
Come on, tell me.
Say it that you want a man..

1081
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,840
I don't want to do anything..
Just give me my phone back!

1082
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
Hello? Who's behind you?

1083
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,160
Give me my phone. - If you don't want to
do anything, then did you

1084
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,840
come here to start
your own business? -What?

1085
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,800
No!
- You're going to be cheaper than me..

1086
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,160
Come on..
What are you doing?

1087
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,080
What the heck is going on?

1088
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Leave that dimwit!
- Help! - Dimwit!

1089
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,760
Who are you?
- Aditya!

1090
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
Aditya!

1091
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,440
Koki's baby?

1092
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,320
How many boys do you want?

1093
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,240
Boys? Give my phone back..
- Tell me.

1094
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,840
Tell me how many boys do you want?
- Give me my phone!

1095
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,240
Give his phone back.
- Disgusting!

1096
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,120
Payal!

1097
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,520
Yuck! Dimwit!

1098
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,800
Payal!

1099
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,960
Payal!

1100
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,840
Because of your 8 pack trash,
I've lost all my packs!

1101
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,960
What is all of this!

1102
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,920
Leave it! Why does Koki
send such kind of people?

1103
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,880
All I wanted was to love him.

1104
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,040
Ms. Chaaya!

1105
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,560
I was coming to meet you.
Wait..

1106
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,680
In order to invite people to
the party, you can send an email!

1107
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,520
Face book!

1108
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,680
Messages!

1109
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
Cell phones!

1110
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,200
And last but not the least, the
one and only, your friend, Koki.

1111
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,720
You're cordially invited for the Tanu
weds Manu wedding, please come in.

1112
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,720
Hey!

1113
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,040
Couldn't grow a moustache and you think you
can get into this party! Get of here!

1114
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,800
Man, what's up with this,
where's Koki, man? Who's calling me?

1115
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,400
Yes, I'm here, coming!

1116
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,080
What's the problem, pal?

1117
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,720
Well, didn't you know that
school kids are not allowed in here?

1118
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,200
Hey, I'm not in school.

1119
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,880
Oh yeah, relax! I'm here.
Alright, it's JAT time. Come on.

1120
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,680
Come on, get out of here.
- JAT.. Which means?

1121
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,000
Just Anderstand Time!

1122
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,440
Understand doesn't start
with an A but with a U.

1123
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,720
Just Anderstand Time U!

1124
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,960
Come on, man!

1125
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,960
Hey, Shabbir!
- Yes?

1126
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,680
Where's the cash?

1127
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,600
Alright, pour the original drinks

1128
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,160
and then after a while,
start diluting them.

1129
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,560
"It is as bad as it gets.
This ain't a movie."

1130
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,200
"You're about to get
a reality check." - Devi!

1131
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,560
"If you think you are gonna make it,
you've been smoking crack."

1132
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,800
"Understand what I am saying
before you pack your bags."

1133
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,480
"Come walk beside me and save
your whole beer. So.. FU.. GLY."

1134
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,640
"And the only thing that matters
to the kids over here.."

1135
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,920
"Drugs, girls and liquor..
You think this is sick."

1136
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,360
"Well, it's about to get sicker."

1137
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,720
26, 27, 28 lakhs!

1138
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,360
Just another hour or so
and we go scot-free.

1139
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,560
Here comes your JAT!

1140
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,200
Hey, everyone is stressed out
and you're dressed up like a fairy?

1141
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,680
Buddy, this is an in-house party
and not some birthday party.

1142
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,560
Everyone is getting to fulfill
their fantasies in this party.

1143
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,280
I want to do the same thing.

1144
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,320
And there's an audience just for me.

1145
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,400
You won't listen.

1146
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,640
So, do whatever you want to do.

1147
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,960
Say it with a smile.

1148
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,000
Go..

1149
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,080
Come on, Adi, let's rock this joint!

1150
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,600
"He's a local guy with exquisite skill."

1151
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,840
"He makes girls go crazy
without any extra efforts."

1152
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,040
"Everyone wants to know how he does it.
They ask him about his secret."

1153
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,960
"This is what he has to say."

1154
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,720
"O' baby, I don't have any money."

1155
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,920
"Baby, I don't have a house of my own."

1156
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,240
"Baby, I don't have a big car."

1157
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,600
"O' baby, I don't have a pillow."

1158
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,840
"Baby, I don't have a cot."

1159
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,280
"Baby, this is the only
mattress that I have.."

1160
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,360
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Hall of Fame."

1161
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,520
"I'm good in bed, baby. Baby,
I'm the King of the Game."

1162
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,840
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Will whisk the nights away."

1163
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,000
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Iron Man."

1164
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,320
"I'm good in bed, baby.."

1165
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,480
"How cruel this beloved is.."

1166
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,680
"But he gives fantastic amount of joy."

1167
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,480
"I've never seen such a
great player of the night."

1168
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,080
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Hall of Fame."

1169
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,360
"I'm good in bed, baby. Baby,
I'm the King of the Game."

1170
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
"I'm good in bed, baby.
I'll whisk your nights away."

1171
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,640
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Iron Man."

1172
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,120
"I'm good in bed, baby.."

1173
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,520
"He's my lover, I'm his lover."

1174
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,800
"To tell you the truth,
he is very skillful."

1175
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,040
"He is long lasting and quick."

1176
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,240
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Hall of Fame."

1177
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,440
"I'm good in bed, baby. Baby,
I'm the King of the Game."

1178
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,600
"I'm good in bed, baby.
I'll whisk your nights away."

1179
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,960
"I'm good in bed, baby.
Baby, I'm the Iron Man."

1180
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,160
"I'm good in bed, baby.."

1181
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,400
The guy is good in bed, come on,
take out your drums and play!

1182
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,640
"I'm good in bed.."

1183
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,760
"I'm good in bed.."

1184
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,880
"I'm good in bed.."

1185
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,400
"I'm good in bed.."

1186
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,440
"He's good in bed.."

1187
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,520
"He's good in bed.."

1188
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,240
"He's good in bed.."

1189
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,080
"He's good in bed.."

1190
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,120
"He's good in bed.."

1191
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,960
"Run for your lives,
the cops have arrived."

1192
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,040
"Run for your lives,
the cops have arrived."

1193
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,920
"He's good in bed.."

1194
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,240
"He's good in bed.."

1195
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:05,080
"I'm good in bed.."

1196
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,320
"My lover has arrived home, oh my dear!"

1197
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,040
I'm not an idiot.

1198
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,400
You know Koki, he's mine.
- I love you, sir.

1199
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,760
He doesn't do anything
without my permission.

1200
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,120
Devi baby, now you know the difference
between a bump and feeling someone up.

1201
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,080
Hey, you..
- Hey!

1202
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,680
Sir..
- Stay back!

1203
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,560
Mr. Shakti Singh!

1204
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,320
Try and control that boxer.

1205
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,520
Hasta la vista babies..

1206
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,200
Next time, think twice before
organizing a party without me!

1207
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,280
Koki, let's roll.
- Coming, sir.

1208
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,320
Sir, there is a lot of money
here at this party.

1209
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,200
This means, we are
going to earn a lot tonight.

1210
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,480
He is the minister's son, sir.

1211
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,640
Come, let's go.

1212
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,000
We were bearing the repercussions
while Chautala was basking in fortunes.

1213
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,680
Just this much, sir?

1214
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,120
These kids belong to me..

1215
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,440
They're stupid but mine.

1216
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,320
The next time, there will be a gift
that will be sent to you in advance.

1217
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,440
Now make a move.
Okay, goodbye. - Goodbye, sir.

1218
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,440
With what you guys have been able to do

1219
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,840
the narcotic department would
have made your lives miserable.

1220
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,320
It's good that you called me on time.

1221
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,200
You guys got lucky.

1222
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,080
Leave!

1223
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,720
Come, Koki, let's go.

1224
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,920
Coming, pal.

1225
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,240
Come fast!

1226
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,920
How much is the total charity
that has been collected?

1227
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,440
Around 30 lakhs..

1228
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,960
What does around mean?

1229
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,840
What if I told you that
you'll be behind bars

1230
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,280
for around 10 years,
will you understand that?

1231
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,280
30 lakhs.

1232
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,440
Out of the 30 lakhs, that scoundrel
Shakti Singh has taken 5 lakhs.

1233
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
Which makes it 25..
- Chautala, keep all of it.

1234
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,840
You'll receive the remainder
of the amount later.

1235
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,960
Why?

1236
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,920
Then, let's organize
these parties together.

1237
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,640
We'll be partners in this enterprise.

1238
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,120
I can't do it!

1239
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,400
This is not an option!

1240
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,560
Oh, Mr. Bachchan.

1241
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,080
We're not playing Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire here

1242
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,040
that you are asking for options.

1243
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,440
Phone a friend or a public opinion.

1244
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,240
You have only one option
here and that's joint share.

1245
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,320
This is the new CWBM.

1246
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,280
Chautala will be a millionaire!

1247
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,560
Forget about everything.

1248
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,520
The Aggarwal case, everything.

1249
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,400
You'll do well.

1250
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,080
You'll do great! Now leave.

1251
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,360
Come on, leave!

1252
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:02,400
Chautala with you, for you, always..

1253
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,040
I'm stressed out.

1254
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,960
That moron Shakti Singh

1255
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,880
siphoned off 5 lakhs.

1256
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,720
Chautala has turned us into a dealer!

1257
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,640
A registered dealer..

1258
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,320
What are you worried about, big man?

1259
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,480
What?

1260
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,400
Your father and brother
will get you out of this mess.

1261
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,480
The rest of us are
going to get ruined.

1262
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,000
Then, who the heck asked you to come?
- What are you doing?

1263
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,080
Let go!
- Adi!

1264
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,960
We can't fight amongst ourselves?
- Stop it, pal!

1265
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,960
Didn't you want to teach him a lesson?

1266
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,600
Now you want to flee at
the sight of trouble. - Guys, stop it!

1267
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,560
You got us all in trouble.
- Have you all lost your minds?

1268
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,640
Have you all lost your minds?

1269
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,800
We're friends and
you're hitting each other!

1270
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,280
Great miss motivational
speaker is at it again.

1271
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,800
This is all your fault.

1272
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,200
Shut up!
- Get out of the way, Dev!

1273
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,840
How many times did I tell you
not to pick a fight with Cheeni?

1274
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,000
Did you listen to me?

1275
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,960
Nunu had just touched you.
He didn't rape you!!

1276
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,040
Adi!

1277
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,920
Hit me!

1278
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,200
Hit me again!
- Dev!

1279
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,920
Hit me again! - Adi!
- Listen.. - To heck with it..

1280
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,800
Go and hit him again.

1281
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,680
Happy now?

1282
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,160
Devi! Devi!
Devi..

1283
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,000
Gaurav..

1284
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,360
Doctor, Dev is having a cardiac arrest.

1285
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,160
Dev!

1286
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,000
Dev!

1287
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,480
Everybody out..

1288
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,120
Doctor, call for crash cart.

1289
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,560
Please, call for crash cart.
Vaccine to me administered.

1290
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,960
2 milligrams.

1291
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,080
Please move out.

1292
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,960
Please move out.
- Check oxygen level.

1293
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,840
Nurse, check the body parameters.

1294
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,120
Check for code blue.

1295
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,800
Nurse, give me a syringe.

1296
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,640
Vaccine administered.

1297
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,760
One, two, three..

1298
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600
Connect the syringe to take blood.

1299
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,800
Check the syringe for blood.
- One, two, three..

1300
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,440
Will Delhi witness a change?

1301
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,600
Ankita Jain signing off from Fortis
hospital with cameraman Gaurav, Delhi.

1302
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,720
Doctors have been fighting against
all odds to revive Dev Majumdar.

1303
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,480
Who will win this fight?

1304
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,840
Will the truth prevail?

1305
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,000
There many questions
being asked?

1306
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,760
Does a man have to pay such a heavy price
in order to save a woman's self-esteem?

1307
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,200
Are commissions appointed just
to cover the evidence of a crime?

1308
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,400
Give me a towel. - How dense is this
mesh of ministers and police department?

1309
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,720
Is this case backed by
Minister Rajbeer Singh Alhawat?

1310
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,280
This is Sakshi Singh signing off
with cameraman Montu, City News.

1311
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,880
Hariram, you've chosen the
appropriate party symbol.

1312
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,800
A drum that beats from both the sides.

1313
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,160
Grandma, you've been smoking
that hookah for far too long.

1314
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,000
Everyone has lost it.

1315
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:38,120
Hello, Minister, I mean
Chief Minister.. How are you?

1316
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,240
What are you talking about?

1317
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,840
That kid has put up a stop sign
before I can become the Chief Minister!

1318
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,440
Which kid..

1319
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,000
What stop sign..

1320
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,440
Stop being a douchebag!
Switch on the TV and watch the news!

1321
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,160
Imple, turn on the TV.
- Yes, sir. Okay.

1322
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,680
Imple, make a drink for me.

1323
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,040
If he completes his story, our story
will come to an end. Do you get that?

1324
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,400
This kid can't do anything.

1325
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,720
The commission report
has already been submitted.

1326
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,680
It's just a matter of two days

1327
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,080
when you will be the new Chief Minister

1328
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,120
and your dear Chautala
will be the Commissioner.

1329
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,760
Don't be so over confident.

1330
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,640
It takes just 3 seconds to stop the oath
ceremony and getting kicked in the face.

1331
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,800
You oaf, better stop him

1332
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,680
before everyone starts protesting
at Jantar Mantar park wearing caps

1333
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,680
that says I am Dev..
You got that?

1334
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,800
Okay.

1335
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,440
Please don't drink today.

1336
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,240
Why?
- There is a function going on today.

1337
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,160
Is there a circus going on here?

1338
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,240
Stop all this nonsense!!
Get out, everyone.. Out!

1339
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,440
Sir, let me handle this.
- Listen.. - Handle it..

1340
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,000
What are you all doing! Get out!

1341
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,240
I said, out everyone! Turn off the television.
- Listen..

1342
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,600
Get going.. Come on!
Fast! Everyone out!

1343
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,240
Payal, I don't think all
this should be happening.

1344
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,040
Dev's gone through a major trauma.

1345
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,960
If something happens to him,
then it will be a big disaster.

1346
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,120
Sir, are you listening
to what he is saying?

1347
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,440
If he doesn't complete his story
today, it will be a bigger disaster.

1348
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,680
I will take the chance, sir.

1349
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,200
Then it will be on your head, ma'am.

1350
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,280
You please continue..

1351
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,040
So, was this the reason
of your redemption?

1352
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,440
No!

1353
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,280
After Nunu's death

1354
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,760
Devi asked us to wait for the cops.

1355
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,920
I wish we had listened to her.

1356
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,280
Chautala was getting restless.

1357
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,080
The pressure was mounting on us.

1358
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,200
But we didn't want to
enter into this world of filth.

1359
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,040
Chautala saw us as
a no limit credit card.

1360
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,680
A machine to mint money!

1361
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,440
And the four of us
decided that enough is enough

1362
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,280
and we're going to
stand up against him.

1363
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:23,200
Buy cameras, good cameras, top
cameras. Buy two, get one free..

1364
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,520
Camera!

1365
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,040
Unbeatable cameras!

1366
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,840
Start the action with just a click.

1367
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,840
Even James Cameron
bought a camera from me.

1368
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,440
Superb camera, each camera
is amazingly unique..

1369
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,920
Button camera, pen camera, cell camera,
you want to buy camera? What say?

1370
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,080
We need something which
can be mounted on the walls

1371
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,680
and the quality of the sound is good.

1372
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
That's it!

1373
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,880
My idea plus your money and the sound..

1374
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,680
It's just like surround sound..

1375
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,640
You can listen to it yourself and
let others enjoy as well..

1376
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,080
Especially for adult content!

1377
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,720
This is the best camera!

1378
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,160
The girls start looking
like supermodels.

1379
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,520
It'll be difficult for the ones who
are watching to control themselves.

1380
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,520
Is she is the heroine?
- Hey!

1381
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,160
I was just kidding.
Sorry, ma'am..

1382
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,800
I will show you guys a demo.
Do watch..

1383
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,840
Oh, my god! What a beautiful woman.

1384
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,360
Hey, mister! Step aside.

1385
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,960
Exactly! Ask him to step aside!

1386
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,880
Wherever Chautala stands in this room

1387
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,960
everything will be recorded clearly.

1388
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,320
Hey, you oaf!

1389
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,680
Don't make any stupid moves.

1390
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,280
And you! You also don't
provoke him unnecessarily.

1391
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,920
Who knows he might pull out his gun.

1392
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,600
After that the headlines
will read.. No guns

1393
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,200
no guts, only stupid Jats.

1394
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,560
Pal, I'm unable to reach Devi.

1395
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,280
Everyone should be here
when Chautala arrives.

1396
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,160
The man has a wicked mind.

1397
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,680
You don't have to worry about Devi.

1398
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,920
She is smart.
She will get here on her own.

1399
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,720
I'm just worried about this hulk,
you never know what he..

1400
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,560
Chautala!

1401
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,520
Hail the Lord..

1402
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,160
Come on, let's go.

1403
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,280
Oh!

1404
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,160
These guys are here.

1405
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,600
Everyone seems relaxed.

1406
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,000
Chautala, we're not going
to organize anymore parties.

1407
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,360
Do whatever it is that you want to!

1408
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,080
Hi, my sugar cane.

1409
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,280
I'll call you back.

1410
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,160
Liar, you always say that you will!

1411
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,480
But you never call back..
- I'll call you back.

1412
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,400
What will you do? Tell me first!

1413
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,800
Will you be my Superman?

1414
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,560
Tell me!

1415
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,440
What the..

1416
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,600
Hello, say I love you..

1417
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,960
I said, I'll call you back.

1418
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,160
So, you won't organize anymore parties?

1419
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,440
Chautala, we're not dealers!

1420
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,160
When we've said we're not going to do
the party then we're not going to do it.

1421
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,120
Listen up, you minister's son!

1422
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,640
Take it easy!

1423
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,440
This is a murder case.

1424
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,920
If the case reopens, your
father's seat will go for sure..

1425
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,200
Eyes to the ground!

1426
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,520
I said, to the ground!

1427
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,560
Hello..

1428
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,360
Say I love you!

1429
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,640
Say it.

1430
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,920
I love you! I love you! I love you!

1431
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,880
One more time?
- Keep saying that.

1432
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,720
Ma'am there is a very important
class going on right now.

1433
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,560
Call back after some time, okay?
- Who is this?

1434
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
Hello!

1435
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,120
Switch it off, I said, off!

1436
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,480
But we didn't kill Nunu..

1437
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,640
When did I say that you killed him?

1438
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,720
I killed Nunu.

1439
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,760
I, Rajvinder Singh Chautala!
I killed him.

1440
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,720
Do whatever you feel like!

1441
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,440
All the evidence is against you.

1442
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,080
Right, Imple?
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,680
Whose fingerprints are on the jack?

1444
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,760
The minister's son, sir.

1445
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,640
And you remember the bribe
Devi ma'am was offering us.

1446
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,200
The photograph of that?

1447
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,520
It has the four of them, sir.

1448
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,760
Time is running out.

1449
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,120
Get to work.

1450
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,000
Let's go, Imple!
Yes, sir.

1451
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,600
There they go..

1452
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,680
Yes.
- Let's roll..

1453
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
I killed Nunu.

1454
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,960
Yes!
- He said it!

1455
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,600
I, Rajvinder Singh Chautala!
I killed him. - Yes!

1456
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,440
Do whatever you feel like!
- He's in a fix now.

1457
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,960
All the evidence is against you.
- Yes!

1458
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,080
Look at these scoundrels!

1459
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,880
Right, Imple?
- Yes, sir!

1460
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,280
This is the monitor room.

1461
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,280
The minister's son, sir..

1462
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,000
And you remember the bribe
Devi madam was offering us.

1463
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,320
The photograph of that?

1464
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,360
It has the four of them, sir..

1465
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,120
Time is running out.

1466
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,400
Get to work.

1467
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,160
Let's go, Imple!
- Revolutionaries!

1468
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,360
What did you guys think?

1469
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,520
That Chautala is a fool?

1470
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:33,400
I had Imple to keep an eye on you.

1471
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,360
Round the clock, non-stop!

1472
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,640
Hey, mister! Step aside.

1473
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,880
So, you guys won't
organize parties anymore.

1474
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,440
Then don't do it!

1475
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,360
Imple!
- Yes, sir?

1476
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,800
For what kind of a job
are they made for.

1477
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,000
They're made for something big, sir.

1478
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,680
You must have heard about MLA Ramlal!

1479
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,080
He is planning an event
at Chandni Chowk.

1480
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,840
Shower him with love

1481
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,480
and then after that, send him
straight to the Almighty. R.I.P!

1482
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,760
We won't do it.

1483
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,840
Do whatever you want!

1484
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,240
We won't kill anyone.

1485
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,640
We'd rather go to jail.

1486
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,680
Where is Devi ma'am?

1487
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,520
Will you guys leave your
so called sister and leave?

1488
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,440
The subscriber must be not reachable?

1489
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,400
What?

1490
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,760
Now listen to me very carefully.

1491
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,560
Devi will remain in my custody.

1492
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,080
And if I find out that

1493
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,120
my invitation to the Ramlal's
death ceremony has been cancelled!

1494
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,240
Then remember, no matter how much
traffic is there in human trafficking

1495
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,720
it just takes two hours
for a girl to disappear.

1496
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,040
You'll get a gun at Kinara Bazaar.

1497
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,560
Let's go, Imple!

1498
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,600
Sir, you used the minister's son
to solve the minister's problem.

1499
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,200
Imple, if the son is getting a
chance to help his dad out..

1500
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,600
Then what's the problem.

1501
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,680
You are right, sir.

1502
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,280
This is God's grace

1503
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,920
that he has given Chautala an opportunity
to be the next police commissioner.

1504
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,040
God is great!

1505
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,920
God is great!

1506
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,080
Give it!

1507
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,200
Sir, the flies are here,
the nectar is yet to arrive.

1508
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,480
You moron!

1509
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,000
Stop being such a Sherlock

1510
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,920
and keep an eye on them.

1511
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,120
Otherwise, I'll gouge out your
eyes and shove it up your rear.

1512
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,760
Shove it up where?

1513
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,880
Up my rear!

1514
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,120
Hang up now.

1515
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,600
Sorry!

1516
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,400
Nice!

1517
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:12,480
In your country,
man do first or woman..

1518
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,640
I don't know.

1519
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,680
Then lie down.

1520
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,040
Lie flat..

1521
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,200
This Ramlal is a fool!

1522
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
My father lost his seat
because of him.

1523
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,520
I just hope your father is not
responsible for his assassination.

1524
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,400
Control your emotions.

1525
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,160
My dad is a politician. Killing is
not his business. - Stop it, you two!

1526
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,560
He has a gun in his hand.
What are you doing?

1527
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,880
Shut up!

1528
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,400
Pal, are you really
going to shoot this guy?

1529
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,440
No buddy!
We came here to have some free snacks.

1530
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,600
Then will give you an enema with
this gun and after that, we go home.

1531
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,800
I'll accept the enema
but we can't shoot anyone.

1532
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,000
We are not murderers.

1533
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,960
Do you have a better
option other than this?

1534
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,720
No, then shut up.

1535
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,840
Let's find Chautala.

1536
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,760
Wherever he is, Devi will be there.

1537
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,960
Get out of here. It doesn't really
matter to you what happens to Devi.

1538
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,520
Just get out here! Go!

1539
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,840
You oaf! What are you doing?

1540
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,440
The police is all around.

1541
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,720
And what kind of a friend are you?

1542
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,360
I just saved his life.
That's the kind of friend I am!

1543
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,440
Tomorrow, when we'll get caught

1544
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,640
for murder, he'll be saved
because he wasn't with us.

1545
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,280
He'll get married and
at least, won't die a virgin.

1546
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,160
Now don't look at me like that.
People might get the wrong idea.

1547
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,680
Devi will be at the same
place where Chautala is.

1548
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,800
I tried so many times to
explain this simple fact

1549
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,960
but they just didn't listen to me.

1550
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,520
I'm going to first find Chautala,
then I'm going to save Devi.

1551
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,080
I'm going to prove that..

1552
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,120
Stay put, I'll be back.
Hail the Lord!

1553
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,320
If I don't come back in 5 minutes,
please leave, okay?

1554
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,120
Listen!
- Hail the Lord!

1555
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,800
What?

1556
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,240
If no one tells you
where Chautala is, then?

1557
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,080
I will find out! I'll ask them.

1558
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,960
Okay..

1559
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,120
Adi!

1560
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,680
Hail the Lord!

1561
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,360
Now what?

1562
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,160
What if Chautala is there inside?

1563
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,080
Move aside.

1564
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,200
Tell me something.

1565
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,760
Have you come to
support me or psych me out?

1566
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,640
Support.. Of course!

1567
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,480
Then why are you scaring me?

1568
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,560
Okay, sorry..

1569
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,360
Could you do me a favor?
Come along with me.

1570
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,960
Me!

1571
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,560
Please come, please..

1572
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,680
Okay.

1573
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,600
Tell me something.
Are you nervous?

1574
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,560
Not at all.
Do I look nervous?

1575
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,960
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1576
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:25,240
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1577
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,440
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1578
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,760
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1579
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,200
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1580
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,600
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1581
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,200
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1582
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,360
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1583
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,640
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1584
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,480
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1585
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,360
How should our leader be?
- Just like Ramlal!

1586
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,720
Long live Mr. Ramlal!

1587
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,280
Long live Mr. Ramlal!

1588
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,800
Long live Mr. Ramlal!

1589
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,160
Long live Mr. Ramlal!

1590
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,920
Long live Mr. Ramlal!

1591
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,240
How dare you hit your wife..

1592
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:16,400
What do you think of yourself?
I'm going to teach you a lesson now.

1593
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,080
Please forgive me..

1594
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,240
If you want to touch, touch properly, man!

1595
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,920
Let me make a call.

1596
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,400
I'm really close to Chautala.
- Hey! - What the..

1597
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:25,640
Chautala?

1598
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,440
Listen to me, man!

1599
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,040
If I don't reach Chautala on time,
you're going to lose your job!

1600
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,440
Wait a second!

1601
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,080
My dimwit!

1602
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,640
Dimwit?

1603
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,880
At that time when I gave
you an offer, you refused

1604
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,840
but now who's this one
you're hitting on?

1605
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,000
Hey! What do you mean by that?
- Hey!

1606
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,960
Wait a minute!
Lies! All Lies!

1607
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,120
What did you say?

1608
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,720
That you are close to Chautala sir?
- Yes.

1609
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,200
You also turned out to be a dealer!
Come with me.

1610
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,000
I am not a dealer!

1611
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,880
I have a family business! A
business of sanitary since 1925!

1612
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,440
Tell him..
- Yeah.. It's our wedding!

1613
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,000
It's my wedding! We came to
give Chautala our wedding card..

1614
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,680
An invitation.

1615
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,680
It's your wedding?
- Yes.

1616
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,760
Move aside! Sit there!

1617
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,040
Why are you hugging him, sir?

1618
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,760
Come with me, I will give
you Mr. Chautala's address.

1619
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,360
He won't be there!

1620
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,320
He would probably be
at Solan farm right now.

1621
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,720
What do you mean?

1622
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,120
I was on my way there
until this pigeon got in way!

1623
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
Solan farm!

1624
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,440
Thank you, pal.

1625
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,480
Adi! Let's go.

1626
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,400
I was just saying thank you..
- Let's go! - Thank you!

1627
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,560
Please don't go.

1628
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,120
My countrymen, I promise you
that there will be a cut in

1629
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,680
the toll tax as soon as possible

1630
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,200
which will bring a relief to the
citizens while driving on the roads.

1631
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,800
You all will get employed.

1632
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,480
You haven't taken a shot, have you?
- Not yet.

1633
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,000
Well don't..
I found out where Chautala is!

1634
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,600
And wherever he is,
Devi is going to be there.

1635
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,240
Now, call me a oaf.

1636
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,880
You oaf,
you've totally proved me wrong.

1637
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,320
We know where Devi is.

1638
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,200
Let's go.
- I will request the government

1639
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,280
to make way for paved roads.

1640
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,120
No one shall remain unemployed.

1641
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,840
It's my promise to you.

1642
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,120
How dare you..
- Get inside!

1643
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,040
All hail!

1644
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,560
First time with a westerner..

1645
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,160
Complimentary, sir.
Did you have fun?

1646
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,440
Keep your compliments to yourself.

1647
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,560
There are 40 MLAs coming over and
they'll be staying till the elections.

1648
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,280
If there's even one complaint..

1649
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,800
Your wish is my command, sir.

1650
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,480
I'm going to shove those compliments
straight up your rear. Get it?

1651
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,440
Now get out of here!

1652
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,360
You're a funny guy, Mr. Chautala.

1653
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,080
Cheeni likes you.

1654
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,720
In fact, Cheeni loves you, Mr. Chautala.

1655
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,400
Next time, 3 is the number..
- That mother..

1656
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,520
Three westerners only for you,
Mr. Chautala. Complimentary!

1657
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,280
Is someone there? Open the door!

1658
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,480
Come on!

1659
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,360
What are you looking at?

1660
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,240
What are you looking at?

1661
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,560
What are you doing, mister?

1662
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,760
Thief! Thief! Thief!
Thief! He took my phone..

1663
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,600
I'm a cop..
Darn it!

1664
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:28,400
Due to popular demand, for
the very first time, friends..

1665
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:34,920
Presenting to you, the extremely
entertaining, Lovely from Jind..

1666
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,440
"O' Lovely! O' my sweetheart.."

1667
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,480
"Come outside."

1668
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,080
"Everyone chant.. Lovely, Lovely."

1669
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,400
"Don't look at me with
your eyes wide open."

1670
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,320
"Shake your body a little."

1671
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:04,280
"You'll remember this
baby from Jind for life."

1672
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,200
"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely, Lovely.."

1673
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,880
"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely, Lovely."

1674
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,600
"At night, I will steal your
heart and play with it like a ball."

1675
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,480
"I'll cause a huge wound on
your heart and steal all the votes."

1676
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,280
"I'll move my veil a little to
make the government fall."

1677
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,280
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger."

1678
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,160
"Lovely, Lovely.."

1679
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,920
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger,
I'm Lovely from Jind."

1680
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,800
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger,
I'm Lovely from Jind."

1681
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,520
"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely, Lovely.."

1682
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,240
"In every nook and corner, the
talks about my waist are popular."

1683
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,040
"From Jind to Delhi,
my flyers are printed."

1684
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,120
"One, two, three, four, I want
to love these many times.. - Four!"

1685
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,640
"In every nook and corner, the
talks about my waist are popular."

1686
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,680
"From Jind to Delhi,
my flyers are printed."

1687
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,400
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger."

1688
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,400
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger,
I'm Lovely from Jind."

1689
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:13,200
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger,
I'm Lovely from Jind."

1690
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,960
"Lovely is like a sharp dagger,

1691
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,840

1692
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,560
"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely, Lovely.."

1693
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,560
"Miss Lovely, you are very hot."

1694
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,480
"You cause a huge wound on my heart."

1695
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,040
"O' Lovely, I'll die for you."

1696
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,640
Uncle!

1697
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,040
Hello!
- Hello, hello..

1698
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,840
Looks like your brother and father
have involved you into the business.

1699
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,320
That's good news!!

1700
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,720
We need young blood in the party!

1701
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,800
Young blood!

1702
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,040
But, uncle, you're here in such a party?

1703
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,440
Such a party?

1704
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,560
Your uncle only comes to
these kinds of parties..

1705
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,960
Devi.. Devi!

1706
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,800
You know this girl?

1707
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,840
That's good!

1708
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,720
It will remain within the family.
Now leave..

1709
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,680
What are you doing, uncle?

1710
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,040
What will you have, my baby?
- Leave her.

1711
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,480
Don't touch her, uncle!
Uncle, I'll shoot!

1712
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,240
Get up! I said, get up!

1713
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,480
Doing the job of a dealer and
you're pointing a gun at me?

1714
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,320
This is the kind of party your
brother and father organized for me?

1715
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,600
Gaurav!
- Will you shoot your uncle?

1716
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,840
Gaurav!
- Shoot me! Shoot!

1717
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,360
Dev! Get Devi out of here..

1718
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,960
Don't touch the girl! She is mine!

1719
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,200
Bring the girl back!!

1720
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,160
No.. The gun will fire!
- Don't touch her.

1721
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,320
Don't make me do a sin.
- Leave her here.

1722
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,240
She is like my sister, uncle!
- Get her back here. - No!

1723
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,960
Where were you?

1724
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,480
Do you have any idea
what was about to happen..

1725
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,800
In that room..
- Devi!

1726
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,440
I am sorry!

1727
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,680
If something had happened to you..

1728
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,560
Then I would have never forgiven you!

1729
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,320
Let's go..

1730
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,680
Hey!

1731
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:57,920
Dev!

1732
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,400
I am fine! Just run.

1733
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,280
We're not murderers.

1734
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:26,520
But tell me something, Chautala,
for a second you got scared, right?

1735
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,000
Goodbye. Don't shoot me on my back.

1736
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,400
Why is this firing happening?

1737
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,640
I think we've won the elections.

1738
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,520
So, let's fire at the opposition.

1739
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,240
So what are we waiting for? Let's fire!

1740
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,520
Dev!

1741
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:02,840
Where did you get shot?

1742
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,800
Bullet passed touching my rear.

1743
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,840
Easy, I'm not dying..

1744
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,400
But tell me something.. How
did you get shot in the rear?

1745
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,920
What are you laughing at, man!
- Are you alright?

1746
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,200
Let's go.

1747
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:19,960
Where are you headed?

1748
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,120
Great.

1749
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,640
Yeah!

1750
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,440
It is great, Chautala!

1751
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,920
This party of yours!

1752
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,880
Everything is pointing towards you.

1753
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,760
And now, your lifeline is in our hands.

1754
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,360
I'll tell you something.

1755
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,160
For a second, I did get scared.

1756
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,200
The tables have turned again.

1757
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,000
One of Delhi's bravest
police officer SHO Chautala

1758
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,560
put his life on the line
to expose the in-house party.

1759
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,480
Sir, What will you like to say?

1760
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,880
I've been involved in this
case for a long time now.

1761
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:38,280
There was Aggarwal's murder case,
then drugs, alcohol, prostitution.

1762
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,320
No matter what happens,
I promise that

1763
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,040
I would remove the filth
that is within our society.

1764
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,800
Chautala with you

1765
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,560
for you, always!

1766
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:46,880
Hail India!

1767
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,120
There they are..

1768
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,920
Montu, follow them with the camera.

1769
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,320
Sir! They've been arrested,
we're bringing them in.

1770
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,080
Montu! Point the camera at them..

1771
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,160
Make haste! Fast! Take this shot..

1772
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,080
Bring the cloth! Come forward!

1773
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,240
Come here!

1774
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,240
Sir, one minute..
- Speak up

1775
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,320
Sir, I didn't get that shot of you
putting the cloth over his face.

1776
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,720
Can you please do it again?

1777
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,240
Have you come to my wedding?

1778
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,520
It will look good on TV!
You'll be a star as well, sir..

1779
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,480
Get the camera ready then!
Come here!

1780
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,960
Stand still and let them shoot!
- Hey you!

1781
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,960
You didn't feel horrible
before turning into a dealer?

1782
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,200
Answer me, you scoundrel!

1783
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,680
Shoot!

1784
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,640
Take your best shot!
Every one of you! - Hurry up!

1785
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:26,320
And if possible, try to print
the reality! Not the breaking news!

1786
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,160
Otherwise, there will be no
difference between you and them.

1787
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,800
Push him inside.
Come here!

1788
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,560
Everyone see her face!
Carefully see her face!

1789
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,720
Get the cloth!

1790
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,720
Move the van fast!
Media, back off now.

1791
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,240
A super cop or something..
How dare you arrest my son?

1792
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,200
Just calm down!

1793
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,840
I am not going to spare you!
- Sir.. - Calm down!

1794
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,040
Take a deep breath.

1795
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,360
What do you mean?
- Have a seat! Sit here!

1796
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,240
Excuse me?
- Are you possessed or something?

1797
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,480
Are you forgetting,
he's arrested your brother!

1798
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,800
I said, stay calm! Stay calm!

1799
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,080
Drink some water..

1800
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,280
Drink some water.

1801
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:22,680
I don't want it!

1802
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,040
Hariram sir!

1803
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,400
This party was organized by you.

1804
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,280
You sent all those ministers there.

1805
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,800
And who ruined it?

1806
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,720
One's son!

1807
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:04,600
Three ministers have been
shot including Chautala.

1808
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,240
Anyway, whatever happened has happened.

1809
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:13,000
Now with a single blow, we
will also get out rid of uncle.

1810
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,720
Father!

1811
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,800
Keep Gaurav away from us.

1812
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,760
Chautala is making sense.

1813
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,880
If this case builds up

1814
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,240
we will never be able
to come back to power!

1815
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,320
Understood?

1816
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,960
Since the beginning,
you've been telling me

1817
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,640
that politics is a business,
now let me handle the business.

1818
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,320
Take him inside. I will let you know.

1819
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,200
Chautala! Come on!

1820
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,240
Come on! Let's go!

1821
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,080
Whoever is guilty will be
punished by the court of law!

1822
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,960
Even if that person who
is behind this is my son!

1823
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:18,560
We should be proud of brave soldier
like Chautala who is serving our country.

1824
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,360
Hail India..

1825
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,960
We received bail, but everyone had
already accepted that we were criminals

1826
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,080
and we had decided to prove them wrong.

1827
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:47,000
"My life is like smoke now."

1828
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,160
"My dreams have faded."

1829
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:00,320
"Who knows where my
happiness has gotten lost."

1830
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,360
"I can't see the light anymore."

1831
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:11,400
"How wonderful those
days and nights were.."

1832
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:18,880
"When I used to talk with my dreams."

1833
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:23,560
"That laughter is lost.."

1834
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,600
The government has set up a
commission to seek the truth.

1835
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,680
Have faith in the government.

1836
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:38,560
We waited for five years,
thinking that justice will prevail.

1837
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:55,680
"There's no shore, there's no support."

1838
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:01,160
"I don't know where I am headed."

1839
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:07,080
"While walking on the road,
I don't know why.."

1840
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,440
This drum will keep
on beating for truth!

1841
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:13,000
This is very good news that
we are forming the government.

1842
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,440
But unless the commission
gives me a clean chit

1843
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,880
I am not going to take the oath!

1844
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,200
Because this drum is a symbol of truth!

1845
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:26,440
"My dreams have faded.."

1846
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,520
"Who knows where my
happiness has gotten lost."

1847
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,560
"I can't see the light anywhere."

1848
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:37,720
Have some tea!

1849
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,040
Hey!

1850
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,120
Aditya! Gaurav! Stop..

1851
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,800
Please, stop!

1852
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,720
"Due to the strong friendship.."

1853
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:13,880
"There was no worry and no fear.."
- Do you want to end up like your father?

1854
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,160
"Now time is upset with me.."

1855
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,560
"There's no reason to live.." - Why
can't you leave your work in office?

1856
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:27,680
"What sort of a storm
has come into my life?"

1857
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:33,280
"I secretly shed tears now."

1858
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,520
Guys, this is tomorrow's headlines..

1859
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,080
Rajbeer and Chautala are the system!

1860
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,240
They know how to mould
the rules in their favor.

1861
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,400
"Who knows where my
happiness has gotten lost.."

1862
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:49,560
I, Dev Majumdar

1863
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,240
In my complete senses

1864
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:55,400
am filing this declaration against
Minister Rajbeer and DCP Chautala.

1865
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,600
Why are you putting your life in danger?

1866
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,880
Let's shoot that imbecile!

1867
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,840
If shooting was the solution,
we could've shot him five years back.

1868
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,960
Then Chautala would have become a martyr

1869
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,640
and we would have been
labeled as criminals.

1870
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,200
We need to make everyone understand

1871
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,280
that this country doesn't
belong to the politicians

1872
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,240
but it is ours!

1873
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,320
People won't understand!

1874
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,440
Didn't you hear Sakshi?

1875
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,280
People need proof, which we don't have!

1876
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,480
No one trusts the words of a living man!

1877
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,840
But a dying man's voice
is heard by everyone.

1878
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,800
Then tell me one thing! Why you?

1879
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,680
Why not me, him or her?

1880
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,880
You will go!
- Yes I will!

1881
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,080
You will go.
If I fail, then you will go!

1882
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,680
If you fail, he will go!
And if he fails, then she will!

1883
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,960
And we will keep doing this

1884
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,440
until the likes of Chautala and Rajbeer
are not punished for their crimes!

1885
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:03,960
Come on, guys.

1886
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,560
Let's not stop living our dreams.

1887
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,280
Come on, man, let's stop being stupid!

1888
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,480
Don't do it, Dev..

1889
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,320
There is nothing in
this country for which

1890
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,560
you've to put your life in danger!

1891
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,080
Don't do this.

1892
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,640
Who is putting one's life in danger?

1893
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:43,240
There are a lot of things in this
country which are worth dying for!

1894
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:57,520
Hey, oaf!

1895
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,360
Give me a hug, at least!

1896
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,880
Come on!

1897
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,440
Take care of him..

1898
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:26,320
Hey.
We have grown up together.

1899
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,760
You better win that world title!

1900
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,440
Just nail it!

1901
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,520
I bet you 100 bucks

1902
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,520
that I'm going to bring Chautala down!

1903
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,360
Now, don't you dare say anything stupid.

1904
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,960
There is still nothing special about you
that I should've feelings for you.

1905
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,840
Don't do it, Dev, please.

1906
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:58,320
Group hug is the need
of the hour.

1907
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,520
Are you ready?

1908
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,480
Talk to Sakshi!

1909
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,960
And bringing Rajbeer
is your responsibility.

1910
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,360
An Enquiry commission
investigates for years

1911
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:42,080
but why is it that any politician
is never brought to justice?

1912
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,960
Millions of rupees are
wasted on commissions.

1913
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,400
If the report of an enquiry
commission is not satisfactory

1914
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,320
another commission is appointed.

1915
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,400
Why is the enquiry not made public?

1916
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,440
Why can't we get to know
the answers that the leaders

1917
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,520
present for the questions that we ask?

1918
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,720
After all, isn't this our money?

1919
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:12,880
Do you think that all this will change
anything? Will you get justice?

1920
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:17,360
Hey!

1921
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:21,280
What is this drama that is
going on here? Everyone out! Out!

1922
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,160
Chautala is here,
where is Rajbeer?

1923
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,880
The government is not being dissolved

1924
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,280
and no counting is going down either!
Don't you understand?

1925
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,560
Now, keep the phone down!

1926
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,440
To heck with them!

1927
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:31,720
Brother!

1928
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,600
You say something else but
you do something else entirely.

1929
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,920
What does that mean?

1930
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,240
In the hunger for power, you've
forgotten the first rule of politics.

1931
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,360
This country worships the martyrs.

1932
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,480
Chautala will go to jail
and that is a fact.

1933
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,840
You should save yourself.

1934
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,560
Didn't you always say
that politics is a business?

1935
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,320
Now save yourself!

1936
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,720
He is right!

1937
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:13,480
Do as he says.

1938
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:14,800
Make your government and take him along.

1939
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,640
Time is of the essence.

1940
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:20,840
The little one created this situation!

1941
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,040
Come on!

1942
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:39,040
Come on, go out!
- Silence! - Leave!

1943
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,440
You have to answer to the accusations
made by Dev Majumdaar.

1944
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,960
We will answer to the government itself.

1945
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,200
Please leave..
- Turn the camera off. - Listen..

1946
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,440
Please leave..
- Move! Step back!

1947
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:46,560
Shut up!
- Move out..

1948
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:47,640
Take this discussion outside..

1949
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,520
Let the government..
Get out of here, please.

1950
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:53,160
Hey!
Shut down your darn camera.

1951
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,960
Imple, show them out.

1952
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,280
Get out..

1953
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,480
Nice!

1954
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:23,040
Nice trick!

1955
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,320
Didn't I say that

1956
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:39,120
Chautala with you, for you, always.

1957
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:41,880
Chautala!

1958
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,320
Chautala!

1959
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,520
How dare you come back inside?

1960
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,080
Sir, you killed him?

1961
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,240
Dev Majumdar has been murdered.

1962
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,920
So that he can't give
his statement in the court.

1963
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,760
Get away from me!

1964
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,640
Chautala!

1965
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:22,080
Dev Majumdar has been murdered.

1966
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,520
They killed Dev Majumdar!

1967
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,960
He's been murdered.

1968
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,880
Gaurav, wait! Gaurav!

1969
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,960
Easy boy! Hold yourself!

1970
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:36,800
Come.

1971
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,760
Gaurav!
No one will take any action.

1972
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:46,640
Stay calm, please stay calm.
The justice shall prevail!

1973
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:50,280
I won't let Dev Majumdar's
sacrifice go in vain!

1974
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:54,040
Whoever is behind his murder,
I am not going to spare him!

1975
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:55,640
This is my promise to you.

1976
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,320
Whoever he may be..

1977
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,400
Sir!

1978
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:01,400
Even if he is a police officer..

1979
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,440
Who was that?

1980
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,920
Who the heck hit me!
- I did it!

1981
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,280
I've already buried one of them!

1982
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,800
I'm going to do the same thing with you!

1983
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,880
He killed Dev Majumdar!
Don't spare him!

1984
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,120
Who hit me.. Come on..
- I did it!

1985
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,920
I won't spare you!
I won't..

1986
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,040
Let's go, sir!

1987
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,760
Come on, take out the car!

1988
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,240
Dev was right.

1989
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:08,600
There is something in this country
that is worth sacrificing for.

1990
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,560
Victory of Dev Majumdar and the truth!

1991
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:17,600
According to the latest news,
DCP Chautala has been arrested

1992
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:19,720
and the oath taking ceremony of
Minister Rajbeer Singh Ahlawat

1993
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,680
has been cancelled indefinitely.

1994
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:24,920
For the first time

1995
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:28,320
in sixty five years, our country
is going to witness an open enquiry.

1996
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,600
This enquiry will be telecasted
live on the national television.

1997
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:35,480
I am Sakshi Singh, signing off
with cameraman Montu, for City News.

1998
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:55,720
How are you doing, Thapa?

1999
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:00,480
Easy!

2000
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,120
It's good that you pulled me out Mr. CM!

2001
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,200
Otherwise, if I had to bear the
pain in my rear one more time

2002
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:27,760
you would have to share
the same pain with me.

2003
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:50,440
Darn you!

2004
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:05,680
Trust me, it was nothing personal.

2005
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:09,880
Imple Singh, with you, for you, always.

2006
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,960
Goodbye, sir!

2007
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,480
Hi, guys..
- Hi!

2008
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:53,000
Devi! See, I won!
Now I am a world champion!

2009
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,360
Yeah. I read about it.

2010
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,360
I also won. See.
- There are two. - Twins.

2011
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,040
Oh, my god!

2012
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:02,040
Congratulations, guys!
God bless you!

2013
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,360
Hello!
- Hello, ma'am!

2014
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,440
Abbas, please check the
rappelling equipment. - Yes, ma'am.

2015
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:19,280
The Japanese team is coming and
if possible please smile a bit more.

2016
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:20,440
Morning!
- Morning!

2017
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,160
Devi, come back please.

2018
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,080
Don't you feel alone there without us?

2019
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,760
Are you kidding me?

2020
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:38,240
You oaf, at the height of 18,000 feet,
I'm on top of the world.

2021
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,280
I have my memories with me.

2022
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,640
At night, I have my stars
to give me company.

2023
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,840
Devi, Dev always used to
say that how can the stars

2024
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,640
which can fall anytime,
tell our future?

2025
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,080
Dev was wrong.

2026
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,960
In these stars, I can still
see my dreams coming true.

2027
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:15,120
Idiot! There is still something
known as imagination!

2028
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Devi!

2029
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:51,200
Come on, let's go.

2030
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,400
Come..

2031
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,480
Hey! What happened to you?

2032
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,440
You okay?
