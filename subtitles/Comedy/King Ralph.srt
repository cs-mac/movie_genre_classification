1
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,770
The rain has stopped, Your Majesty.
We can continue with the portrait.

2
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,010
So I should hope, Albert. First time we've
had the whole family here for six years.

3
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,044
Let's try and get one in.
We'll need both banks to fill light.

4
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,208
I've already strung the cables, sir.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,240
- All set up, sir.
- Thank you. We're ready now, everybody.

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,922
Please remember to look straight into the
lens and keep your eyes wide and bright.

7
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,203
Now, after three. One, two...

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,324
...three.

9
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,445
I know, at a time like this,
it's difficult to apply oneself to any task.

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,770
But a surviving heir to the throne
must be found.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,920
The nation, the Commonwealth, and I dare
say the known world await your findings.

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,008
Good luck, gentlemen.

13
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,804
Since when do we give a toss
about this kind of bullshit?

14
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,482
Shut up, Dysentery. Where's your
sense of national flippin' pride?

- Excuse me, Sir Cedric.
- Yes?

18
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,249
- I do believe we've found an heir.
- That's wonderful, Duncan. Who is it?

19
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,284
His name is Jones. Ralph Jones.

20
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,006
Ralph Jones.
Is he everything we might have hoped?

21
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,726
Well, he has his strengths
and his weaknesses.

22
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,730
You see... he's an American.

23
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,811
Quickly. The strengths?

I've had it with you, Jones.
We're not payin' you to watch television.

(Ralph) Shit. Can you believe that?

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,490
It's beyond all comprehension,
Your Majesty.

56
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,682
But I have news
that might bring you cheer.

57
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,768
I doubt it.

58
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,762
It is my glorious duty to inform you...

59
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,807
...that you are the new... King of England.

60
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,651
<i>(Mitzi screams)</i>

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,651
You see, the Late king's uncle,
the Duke of Warren...

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,128
...had a small dalliance
with your grandmother, Constance...

63
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,811
...who was a waitress at the hotel
where he was staying.

64
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,447
One Gastro Death-Dealer
with onions, jaLapefios and Tabasco.

65
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,641
Thank you.

66
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,003
At any rate,
Constance had a son, your father.

67
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,851
Now, since he and your grandmother
are both dead...

68
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,248
...you are the only surviving royal heir
in your line.

69
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,647
Look, even if I believed ya, which I don't...

70
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,048
...I haven't got time to be
the King of England. I gotta get a job.

71
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,288
This is more than a job.

72
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,290
I may put a band together,
get back to playing rock and roll.

73
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,961
But you can't refuse the throne.
It's a sacred trust.

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,165
- Yeah? What does a sacred trust pay?
- You don't get a salary, as such.

75
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,124
- As I figured. I pay you, right?
- You don't need money.

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,087
Everything's taken care of. The king has
his own castle, five castles, in fact...

77
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,841
...a fleet of cars, a yacht,
a full staff of servants.

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,804
Good God, the future
of a nation's at stake.

79
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,527
You're good, Dunc. Real good.

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,723
- Do you remember your grandmother?
- Connie? Yeah.

81
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,126
Remember a ring she wore?

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,484
Sure, she'd brag about it all the time.
She said she got it from some prince...

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,524
There's only one other like it -
the Duke of Warren's.

84
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,608
Was this the ring?

85
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,084
Holy shit.

86
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,930
Yes!

87
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,808
Yes!

88
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,287
How long do you need rne? I've never
held a job for more than six months.

89
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,041
(Phipps) Well, you see,
a king is a king for life.

90
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,447

Very good.

00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,049
- I'm Cedric Willingham.
- Glad to meet ya, Ced.

107
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,325
Have you ever been to England before?

108
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,204
No.

109
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,164
But I have almost all
the Rolling Stones albums.

110
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,250
Well, then, you're practically a native.

111
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,009
Dunc says you've been here 25 years.
You must be a hell of a typist by now.

112
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,088
I'm not that type of secretary.

113
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,285
My duty is to instruct you in the arts
of sovereignty, to make you a king.

114
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,325
Uh, look, my 'duties' are
mostly for show, right?

115
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,966
I hope you're not countin' on me
to solve problems...

116
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,367
...because I don't have a lot of experience.

117
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,245
English Law prohibits monarchs
from solving problems.

118
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,807
Unfortunately, it doesn't
prohibit you from creating them.

119
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,366
Good! That's a load off my mind.

120
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,168
So... where do we start?

121
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,128
Everywhere.

122
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,928
You might be thinking
what name you'd like to use as king.

123
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,123
'Edward' and 'George'
have been popular this century.

124
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,768
- What's wrong with 'Ralph'?
- It Lacks a certain... majesty.

125
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,290
I can't really think of any notable Ralphs.

126
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,687
Well, sure...

127
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,246
Ralph Macchio. Ralph Lauren.

128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,488
Ralph Kramden.

129
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,530
Oh, this is extremely nice.
Better than I'm used to.

130
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,521
This is the picture gallery. Many of the
people in the paintings are your relatives.

131
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,689
That's the Duke of Warren,
your unfortunate grandfather.

132
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,326
You have his chin.

133
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,491
That's George III. You may remember him.

134
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,764
He was king during that little temper
tantrum you call the Revolutionary War.

135
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,090
Sounds like sour grapes to me, Ced.
After all, we did kick your ass.

136
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,487
The loss is entirely yours, or rather theirs.

137
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,728
Try to remember
you're an Englishman now.

138
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,810
OK, but I still think they kicked <i>our</i> ass.

139
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,688
Just a few quick questions to probe
your knowledge of English history.

140
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,687
Fine.

141
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,361
When she failed to give him a son,
Henry VIII had Anne Boleyn...?

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,366
- Look into adoption?
- Beheaded.

143
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,801
Jeez, this is a tough country.

144
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,161
Would this be to your liking,
Your Majesty?

145
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,328
You know, I kinda like that.

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,529
That's an upholstery fabric, Your Majesty.

147
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,406
English people don't generally like
their monarch to look like a sofa.

148
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,165
Ah.

149
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,761
These are traditional English dishes,
some of which you will be served tonight.

150
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,531
Here we have roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding...

151
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,087
...bangers and mash
and the ever-popular spotted dick.

152
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,248
Spotted dick?!

153
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,563
- Dick of what?
- These are the bangers.

154
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,129
Sausages.

155
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,402
The spotted dick is a dessert.

156
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,688
Could I just have some ice cream?

157
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,529
Quite an eventful first day, Your Majesty.
I'll leave you to rest now.

158
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,007
This is Your Majesty's bedroom.

159
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,768
There you go, chief.

160
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,442
Unfortunately, you can redecorate
your private quarters as you see fit.

161
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,882
- Good. I got a few ideas.
- The velours industry is on stand-by.

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,562
Through those doors is your dining room,
and across the way, the bath.

163
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,047
Through here is your study...

164
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,842
...and there is your dressing room.

165
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,327
Anything we've left out?

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,401
I don't know. How about a bowling alley?

167
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,967
One other thing.
At your coronation four months hence...

168
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,448
...you will be required to wear
the imperial state crown.

169
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,167
It's usually kept in the Tower of London,
but we placed it near your bed...

170
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,011
...as a reminder of
the eminence of your office.

171
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,091
It contains the Star of India,
the second Largest diamond in the world.

172
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,683
You should practise wearing it
to get used to the weight.

173
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,849
- Good evening, Your Majesty.
- Thanks.

174
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,924
- Hey, (Zed.
- Yes?

175
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,766
What exactly is it
that a king does all day?

176
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,087
Scarcely a minute is unaccounted for.

177
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
Nevertheless, what you do is
not as important as what you are.

178
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,089
What am I?

179
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,569
To be the King of England is
a responsibility like no other on Earth.

180
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,526
You must become a symbol of
all that is best about England.

181
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,168
An embodiment of our history, our culture,
our morality, our pride of achievement.

182
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,367
In short, our ideal of civilisation.
You must, under harsh public scrutiny...

183
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,804
...exhibit all of our virtues
and none of our shortcomings.

184
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,130
Wait a minute. I thought all I was
supposed to do was dress up and wave.

185
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,290
- I don't even know what our virtues are.
- You will learn soon enough.

186
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,442
I'm afraid it's a god's burden to bear.
Unfortunately, it must be borne by a man.

187
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,328
Good evening, Your Majesty.

188
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,921
It's not enough simply to be the king.
You must look and act like one.

189
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,088
We'll begin with the walk.

190
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,682
Imagine yourself to be
the master of your domain.

191
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,568
A leader of men.

192
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,288
Don't swing your arms.

193
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,567
Back straight.

194
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,887
Head up.

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,968
But relaxed.

196
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,809
How am I doin'?

197
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,850
It's an unmitigated catastrophe,
Prime Minister.

198
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,248
This song-and-dance man
from the colonies...

199
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,840
It's the end of everything
that we hold dear.

200
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,522
And please try to keep in mind that Jones
will need a certain period of adjustment.

201
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,167
He's American.
He's impervious to adjustment.

202
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,571
Better to declare his line at an end than
subject England to this embarrassment.

203
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,411
Are you suggesting that
we have no king at all?

204
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,888
Certainly not. Simply choose a king
from the House of Stuart...

205
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,766
"who reigned in glory before the
Wyndhams. Make theirs a royal line again.

206
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,602
That would be your line, Lord Graves,
making you next in line for the throne.

207
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,325
Yes, I believe it would.

208
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,525
Removing Jones would be a drastic
measure for us to take at this juncture.

209
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,406
After all, he does have royal blood,
no matter how badly diluted.

210
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,526
So until he commits some grievous error,
we will simply have to live with him.

211
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,771
Well... yes.

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,284
I suppose so.

213
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,611
Well, Jones, you really
fell upstairs this time.

214
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,849
Too bad it's only gonna Last
the rest of your life!

215
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,724
<i>(bell rings)</i>

216
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,567

- Which one are you, again?

217
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,126
Gordon, Your Majesty's page.

218
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,247
Yeah, Gordon.
Could you bring me something?

219
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,567
- Anything.
- Anything, Your Majesty?

220
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,729
I've never had anybody bring rne
something. I wanna try it out.

221
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,890
Certainly. Perhaps
an assortment of fine chocolates?

222
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,851
Got any Milk Duds?

223
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,928
<i>(whistles)</i>

224
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,523
Sir Cedric, the king's gone!
He just walked out.

225
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,883
- Why didn't anyone stop him?
- We tried, sir, but he is the king.

226
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,129
- McGuire's with him.
- We've got to find him before the press.

227
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,529
Think! You've been made King of England.
Where's the first place you would go?

228
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,608
<i>(J American Dixie tune)</i>

229
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,882
Our headliner, Miss Fanny Oakley.
Thank you, Fanny!

230
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,368
And now a young Lady
making her professional debut...

231
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,405

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,003
I will, sir.

241
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,691
Hey, Flamingo. Hi. Really unique show.
Striptease without the nudity.

242
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,644
My name's Miranda.
And the show was terrible.

243
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,127
- Who are you?
- Ralph Jones. You know,"...

244
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,928
...you don't really have a Vegas accent.
- I wouldn't know. I've never been there.

245
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,362
How embarrassing!
Why did I ever think I could do this?

246
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,451
You just gotta remember to take
a crossover step before your spinback...

247
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,245
...or you'll never make it around
for the hip reveal.

248
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,762
- A lot of girls have trouble first night.
- This is my only night.

249
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,726
They already sacked rne. Know anybody
who'd wanna buy a tearaway dress?

250
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,286
- How about one of the maids?
- Your Majesty...

251
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,687
"we should stay with the present uniform.

252
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,330
Phippsy, you old hound! I didn't know you
went for this sort of thing. Meet Miranda.

253
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,890
- Do you guys work here?
- Well, no.

254
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,970
- Then what are you doing backstage?
- Well, it's OK.

255
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,323
- I'm the new king here.
- The king of what? Burlesque?

256
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,807
No! England.

257
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,082
That isn't a proper thing to joke about.

258
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,488
I'm not jokin'. They just hired me.
I could get you your job back.

259
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,489
- I don't think...
- I don't want it back.

260
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,171
I just wanna get dressed.
Excuse me, please.

261
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,727
This'll only take a rninute.
I'm new here. I don't know many people.

262
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,684
I thought we'd get together tomorrow,
have a drink...

263
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,962
...discuss the mood of the country...
- Alan!

264
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,321
- Who's Alan?
- The bouncer.

265
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,411
This is ridiculous. Nobody believes me.
Maybe we should get some cards printed.

266
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,761
- Alan!
- Look, I'll make you a deal.

267
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,771
If I can prove to you by tomorrow night
I'm the King of England, go out with me.

268
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,609
- Why are you guys in here?
- Hold on.

269
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,563
- These friends of yours?
- No.

270
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,922
Don't you be touchin' him now, Lad.

271
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,768
- Have we got a deal?
- Yes, all right, fine.

272
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,850
Corning here is the best thing
I've done so far.

273
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,206
Hiya, (Zed.

274
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,008
I need hardly remind you that this is not
the preferred entertainment of royalty.

275
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,884
Sorry, (Zed.

276
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,645
That's it, Your Majesty. Grip the bat.
Swing it vertically, not horizontally.

277
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,209
In baseball the ball comes to you on the
fly. In cricket it usually hits the ground.

278
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,722
The bowler is trying to hit your stump.
If he does, you are out.

279
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,721
So the better shot to learn initially
is the forward defensive shot.

280
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,080
Bowler?

281
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,123
At first, Your Majesty, just try to block it.

282
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,569
Bowler...

283
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,923
Pitch a few up, bowler. Nice and slow.

284
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
It's outta here!

285
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,286
<i>Although there's relief in most quarters
that a new sovereign has been found...</i>

286

- Yes.

292

I'm Lord Percival Graves. Do you have
a moment? It is a matter of some urgency.

293
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,764
Do come in")

294
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,050
I understand you've met our new king.

295
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,083
Yeah.

296
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,929
Looks like I did.

297
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,847
And you made quite an impression on him.

298
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,089
- Who said that?
- Have you seen today's <i>Bugle?</i>

299
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,602
72 per cent of the people see
the ascendancy to the throne of England...

300
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,691
...by an American commoner as a serious
threat to the status of the monarchy.

301
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,690
I'm sorry. What's this got to do with me?

302
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,522
You are in a unique position
to be of service to your country.

303
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,809
I'm sure that you are aware
that members of the royal family...

304
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,924
...are expected to maintain
certain standards...

305
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,249
"particularly with regard
to the company they keep.

306
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,809
Now, if the King of England were to
become involved with someone like you...

307
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,967
Someone like me?

308
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,562
...then the pressure on him
to abdicate would be considerable.

309
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,446
- You're asking rne to sleep with him?
- Oh, no, no, no.

310
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,724
No, nothing like that.
I simply want you to spend time with him.

311
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,764
To befriend him,
nurture his burgeoning affection...

312
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,089
"until such time as
a simple photograph can be taken.

313
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,487
Little snapshot of you together in public.

314
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,602
Forget it.

315
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,724
He is making a mockery
of centuries of tradition.

316
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,888
We are on the brink of a national crisis.

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,209
I think we'll survive.
What's in this for you?

318
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,721
I'm prepared to make it
well worth your while.

319
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,003
- Thanks, but I don't need the money.
- (laughs)

320
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,487
What about your family?

321
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,809
What about them?

322
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,130
Your father and brother have been out
of work for almost a year, haven't they?

323
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,210
Such a tragedy,
the demise of the steel industry!

324
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,561
My enquiries tell rne that their savings
have dried up. Debts are mounting.

325
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,446
It's only a matter of time
before the house is repossessed.

326
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,248
Get out.

327
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,721
I don't think you understand quite
how much I'm offering. Close the door.

328
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,562
£15,000 to start. And if you're
successful, enough to ensure...

329
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,163
...that you never have to worry
about money for the rest of your life.

330
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,647
You or your family.

331
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,323
Now, surely, you're not prepared
to sacrifice their future...

332
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,889
"for the sake of an American usurper
that you don't even know?

333
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,408
I think not.

334
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,884
Tea?

335
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,524
Milk?

336
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,084
Sugar?

337
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,048
One lump or two?

338
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,285
Two for me. A little bonus there.

339
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,805
So...

340
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,728
What's on the agenda today?

341
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,003
One word of advice, Your Majesty.
When you meet the Prime Minister...

342
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,567
...it would be best to say 'How do you do?'
rather than 'How you doin'?'

343
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,967
No problem. How do you do? (yawns)

344
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,890
Excuse me.
I didn't get much sleep Last night.

345
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,368
Still on Vegas time, plus I haven't had
a day job for four years.

346
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,724
I'm more of a night owl,
but what the hell? As long as we're all up.

347
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,967
Your Majesty, may I present
the Prime Minister, Geoffrey Hale?

348
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,969
How do you do, Geoff?

349
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,641
- It's a pleasure to meet Your Majesty.
- Think nothing of it. Call rne Ralph.

350
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,728
No, I'm afraid I can't.

351
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,720
Shall we sit?

352
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,808
I don't want to keep you, Your Majesty...

353
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,924
...but there is a matter of
some pressing national interest.

354
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,361
- Fire away, Geoff.
- As you may know...

355
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,051
...there's considerable unrest in Africa...

356
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,721
"resulting in the emergence
of several new states.

357
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,046
Ah.

358
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,960
Well, the first thing we're gonna
have to do is buy all-new globes.

359
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,447
Beyond that,
we shouldn't rush into anything.

360
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,007
There's no problem that can't be ignored
if we put our minds to it.

361
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,487
Yes, well, of these new states...

362
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,969
...Zambezi is the most important, owing
to its recently discovered mineral wealth.

363
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,764
That's pretty much my feeling.

364
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,329
So we've decided to invite King Mulambon
of Zambezi to visit England on the 23rd.

365
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,286
- I didn't know Zambezi even had a king.
- They didn't until recently.

366
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,971
Mulambon is anxious
to legitimise himself...

367
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,926
...by rubbing elbows with
the royal houses of Europe.

368
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,922
So, Your Majesty, we would be grateful
if you would host a reception for... him...

369
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,247
<i>(Snares)</i>

370
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,242
You'll have to excuse him, Prime Minister.
He is more of a night owl.

371
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,166
Extraordinary fellow.
Could I have a word, Willingham?

372
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,366
He simply won't do. He's common,
ignorant and extremely ill-mannered.

373
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,042
The man's an orang-utan.
God help us with the King of Zambezi.

374

♪ Well, be-bop a-lula

375
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,646

§ Y I
oir Majesty?
Yes?

379
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,770
- Did you have a nice nap?
- I guess the jet Lag caught up with me.

380
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,123
- I'm ready to go now, though.
- Good. There's much to cover.

381
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,323
The new uniforms are ready
and I brought some books to read.

382
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,569
One on English history,
one on the lives of the monarchs...

383
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,365
...and a primer on etiquette. What's this?

384
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,405
Date night. Where does the king eat
in this town? I'm in the mood for sushi.

385
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,569
That's out of the question.
We haven't arranged security.

386
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,569
Japanese are dangerous here?

387
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,651
Your Majesty, there are elements at Large
who might seek to do the king harm...

388
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,411
- "for their own personal ends.
- What kinda harm?

389
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,605
Well, kidnapping you for ransom.
In some cases, even...

390
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,763
Even what? Killin' me? You know, Ced,
I can't take too many more surprises.

391
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,690
Where was this when Phipps
was goin' on about the castles?

392
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,567
We didn't want to alarm you. There's
nothing to fear if precautions are taken.

393
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,208
You must accept some limitations on your
personal freedom, and on your wardrobe.

394
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,766
So far, there are no royal luaus planned.

395
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,123
There's still gotta be a way
to get this date in. I'm serious, Ced.

396
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,607
After all, I am the king, right?

397
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,485
Very well... Your Maj.

398
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,849
(driver) I've got
the king's special permission.

399
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,928
(policeman) Go through.

400
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,641
Miss Greene, Your Majesty.

401
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,129
- Your Majesty.
- You don't have to worry about that.

402
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,245
- And please, call me Ralph.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I could never do that.

403
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,840
Yeah, God knows what could happen(!)

404
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,091
Well, I guess just the seven of us.

405
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,725
That was a lovely dinner. I can't believe
I'm eating in the throne room.

406
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,844
Yeah, well, Willingham
wanted it to be intimate.

407
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,521
I asked Gordon to get us some music,
something we can dance to.

408
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,168
Oh, here's dessert.

409
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,481
Would you care for some spotted...

410
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,448
Dick?

411
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,324
Yeah.

412
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,886
I came to London to study design.

413
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,686
I only tried exotic dancing
because I needed some extra money.

414
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,041
I went to night school for a bit.

415
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,006
But when my dad lost his job,
I started sending money home.

416
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,521
There wasn't enough to live on
and go to school.

417
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,291
Now I don't know if I'll ever get back to it.

418
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,402
Sure you will. Something'll break for ya.

419
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,287
I've never done anything my whole life
and look where I am. There.

420
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,323
- What's this?
- What's what?

421
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,889
- There's no such word as 'yo'.
- Are you crazy? I use it all the time.

422
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,562
You don't have to look it up. We're using
the King's English. If I say it, it's a word.

423
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,401
By the way, the Y's on a triple-word
score. I'm starting to catch up here.

424
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,887
Narrowed the gap to 164 points.

425
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,844
What?

426
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,407
I don't know.
You're not the kind of girl I'm used to.

427
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,764
You can spell, you wear clothes to work.
You just have more class, I guess.

428
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,201
I'm just a sales girl from South London.

429
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,006
It doesn't count for much class down here,
but it's nice of you to say so.

430
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,648
Look, I know our deal was just for one
date, but do you think we could extend it?

431
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,127
You don't really know me.

432
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,401
There are things about me
you might not like.

433
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,684
Like what? You're beautiful,
you're smart, you're honest.

434
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,648
I should go.

435
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,570
- Thank you for a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

436
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,525
<i>(door opens)</i>

437
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,201
I'm sorry it took such a long time,
Your Majesty, but I found you some music.

438
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,810
I hope you aren't enamoured of her.

439
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,769
- It would never work out.
- Why not?

440
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,690
As king, you are expected
to marry a woman of noble birth...

441
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,770
"particularly given
your less-than-perfect breeding.

442
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,805
And Miss Greene, fetching as
she may be, does not qualify.

443
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,844
Your Majesty may remember, in 1936...

444
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,965
...King Edward fell in love with a commoner
and had to abdicate his throne.

445
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,243
The House of Wyndham can ill afford
another such disaster.

446
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,170
I didn't say I'd marry her.
I just wanna take her out.

447
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,443
With respect, your Majesty,
it would be best for both of you...

448
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,927
...if you did not see Miss Greene at all.

449
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,089
But if you insist, it's imperative that
you only see her here at the palace.

450
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,606
I'll teach you a poem to help you
remember the order of the kings.

451
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,883
One, two, three Eds, Richard two,
Henry four, five, six, then who?

452
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,005
Edward four, five, Rich the bad,
then Richard III...

453
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,009
Then Henrys twice and Ed the Lad.

454
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,203
Mary, Lizzie, James the vain,
Charlie, Charlie, James again...

455
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,081
She's already seen him twice this week.

456
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,649
We could tip off the press next time.
Have some photographers outside.

457
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,969
No, let's wait a bit longer.

458
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,641
Give him enough time to become
hopelessly infatuated with her.

459
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,841
Pull!

460
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,087
Now this is what I call a room.

461
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,366
Your Majesty,
the Sovereign King Mulambon of Zambezi.

462
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,647
Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf
of the people of the United Kingdom...

463
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,728
And the Commonwealth.

464
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,411
And the Commonwealth, for which we... no.

465
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,170
It's a great pleasure...

466
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,362
...to have you as our guest.

467
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,881
<i>We</i> hope you had a pleasant trip.

468
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,728
Oh, look! See the swan?

469
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,047
Keep those knees tight in. Sit back.

470
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,528
Grip with the knees.

471
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,722
Heels down! Heels down!

472
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,444
Whoa!

473
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,891
Your Majesty.

474
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,689
Oh, blast!

475
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,841
Hello, newsdesk?

476
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,123
I have something
you might be interested in.

477
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,008
<i>(Phipps) When in public,
a royal personage must refrain...</i>

478
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,408
<i>“from chewing gum, using profanity...</i>

479
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,967
<i>“picking his nose,
scratching his private parts...</i>

480
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,084
<i>...and staring dawn the bust lines
of female dignitaries.</i>

481
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,690
What? That's everything.

482
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,771
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I'm afraid I have some distressing news.

483
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,611
Miss Greene's presence Last night
did not go unnoticed.

484
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,607
Your Majesty, for the sake of the
monarchy, this gives you little choice...

485
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,882
...but to end your friendship
with Miss Greene.

486
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,765
What?! I can't do that.
I don't even wanna do that.

487
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,281
Don't worry.
We'll find you an exemplary consort.

488
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,290
A woman of such distinction
as to far exceed your standards.

489
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,926
I've always liked my standards
down where they are.

490
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,967
(Ralph) Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf
of the people of the United Kingdom.

491
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,082
It's our pleasure to have you as our guest.

492
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,250
Welcome, Your Majesty,
on behalf of the people...

493
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,601
You got a good thing goin' here.
Don't blow it.

494
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,371
Don't worry, Your Majesty. You'll be fine.

495
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,448
<i>(fanfare)</i>

496
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,410
Your Majesty, may I present His Royal
Highness King Mulambon of Zambezi.

497
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
Hey, homes! What's happenin'?

498
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,769
Gimme a quintet, brother!

499
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,561
I do not comprehend, Your Majesty.

500
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,811
Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf of
the people of the United Kingdom...

501
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,047
You wanna go get a beer?

502
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,485
Do you feel that being the king of a
major nation is tougher than you thought?

503
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,481
Yes, it is difficult sometimes, with all the
ceremonial duties and official obligations.

504
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,242
But I'm quite pleased with the economic
progress my country has made.

505
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,365
We are hoping to be the first in Africa
to market an automobile.

506
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,611
Really? I might be in the market myself
soon. The Rolls doesn't have much poop.

507
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,248
- This car gonna have fuel injection?
- Everything. Five-speed transmission...

508
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,604
- Reclining buckets? Rear spoiler?
- No, but it'll get excellent gas mileage.

509
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,850
Gas mileage is fine, but keep in mind
the first question any car-buyer asks:

510
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,849
'Will this get me Laid?'

511
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,284
Beautifully stated.

512
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,644
Ah!

513
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,331
Looks like that's all she wrote.
Wanna go again?

514
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,366
Yes.

515
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,363
Hi-ya!

516
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,248
- What was that, a five?
- No, it was a three.

517
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,203
- Not on the line?
- Makes no difference.

518
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,530
- I plan to claim victory with this throw.
- Be careful not to foot-fault there.

519
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,611
If he gets anything better
than a seven here, we're screwed.

520
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,729
<i>(cheering and applause)</i>

521
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,882
- You're good. Can I get a set of those?
- I'll send you one.

522
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,324
Listen, I've been meaning to ask you. Do
they tell you who you can date over there?

523
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,807
Of course not. I am the king.

524
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,005
Damn. I knew I was
gettin' hosed over here.

525
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,686
Well, I think he did pretty well,
considering. It could have been worse.

526
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,043
Yes, he could have
exposed himself, I suppose.

527
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,730
<i>(phone rings)</i>

528
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,850
Yes?

529
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,327
The Prime Minister for you, sir.

530
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,531
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

531
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,210
Yes.

532
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,127
Oh, really?

533
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,403
Well, it's a strange world
we live in, isn't it, sir?

534
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,488
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

535
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,562
The Prime Minister
spoke to King MuLambon.

536
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,004
The king said he couldn't remember
when he'd had so much fun.

537
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,011
- Sherry?
- Please, yes.

538
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,001
<i>King Ralph seems ta have passed
his first diplomatic test with high marks.</i>

539
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,569
<i>The king's personal style, which had
raised some eyebrows in official circles...</i>

540
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,651
<i>...is now being characterised as
"a breath of fresh air".</i>

541
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,404
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

542
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,366
We were a little nervous when we first
decided to take a chance on you...

543
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,209
...but, erm...

544
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,564
- I really did all right then, huh?
- Yes, but don't let it go to your head.

545
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,446
Today's 'breath of fresh air'
can quickly become tomorrow's 'ill wind'.

546
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,645
Now the Zambezi thing's over with, I got
a coupLa weeks of vacation coming, right?

547
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,288
If anything we will have to increase public
appearances in light of your popularity.

548
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,961
And the ball season will soon be upon us.
You will need dance lessons.

549
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,050
Waltz, foxtrot, even eightsome reel.

550
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,251
Come on, I haven't had a day off
since I've been here.

551
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,285
I can't go out, I eat alone, I live
in a museum, I sleep in an auditorium...

552
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,210
- You will get used to it.
- I got no family, no sex life.

553
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,765
Good. Less chance for scandal.

554
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,521
I don't see anybody that doesn't
work for rne. I'm gettin' palace fever.

555
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,440
Are you trying to tell me in your uniquely
American way that you are lonely?

556
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,368
Yeah.

557
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,280
Don't lose patience, Your Majesty.
We are working on the problem.

558
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,368
Good evening.

559
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,361
Right, I'm gonna give you guys
one more chance. Fetch!

Ooh, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

563
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,724
I got him. I got him good.
I'm sorry. Really, I'm terribly sorry.

- Haven't seen what, Your Majesty?

567
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,884
- I really need a night out, Gordon.
- There are easier ways.

568
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,882
Stay, boy. Stay.

Good luck.

Hello, Miranda? It's me, Ralph.

Am I glad to see you!
People are lookin' at me.

579

- Are you alone?
- Yeah. There's somethin' I wanna do.

580
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,404
Two double Whoppers with fries
and two giant Cokes.

581

Two double Whoppers,
two fries, two giants!

582
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,407
- Got any money? I haven't been paid.
- Sure.

583
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,091
You know, you look familiar.

584
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,125
Aren't you...?

585
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,881
Yeah, you are, aren't you?
You're the new king!

586
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,049
What, are you crazy?
What would I be doin' in here?

587
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,288
It's the king!

588
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,928
Could I have the burgers, please?

589
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,409
- Oh, look! It's the king!
- (Ralph) No, you got the wrong guy.

590
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,602
I ain't him. I can't...

591
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,688
All right, all right, one or two.

592
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,450
Your Majesty,
here's a burger on the house.

593
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,005
- I think I'm gonna need a new burger.
- Over here, Your Majesty.

594
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,170
Maybe just one quick one.

595
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,090
Could you move a little closer together?
That's lovely.

596
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,966
Maybe put your arm around him
and give him a little kiss.

597
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,009
Very nice.

598
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,801
- What the hell did you do that for?
- We've got to go.

599
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,003
- The fries aren't ready.
- There'll be photographers everywhere.

600
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,329
- How about some onion rings?
- Your Majesty, I've got your burger.

601
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,206
- You should get back to the palace now.
- I don't wanna get back to the palace.

602
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,722
- There's gotta be some place we can go-
- Well, maybe one.

603
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,802
(Miranda) Two, three, four, side...

604
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,481
Two, three, four, forward...

605
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,321
Two, three, four, side...

606
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,762
Hope you're not too upset
about this 'mystery woman' thing.

607
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,565
The girls at work said it was
probably some East End tart...

608
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,650
...trying to get her picture in the papers.

609
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,367
I wish we could meet again, somewhere
else, in different circumstances.

610
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,211
Different circumstances?

611
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,245
We got the park, we got the Lake,
we got the moon, we got the stars.

612
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,442
What else do we need?

613
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,642
Yeah.

614
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,242
What? What is it, this 'commoner' thing?

615
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:45,002
Edward VIII and that Wallis broad?
That was 50 years ago. This is the '90s.

616
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,920
We gotta be able to work somethin' out.
Anything's possible.

617
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,169
Not in England. Not for royalty.

618
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,688
Don't say that.

619
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,531
I can't see myself making it here
without you, Miranda.

620
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,363
Now, this is exceptional.

621
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,010
You realise, don't you, that you're looking
at the fall of the House of Wyndham?

622
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,570
And before long, the House of Stuart
will be restored to its rightful place.

623
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,969
And you, Gordon, will be
private secretary to the king.

624
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,520
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, my Lord.

625
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,611
A Miss Miranda Greene to see you.

626
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,403
Lord Graves.

627
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,091
What an unexpected surprise.

628
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,924
Here's your money. All of it.

629
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,364
I'm just glad that I got out now
before any real damage was done.

630
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,770
You can't bluff me.
I know what you're after.

631
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,247
You just want more money.

632
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,201
You're right.
Then there'd be more to give back.

633
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,045
Come back here, you little strumpet!

634
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,884
I rather enjoyed that.

635
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,410
Welcome to Windsor Castle, Your Majesty.
The Prime Minister will be here shortly.

636
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,569
There's something
he wishes to talk to you about.

637
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,409
The peak goes to the front, Your Majesty.

638
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,967
Now that you've handled
the Zambezi reception so famously...

639
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,564
"we feel that you're ready to help us with
a matter of even greater national import.

640
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,762
I don't know if you're aware of it...

641
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,602
...but Finland recently discovered Large oil
deposits in their area of the Baltic Sea.

642
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,041
One of our companies is
bidding for the contract...

643
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,403
...to supply all the platforms
and drilling equipment...

644
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,603
...a contract that could create
thousands of jobs in the Northeast.

645
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,441
Unfortunately, we're getting
spirited competition from the Japanese.

646
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,370
I've heard they can be a problem.
What are we hunting, (Zed?

647
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,721
I believe it's pheasant, Your Majesty.

648
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,083
At present, the competition seems to be
what you call a 'toss-up'.

649
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,328
However, we have one more ace to play.

650
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,126
The King of Finland is due here
in two weeks on a state visit.

651
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,644
- Is this gun loaded, (Zed?
- Yes.

652
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,845
You will, in keeping with tradition,
be hosting a royal banquet for him.

653
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,362
I'm afraid we won't be able to get by
on pretzels and beer this time.

654
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,403
The king will be with his daughter...

655
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,047
...Princess Anna, one of the most
socially desirable women in the world.

656
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,322
Does that mean she's ugly?

657
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,047
Far from it. We're organising a ball
in her honour to follow the banquet...

658
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,686
...so that you two can
get to know each other better.

659
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,531
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
The beaters are approaching.

660
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,088
Here they come, Your Majesty.

661
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,970
They're over.

662
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,567
<i>(squealing)</i>

663
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,642
Did I get one?

664
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,445
Fortunately, it's only a flesh wound.

665
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,801
Now, if everything proceeds as it should...

666
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,720
...this ball will be the first step
toward the royal wedding of the century.

667
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,411
Wedding? You mean her and me?

668
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,329
Yes, you and her.

669
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,046
This is going too far.
You can't tell me who to marry.

670
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,448
- Isn't being king worth something?
- Yes, that's why you must marry.

671
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,564
- To protect your birthright.
- What about matters of the heart?

672
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,206
They must be subordinated
to the good of the monarchy.

673
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,927
You're the Last of the Wyndhams. A queen
must be found to perpetuate the line.

674
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,805
Princess Anna is the best
of the acceptable candidates.

675
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,970
I know it's difficult, but there are times
when you must put aside personal desires.

676
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,651
A king's life is not always his own!

677
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,842
- You're serious about this.
- Yes!

678
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,284
Well, I got news for ya. My life is my own
and I can't take this shit any more.

679
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,405
I got everything in the world and nothin'
I need. No friends, no freedom, no fun.

680
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,683
At least back in the States
I could screw up my life as I saw fit.

681
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,966
Take this job and shove it down somebody
else's throat, cos I quit! I'm outta here!

682
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,762
You'd walk out on the English people?

683
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,204
- I told you I was the wrong guy for this.
- You're wrong for everything, Ralph.

684
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,846
Who are you callin' 'Ralph'?
It's 'Your Majesty'!

685
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,930
Not any more. You quit,
just as you quit the bear scouts.

686
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,327
- Cub scouts.
- Little League, high-school band...

687
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,161
...three colleges and an assortment
of jobs too numerous to mention!

688
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,648
Now you want rne to quit on Miranda
and any chance at a normal life.

689
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,922
That shirt is not yours.

690
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,011
I wasn't born to this crap. You can't
expect rne to accept these restrictions.

691
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,646
What of the thousands of workers
who will benefit?

692
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,081
- Maybe something else'll come along.
- Will it?

693
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,522
Are you willing to bet their future on it
for a woman you've known a few weeks?

694
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,768
You want rne to marry one
I don't know at all!

695
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,521
I'm asking you to think of
something Larger than yourself.

696
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,881
To accept responsibility for once...

697
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,209
"without beating retreat
at the first sign of difficulty.

698
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,008
The throne of England is not a job to be
discarded when it's your bowling night!

699
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,681
First sign of difficulty? You've been
destroying my fantasy for weeks.

700
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,727
It's up to you whether you embrace this
situation as a challenge to your abilities...

701
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,051
...or simply to chalk it up as another
failure, a monument to your own passivity.

702
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,683
I think it's time you made
a stand somewhere for something.

703
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,768
If not now, then when?

704
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,401
There's no guarantee
I'll be attracted to her.

705
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,841
Then we'll get her
a G-string and some pasties...

706
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,169
...but you must not shrink from your duty.

707
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,841
To refuse to receive her now
would be disastrous for England.

708
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,885
Your family, your government and the
people of England are counting on you.

709
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,163
You owe it to them and to yourself.

710
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,047
OK, I'll give it a shot.

711
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,883
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You won't regret it.

712

- What?

I mean, I really wish I could. You just
have to trust me. It's not a good idea.

Yeah, they're puttin' the pressure

It could never have worked out.

Sure, I understand.

722
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,606
I guess we should just be glad for
the time we had, that kind of thing.

723

We did have a good time, didn't we?
Please don't think badly of me.

No.

Bye. Ralph.

This is my invitation to the Finnish ball.

Make sure that Miss Greene
gets one just like it.

733
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,085
- Of course.
- And write this on the back.

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,925
He also instructed me to give you this.

751
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,366
I have no doubt that they will be
the toast of the continent.

752
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,526
Good evening, Your Majesty.
Lord Percival Graves.

753
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,880
I know that you will acquit yourself
as famously with the Finnish royals...

754
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,241
...as you have in your other endeavours.

755
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,522
One word of advice, if I may.

756
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,884
If things become too staid,
too formal for you...

757
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,961
...don't hesitate to display
that wonderful American flamboyance...

758
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,607
"for which you are so justly celebrated.

759
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,610
With your lustrous charm...

760
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,089
...I wouldn't be afraid to
show them who you really are.

761
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,441
Thanks. I'll try to keep that in mind.

762
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,451
Majesty-

763
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,370
His Britannic Majesty, King Ralph I...

764
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,771
...and Their Royal Majesties, King Gustav
and Queen Katherine of Finland...

765
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,850
...and Her Royal Highness, Princess Anna.

766
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,804
I am told you are something of
a sportsman. My particular passion is polo.

767
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,446
- No game like it for a gentleman.
- I've heard that.

768
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,450
If I ever get to be one, I'll take it up.

769
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,688
Do you ever do any fencing?

770
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,361
Just a little, when I was a kid.
A couple of watches here and there.

771
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,883
- The princess is lovely, isn't she?
- She doesn't say much...

772
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,844
...but she is what they call
in America a fox.

773
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,090
I am glad you find her so. Best wishes
in your fox-hunting, Your Majesty.

774
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,282
Fox-hunting? You like fox-hunting?

775
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,325
I don't get around much Lately, but
I used to go out almost every weekend.

776
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,920
- One club or another.
- Really? That often?

777
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,850
You must have collected several tails.

778
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,726
Well, I admit I slept with a few,
but I'm not like that any more.

779
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,925
Nowadays you can't be too careful.
You never know who they've been with.

780
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,281
No... I suppose not.

781
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,404
Of course, once I had a steady girl,
that put an end to it.

782
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,967
- She didn't like fox-hunting?
- Well, of course not!

783
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,442
Anna isn't into it, is she?

784
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,803
Oh, yes, she loves it. Most royals do.

785
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,806
Gustav, let the king eat.
His guests are waiting.

786
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,008
Right.

787
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,925
Sorry, they don't feed
the chickens enough over here.

788
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,482
Excuse me.

789
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,288
Just spectacularly bad luck.
It could have happened to almost anyone.

790
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,361
I'd be better off doing things my way.
When I try to do things right I screw up.

791
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,925
All is not lost, Your Majesty.

792
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,329
If things go well between you and the
princess at the ball, it will be forgotten.

793
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,408
<i>(I stately processional)</i>

794
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,008
Shall we dance?

795
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,164
<i>(J slow waltz)</i>

796
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,124
- You dance great.
<i>- (deep</i> voice) Oh, thank you. So do you.

797
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,891
I'm curious about
what kind of things you like.

798
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,288
Oh, I don't know. Certainly the fine arts.

799
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,607
The opera, the ballet, the symphony.

800
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,371
- And I love to travel.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

801
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,962
- Have you ever been to Hoover Darn?
- No, I missed that one.

802
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,050
- We prefer Deauville.
- Deauville?

803
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,801
France. Daddy played in
the Gold Cup there this summer.

804
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,402
- Then, of course, we went to Ascot.
- Oh. What country is that in?

805
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,284
England.

806
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,850
What do you say that
we take a little breather?

807
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,283
- It seems to be going well, Willingham.
- Yes.

808
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,650
We've been settin' a torrid pace in there.
I hope the rest of our life isn't as wild.

809
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,411
Now that we've gotten
to know each other...

810
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:55,481
...our representatives can get together
to work out a schedule for our courtship.

811
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,127
I have a few travel commitments
that have to be worked around.

812
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,969
I need to talk to you about this.

813
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,369
Don't you think we should develop
some special feelings for each other first?

814
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,280
It would be a charming bonus,
but I hardly think it's necessary.

815
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,166
We're royals. We marry for the... position.

816
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,610
If I wanted to marry for love...

817
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,361
...I would have married Gunnar jann
back in Penike.

818
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,320
But do you really wanna marry me?

819
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,411
Well, I must admit, you'll require
a bit more work than I'd hoped.

820
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,811
You are unsophisticated, ignorant
and totally Lacking in social grace.

821
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:41,088
But I console myself with the fact
that you have nice buttocks.

822
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,407
I beg your pardon?

823
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,488
As you were dancing...

824
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,047
...I drowned the memory of
your behaviour at dinner...

825
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,006
...with a vision of you
bending me over the Queen-Anne desk...

826
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,487
...in the white drawing room.

827
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,490
Wouldn't that be uncomfortable,
with all those pens?

828
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,331
Yes. Or best of all...

829
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,445
...you could strap me to the throne
with strings of pearls.

830
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,645
- The servants might see us.
- I would hope so.

831
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,728
Ah, there you two are!

832
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,404
Come, Anna.
You haven't danced with your father.

833
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,488
Corning, Father.

834
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,606
Yes, yes, they do make a lovely couple.

835
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,362
- How's it going, Your Majesty?
- Great.

836
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,006
We have nothing in common,
she sounds like a tuba...

837
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,646
...she wants to have sex on
a bed of nails on national TV...

838
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,209
...but at least the party stinks.
I gotta do something to liven things up.

839
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,085
Time for some of that
American flamboyance.

840
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,411
- Your Majesty.
- I got a little number I'd like to do.

841
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,081
- You guys got a piano?
- No, but we've got a harpsichord.

842
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,168
Good enough. Let's go over the changes.

843
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,724
Thank you.

844
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,161
- You guys ready?
- We'll do the best we can, Your Majesty.

845
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,966
Ladies and gentleman, I'd like to
welcome you all to the ball again.

846
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,321
Is everybody havin' a good time?

847
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,930
Well, as you may have read, I love music.

848
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,566
Since this is the biggest audience
I've ever had...

849
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,368
...I'd like to play somethin' for ya, maybe
pick up the tempo, get things rollin'.

850
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,450
This is a sweet
Little Richard Penniman tune.

851
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,405
<i>(I scale with wrong note)</i>

852
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,124
Agh!

853
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,208
A little rusty.

854
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,927
Here you go. Help me out here.

855
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:06,723
Thanks.

856
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,927

Thanks a lot, guys.

885
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,760
- Great to see you! Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

886
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,771
- Who is this girl?
- Miranda. Who are you?

887
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,565
I am Princess Anna,
the king's future bride.

888
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,008
Future bride?

889
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,764
I see. Excuse me,
I think I should be going.

890
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,167
No, wait, Miranda.
I can explain this. Sorta.

891
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,851
- Anna, we are going.
- I want to know who that girl was.

892
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,406
Never mind him. He is not worth it.

893
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,684
Please wait, King Gustav.
I'm sure His Majesty regrets...

901
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,209
- Hear! Hear!
- Must we stand idly by...

902
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,211
...and suffer the degradation
of our most sacred traditions...

903
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,847
...by this witless ivory-tinkler
from across the sea?

904
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,325
I say no!

905
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,408
Hear, hear!

906
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,688
I say it is time to reclaim our heritage.

907
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,564
Hear, hear!

908
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,083
I say it is time to reclaim
our national pride.

909
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,326
Hear, hear!

910
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:21,162
I say it is time to reclaim our throne!

911
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,248
Hear, hear!

912
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,842
Sorry, Grandpa.

913
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,090
I had a chance to make a mark for our
side of the family and I screwed it up.

914
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,169
Maybe I should have myself beheaded.

915
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,727
Tommie, this is Ralph. I need a favour.

916
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,528
- Mrs Greene?
- Yes?

917
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,007
Hi. Is Miranda here?

918
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,602
As I live and breathe!
You're him, aren't you?

919
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,810
Just barely.

920
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,525
I know I shouldn't have come,
but I wanted to see you.

921
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,291
Parliament wants rne to resign.
Hale agrees.

922
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,165
- You're not gonna do it, are you?
- I don't know.

923
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,251
I've never done anything of importance.
I usually bail out long before that.

924
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,604
But I am the king, even if I shouldn't be.
I don't wanna be the Last of the line...

925
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,770
...the one who embarrassed the country
and had to crawl out the back door.

926
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,247
King Ralph the Chickenhearted.

927
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,808
- What do you think I should do?
- I'm in no position to give advice.

928
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,641
I'm sorry about all the stuff in the papers,
all the things they've said...

929
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,003
Ralph, there's something
I have to tell you.

930
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,885
After we first met at the club...

931
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,850
...Lord Graves came to see me.
- Graves?

932
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,608
He offered me money to help my family...

933
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,527
...if I would... see you...

934
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,286
...and compromise you in some way.

935
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,846
You went for it? You let him bribe you?

936
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,085
- To begin with.
- I don't believe this.

937
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,166
Ever since I've been here,
I've had people sayin'...

938
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,887
...'Stay away from her.
She's the wrong class.' And I ignored 'em!

939
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,891
I kept tellin' myself 'Everything'll work out
fine once they know you like I do...

940
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,166
...once they find out what a great gal
you were.' And you were settin' rne up!

941
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,682
What did they give you for the night
in the park? Triple-word score?

942
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,124
It wasn't like that. After that night,
I gave Graves his money back.

943
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,891
- I didn't know he already had photos.
- Yeah, right(!)

944
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,651
Why do you think I kept you
away from the photographers...

945
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,003
...and called to say I couldn't see you
any more? It was too dangerous.

946
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,929
I wish I could believe that.

947
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,250
I don't expect you to,
or to believe that I've missed you.

948
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,204
But I wish we could still see each other.

949
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,848
I was stupid. I was offered an easy way
out of my problems and I took it.

950
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,566
I didn't think about the consequences.

951
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,401
I don't know what to think any more.
I've been in over my head all along.

952
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,251
The only thing I was ever sure of was you.

953
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,567
You <i>were</i> England to rne, Miranda.

954
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,924
Come in.

955
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,362
You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?

956
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,642
Yes, Gordon, I'd like something.

957
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,489
Anything, Your Majesty.

958
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,210
No.

959
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,249
Just an explanation.

960
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,730
I'll see what I can find out, Your Majesty.

961
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,164
Perhaps you can 'find out' why
the note is written in your handwriting.

962
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,727
I... don't know anything...

963
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,405
...about... anything.

964
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,368
Don't worry. It'll all come back to you.

965
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,688
- Hi.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

966
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,569
- Your Majesty.
- Got a second?

967
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,126
Of course. It's been
a rather disturbing day.

968
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,005
Yes, it has, but that's not
why I wanted to see you.

969
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,361
I was thinking of something
you said to rne once.

970
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:21,565
Most things go in one ear, out the other -
no offence - but this stuck with rne.

971
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,890
You said you were nervous when you
first decided on rne or something like that.

972
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,480
- Did I say that, Your Majesty?
- Yes, you did.

973
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,683
- The word 'decide' got me thinking.
- Did it, Your Majesty?

974
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,041
Yes, it did. Now, I'm the king, right?

975
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,846
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- And as my assistant private secretary...

976
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,000
...you are sworn to give rne whatever
information I might need, aren't you?

977
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,089
Yes, Your Majesty.

978
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,168
All right then, Phipps.

979
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,204
Fess up.

980
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,487
- You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?
- Yes, Ced. Come on in.

981
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,608
Have a seat.

982
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,329
I've been talking to Dunc about
something he said a while back.

983
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:20,209
It came out there was another guy in line
for the throne besides rne. Is that true?

984
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,209
I'm afraid it is, Your Majesty.

985
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,881
Was his claim as strong as mine?

986
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,241
Almost, yes.

987
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,285
His great grandfather had an unfortunate
evening with a parlour maid.

988
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,448
- So he was English?
- Yes.

989
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,642
Then why wasn't he chosen over me?

990
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,728
He begged to be let off.

991
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:47,046
He insisted that he was undeserving
of such an exalted position.

992
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,128
In other words...

993
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,649
...you just couldn't face it.

994
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,727
Yes, Your Majesty, I couldn't.

995
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,242
I didn't feel worthy and
I have no children to continue the line.

996
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,282
So I swore Phipps to silence and decided
to stay on as your private secretary.

997
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,927
Why? So you'd pick up
a few pointers, just in case?

998
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,805
I was determined to help you
do the job so well...

999
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,083
...that 'just in case' would never arise.

1000
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,324
It's easier to whisper advice from cover
than risk its merit at the point of attack.

1001
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,969
I am sorry, Your Majesty, both for
my deception and my cowardice.

1002
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,609
I probably oughta be pissed...

1003
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:50,088
...but I had nothin' else goin'
and I didn't get shot.

1004
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,606
Plus you are a relative.

1005
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,683
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your tolerance.

1006
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,205
Call the Prime Minister.
I wanna address Parliament.

1007
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,448
Parliament?!

1008
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,050
Parliament.

1009
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,128
<i>(two knocks)</i>

1010
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,846
My Lords, members of
the House of Commons...

1011
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,045
...His Majesty, Ralph I,
by the grace of God...

1012
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,642
...King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern lreLand...

1013
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,731
...Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

1014
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,248
Please be seated.

1015
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,485
My Lords and members
of the House of Commons.

1016
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,001
<i>It's unusual for a king
to address Parliament...</i>

1017
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:26,011
<i>...but I have some things ta say
and I wanna say them first-hand.</i>

1018
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:30,921
As you all know, I have made
some terrible mistakes Lately...

1019
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,841
"which have shamed England and cost
its workers some badly needed jobs.

1020
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,089
I have no excuse for my actions.

1021
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,204
I know I can't undo what's been done.

1022
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,290
I can only try to make up for it
in some way.

1023
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:51,123
With that in mind, I placed a call Last
night to King Mulambon of Zambezi.

1024
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,247
I am happy to be able to announce...

1025
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,445
...that Zambezi will begin production of
Africa's first car by the end of the year...

1026
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,086
...and, in a deal worked out
with Prime Minister Hale...

1027
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,204
"all of the engines will be built
right here in England.

1028
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,243
This means opening three manufacturing
and assembly plants in the Northeast.

1029
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,651
In addition, Zambezi wants to buy £200
million worth of English heavy equipment...

1030
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,482
...to help in the mining of
their vast national resources.

1031
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,964
Yeah!

1032
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:42,646
As happy as I am about all this, it doesn't
make up for my shortcomings as a king.

1033
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,843
I have done my best to learn
the ways of royalty...

1034
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,601
...to try to be the kind of king
you could be proud of.

1035
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,247
But I'm afraid my best
will never be good enough.

1036
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,888
Too often, my personal instincts
conflict with my royal obligations.

1037
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,005
For that reason,
I have decided to give up my throne.

1038
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,522
But before I go, there are
some things I wanna set straight.

1039
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,440
Since I became king, one member of
this house has worked to discredit me...

1040
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,450
...hoping that his family
would return to the throne.

1041
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,803
The so-called scandalous photographs
you've heard about...

1042
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,968
...were taken and given
to the King of Finland...

1043
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,243
...by a man working for
Lord Percival Graves.

1044
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,049
This is an outrage!

1045
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,801
A vile piece of slander! I demand
to know the source of these accusations!

1046
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,050
We have the confession of a royal page,
Gordon Halliwell, who worked with you.

1047
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,242
I know no such man!

1048
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,524
And several cheques made out to
the photographer, signed by Lord Graves...

1049
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:50,565
- "whose fingerprints were on the photos.
- So? I saw them at the ball.

1050
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,651
Scotland Yard found the negatives
in his house this morning.

1051
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,446
By what right can you order my arrest?

1052
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,131
By the Treason Act of 1702...

1053
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,882
"forbidding interference with the proper
succession of a monarch, enacted by...

1054
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,485
Charlie, Charlie, James again...

1055
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,568
"William III.

1056
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,570
<i>(murmuring and booing)</i>

1057
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,648
Shame!

1058
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,570
That's right. String 'im up. Wanker!

1059
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,721
I didn't bring this out to defend myself,
but I embarrassed England unintentionally.

1060
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,207
Graves did it deliberately.

1061
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,962
This is kinda where my notes run out.
I guess I'll have to wing it from here.

1062
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,085
I just wanna say that when I first came
here, I hardly knew where England was.

1063
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,010
But over the Last few months,
something has changed.

1064
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,044
I'll always consider myself an American...

1065
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,925
...but I've come to feel like
I'm English, too.

1066
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,921
I now realise how important a king
can be to his people if he's the right man.

1067
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,840
I also know that I'm too set in my ways
to ever be that man.

1068
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,568
As an Englishman, I want all of us
to have the kind of king we deserve.

1069
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,403
For that reason, tomorrow I'm turning over
the throne to Cedric Charles Willingham...

1070
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,726
"who, you'll be glad to know,
is also a Wyndham...

1071
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,528
...and a better, more qualified man
than any nation could hope for.

1072
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,611
And so to him I pledge my allegiance.

1073
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,364
Long live Cedric I, by the grace of God...

1074
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,201
...King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern lreLand...

1075
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,291
...Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

1076
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,648
God save the king.

1077
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,848
(all) God save the king!

1078
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,171
Well, I can't help it!
I'm gonna miss the geezer, all right?

1079
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,648
And one Last thing.
There's been some discussion...

1080
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,969
...and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
has suggested...

1081
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:29,085
...a healthy annual income and a house
in the country befitting your status.

1082
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,249
I don't know, (Zed. I should
stay out of the royalty business.

1083
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,886
You wouldn't have any
official obligations...

1084
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,449
...and I'm having this house equipped
with its own recording studio.

1085
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,406
Maybe I should give this
a little more thought.

1086
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,443
I think so.

1087
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,166
After me, you're still
the only Wyndham left...

1088
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,648
...and there's still the matter
of your investiture.

1089
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,162
Well, I guess that about does it.
I know you'll do a hell of a job.

1090
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:58,046
You got the breeding, the know-how,
you've practically been king already.

1091
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,811
You'll probably have to work
on your dancing, though.

1092
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,287
And feel free to change the decor.

1093
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,880
Just a dab here and there.

1094
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,127
Anyway, I wanna thank you
for everything you did for rne.

1095
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,686
I couldn't have made it without you.

1096
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,246
And you too, Dunc, and Tommie.

1097
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,681
It's I who should be thanking you.

1098
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,928
You showed me how to be a king.

1099
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,928
Me? I was a lousy king.

1100
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,202
On the contrary.

1101
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,966
You are a good and decent man...

1102
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,810
...and you've acted honourably.

1103
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,127
I shall try to follow your example.

1104
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,648
Thank you, (Zed.

1105
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,969
Hey, don't forget the crown. Practise
wearing it to get used to the weight.

1106
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,167
So long, Tommie.

1107
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,442
Good luck, Your Majesty.

1108
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,765
So long, Dunc.

1109
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,688
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

1110
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,007
So long, Your Majesty.

1111
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,804
