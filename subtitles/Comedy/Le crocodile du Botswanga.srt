1
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:24,281
Time of the wolf

2
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:53,287
Ben! Leave the birdcage in the car until the house has warmed up.

3
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,287
But it's hungry!

4
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,278
It will last for 10 minutes. 
Take that box instead.

5
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:01,276
Will help me, Eva?

6
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,278
It's wet at the bottom. Don't soil your clothes, Ben.

7
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,287
Where shall I put that one?

8
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,287
Doesn't matter! Put it anywhere.

9
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,276
Let's see...
- Freeze!

10
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,278
Close the door and come back.

11
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,278
What are you doing here?

12
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,278
I mean... How did you get in here?

13
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:53,276
What do you want?

14
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:55,287
Please. Put the gun down.

15
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,278
Stay put, or I will shoot! 

16
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,287
What did you think? This is private property.

17
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,278
You can't simply ...

18
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,278
Tell them to leave.
- Shut up! 

19
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,278
And take the baby away.

20
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,278
Let's talk this through.

21
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,278
Surely, we can work this out.

22
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,276
He shall leave!

23
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,279
We are not your enemies...

24
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:41,287
How long do you plan to stay?

25
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,287
Do you have food? For how long?

26
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,278
For long.

27
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,278
We share some with you, if you want.

28
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,287
Where do you come from? Are you from the city?

29
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,278
How much gas do you have?

30
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,287
It's almost gone.

31
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,276
Water?

32
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,276
Just some bottles.

33
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,278
Will you let the children go?

34
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,276
I implore you!

35
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,287
Get into the car.

36
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,278
Eva, take Ben and get outside.

37
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,278
What do they want?

38
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:43,279
Check that box.

39
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:07,280
Listen: We will get our things inside.

40
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,278
You killed him!

41
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,276
You killed him!

42
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,276
Be quiet! 

43
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,287
Enough! Shut up! Scram! 

44
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:29,279
Scram! 

45
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:35,276
Leave! 

46
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,278
Come on! Leave! Take him an leave.

47
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,278
My husband was shot.

48
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:26,279
But you do know me!

49
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,278
So...? 

50
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:36,280
There are people in our cottage. They shot Schorsch!

51
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:41,280
They took our car and the provisions.

52
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,279
I am very sorry.

53
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,278
It's your duty to help us.

54
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,278
You do know the situation.

55
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,278
Do you just act stupid?

56
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,287
Why did you come here from the city in the first place?

57
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:07,279
Take the children an leave.

58
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,279
Go away.

59
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,278
Madame Ordnaire!

60
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,278
I know that you can here me.

61
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,278
I will be back shortly.

62
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,287
Eva will stay with you.

63
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:14,287
I'll find some food. Probably even a place to sleep.

64
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,279
Take care.

65
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,276
Come here Benny.

66
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:36,287
Try to get some sleep.

67
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,278
I'll make as fast as I can.

68
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,278
Come on! You must sleep now.

69
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:01,279
Don't come here again. My husband must not know!

70
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:05,287
You have always been kind to me, too.

71
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:09,280
I can't give you any more.

72
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,276
Good luck.

73
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:35,280
Wait! I'll give it a try.

74
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,287
You must get it!

75
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:46,287
It won't escape us.

76
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,278
Please! It must not escape!

77
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:52,276
Now! 

78
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,287
Look out! It's getting away!

79
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,278
I know! Quiet! 

80
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,287
Stay there!

81
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:12,279
Come on! Get it down!

82
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,287
Be quiet! 

83
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,278
Your shouting is scaring it.

84
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:23,280
Quiet... Shit! 

85
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:25,276
What? 

86
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,278
Lie down! Don't move.

87
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,278
Take a clean tissue.

88
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:42,279
Put your head back. Come on!

89
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,279
Calm down.

90
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:57,278
When you stay calm, I'll get the bird for you.

91
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,276
Promise.

92
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,278
Come on.

93
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,278
You do want to go to Benny, don't you?

94
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,278
Quiet... There we go!

95
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,276
There it is.

96
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,278
Sleep now!

97
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,278


98
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,287
Mom! Mom wake up!

99
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,287
Mom! Benny is gone! 

100
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,287
What? 
- Benny! He is gone!

101
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:59,280
He way lying next to me, now he is gone.

102
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,276


103
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:59,281
Get more hay.
- Can you give me the lighter?

104
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,278
Take care not to burn down the barn.
- I know.

105
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:06,278
Benny! Where are you? 

106
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,287
You must light it outside.

107
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,287
There is so much falling down.

108
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,278
There is too much lying on the floor.

109
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,279
We need more. Go, get more.

110
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:40,287
It's no use like this. We must go looking for him.

111
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:43,287
Can you keep the fire burning?
- Sure.

112
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:48,287
Give me the lighter. You must keep it burning brightly.

113
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:53,281
When it dies down, I won't find my way back to you.

114
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:59,279
Did you understand?

115
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,278
Don't worry. We will find  him!

116
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,287
Don't go! I'm scared!

117
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,287
Me too. But don't worry.

118
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,278
We will find him.

119
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:23,279
Keep it burning and be careful.

120
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:36,280
I will go now.

121
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:48,283
Eva, I love you! Don't you forget that!

122
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,278
Benny! Can you hear me? 

123
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:26,280
Get over here! To the light!

124
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,278
Benny! If you can hear me, answer me!

125
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:32,284
Is there somebody there? Hello? Anybody?

126
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,278
Our jackets burned!

127
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:12,287
What have done? Are you too stupid to be careful?

128
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,287
Why did you leave!

129
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:17,279
If you had stayed, none this would have happened.

130
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:22,280
Eva! Eva! Don't run away!

131
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:31,287
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

132
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:34,287
It's all to much for me to bear.

133
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:37,279
You did your best.

134
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,278
Benny! 

135
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:10,287
Stay where you are!

136
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:15,281
Stay there!

137
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:19,279
Please, let my boy go.

138
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:27,281
I think it's him.
- Who?
The one I saw last night.

139
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,287
Where do you come from? Please let him go.

140
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:37,281
Why should we want to you any harm?

141
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:44,280
Thank you! Come here! 

142
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:55,284
You are freezing. Where have you been?

143
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:59,278
You can't simply run away.

144
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,278
Promise me you won't run away again.

145
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,278
Don't you want to stay?

146
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:16,276
Come on.

147
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:22,278
Where did you find Benny?

148
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,278
Won't you tell me?

149
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:38,280
Is there something wrong with you? Are you hurt? 

150
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:46,281
May I see it? I may be able to help you?

151
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:49,278
Are those sheep yours?

152
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:55,281
Tonight some sheep were close by. I could hear them scream.

153
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:59,279
Are you freezing? Give me the jacket? 
- Mom, he is not freezing.

154
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:06,281
Did you catch a cold? What is wrong with you, Benny?

155
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,278
What? 

156
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,279
Leave him be. He is just tired.

157
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,278
Do you have something to drink?

158
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:27,283
Can you spare some?
- What will I get in return?

159
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:34,278
What's your name?

160
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:41,279
It's no use being nice to me.

161
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,276
Why not?

162
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:49,276
I'm not a nice person is why

163
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,278
Did you always think of yourself as that?

164
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,287
What you are telling me...

165
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,279
is hard for me to believe.

166
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,278
Where do you come from? 

167
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,276
Why do you want to know?

168
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:30,279
Be fair. I helped you out, so you can should me.

169
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:45,284
Do you have jewellery? Or maybe a radio with batteries?

170
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,276
Why?

171
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:56,280
And that bike? 
- What's with the bike?

172
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:05,279
Did you cross the railway?
- Yes.

173
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:11,280
Was that far away from here?
- Three, maybe four hours.

174
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:21,281
There is a train station to the south. Trains are stopping there.

175
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,280
The personal is said to be corrupt.

176
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:17,279
Who did that?
- Who did what?

177
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,287
Died of thirst. Or it drank too much polluted water.

178
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:27,279
Or the Sheppard slaughtered them to drink their blood.

179
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:36,287
It was dogs.
- What dogs?

180
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,278
What dogs? What dogs? The dogs from the villages.

181
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,279
They don't have anything to eat.

182
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:48,281
That's a normal thing. They will anything they can find.

183
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,287
Shit.

184
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:57,281
Two day old. Full of maggots.

185
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,278
Let's go.

186
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:17,279
What are you doing?
- Eva. Come on.

187
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:21,279
Do you honestly believe you will last long with only one jacket?

188
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:27,287
I didn't even have a lighter.

189
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,279
And your lighter won't last forever, too.

190
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,276
Come on!

191
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,276
He doesn't need it any more.

192
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,278
Stop! Stop! 

193
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:48,287
Stop! Please! 

194
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:53,281
STOP! 

195
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:59,279
Stop! Wait for us!

196
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:05,281
Wait for us! 

197
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:06,278
Hello.

198
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:12,280
You can go inside, there are other people too.

199
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,276
Hello.

200
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:47,287
I am Anna Loren. These are my children Eva and Ben.

201
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,278
We are from the city.

202
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:58,279
Other people? I don't understand you...

203
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:08,280
Where are those other people? We didn't see anyone.

204
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:17,287
How many people stay here?
- He doesn't understand you.

205
00:37:17,287 --> 00:37:19,278
I know. Be quiet!

206
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,276
It's so cold in here.

207
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:44,278
May I start a fire?

208
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:18,279
Did the train stop here?

209
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:25,281
The train... Outside?

210
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,279
Did the train stop here?

211
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,287
Hello.

212
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:18,287
Where do you come from?

213
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,287
We are from the City.

214
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:24,280
I am Anna Loren. These are my children Eva and Ben.

215
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:31,287
Hello. My wife, my daughter.

216
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,278
What do you want here?

217
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,287
The boy tried to steal something... 

218
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:40,278
I see. Thank you.

219
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,279
I can't understand hoe you can stay so calm?

220
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,278
Did you steal something from me?

221
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:59,287
It's not so easy. The woman is right.

222
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,287
If we give up the most basic rules, we can give up anything.

223
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,287
What is it you could give up?

224
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:07,287
Are you the one in here to look after the order of things, Mr. Koslowski?

225
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:10,287
Why you? Because you carry a gun?

226
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,287
Do  you want to impress us?

227
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,278
Shut up.

228
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,287
Empty your bags.

229
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,278
Shall I take them away from you?

230
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:27,279
Let go of the boy!
- I told you to shut up!

231
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:31,287
Before you and your wife showed up here, we stuck to the rules.

232
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:36,287
Rules that are necessary for living together in a civilised manner.

233
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,287
You call this "civilised"?

234
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:42,287
The rules stay the way they are. They apply to you too! Understood?

235
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:46,280
If you don't like it, pack you wife and child an leave.

236
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,287
I told you to let go of the boy.

237
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:52,276
Do you want to get beat up?

238
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:57,287
Who do you think you are? Why is it you, that makes the rules?

239
00:40:57,287 --> 00:40:59,278
If you would...

240
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:05,287
Eva.

241
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:07,287
Please mom, let me go.

242
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:11,280
Don't you dare coming back! 
- Fuck off!

243
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:19,283
Please, let me talk to him.

244
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:37,281
Mom? Please? I'll be back.

245
00:41:58,287 --> 00:42:02,287
Honestly, you didn't steal anything?
- No! 

246
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:05,279
Then I'll tell them that.
- I don't care!

247
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:10,287
You don't want to go back, do you?
- I'll leave.

248
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,278
Don't come nay closer!  
- But your hand...

249
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,278
Does it still hurt?

250
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,287
How did that happen?

251
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,278
It doesn't matter, who cares?

252
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:31,280
Did you get in a fight? With whom?

253
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:36,280
Won't you tell me?
- No.

254
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:46,281
Please, don't go.

255
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:52,287
I prefer to be alone.
- I don't believe that.

256
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,279
Forget it. See you later.

257
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,287
Do you know what that is?

258
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:07,287
Those guys spectacles.
- But you...

259
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,287
I can use those to make a fire.

260
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,279
Your mother has a lighter.

261
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:18,280
Will you give them to me? I'll return them.

262
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:21,278
They will et you inside again.

263
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:24,278
You just don't get it.

264
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:43,278
Possibly the train will really stop here.

265
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:47,287
I'll stick around.

266
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:49,278
Would be stupid if I missed it.

267
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,287
Why don't you obey me?

268
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:03,287
I did come back, didn't I?

269
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:06,279
You have to do as you are told.
- Hah!

270
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,278
You won't hit me again.

271
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:31,278
Did you talk to him?

272
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:44,278
Can you spare a cigarette?

273
00:44:56,287 --> 00:44:58,278
Sure. There.

274
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,287
I don't have may left

275
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:14,281
Don't worry. Apart from us, no one is smoking here.

276
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:38,279
Are you from the city?
- Isn't that obvious?

277
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,278
Which district?  
- The 11th.

278
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:48,287
Are you here long?  
- So, Just six days.

279
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:53,287
And the others? 
- Some longer, some shorter.

280
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:57,280
Koslowski said, the last train pass ten days ago.

281
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:00,287
Did it stop?

282
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:03,279
Looks like it. Otherwise they would all still be here.

283
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:14,283
My name is Bea, but please call me "Be".
- I am Anna.

284
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:23,280
Do you want?
- Yes. Thank you.

285
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:49,280
Do you have anything you can swap?  
- What?

286
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:53,287
It depends. I don't know what counts.

287
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:55,278
I have some jewellery.

288
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:58,278
The bike is quite good.

289
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:04,287
Keep it as long as possible,... and the lighter too.
- My watch?

290
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:06,278
Useless.

291
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:12,279
And you?
- Me?

292
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,287
I don't have a thing. That? Don't mention it.

293
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:19,278
Koslowski can be paid in other ways.

294
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,278
Do you think he is one of the "just"?

295
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:25,287
Pardon?

296
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,287
It's hard to realise, even if you are fucking.

297
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:31,287
But he has complete control over all of us.

298
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:33,287
probably he is one of the "just".

299
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:36,279
At least it would be nice that way, wouldn't it?

300
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,279
What do you mean by "just"? 

301
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:44,287
Once, I knew one...

302
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:47,287
My friend Manfred was one of them.

303
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:51,280
You can't simply tell from looking, that's the funny part.

304
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,287
There are 36 altogether.

305
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:58,287
Since the beginning there were 36. Always.

306
00:47:58,287 --> 00:48:01,287
They guarantee our existence...

307
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,278
and that God protects us.

308
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:08,280
If only one of them is missing... everything will go.

309
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,279
Really? 
- Yes.

310
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:18,280
I'm not sure with Koslowski.

311
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:23,287
But now I am almost positive...

312
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:25,287
Where do you want to get it?

313
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:27,287
What does a winch cost? 
- It's up to you.

314
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:28,276
Please, excuse me.

315
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,287
Eva, what happened?

316
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,187
They can't stop the train because they can't move the wagons.

317
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:38,287


318
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,287
Listen. It's all quite simple.

319
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:45,280
If you want to leave here, we must force the train to stop.

320
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:50,280
If we used a roadblock it could derail.

321
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:56,281
Quiet! Listen to me!

322
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,287
We must move to wagons over to the right rail track.

323
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:06,287
So? What do you want to do? Everyone must contribute to this.

324
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:08,287
We cant use the winch outside, because it needs electricity to work.

325
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:10,287
I could try to get hold of a hand operated winch.

326
00:49:10,287 --> 00:49:13,287
But you must understand that it will cost you.

327
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:14,287
Does everybody understand that?

328
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:18,287
Make up your minds. And don't blame me for wanting to help you.

329
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:21,287
Quite the contrary, Mr. Koslowski. We love you for your selflessness.

330
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:24,287
Why do you have to stir things up all the time, Madame Brandt?

331
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:28,287
Nobody did invite you. Nobody forces you to stay.

332
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:32,287
When does the next train come? What, when there are no trains any more?

333
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:35,287
What, when others stop the train before us?

334
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,287
Don't you touch me! 

335
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,287
What if they don't take us, because we don't have anything to swap?

336
00:49:39,287 --> 00:49:43,287
All the time you want something for water, food and winches.

337
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:46,287
Do you have a better idea? Why don't you drive to the village...

338
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,287
I mean you no harm... 
- Quiet! 

339
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,280
Excuse me... Listen... Information of supplies.

340
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,279
In the north everything is under control.

341
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:08,280
Only few supplies from the south...

342
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:13,278
...increasing losses...

343
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:20,280
...only little diesel, little personal...

344
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:36,280
...little meat because of polluted water...

345
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:39,278
...cutting down rations...

346
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:51,278
...and the usual instructions for power saving.

347
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,276
Is that all?

348
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:56,287
Are you joking?

349
00:50:56,287 --> 00:51:00,287
Always the same! Probably someone else should be taking over radio duty.

350
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:01,287
You sounding like an oracle is frustrating!

351
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:03,287
I only tried to repeat the facts. I am sorry...

352
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:05,287
I am sorry.

353
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:07,278
Stop apologising!

354
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:10,287
How dare you say something like that?

355
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:15,287
My husband tries to report as accurately as possible.

356
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:17,287
And you insult him as a response! 

357
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:19,287
Have you all gone mad?

358
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:23,287
I don't want to sit there like her, because my husband was run over by a train.

359
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:24,287


360
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:28,280
I want to know, when we move on.
I don't want to waste more time. 

361
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:32,287
Don't you have any sympathy?
- Sympathy?

362
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:34,287
You are talking about sympathy? I can't afford any sympathy.

363
00:51:34,287 --> 00:51:37,287
I'm content with that puddle of blood outside.

364
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:40,279
You and you sympathy. Show this woman some of your sympathy!

365
00:51:46,287 --> 00:51:50,280
Shut up. Your praying makes me sick.

366
00:51:55,287 --> 00:51:57,278
I think we had enough! 

367
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:02,276
Thank you.

368
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,287
I'm sorry. I was in a rage.

369
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:13,280
Sure. I can understand that.

370
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:34,287
My dear husband was able to show us, how to behave.

371
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,287
Mr. Azoulay is the great news reporter again...

372
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,287
... and Mrs. Azoulay's honour has been restored.
- Stop.

373
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:42,287
And with a great gesture he put his shitty wife in her place.

374
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:46,280
You have enlightened me. Thank you!

375
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:50,287
Finished you performance?

376
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:53,287
Why doesn't he puke from being that self-content?

377
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:56,287
What do you say, Mr. Koslowski?

378
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,279
Instead of hitting you, he rather beats me.

379
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,279
It doesn't matter. He always has moral on his side.

380
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:07,278
Some day I'm gone kill you.

381
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,276
I hope that day comes soon.

382
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:16,279
Stop it. I can't stand it any more.

383
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:21,280
Please, stop it.

384
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:25,279
If only because of the children. Stop it.

385
00:53:28,287 --> 00:53:30,287
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

386
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:33,287
Rest assured that we are ashamed of ourselves.

387
00:53:33,287 --> 00:53:35,278
But you should be ashamed of yourself too.

388
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:40,279
Come... Let's be ashamed.

389
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:13,278
Did you realise they didn't bark?

390
00:57:18,287 --> 00:57:20,278
Yes. You're right. 

391
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:25,280
When they burned the cattle in the village, there was a whole pack.

392
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:28,287
None of them barked.

393
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:30,278
They are in all those towns.

394
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:34,287
Since they don't have food or water any more

395
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:36,278
they roam around.

396
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,279
They have become more careful.

397
00:57:44,287 --> 00:57:45,276
Mean.

398
00:57:47,287 --> 00:57:49,278
and why did you...
- Because I was stupid!

399
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:54,287
I lured one in using some meat.

400
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:56,278
He stayed with me.

401
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,278
Followed me, as if we were friends.

402
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:04,279
Two days before I met you, it bit me.

403
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:12,287
Why? 
- Why? Because it was mad.

404
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:14,278
Because it wanted some meat. What do I know?

405
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:23,281
Probably it was mad at me, because I couldn't feed it enough.

406
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:30,287
Doesn't matter. It's my on fault.

407
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:34,280
Wanting to have a mad dog a friend.

408
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:42,279
Where is it now?  
- I beat it to death.

409
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,278
And in doing so spilled all the burning ash.

410
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:08,278
What are you doing? 
- Nothing.

411
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:18,280
What are your plans now?
- Nothing. What is there to do?

412
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:28,279
Take it. I hope it's of some use.
- Hm.

413
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:35,281
Well... 

414
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:42,280
See you soon. I have to get back.

415
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:47,279
Aren't you freezing? 
- I'm used to it.

416
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:52,287
I don't know if I can be back tomorrow, but...

417
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:55,287
...if I come I will bring you some food.

418
00:59:55,287 --> 01:00:00,281
Mom did swap her jewellery...

419
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:06,281
... Koslowski has some good contacts in the village. He got me the ointment too.

420
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,278
Eva!

421
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:32,276
There.

422
01:00:48,287 --> 01:00:50,278
50 litres. Maximum.

423
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:54,287
Give me some water, please. Please.

424
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:57,287
Koslowski isn't giving us enough. We are six persons.

425
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,278
My husband, my sister and me can work.

426
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,287
We work harder than others and my child is sick.

427
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:05,287
I implore you.

428
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,287
Please. We don't have anything to swap.

429
01:01:08,287 --> 01:01:12,287
We only have what we are wearing.

430
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:14,287
You have to argue with him.
- No.

431
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:17,279
He doesn't give us any. Me has no mercy.

432
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:23,287
I implore you! I do anything you want. Do with me what you want.

433
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:25,278
Please stop. Don't cause trouble.

434
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,287
We can help you out, can't we?

435
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:31,287
Can't we discuss that later?
- No. Not later!

436
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,287
No! 

437
01:01:34,287 --> 01:01:37,279
Later, there will only be two glasses per person.

438
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:40,278
Please, give me some water!

439
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:46,287
I implore you! Otherwise you can beat me to death right here.

440
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,278
How much are ten litres?

441
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:52,287
A rich man? What do you have?

442
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:56,287
We don't have much. We are waiting for the train.

443
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:58,287
Don't you say!

444
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:00,278
I beg you! Don't go.

445
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:03,278
What would you give in exchange for a bike?

446
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:07,278
I don't really need a bike.

447
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:10,278
A watch?

448
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:17,287
Nice. You should have given that one up sooner.

449
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:19,278
Thanks. No more for you.

450
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:24,280
We have other customers to serve. Bye.

451
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:47,276
Dear Dad,

452
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:50,278
Now, that I have found a pen and paper...

453
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:53,278
I must write you.

454
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:59,280
So much is happening, and there is no one whom it could talk with.

455
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:05,287
I don't know, if you can see or hear or read this...

456
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:08,279
or if you are able to sense anything at all.

457
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:14,281
But I so much want to believe you can.

458
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:18,287
My dearest dad,

459
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:22,287
It's so hard, to put all this into words...

460
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:24,278
when there is no one to talk to...

461
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:27,278
it feels like I am suffocation on all this.

462
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:32,287
You might ask, why I don't talk to Benny or mom?

463
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:38,283
But I can't. You would know about it, if you were here.

464
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:43,287
I have to think about every word I say to mom,

465
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,278
because otherwise she will suffer breakdown.

466
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:49,279
Her hands are constantly shaking and I can't help her.

467
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:56,281
I don't think, that Benny could understand, what you can, dad.

468
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:59,278
An then there is this boy...

469
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:02,278
...I could talk to him.

470
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:07,287
But he acts so proud, and

471
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:09,278
as if he cares for nothing at all.

472
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:14,280
Even if I know that's not the case.

473
01:04:16,287 --> 01:04:18,278
It must seem very confusing to you.

474
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:23,280
But that's the main reason I write all this down.

475
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:28,280
I hope it makes more sense in writing.

476
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:32,287
I want to tell you one thing after another, 

477
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:35,279
so you can understand the life we are leading.

478
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:43,287
We get up early every morning.

479
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:46,287
Simply, because someone gets up early,

480
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:48,278
and wakes all the others.

481
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:52,279
We work every day...

482
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:19,284
Arina! The boy is dying! 

483
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:33,287
Where do you come from?
- Aren't you one of us?

484
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:37,280
Look out, dammit! 

485
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,279
Put the canisters below the roof? Look out.

486
01:09:09,287 --> 01:09:13,287
Behind the building there is a pool with rainwater...

487
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:18,287
...you can wash up with it, if you feel like it.

488
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,287
Hey! Excuse me. Those are our things.

489
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:25,287
What?
- This is our spot.

490
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:28,287
So what?
- Let's go outside.

491
01:09:28,287 --> 01:09:30,287
Move somewhere else!
- What does this make your spot?

492
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:35,287
Because the horses drink too much, we will slaughter three of them.

493
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:37,278
There will be fresh meat for all of us.

494
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:43,287
Excuse me.
- Yes?

495
01:09:43,287 --> 01:09:47,287
I wanted to ask, what you are doing here?
- Are you not one of our group?

496
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:49,287
We are waiting for the train.
- What train?

497
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:53,280
What are you doing here? Where do you want to go?
- Away, of course.

498
01:09:54,287 --> 01:09:55,276
Excuse me.

499
01:09:58,287 --> 01:10:01,287
The water was expensive. You can't simply take it.

500
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:03,278
I did understand that. So?
- What's going on?

501
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,287
Nothing. He is all fired up, because we take some of his water.

502
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:09,279
Are you the one who is responsible?
- Everyone here is responsible.

503
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,278
Suddenly it gets a little crowded.

504
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:17,287


505
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:20,287
Is he all mad again?
- Yes.

506
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:22,278
But is right.

507
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,287
How is your young friend?

508
01:10:28,287 --> 01:10:32,280
Did you see him again?
- Yes.

509
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:44,281
We should light another fire, if a train should come.

510
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,278
Otherwise the train will simply run by.

511
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,278
That would be really  bad.

512
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:56,287
If we started another fire,

513
01:10:56,287 --> 01:10:58,278
maybe the train brakes and stops.

514
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:00,276
Give it to me. Now look.

515
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:09,281
What's going on? What's going on?

516
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:16,276
Mh, tastes good.

517
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:21,279
Let's see how that razor-blade tastes.

518
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:30,278
Here. Give it a try.

519
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:37,287
Yes. You! Come on! 

520
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:40,279
Come on! Eat it! Don't be a sissy.

521
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:46,287
Hey. You don't even swallow!

522
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:50,287
Don't be a sissy!

523
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:54,287
You have to careful.

524
01:11:54,287 --> 01:11:56,287
Otherwise you cut yourself.

525
01:11:56,287 --> 01:11:58,278
Hey, come on... 

526
01:12:00,287 --> 01:12:02,287
I told you to get rid of the bike.

527
01:12:02,287 --> 01:12:04,278
Otherwise people will hurt themselves.

528
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,278
It has to go.

529
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:25,278
It's nothing.

530
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:05,280
Please. Some Milk.

531
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:12,278
Please? 

532
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:19,278
What? Am I daydreaming?

533
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:23,287
What do we have here?

534
01:13:23,287 --> 01:13:27,287
It's the Pollack from the village. Boy are we glad to see you.

535
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:31,287
The bastard that worked at Francois'.

536
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:33,287
And suddenly Francois was dead.

537
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:36,279
Just like that. And the Pollacks were gone.

538
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:40,279
Didn't think we would meet again so soon, eh?

539
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:56,280
You will look at me, when I'm talking to you, Pollack.

540
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:01,276
Wait. Leave them.

541
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:08,278
Pig! 

542
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:12,279
Bastard! 

543
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:44,280
Take this.
- Thank you.

544
01:15:47,287 --> 01:15:49,278


545
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:58,279
Mom.

546
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:53,279
What are you doing here?
- Leave me alone.

547
01:18:56,287 --> 01:18:59,279
With all these people, there will be something left over for me.

548
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:01,276
That's why I'm here.

549
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:08,278
What's with the goats? What do they get to drink?

550
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,278
Water, I guess.

551
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:18,287
No. You can't do that.

552
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,287
There are little children with the group!

553
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:22,287
The milk is for them. That's why they feed the goats.

554
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:23,276
If you...

555
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:32,278
Hey, wake up.

556
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:03,276
Mom!

557
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:08,287
I swear! I never saw that woman before.

558
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:11,287
No! Liar! That's a lie!

559
01:20:11,287 --> 01:20:14,287
Ask the children. They don't lie

560
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:16,287
I say it again! It's untrue!

561
01:20:16,287 --> 01:20:19,287
Ask my wife! We have never been in this area before.

562
01:20:19,287 --> 01:20:22,287
Leave him be!
- You bastard!

563
01:20:22,287 --> 01:20:25,287
Murderer! Pig! 

564
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:28,279
Let go of him!
- You bastard! 

565
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:32,278
Please be reasonable.

566
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:46,287
Listen. Everyone can see that the woman is not lying.

567
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:49,287
What can I say? It's absurd!

568
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,287
Everybody could accuse everyone.

569
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:55,287
What's going on?
- The woman says that the he shot her husband.

570
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:58,279
Where did that take place? 
- It's not true!

571
01:21:01,287 --> 01:21:03,287
What's going on? 

572
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,278
She says it has happened in their cottage.

573
01:21:06,287 --> 01:21:11,281
When? 
Some days ago.

574
01:21:13,287 --> 01:21:15,278
On Sunday.

575
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:18,287
The 17th.

576
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:21,279
Impossible! We still were in the city then.

577
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:24,278
My wife and the boy will state that too.

578
01:21:25,287 --> 01:21:29,287
Do you have proof?
- My husband is dead! He is dead.

579
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:32,279
You know that is no proof.
- But...

580
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:36,287
Ask my children. He is dead.

581
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:39,279
I'm sorry. I can't decide that now.

582
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:49,279
Please calm down. We will settle that all later.

583
01:22:16,287 --> 01:22:18,287
Put up the tarps. Hurry!

584
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:21,279
Please come inside. You're getting all wet.

585
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:27,276
Hurry. Come on.

586
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:32,278
Benny! Where is Benny? 

587
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:42,280
Ben! Benny! 

588
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:49,279
Ben! Benny! 

589
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:41,287
How would you decide?

590
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:43,278
You accuse each other. Correct?

591
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:46,287
Neither of you have proof.

592
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:49,287
Whom shall I believe?

593
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:52,287
I am n judge.

594
01:23:52,287 --> 01:23:56,280
My friends and I just try to keep chaos at bay. That's all.

595
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:02,276
I'm sorry.

596
01:24:10,287 --> 01:24:14,287
Probably one of your "just"?

597
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:17,287
Anyway, in Pont Monterre,

598
01:24:17,287 --> 01:24:20,287
I have seen one of them with my own eyes.

599
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:23,287
In the middle of the town square he undressed and leapt into the fire.

600
01:24:23,287 --> 01:24:27,280
Burning like a torch.

601
01:24:28,287 --> 01:24:33,287
I thought I couldn't believe my eyes?
- Don't tell such stories.

602
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:36,287
I'm serious. They will redeem us.

603
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:41,287
They are everywhere. Well "everywhere" is probably a bit exaggerated.

604
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:43,287
Everywhere where there are mad people.

605
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:47,280
In Pont Monterre. In Vogne.

606
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:52,280
They say in Arrieux there were several.

607
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:57,280
They jump in the flames all naked an burn to their deaths.

608
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:01,287
They sacrifice themselves for us.

609
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:04,287
So the damned world will be alright again.

610
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:08,280
I guess they are belong to your "just".

611
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:13,280
On the other hand... When they are of the "just"...

612
01:25:15,287 --> 01:25:17,287
Everybody that burns in the flames,

613
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:19,287
is one "just" less.

614
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:22,287
You said they were 36, didn't you?

615
01:25:22,287 --> 01:25:26,280
So the world can keep on turning.

616
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:31,287
So what does logic tell us?

617
01:25:31,287 --> 01:25:34,279
Your 36 are a different team.

618
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:53,279
Excuse me.         
- Yes? 

619
01:25:56,287 --> 01:25:59,279
Do you want some?
- No. No, thank you.

620
01:26:00,287 --> 01:26:08,285
What is it then?
- What was that music you played yesterday?

621
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:13,279
Did you like it? Sit down.

622
01:26:14,287 --> 01:26:16,278
Hold that.

623
01:26:21,287 --> 01:26:23,278
Glad you liked that music.

624
01:26:25,287 --> 01:26:27,278
Gimme.

625
01:26:28,287 --> 01:26:32,287
I forgot to pack some salt.

626
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:35,279
Now I have to swap two pair of socks for it.

627
01:26:37,287 --> 01:26:42,287
You would like to hear it again, wouldn't you?
- Yes. Please.

628
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:45,279
I rewound it with my finger.

629
01:26:46,287 --> 01:26:48,278
You have to do that too, understand?

630
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:22,278
Georges! Over here!

631
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:39,287
Get up! Get up you bastard.

632
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:42,287
What do you want?
- Shut up! 

633
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:44,287
Get outside, before I put a bullet in your head right here.

634
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:48,287
What's going on? What did my husband do? 

635
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:53,287
Shut up! 
- Did he commit a crime?

636
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:56,287
Let him go! Let him go
- What did he do?

637
01:29:56,287 --> 01:29:59,279
Are you insane? I asked you what he did to you.

638
01:30:01,287 --> 01:30:03,287
Listen, smart-ass! 

639
01:30:03,287 --> 01:30:05,287
It's none of your business, but anyway:

640
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:08,287
Your nice foreign buddy and his brood...

641
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:11,287
they steal everything they can get their hands on.

642
01:30:11,287 --> 01:30:14,287
And not only since we are here.

643
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:16,287
Ain't it so?

644
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:18,287
I know you, my dear fellow.

645
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:22,287
Back in my village he killed a farmer and stole his stuff.

646
01:30:22,287 --> 01:30:26,287
That's not true. I swear that's no true.

647
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:30,287
Certainly! You want to accuse me of killing that farmer? Filthy pig!

648
01:30:30,287 --> 01:30:33,287
None of that is true.

649
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:34,287
What's going on?

650
01:30:34,287 --> 01:30:37,279
Have you all gone mad?

651
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:43,287
I have been robbed. Meat, water and a goat are missing.

652
01:30:43,287 --> 01:30:46,287
We just found out. I'm sure he took it.

653
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:50,280
Since we are on our journey, no one ever stole anything from us.

654
01:30:51,287 --> 01:30:55,287
That's not true. My husband was here all night.

655
01:30:55,287 --> 01:30:58,279
Where should he out your goat. That's ridiculous!

656
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,287
You should have kept your eyes open.

657
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:05,287
Who was on night watch?

658
01:31:05,287 --> 01:31:09,287
Maybe Koslowski knows where the things have gone.

659
01:31:09,287 --> 01:31:13,287
That's too low. Do you want to accuse me?

660
01:31:13,287 --> 01:31:15,287
Maybe it was the boy.
- What boy?

661
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:19,280
She knows him. He stole some spectacles before.

662
01:31:26,287 --> 01:31:27,276
Why did you do that?

663
01:31:29,287 --> 01:31:31,287
I thought you would stick with us, when we travel on.

664
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:34,279
I never said that.
- Really?

665
01:31:35,287 --> 01:31:38,287
Great! So now everything is fine!

666
01:31:38,287 --> 01:31:41,287
Because of you they almost killed the foreign man.

667
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,279
They need the milk for their children.

668
01:31:45,287 --> 01:31:47,287
I don't find goats every day.

669
01:31:47,287 --> 01:31:49,278
You don't care what people say, do you?

670
01:31:52,287 --> 01:31:54,278
Don't you care about anyone?

671
01:31:55,287 --> 01:31:56,276
Generally no.

672
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:25,278
What is it? 

673
01:32:32,287 --> 01:32:34,278
I'm sorry! 

674
01:32:42,287 --> 01:32:46,280
The girl killed herself.

675
01:32:50,287 --> 01:32:52,278
Why? 

676
01:35:20,287 --> 01:35:25,281
I thought you could help me?
- With what?

677
01:35:27,287 --> 01:35:29,278
With everything.

678
01:35:31,287 --> 01:35:34,279
But you destroy everything.

679
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:38,276
Your dog...

680
01:35:55,287 --> 01:35:58,279
Now it works.
- You think that will fit?

681
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:12,280
Those are my daughters clothes. Maybe they fit your children.

682
01:36:15,287 --> 01:36:16,276
Thank you.

683
01:36:22,287 --> 01:36:24,278
Would you help me to bury my daughter?

684
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:29,280
I´m sorry. I can't do it on my own. It's too much.

685
01:38:11,287 --> 01:38:13,278
Ok. I'll make my round.

686
01:41:07,287 --> 01:41:14,284
What's going on? What are you doing there?

687
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:29,280
Are you mad? Are you completely insane?

688
01:41:30,287 --> 01:41:32,278
What are you doing?

689
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:35,287
Get over here, please. Please?

690
01:41:35,287 --> 01:41:38,287
I won't harm you. Come here.

691
01:41:38,287 --> 01:41:41,279
Please believe me. I won't harm you.

692
01:41:45,287 --> 01:41:48,279
The horses! The run into the flames.

693
01:41:51,287 --> 01:41:54,287
No!
- Calm down. Everything is alright.

694
01:41:54,287 --> 01:41:58,287
Let go of me!
- Stop it. Calm down. 

695
01:41:58,287 --> 01:42:02,287
Let go of me! Let go of me!

696
01:42:02,287 --> 01:42:07,281
Calm down! It's alright! 

697
01:42:11,287 --> 01:42:13,278
What in God's name did they tell you?

698
01:42:15,287 --> 01:42:17,278
You can't believe all those things they talk about.

699
01:42:23,287 --> 01:42:26,287
He's getting on our nerves too with his nonsense. 

700
01:42:26,287 --> 01:42:29,279
That razor-blade-idiot.

701
01:42:35,287 --> 01:42:38,287
Probably he believes in it himself.

702
01:42:38,287 --> 01:42:41,279
You got guts.

703
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:51,287
Tell me, where are your parents? 

704
01:42:51,287 --> 01:42:53,278
Where are they?

705
01:42:54,287 --> 01:42:57,279
Why do they let you run around at this time?

706
01:43:03,287 --> 01:43:05,278
You would have walked into the flames. That's for sure.

707
01:43:07,287 --> 01:43:10,287
But believe me, the fact that you wanted to...

708
01:43:10,287 --> 01:43:13,279
that's enough. You are brave.

709
01:43:20,287 --> 01:43:22,278
Everything will be alright.

710
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:30,287
Probably tomorrow a car arrives...

711
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:33,287
a fast racing-car, you know?

712
01:43:33,287 --> 01:43:37,280
You like those, don't you?

713
01:43:39,287 --> 01:43:43,280
And a man jumps out and tells that everything is alright again.

714
01:43:44,287 --> 01:43:48,287
And water runs into your mouth,

715
01:43:48,287 --> 01:43:51,279
and the doves fly. And maybe the dead come back to live.

716
01:43:57,287 --> 01:43:59,278
It's enough that you really wanted it.

717
01:44:02,287 --> 01:44:05,279
I'll tell everyone, how brave you are.

718
