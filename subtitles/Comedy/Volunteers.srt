1
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,032
And so, my fellow Americans,

2
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,866
ask not what your country
can do for you.

3
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:54,199
Ask what you can do
for your country.

4
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:02,165
Ask not what America
will do for you,

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,132
but what together we can do

6
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,199
for the freedom of man.

Very good, Lawrence.

42
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,332
If you'd like to crawl under the
table, I'll let you see my hold card.

43
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,900
- Cretin.
- Mmm… Smithy.

44
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,532
All right.

45
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,266
200, and…

46
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,165
Three… no,
no, no, no…

47
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,433
Let's make it an even 500.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,734
Is there an ashtray
around by any chance?

49
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,132
Your 500…

50
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,934
500 more.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,633
500…

52
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,899
And 1,090.

53
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,667
- Hmm.
- Wow

54
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,767
you better not
be bluffing, asshole.

55
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,799
I fold, god damn it.

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,899
- Ha!
- Come on.

57
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,866
Wonderful, wonderful.

58
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,566
I can't remember when I've sat
through anything so exciting.

59
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,399
- Uh-huh.
- Why don't we get the hell out of here?

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,766
Well, we might as well…
I've peaked.

61
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,866
Gentlemen, next time, my room.

62
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,532
Hey, wait a minute!

63
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,933
- What did you have?
- Oh, I forgot.

64
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,366
Fuck you! You fuckin'
understand what I'm saying?

65
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,666
- Just barely.
- I'm gonna carve you up in little pieces.

66
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,499
I'm gonna cut up
your momma and papa.

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,099
- I'm gonna cut up your relatives!
- You have a coat?

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,399
I'm gonna stick this up your ass! I'm
gonna open up a dog food factory

69
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,632
- and get rich off your meat!
- Two A.M., game's over.

70
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,366
- We were just leaving, Albert.
- Nobody bluffs this pro!

71
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,233
- Now that's enough.
- Squeeze it.

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,233
- You gonna be sorry you was ever born!
- Ciao.

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,966
- 2,200 in one hand.
- Not bad,

74
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,299
now you only owe me $14,000.

75
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,232
What the hell, Lawrence,
it's only money.

76
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,332
Graduation is tomorrow.

77
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,199
When do you plan to make good?

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,232
Albert, my only Italian friend,

79
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,699
by necessity, you
will have your money.

80
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,833
The Lakers are playing
the celtics tomorrow

81
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,232
for the championship,
last game of the season.

82
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,933
What say we bet
the entire 14 grand,

83
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,866
double or nothing?

84
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:23,466
You know, Lawrence,
I'm gonna miss you.

85
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,432
Ain't many underclassmen
with your style.

86
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,766
You run up a tab of 14
gs in one semester,

87
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:33,666
and now you stand to lose 28 gs…
Plus vig…

88
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,799
- Albert, it's a lock.
- Yeah…

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,766
Who's a lock?

90
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,166
I don't know.
Let's see…

91
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,265
Lakers, and two points.

92
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:47,666
How do I know you are
good for it if you lose?

93
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,499
God forbid…

94
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,666
That'd be one for my diary.

95
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,466
Albert, please…

96
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:57,132
Lawrence Bourne III,
son of Lawrence Bourne, Jr.,

97
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,766
textiles, lumber, paper, we're the
family that owns the state of Maine,

98
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,466
- so fear not.
- I'm bored now.

99
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,399
Yes, of course, lambchop…
Have to hurry, Albert,

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,899
- I think she's losing the mood.
- All right, L.A. plus two.

101
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,199
But if they lose,

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,265
you've got just the day
to come up with 28 big ones.

103
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:18,332
A sure thing.

104
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,999
Oh god!

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,666
Again, again,
don't stop! Don't stop!

106
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,532
Come on already, Bourne.

107
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,199
Now, now, now!

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,566
- Now, now, now!
- No, not yet!

109
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,933
Now, god damn it!

110
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,333
I'm awfully sorry, Lawrence,
but it's after 8:00.

111
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,799
Oh, really?
Well…

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,934
We'd better get down to the
actual sex then, bootsy.

113
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,232
Who is this cutie?

114
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,833
This is my roommate,
Kent sutcliffe.

115
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,165
Kent sutcliffe, bootsy weidner.
Bootsy weidner, Kent sutcliffe

116
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,466
- All of this junk is Kent's.
- Where are you going?

117
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,999
- The peace corps?
- That's right.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,999
I was joking.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,132
No, my roomie's joined up.

120
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,599
He's off to expose the
less-privileged of the world

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,900
- to self-styling adorn.
- Really?

122
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,833
Well…

123
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,733
When do we start?

124
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,399
I'm leaving tonight,
11:00 P.M…

125
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,966
Idlewild. Some people are
coming to see me off.

126
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:53,366
And some people are having dinner
with their parents. I'm sorry, Kent.

127
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,466
If it's any consolation,
though, I am planning

128
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,466
to learn how to spell Thailand.

129
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,366
Thailand…

130
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,532
It does sound like such fun.

131
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,399
Bootsy enjoys
the idea of working

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,466
with sweaty young men
from distant lands.

133
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:08,499
Graduation breakfast
is at 9:00, Lawrence.

134
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Shit, my speech.

135
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,799
My speech…

136
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,632
Christ, I don't even
have a theme yet.

137
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm valedictorian at Smith.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,099
Oh my god.

139
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,499
It is our responsibility today

140
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,999
to live in our own world,
and to identify the needs…

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,332
The din in Boston
garden is unbelievable.

142
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,299
It's a 107-105 game.
The Boston celtics lead.

143
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,399
But here come the Lakers. Down
the middle comes Tommy Hawkins.

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,265
…Between the wrong
people, while the real problems

145
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:51,566
of our times grow and multiply,
fertilized by our neglect.

146
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,933
- There is a… - dribbling down the
floor, takes it in to bill Russell.

147
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:58,032
He turns to his left and he is
fouled as he tries to shoot.

148
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:02,666
Hello darling, wherever you are.

149
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,933
The second one is good. And we've
got a 108-107 Boston lead.

150
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,733
The Lakers, with only seconds
remaining, come down the floor.

151
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,265
They feed the ball to their
great captain, Elgin baylor.

152
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,366
He takes a three-bounce dribble. He's
in the air. He fires a 32-footer,

153
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:17,733
a desperation shot.
It is… no good!

154
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,866
The celtics get the rebound…
Down the floor…

155
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:22,833
…superior
vitality, and strength…

156
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,199
…and he
banks it up and in.

157
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,299
It's 110-107, the celtics.

158
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,165
The Lakers have been defeated
by the world champion

159
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,466
Boston celtics.
The final score:

160
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,899
Boston, 110;
Los Angeles, 107.

161
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,966
What a basketball game, fans…

162
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,933
Now, the 1962 candidates

163
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:42,132
for graduation.

164
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,567
Benjamin Norman
Andrews, Jr.,

165
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,700
Peter cardin-

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,599
crystal hope brobagos.

167
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,633
Lawrence dautrey Bourne III,

168
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,532
Nicholas cowen,

169
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:07,233
Joan Chester-carr,

170
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,733
rich Louie diggot…

171
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:15,432
Mr. b said you got
until this evening.

172
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,499
So I ain't gonna
fuck with you here.

173
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,099
But after dark, cool breeze,

174
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,966
your ass belongs to me.

175
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,934
Don't go away. I want you
to sign my yearbook.

176
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,633
…richard Allen arrington.

177
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,065
To my sister's boy,

178
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,332
my father's grandson,

179
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,165
and my favorite nephew.

180
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,833
The eighth generation

181
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,132
to live in this lovely house

182
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,499
and to be graduated from Yale.

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,599
- To Lawrence.
- Hear, hear.

184
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,032
Very nice, thank you,
aunt eunice, excellent.

185
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,265
Could we have a little chat?

186
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,533
I could use
some fatherly advice.

187
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,233
From me?

188
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,165
When was the last time
we did this sort of thing?

189
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,700
Never, we're breaking new wind.

190
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,432
Well?

191
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,366
Lawrence, how have things
been for the last four years?

192
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:20,699
Fine. I need $28,000 to
pay off a gambling debt

193
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,666
or else I'm a dead man.

194
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,766
Don't worry, though, it'll
never happen again.

195
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,833
- $28,000?
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,265
That doesn't
surprise me very much.

197
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:34,032
You've been a constant
source of embarrassment,

198
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,899
irritation, ever since
your mother and I

199
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,833
brought you home that day
from the orphanage.

200
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,733
Orphanage? Father, I am not adopted.
I am your son.

201
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,532
I know, I know, but please
allow me that little fantasy.

202
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,165
I need the money.

203
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,366
No, not ever.

204
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,366
You're going to have to learn
to be responsible for yourself

205
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,734
and to others. This is an
ideal step in that direction.

206
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,265
See, they're coming
to break my hips, father.

207
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,699
Son, in the years to come,

208
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,000
you'll thank me
for the gift of self-reliance.

209
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,332
And in the meantime,
if that should come to pass,

210
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,366
you'll simply
have to learn to…

211
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:19,499
Use one of those…
What do they call them?

212
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,734
- A Walker.
- Lawrence, dad…

213
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,666
You don't seem to understand.
I have nowhere else to turn,

214
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,966
if I don't give them 28
grand by midnight tonight,

215
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,599
- they're going to beat the crap out of me.
- You know what upset me

216
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,199
- - About
the graduation ceremonies?

217
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,232
Was how tacky the university
grounds looked.

218
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,132
The lawns looked as if they needed to
be seeded, trees weren't as ancestral.

219
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,799
I don't suppose this
occurred to you, did it?

220
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,999
You are a true peckerhead.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,399
There's a gentleman here
to see Lawrence III.

222
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,632
- A Mr. Cicero.
- He's here for the money.

223
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,133
Well, he's not going to get it.

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,833
Mr. Cicero,
Mr. Lawrence Bourne, Jr.

225
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,866
Good evening.

226
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,099
I'm sorry you've had to
drive all the way up here,

227
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,366
but I'm sure we can
conclude these matters

228
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:10,065
really very quickly.
What do you say to…

229
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,132
4% interest?

230
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,532
For five years, and let's say

231
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,766
a down payment of $5,000,

232
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,166
which I am quite sure that Lawrence
can get to you within the week.

233
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,999
Out of my way, you peckerhead.

234
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,265
Sutcliffe!

235
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,432
- Kent!
- Lawrence!

236
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,933
Thank god I'm not at Yale, Kent.

237
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,099
You made it!
You actually made it.

238
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,632
- I knew you would.
- I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

239
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,632
And on that, I have a
special favor to ask.

240
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,833
- Sure, but I've only a minute.
- All the better then.

241
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,799
Kent, old pal, I'd rather take
your place on this old plane.

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,265
- What?
- Some very dangerous and primitive people

243
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,566
are after me, and I have no
money and nowhere to run.

244
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,599
You're my last chance,
believe me.

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,232
Next. Come on,
let's move it.

246
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:42,032
- I'm serious.
- You are.

247
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,899
Lawrence, you can't.
This is the peace corps,

248
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,799
the most important
decision of my life.

249
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,632
Traveling halfway around the world
to help a bunch of half-starved

250
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:51,766
- oppressed human beings.
- Well, here's the thing, Kent, old pal.

251
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,032
- I'm going to die.
- I've been through training.

252
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,199
- The government is involved.
- All the more reason to expect mistakes.

253
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,532
- But my name is on the list.
- I'll wire my father.

254
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,999
- He'll straighten the thing out.
- What'll happen to me?

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,632
Nothing! Nothing. And when the
heat is off, I'll be back

256
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,999
with some tropical, parasitic
disease that might have been yours.

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,165
Kent!

258
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,466
- Okay.
- Ha ha!

259
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,833
- But on a couple of conditions.
- Name it.

260
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,899
- Next, move it, gentlemen.
- What? Anything in the world.

261
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,432
- Bootsy weidner.
- Bootsy weidner?

262
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:23,132
Fine, have her.
Everyone else has.

263
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,666
- And your car.
- My car? You shit!

264
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,266
Not just the keys, I want the
registration signed over.

265
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,399
I didn't think
you had it in you.

266
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,332
- - You're
a douchebag, sutcliffe.

267
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,099
- My hat is off to you.
- Come on, gentlemen, let's move it.

268
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,734
Well, good luck, Kent.

269
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,632
- Come on, sutcliffe, you're holding up the parade.
- So long, kiddo.

270
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,966
Pan am flight 29,
you are cleared for takeoff.

271
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,166
Runway five…

272
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,233
Hey!

273
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,065
I'm gonna slice off your face
and use it for a dartboard.

274
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,166
Fuck you!

275
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,032
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you and your mother

276
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,834
and your father, and your kids,

277
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,933
Pan am 29 air, be advised

278
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:21,199
there is a person or persons
attached to your aircraft.

279
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,699
Roger.

280
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,633
- Okay, you're clear.
- Roger.

281
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,533
…Backs and tray tables
are in ful upright positions.

282
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,566
<i>♪ Michael, row the boat ashore ♪</i>

283
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:41,065
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

284
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,366
<i>♪ Michael, row the boat ashore ♪</i>

285
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,499
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

286
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,265
<i>♪ sister, help to trim
the sails ♪</i>

287
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,700
- <i>♪ Hallelujah… ♪</i>
- So this is hell.

288
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,999
Sorry.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,232
It's been a hell of a day,
and if you don't mind,

290
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,699
I'd just as soon sleep
through this whole thing.

291
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,667
- That's a good man.
- No problem.

292
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,332
No turning back now, huh?

293
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,934
No, siree.

294
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,866
Yeah, two years or bust.

295
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:31,366
Tom tuttle, Tacoma, Washington.

296
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,599
- Lawrence Bourne III.
- Hi, Larry.

297
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,866
What's your specialty?
Mine's engineering.

298
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,632
Washington state, 3.95,
but summa cum laude.

299
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,966
I've also dabbled extensively
in a relatively new field…

300
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:45,265
Psychological and motivational management.
You ever heard of it?

301
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,599
Not many people have, really.

302
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,265
In a nutshell, it teaches you
to manipulate human behavior

303
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,599
to achieve maximum productivity.

304
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,232
I'm the first expert on it
in peace corps history.

305
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,532
The higher ups have got
a lot of hope for it.

306
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,032
A challenge?
You bet it is.

307
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,566
But I'm ready for it.
You know, I was president

308
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,532
of the engineers club,

309
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,566
treasurer of the honor society,

310
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,466
then, of course,
I was youth of the year

311
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,366
in Tacoma, twice.

312
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,432
- Stewardess?
- I was public works chairman

313
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,866
- stewardess?
- For a while, with the boys' state…

314
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,733
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I need to send

315
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:20,733
a telegram, right now,
this instant.

316
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,599
- A telegram…
- When I got out of school,

317
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,099
- I could relay something
to the captain - there was

318
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,299
- he could pass it along.
- Nothing there to test me.

319
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,933
- That's
when I looked to the peace corps.

320
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:33,165
- I liked what I saw.
- To Lawrence Bourne, Jr. number one, Bourne Lane,

321
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,866
- imagine changing peoples' lives.
- Darien, Connecticut.

322
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,833
Lawrence, have made grave error.

323
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,499
Have joined peace corps
and gone to Thailand.

324
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,132
Please arrange
for my immediate return.

325
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,099
Your loving son,
blah, blah, blah…

326
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,899
- Lawrence.
- Are you sure about this?

327
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,299
Do I look like I'm associated
with this hootenanny?

328
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,032
Okay.

329
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,966
Thank you.

330
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,966
And when you come back,

331
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,266
bring me anything with alcohol.

332
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,633
Let's not pull any punches.

333
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,265
We're both men, right?

334
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:21,432
We're both adults.

335
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,399
Let's just say it.

336
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,399
You're scared.

337
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,666
And you've got a
perfect right to be.

338
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,999
Albert spear once said,

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,733
"fear is
victory's fuel."

340
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,733
You spend a few years
with me, pal,

341
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,499
and we're gonna turn
that fear into high octane.

It may not be one of the
seven wonders of the world,

354
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,966
but it sure is in the
Tom tuttle top 10.

Trough kind of things.

Roman urinal? Let me show you.

357

Fascinating things.

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,866
There were dozens
of them. What they did,

359
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,399
was they built them for midgets.

- Good morning.

372
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:09,466
- Oh, I'm sorry…
- Oh, it's no, no… it's no problem at all.

373
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:12,500
We're all here to lean on
each other, aren't we?

374
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,866
Kent sutcliffe?

375
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,099
Kent?
I'm Beth Wexler.

376
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,099
Beth! Beth Wexler,
yes, yes…

377
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,165
- Of course…
- Well, you don't know me.

378
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,866
- Do you know me?
- I know the name,

379
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:27,566
we're gonna be stationed together…
Loong ta?

380
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,666
Oh, Beth Wexler,

381
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,632
oh, yes, of course, I'm sorry.

382
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:36,032
You know, what with finals
and then graduation,

383
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,165
and my brother
dying so tragically…

384
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,265
Oh my god, oh, I'm so sorry.

385
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,632
Yes, well, he lived
that kind of life,

386
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,999
you know, fast cars,
fast times. It was…

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,100
Inevitable, I guess. I'm just so glad
to have the whole thing behind me.

388
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,366
Kent sutcliffe.

389
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,432
Beth Wexler.

390
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:59,332
- I gotta tell you…
- What?

391
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,666
You're completely different from the
way I pictured you in your bio.

392
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,032
- Oh, really? How so?
- I don't know.

393
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,032
A soil science volunteer,

394
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,366
hometown, canton, Ohio.

395
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,432
I just sort of pictured this…

396
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,833
Sweet-natured
doofus.

397
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,799
Beautiful tuxedo you're wearing.

398
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,232
- Dinner jacket.
- Oh.

399
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:21,432
- I hope you didn't rent it.
- No, no.

400
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,299
The folks threw me sort of a…

401
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,099
Graduation-slash-
good-luck-in-saving-the-world party.

402
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,999
I come from that kind of money,

403
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,532
something I wish you would overlook.
Now, if memory serves me correctly,

404
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,432
you are from…

405
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:37,466
- Long island.
- Long island,

406
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,065
- long island university, right?
- Right.

407
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,432
Say, were you as fed up with the
bullshit of college life as I was?

408
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:46,466
Yeah. I made
some good friends,

409
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,032
- but I felt that…
- I have to tell you, I feel so good

410
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,466
about what it is we're doing here,
without sounding incredibly corny,

411
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,532
but it is amazing.
I mean, here we are,

412
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,666
traveling halfway
around the world

413
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,032
to help out a bunch of half-starved
and oppressed human beings,

414
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,999
I mean, I am right there,
you know what I mean?

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,699
- Exactly.
- Passengers: <i>♪ If I had a hammer ♪</i>

416
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,065
<i>♪ I'd hammer in the morning ♪</i>

417
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:11,065
- <i>♪ I'd hammer in the evening… ♪</i>
- WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,799
please make sure your seatbelts
are securely fastened.

419
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,032
We will be landing in Bangkok
in approximately seven minutes.

420
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,933
Bangkok already.

421
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,733
Well, we've been talking now

422
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:24,300
for… oh my,
10 hours, 22 minutes.

423
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,232
Kent…

424
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,532
I'm really lucky to be
assigned with you.

425
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,532
You know, Beth,

426
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,733
we're going to be awfully
busy once we get to…

427
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:38,065
- Loong ta.
- Loong ta, yes, of course.

428
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:40,065
What say we…
You and I

429
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,866
take the first night out
just for ourselves, huh?

430
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,532
A bit of dinner,
maybe a few drinks,

431
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:48,299
and then see a little
bit of the city, huh?

432
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,100
There really is only one
thing we haven't shared.

433
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:58,433
Very funny.

434
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,633
Thank you just the same.

435
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,999
Beth, now we've been
moony-eyed since Istanbul,

436
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,866
why fight it?

437
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,332
Kent, why are you doing this?

438
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,666
I thought we were
becoming friends.

439
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,632
Well, this is what I do
with my friends.

440
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,466
You mean, you've just been
trying to go to bed with me?

441
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,567
Well, I think I've put
in the hours, don't you?

442
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,499
You are the most crass,

443
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,232
arrogant human being I have
ever met in my life!

444
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,499
Hold that thought for
just one minute. Tammy!

445
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,432
Tammy…

446
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:42,332
How would you like to see a bit of
Bangkok with me this evening…

447
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,132
Have a little dinner, maybe a
few drinks, then who knows?

448
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:48,566
- Oh my god!
- I'd love to, Lawrence, but I'm engaged.

449
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,867
Come on, Larry,
let's get a move on it.

450
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,265
- Lawrence?
- Oh, I didn't tell you, did I?

451
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,332
Lawrence Bourne III.

452
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,299
You see, Kent and I
had to change places,

453
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,666
nasty matter of a
large-scale gambling debt…

454
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,299
By the way, you were
right about him,

455
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,332
oh…

456
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,399
Just get out of my way,

457
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,033
you… you Ivy league…
Schlemiel!

458
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,499
I think you're taking
the narrow view.

459
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,399
But, I guess
I should've known…

460
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,466
Just another
sexually-repressed,

461
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,399
guilt-ridden
Jewish maid,

462
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,799
running off to hide in the peace
corps so she won't have to face men.

463
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,799
Oh!

464
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,632
What did I say?

465
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,766
Augustus Clay, Betty
cronk, -

466
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,833
Steve Jones,

467
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,532
rozie rousse, Betty cronk,

468
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:41,199
I want you kids to stow your
gear to the rear of the air…

469
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,165
Aircraft.

470
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,132
Hello.

471
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,799
Welcome to thaild.

472
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,899
- What?
- Welcome?

473
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,866
I'm John Reynolds, with the
American agriculture mission.

474
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,799
I help out
with the new arrivals.

475
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,599
- Welcome to Bangkok.
- Thank you.

476
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,999
- I'm with the peace corps, Beth.
- Beth Wexler.

477
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,265
- Right.
- You've come a long way from home, Beth.

478
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,967
The least I could do
is know your name.

479
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,233
Come on, sugar.

480
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,799
Oh! Jesus h. Christ,

481
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,233
we must be a mile from the sun.

482
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:45,867
Pardon me.

483
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:53,866
Excuse me. I'm just
going by height of course,

484
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:57,065
- but, are you in charge here?
- Yes, John Reynolds.

485
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,933
Lawrence Bourne III, Johnny.

486
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:02,733
- Bourne, I've got a telegram for you.
- Hmm.

487
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,399
- Last chance.
- Over my dead body.

488
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,232
Interesting.

489
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:10,232
You must have some friends in
pretty high places, Bourne.

490
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:13,366
Well, we do consider
Washington our general store.

491
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:16,899
Damndest thing I ever saw…
training waived, location approval.

492
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,100
Just like that, you're
officially in the peace corps.

493
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,433
Beth.

494
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,833
Hey! John,

495
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,265
John, John,

496
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,132
this is ridiculous,

497
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:36,265
really, I am obviously
not of peace corps fiber.

498
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:39,065
It's not that I can't
help these people,

499
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,100
it's just that I don't want to.

500
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,566
Looking at you, I think two years
in loong ta might do you some good.

501
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,933
Hi, Tom tuttle from
Tacoma, Washington.

502
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,199
- Ere do we saddle up for loong ta?
- He's going, too?

503
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,799
- Hey, Larry.
- I'll be taking you all by chopper.

504
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,833
Chopper, holy cow! I call
shotgun on this one.

505
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,032
I got dibbs on that,
Larry, sorry.

506
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,265
- Tom tuttle, Tacoma, Washington.
- Hi, Beth.

507
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:03,366
- Are you going to loong ta?
- Loong ta? I'll give you a hand over here.

508
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,632
- That's great!
- I'm stationed with him?

509
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,567
John, for what I'm about to
do, you should be ashamed.

510
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,966
I'd like to go home, please?

511
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:18,033
Please, can I go home? Just let me go home.
Can I go home?

512
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,466
Loong ta is one of the
most primitive villages

513
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,566
in the golden triangle. If we
get a bridge across that river,

514
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,599
it'd change
the villagers' life 100 fold.

515
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,699
We want you three to concentrate
on the building of that bridge.

516
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,599
Tom will obviously
be in charge of that.

517
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,599
You'll also find we've
laid in all the equipment

518
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,899
you'll need for the job…
Cables, saws,

519
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,132
axes, blueprints…
You name it.

520
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,999
Is this on?

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,934
In a week, I'll have that
town running like Pittsburgh.

522
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,432
Now, the jungle's pretty dense.

523
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:57,399
I wouldn't wander too far from the
village, there's commie guerrillas nearby.

524
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,933
You'll also hear talk about
an old Chinese warlord-

525
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:02,466
black marketeer, who runs
the whole upper river.

526
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,999
We better not
take any chances, then.

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,366
We'll run up an American flag.
That ought to scare them.

528
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:12,400
You're just gonna
have to rely on each other.

529
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,934
Go peace corps, go!

530
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,065
Oh, what lovely flowers!

531
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:51,966
- Opium poppies.
- Poppies.

532
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,500
Poppies.

533
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,632
Well, hello.

534
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:14,132
Hello. Hello, there.

535
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,766
Yes, yes, Lawrence Bourne III.

536
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:20,132
I whistle a happy tune,
so let me entertain you, huh?

537
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,532
That's right, that's right.
Rich American, huh?

538
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:27,132
Yale, 1962. I bet
you're impressed, aren't you?

539
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,700
Hello, hello.

540
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,866
There you are.
Yes, very good.

541
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:36,400
Say, listen, how were the
crops this year, huh?

542
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,000
Good rainy season, eh?
Plenty of moisture?

543
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,500
We're now approaching the
ceremonial gates to the village.

544
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,934
This is al po. He is
the elder of loong ta.

545
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:17,232
Oh, he's… oh my god,
he's blind!

546
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:20,332
Well, we're too late to help him.
Maybe the next generation.

547
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,232
Helen Keller was once asked

548
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:27,366
whether she'd rather have her
hearing or her sight restored.

549
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,332
She said her hearing,

550
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,366
'cause being deaf is so lonely.

551
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,232
You're one
lucky guy. Yes, you.

552
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:39,132
Wow, he looks so wise, so old.

553
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,733
He's probably 30.

554
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:42,699
Let me tell you this.
In his whole life,

555
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,966
he never set foot on the
other side of that river.

556
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,566
We've gotta build
that bridge, then,

557
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,966
- if for no other reason.
- Everything's taken care of here.

558
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,332
They've even prepared a
couple of huts for you.

559
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,833
Other than that,
you're on your own.

560
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,799
- You're not going right now, are you?
- I'll be back in a month.

561
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,666
My work is done here…
Or maybe sooner.

562
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,265
If y'all need me,
you got the radio.

563
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:06,065
Until then, vaya con dios.

564
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,500
Goodbye!

565
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:13,266
We're gonna miss
his wit around here.

566
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,734
Look out, loong
ta, here we come.

567
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,666
Well, honey, we're home.

568
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,467
Oh, please.

569
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,332
Well, hello there.

570
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,232
Well, now whom do you know, huh?

571
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,566
This is the nicest hut in town.

572
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,132
Oh, river exposure, huh?

573
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,299
A view of the swamp.

574
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,199
Tuttle and I are in it.

575
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,532
- I'm busy.
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:09,399
I can see. I'm the main attraction
from 5:00 to 7:00 tonight.

577
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,432
Beth…

578
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,432
I am not going to apologize

579
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,933
for trying to make you. I
do have my principles,

580
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,799
but, I guess…

581
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,599
I was just a tad deceitful,

582
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,232
and, in that case, I do deserve
a firm slap on the wrist.

583
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,132
Lawrence, if I
accept your apology,

584
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,265
that's also accepting
the fact that you're here.

585
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,432
I don't plan to do that.

586
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,799
It's a small village, but, if we're
lucky, we'll keep missing each other.

587
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,399
And maybe I'll have dinner
with you on the plane home.

588
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,132
Spunk.

589
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,700
Coffee.

590
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,766
Oh, yes…

591
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,899
Thailand.

592
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:30,065
All right,
quiet down, quiet down, please.

593
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,632
Quiet down, settle everyone.

594
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:36,632
Good morning, good morning.

595
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,065
I am Tom tuttle.

596
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,032
Tom tuttle.

597
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,299
Tom tuttle.

598
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,032
Good. We…

599
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:48,265
Will build…

600
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,232
A bridge…

601
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,332
Bridge.

602
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,299
Bridge…
build bridge..

603
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,933
Blidge.

604
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:59,299
Bridge, good.
All right,

605
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,833
this is good.
Now, we're going to use

606
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:05,933
that wood there, the teakwood there.

607
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,432
Yes. No, no, it's good wood.

608
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,332
That… listen to me…

609
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,399
That is very good wood.

610
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,399
And we will chop,
op, chop the wood.

611
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,599
Where are you going?

612
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,666
Where are you…
Come back here.

613
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,733
I have not dismissed you yet.

614
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,699
The…

615
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,132
The psychological motivation
course you took…

616
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:37,099
Did you find that on the
back of a matchbook cover?

617
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,165
I don't understand it.

618
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,366
I explained the bridge,
everything was a-okay.

619
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:44,666
Then I mentioned the teakwood we'd be
using and they went heathen on me.

620
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,733
The problem is
you're an asshole.

621
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:49,265
All right, let's not get personal.
Who said that?

622
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,265
It should've been me.

623
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,532
You're an asshole,
peace corps guy.

624
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,532
You can't cut down those trees.

625
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:58,466
They're sacred. The spirit
that guards the village

626
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,499
live in those trees.

627
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,499
Don't they teach you nothing?

628
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,366
He might be just
a marvelous mimic.

629
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,032
You speak english?

630
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,032
As good as him.

631
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,999
You better pick
another set of trees,

632
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,199
'cause no one touches
those, champ.

633
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,767
- Champ?
- Champ?

634
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,632
- Who are you?
- I'm at toon.

635
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,699
I spent four years in
American school in Bangkok,

636
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,032
I'm the sharpest thing
this village ever seen,

637
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,866
so they sent me.

638
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:32,032
Big deal.

639
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,899
- Less headaches here.
- Astonishing.

640
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,699
Believe it, hot rod.

641
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,399
That wood is teak wood.

642
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,232
- Yeah?
- The strongest fiber we can find.

643
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:46,432
If we can finish
building this bridge,

644
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:49,866
you won't need to worry
about spirits, little man.

645
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,999
Why do you guys
think you can come here

646
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,099
and turn everything upside down?

647
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,299
This is not American city

648
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,666
where you put up
an empire state building

649
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,566
over a weekend, you know?

650
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,499
We have a certain way
of doing things here.

651
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,432
We don't rush, rush, rush.

652
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:14,199
These are my kind of people.

653
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,299
All right, there's some wood over
there that looks fairly sturdy.

654
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,165
All right!
All of you! Yo!

655
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:26,132
Speak english!

656
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,967
More walking, less talking.

657
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,233
At!

658
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,734
Lawrence Bourne III,
ugly American.

659
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,266
You, I like.
He'll be awhile.

660
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
You smoke?

661
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,632
This wouldn't be the dung

662
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,033
of one of your
ancestors, now would it?

663
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,232
Hello.

664
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,933
It's okay, it's okay.

665
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:33,499
Now, I take the four aces,

666
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,065
and put them back in the
middle of the deck.

667
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,165
Where do they go,
you ask? Well,

668
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:41,132
watch.

669
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,065
Where are the aces, you ask?

670
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,899
Well…
Ace, Ace, Ace, Ace.

671
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,532
Ahh.

672
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,699
Thank you. I'd like
to thank lady bertrand Russell

673
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,165
for teaching me that trick as
well as one or two others.

674

This is perfect.

00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,532
This is what
you build Bridges of.

685
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,632
I like this.

686
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:37,767
I like this.

687
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,432
You're a big kitty-cat.

688
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:51,566
Yes, you are.

689
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,933
Oh, what a big cat.

690
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:02,433
See? Friend.

691
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,834
Look. A big mouse.

692
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,232
Very nice here.

693
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,733
Good, good kitty.

694
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,132
Okay, baby.

695
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,265
Shh, shh, shh.

696
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:29,532
Okay, 'atta babe.

697
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,666
Stay there. Yes,
you a big cat.

698
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,766
You…

699
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:41,133
Damn! Trapped in a
tiger trap by a tiger.

700
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,333
This could be a setback.

701
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:06,432
Boy, am I glad to see you.

702
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:09,600
Tom tuttle, from Tacoma,
Washington, pleased to meet you.

703
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,599
All right, gentlemen.

704
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,566
It is my deal;
Blackjack is the game.

705
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,399
Place your bets.

706
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,699
Guys, wait.
Take it easy now.

707
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,000
We have all night.

708
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,966
All right, here we go.

709
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:35,266
All right.
Who needs a card?

710
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,499
No one? Well, dealer pulls… ho!
20.

711
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,232
Mighty tough to beat. Let's
see what we have here.

712
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,232
Blackjack! A winner,
Blackjack, a winner.

713
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,499
Blackjack, a winner,
Blackjack…

714
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,132
Blackjack…

715
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:55,733
What's going on here?

716
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,032
We learn fast in this town.

717
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:00,165
You owe me.

718
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,367
All right, back, back, back…

719
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:10,065
Double or nothing,
redeal, come on.

720
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,866
Come on, come on.

721
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,766
I'm gonna keep my eye
on you douchebags this time.

722
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:25,232
Lawrence, Tom hasn't come back yet.
I think he's missing.

723
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,165
Guys you know Beth Wexler.

724
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,899
- Ah…
- The guys, they say hi.

725
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,199
I'm really worried. I think
we should go find him.

726
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,699
By going out in the
jungle at night?

727
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,867
No, no, no.

728
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,599
Fine, I'll go myself.

729
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,666
Why don't you just relax, Beth?
I'm sure Tom

730
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,366
just went skinny-dipping
in the river,

731
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,699
- and discovered himself.
- I'm gonna call John.

732
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,666
That's a good idea. Have him bring the
flash and the green hornet in on the case.

733
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:54,066
I should've known better
than to come to you.

734
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,099
All right, now,
the name of this next game

735
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,833
is new england baseball.

736
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,299
What it is, is regular
five-card stud

737
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,233
except deuces are wild for white men.

738
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:54,766
Well now, who the hell are you?

739
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,766
I wish

740
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:59,733
to get into your game.

741
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:01,733
Well, that'd be all right by me,

742
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,467
but gee, the rest of the fellows
don't look too excited.

743
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,400
Uh, Lawrence…
Asshole…

744
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:23,766
I wish to get into the game.

745
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:25,499
You're in, you're in.

746
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,833
You put up some of
that fruit salad,

747
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:30,566
and I'll put up a comb. You
ever seen one of these?

748
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,599
Asshole! Do you know
who you're talking to?

749
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,299
That's chung mee. He
runs the black market.

750
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,499
He runs everything.
He comes into this village,

751
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,065
we give him whatever he
wants, he is a motherfucker.

752
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:46,066
This is the black marketeer?

753
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:50,399
Mr. mee!

754
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,499
Lawrence Bourne III.

755
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,466
I really must apologize
for my rudeness,

756
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:57,532
although the hair does look ridiculous.
I didn't know who you were.

757
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:59,966
But I've heard an
awful lot about you.

758
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:03,065
I was just graduated
from Yale, class of '62…

759
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:05,199
Jeez… you didn't
let me finish.

760
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,032
Don't kill me! I
haven't had a woman yet!

761
00:47:10,033 --> 00:47:12,733
What a break this is, at,
meeting him face to face

762
00:47:12,734 --> 00:47:14,499
and getting taken right
to his home. Ha!

763
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,733
I'm not gonna let him off easy, I'm
gonna ask for a major share of the pie.

764
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:21,265
- They say he has a testicle collection.
- Oh, he's not gonna hurt us.

765
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:23,699
If he wanted to kill us, we would
have been dead on the spot.

766
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,799
- Well, maybe he didn't like us enough to do that.
- No, no, at,

767
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,999
- this is capitalism at its most prime.
- What's capitalism?

768
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,233
Oh, at, sometimes you Asian
people just slay me, really.

769
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,165
Glorioski.

770
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,199
I'm going, I'm going!

771
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,899
Don't say nothing, Lawrence.
Don't say nothing!

772
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,999
They wanna use me like a woman.

773
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,967
You'll just have to show
'em you can take it like a man.

774
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,766
The bridge you are building…

775
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,299
When will it be completed?

776
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,599
The bridge?

777
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,799
You're interested in…

778
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,066
In our bridge.
Oh, permit me.

779
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,866
As I said, it would be
very difficult to say.

780
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,366
We do have a very fine young
man working on it right now,

781
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,532
but why do you want to know?

782
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,799
Opium is my business.

783
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,399
The bridge mean more traffic.

784
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,632
More traffic mean more business.

785
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:47,766
More business mean more money.

786
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:51,666
More money mean more power.

787
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,332
Well, before I commit
any of that to memory,

788
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,599
would there be
anything in this for me?

789
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,099
Speed is important in business.

790
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,866
- Time is money.
- You said opium was money.

791
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:06,099
- Money is money, - well,
then what is time again?

792
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,399
When bridge is completed,

793
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,699
you can have whatever you need.

794
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,599
Oh, I see.

795
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,432
And they told me to go on those
business interviews at Yale.

796
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:21,699
Well, gosh, first of all,

797
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,065
I would like to run
everything in loong ta.

798
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:26,399
Then, whenever I was ready,
passage back to Bangkok

799
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,632
and an airline ticket
back to the United States.

800
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,966
Oh, and this is hardly
worth mentioning,

801
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:34,499
but, 28…
$48,000 in cash.

802
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,900
I have some library books
that are overdue.

803
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,632
- Nice knowing you.
- I want bridge finished in six weeks.

804
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:44,899
Or you are finished in seven.

805
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,734
- You're going along with that?
Hey! -

806
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,566
No problem, commander,
the bridge is yours.

807
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,533
You are mine.

808
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:57,032
Well, it's only fair.

809
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,166
Business is completed.

810
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:16,232
After business come pleasure.

811
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,767
Pleasure is also my business.

812
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:33,466
- For me?
- If I say yes and not no.

813
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:37,165
- You want me to translate?
- No, no, I got that one,

814
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,966
it's a little incentive,
isn't it?

815
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:43,165
You are a slyboots,
you… really.

816
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,366
Hello, hi.

817
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:47,466
Lawrence Bourne III,
junior partner.

818
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,232
You must be…

819
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:51,432
What it
means is su-ru-sirre.

820
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:55,265
- Pardon me?
- What it means is su-ru-sirre.

821
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:56,933
I'm sorry, what?

822
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:59,666
Lucille, her name is Lucille.

823
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,733
Oh, Lucille. Wow, now
that's highly erotic.

824
00:51:02,734 --> 00:51:06,666
I love Lucille. Tell me, how
did you get a name like that?

825
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,499
With mama's engrish.

826
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,265
- What?
- That is her name?

827
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:14,432
- She's staying for dinner, of course.
- Yes, but you are leaving.

828
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:17,399
But I just got here.
What do you see in him?

829
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,899
Are you some sort of a
chubby chaser or something?

830
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,999
Lucille is my bodyguard.

831
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,766
She does not like it when
my orders are questioned.

832
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:29,966
Thank god my fly was zipped.

833
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,766
Thank you for dinner
and not killing us.

834
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,466
Glad to be aboard,

835
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:38,499
Lucille, any night
of the week, I'm free.

836
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,432
Did I mention that back
home I drive a corvette?

837
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,466
Nothing can stop that boy now.

838
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,333
When the task is done,
you may deal with him.

839
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,099
Do you think you can
find Tom with the helicopter?

840
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,866
We'd never spot him
from up there, uh-uh.

841
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:15,399
What about organizing
a search party?

842
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,199
I'll be honest with you, Beth,
I'm figuring on the worst.

843
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,966
There's a lot of ways
into that jungle,

844
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:22,199
and precious few ways out.

845
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,933
So we just give up?

846
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:27,165
Keep on what you're doing,
Beth. That's best.

847
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,032
Bourne's a sharp fellow,

848
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:32,366
and, you know, I got a feeling
he'll come through for you.

849
00:52:32,367 --> 00:52:34,299
Bourne?
He's useless.

850
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,499
He's probably down at
the river right now

851
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,966
paying the young girls
to wash themselves.

852
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:42,666
This bridge is going
to last forever.

853
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,966
Your children, and your
children's children

854
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,099
will use it and remember you.

855
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:58,233
In America, Bridges
are monuments.

856
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:04,165
People come from all over
to visit them,

857
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:08,033
to admire them, to end
their lives off them.

858
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,899
Now you people are
so gosh darn lucky

859
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,132
to have this opportunity.

860
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:22,265
…gosh darn…

861
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:27,065
Take advantage of it.

862
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:29,967
Seize it.

863
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,833
And work quickly.
Thank you.

864
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:37,900
Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence…

865
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:43,166
Thank you.
Thank you.

866
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:52,066
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

867
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:56,199
Good morning. I just
put a stick in the ground.

868
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,899
John, welcome back to our
little corner of the world.

869
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,500
Is your chin getting bigger?

870
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:11,766
Can't you just stay
a day or two?

871
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,232
Well, I wish I could. I
really do, but Mike and me

872
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,299
been so goll darn
busy these days.

873
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,733
I get lonely. There's nobody
here I can really talk to…

874
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,966
Especially Lawrence.

875
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,032
- Who's Mike?
- Mike's my knife.

876
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:27,432
We been traveling together
ever since I was 16.

877
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:29,265
A good companion, Mike.

878
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,600
- Oh, your knife.
- Beth…

879
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:38,099
Words come hard
for a fellow like me,

880
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,632
but my heart soared when
you radioed last night.

881
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:43,866
I been thinking about you ever
since you walked off that plane.

882
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,699
Really? Oh, I didn't
know you cared at all.

883
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,232
Beth, there's a lot of things I
want to tell you about myself.

884
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,866
- I… - oh, there's a lot
of things I want to know.

885
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:56,699
When we get back, we're gonna
make the time, you and us.

886
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,332
- Us?
- Mike.

887
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:02,432
Oh yes, Mike.

888
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:05,432
Until then, I brought you
a little something

889
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,599
I'd like you to keep
near your heart.

890
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,366
It's a present,

891
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:14,266
just from me to you.

892
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,599
- Oh.
- It's a Burmese prince.

893
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,833
There's kind of
an art store in Bangkok

894
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:26,199
that specializes in these type things.
I go there a lot.

895
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,199
When you're in the city,

896
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,532
I'd love to take you
through the place.

897
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:33,432
Oh, well, thank you.

898
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,566
Thank you.

899
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:38,800
This is really unexpected.

900
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,432
See that Mike?

901
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:45,100

911

Tom tuttle from Tacoma,

912
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,899
do you know where you are?

913
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,632
My guess is I'm in the clutches
of the angry pink menace.

914
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:30,265
I am souvanna.

915
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:33,132
We will be spending
much time together.

916
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:36,499
You'll get nothing
from me but my scorn.

917
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,199
Tom, this is the people's army.

918
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,899
From here, we strike out and
bring hope to the oppressed,

919
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,899
the oppressed
who are still slaves

920
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,265
to running-dog, foul-breathed,
capitalist vermin like yourself.

921
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,566
We exist only
to spread the word.

922
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:53,132
Tom tuttle from Tacoma…

923
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:56,032
- You will be brainwashed.
- Me?

924
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:58,432
America's son? Ha!

925
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,567
That will be a challenge.

926
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,667
You bet.

927
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:07,499
Our enemies are all those
in league with imperialism.

928
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,933
The bureaucrats,
the big landlord class

929
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:13,466
and the reactionary section of the
inteligentsia attached to them.

930
00:57:13,467 --> 00:57:16,065
Very good, Tom. You quote
the chairman well.

931
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,933
Ouenemies are all around us.

932
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,232
We must always be on our guard.

933
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:23,099
Sure, we'll lose a lot of
snooze time, but that's okay.

934
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,265
- We'll catch up after the revolution's over.
- That's enough, Tom.

935
00:57:26,266 --> 00:57:29,933
The leading force behind our revolution
is the industrial proletariat.

936
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:32,499
Our closest friends are the
entire semi-proletariat

937
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,733
- and the petty bourgeoisie.
- That's enough.

938
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:37,199
- But there's so much more.
- I said that's enough!

939
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,432
The time has come
to tell you your mission.

940
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:43,332
- My mission. I'd like that very much, comrade.
- Good.

941
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,299
Tom, the bridge
you were building

942
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,766
for the lying, malignant,
snake-infested peace corps,

943
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:50,299
- - That
bridge is important to us.

944
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,466
It gives us an easy
access across the river.

945
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,966
We can drive our brand-new
people's truck across it,

946
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:58,232
and plaster the words of the chairman
on every tree, rock, and animal

947
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:00,833
- for miles until we run out of the people's gas.
- Yes!

948
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,999
You, Tom tuttle of Tacoma,

949
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,232
are going to ensure that
that bridge is built,

950
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,966
and that no one in loong ta
interferes with our plans.

951
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:10,933
In a week,

952
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:13,999
I'll have that village
running like Peking.

953
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,399
And if someo
does stand in your way?

954
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:28,199
That's enough, Tom.

955
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,666
Enough!

956
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,066
Enough, enough, enough.

957
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:46,265
The bridge that
couldn't be built.

958
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,466
Well, I say "bullshit" to that.

959
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:51,432
A bridge is nothing when you've
got strong arms, strong backs,

960
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:54,366
guts, determination, courage…

961
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:56,733
Break!
Take a break.

962
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,833
Take a break?
Wait a minute,

963
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:01,366
you had a break not two
hours ago, now come on,

964
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,599
hey, hey, Beth, now…

965
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,766
Beth, I'm surprised at you.

966
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,032
You're supposed to be
setting an example here.

967
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:10,299
I don't mind telling you
I'm just a little shocked.

968
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,966
- Shut up.
- Uh-oh.

969
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:16,132
You know, I'm killing myself.

970
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:19,399
You don't even want to be here and
everything comes so easy for you.

971
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,032
Well, I wouldn't
necessarily say that.

972
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:28,099
How did you learn to speak thai?

973
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,333
I have to communicate, don't I?

974
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,933
You know what
your problem is, Beth?

975
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:36,799
You just take things
so seriously,

976
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,099
I mean, who says
it has to be so tough, huh?

977
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,532
J.f.k.?

978
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:44,232
Has he ever done this?
I think not.

979
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:46,299
You leave him out of this.

980
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,366
I came here to do a job,

981
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:52,265
something I believe in, the
peace corps… helping people.

982
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:55,166
You're only here
because you're running away.

983
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,999
Beth, nothing is fair.

984
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,099
Wake up and smell the river.

985
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,933
Now, you wanna get
this log moved?

986
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,966
First of all, let's get
some more men down here.

987
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,532
Now, the easy way.

988
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:17,300
Come stand where I'm standing.
Come on, come on.

989
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:21,399
Now, with great conviction,
say the following…

990
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,065
What did I say?

991
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:40,567
"Move this log, and I'll
sleep with each one of you."

992
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,499
The easy way.

993
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,933
Well, I'm back.
Did you miss me?

994
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:52,332
Tom! Tom!

995
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,232
Where'd you go? We thought you were dead.
Are you all right?

996
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:57,566
Me?

997
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,532
I'm okay.
I'm a-okay!

998
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:02,432
I'm Jim dandy.

999
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:04,399
A-number one,
that's me.

1000
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,466
Got a little lost, that's all.

1001
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:09,466
Took the opportunity to give
myself a jungle survival course.

1002
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:11,933
As always,
I'm the better for it.

1003
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,899
Now I'm back,

1004
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,899
and able to build
that doggone bridge!

1005
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,834
I'm back!

1006
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:02,899
It's open.
It's always open.

1007
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,032
Miss Wexler,

1008
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:07,900
Lawrence Bourne III requests…

1009
01:04:09,867 --> 01:04:12,566
Requests the pleasure
of your company

1010
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:14,766
on this special occasion.

1011
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,265
Would you come with me?

1012
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:19,467
Go where?
For what?

1013
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,632
I'm not allowed to say.

1014
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:24,733
No, no, no…

1015
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:27,100
Come on…

1016
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:30,499
Be a g… guy.

1017
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,734
Come on.

1018
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:51,200
- This better be good.
- Yeah, yeah.

1019
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,100
Uh-uh.

1020
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,767
Welcome.

1021
01:05:15,633 --> 01:05:17,866
I call it Lawrence's.

1022
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:20,199
I don't believe it.

1023
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,466
Even from you.

1024
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:24,933
It was actually much easier
than you would imagine.

1025
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,799
- How did you get… - oh,
just a few connections,

1026
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,199
a little elbow grease
is all, and voila,

1027
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,332
loong ta's first public service.

1028
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,499
Are you as proud of me as I am?

1029
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,867
Can I get you a drink?

1030
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,966
Wait a minute, I don't get this.

1031
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:43,199
What's this for?

1032
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,833
It's for a job
well done, of course.

1033
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:48,934
I've got Johnny Walker, Jim beam,
Jack Daniels. The gang's all here.

1034
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,165
- You've got liquor?
- And wine.

1035
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:57,999
The house white is a
delightfully articulate chablis.

1036
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,499
I haven't seen a tube of
toothpaste in two weeks,

1037
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,999
and you have a bar.

1038
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,766
Mm-hmm.

1039
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:09,800
Good nig, Lawrence.

1040
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:13,065
How about a coke?

1041
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:15,165
You have a coke?

1042
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:18,232
Cherry, lemon, vanilla…

1043
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,333
Or plain?

1044
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,633
Plain.

1045
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,633
A plain coke.

1046
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:35,166
You have more than earned it.

1047
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:45,366
Oh god…

1048
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:49,300
That is fantastic.
I miss these so much.

1049
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,300
To friends?

1050
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:00,666
Mmm.

1051
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,532
Now…

1052
01:07:02,533 --> 01:07:04,834
Would you care to dance?

1053
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:15,367
Sam, try that again.

1054
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:40,766
Well, here we are.

1055
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:45,133
I'm having such a good time.

1056
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,833
So am I.

1057
01:08:47,834 --> 01:08:51,800
Would you…
Like to come inside?

1058
01:08:54,066 --> 01:08:56,265
No, I don't think so,
not tonight.

1059
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,632
What?

1060
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:01,399
You see, if I go in there,

1061
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,399
I'm going to be tempted
to make a pass at you,

1062
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,265
and that's not what you want.

1063
01:09:06,266 --> 01:09:08,933
- It isn't?
- No, it isn't.

1064
01:09:08,934 --> 01:09:11,867
I like you very much, Beth.

1065
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,332
All I ask…

1066
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,934
Is that you just give me
a little chance.

1067
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,400
- Good night.
- Good night.

1068
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,466
John has come marching home.

1069
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:12,199
John… you scared
the hell out of me.

1070
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,466
You wanted to know
all about me, Beth.

1071
01:10:14,467 --> 01:10:17,966
- Tonight's the night.
- John, the clown outfit aside,

1072
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:21,366
- I don't think this is very funny.
- This is no clown outfit,

1073
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:24,099
this is my business suit.

1074
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,966
- I beg your pardon?
- Things are starting to happen, Beth,

1075
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:28,933
and I want you
at my side when they do.

1076
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,499
There's more to me than a
pencil-pushing aggy advisor.

1077
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,799
You see, Beth,

1078
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,065
I'm not with the
rinky-dinky peace corps.

1079
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,199
I'm with the company,
the a-team.

1080
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,265
- You might know it as the c.I.A.
- John…

1081
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:45,199
Listen, I like the fact
that you're quiet,

1082
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,399
why do you feel you have to play
these weird little jokes on me?

1083
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:53,466
You're not listening to me.

1084
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:55,299
Your John is in charge
of a joint operation

1085
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,899
to eliminate the communist
element in that jungle.

1086
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,566
The bridge y'all built will
make it a much easier task.

1087
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:03,399
You'll have nothing to worry about, though.
You'll be safe.

1088
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,766
Me and Mike'll see to that.

1089
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,332
Now come on, Beth, how can you
resist a man in a uniform?

1090
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:12,532
- You're crazy.
- I have to be to outsmart those little pink pagans.

1091
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:14,699
They're gonna be shocked
out of their sarongs.

1092
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,065
When they see what we've
got in store for them.

1093
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:21,399
Operation red-belly, Beth.
Operation red-belly.

1094
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,733
Very soon, a convoy of trucks is gonna
roll over that bridge y'all built.

1095
01:11:24,734 --> 01:11:27,232
And once this spot is leveled,

1096
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:29,799
this village will become an
airstrip, a lair, if you will,

1097
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,499
from which we'll be able
to strike at all hot spots

1098
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,466
all up and down the delta.

1099
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,566
Strong, swift strikes.

1100
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,934
One after another.

1101
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:43,199
Again, again…

1102
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,433
And again.

1103
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:50,200
Where's that Burmese
prince I gave you?

1104
01:11:51,233 --> 01:11:54,700
I looked through your drawers
and I couldn't find it.

1105
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,666
- John, get out of my way.
- Where are you going?

1106
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:02,466
To radio Bangkok. It's for your own good,
you might have malaria or something.

1107
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:04,733
Beth, please…

1108
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:07,499
- Don't push me now.
- Don't touch me!

1109
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,332
You touch me, and you and
Mike will get 20 years each.

1110
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:14,699
Beth, I must tell you
in all candor,

1111
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,400
I don't like what I'm hearing.

1112
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:31,232
- - Shh,
it's only chloroform.

1113
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:33,332
Beth, honey,
you're amongst friends.

1114
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:02,633
Poor Lawrence.

1115
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:06,767
Poor, poor Lawrence.

1116
01:13:23,934 --> 01:13:27,099
- - I, Tom tuttle,
of Tacoma, Washington,

1117
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:31,300
hereby declare this bridge
officially open.

1118
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,966
How do you like that, Lawrence?

1119
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,799
Can you believe
I never had lesson?

1120
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,999
Where the hell is she?

1121
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,833
I haven't seen her anywhere.
Did you speak with her today?

1122
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:34,966
- Who?
- Beth!

1123
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:38,199
Beth? No, I haven't
seen her all day.

1124
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,366
That doesn't make sense.
It's way after dark,

1125
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:42,165
she could be lost, maybe…

1126
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,833
Maybe an animal got her,
maybe the commies got her…

1127
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:48,800
There's plenty of
places she could be.

1128
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,632
At, you are lying to me.

1129
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:59,899
I can tell, your eyes
are getting round.

1130
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,466
- Get outta here!
- All right, where is she?

1131
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:04,499
Careful, I know
the art of kickboxing.

1132
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,466
- I know. Where is Beth?
- Okay, okay.

1133
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:09,599
But you're not gonna like this.
I saw Beth last night,

1134
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,999
she went into the
jungle with John.

1135
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,699
Oh, bullshit, with…

1136
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:21,967
- You saw them go together?
- She's no good for you, big guy.

1137
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,532
You have more important
things to care about.

1138
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:27,967
Yourself.

1139
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,933
She led me on.

1140
01:15:32,934 --> 01:15:35,099
She led me on,

1141
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,132
and then she lets that
weedwhacker diddle her,

1142
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,333
that easy bitch!

1143
01:15:40,767 --> 01:15:43,065
You know, when you
think about it,

1144
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:46,866
there's a lot to be said with
just playing with yourself.

1145
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:02,432
Our enemies are in league
with imperialism.

1146
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,299
Imperialism is colonialism.

1147
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,933
Colonialism is the
exploitation of the people.

1148
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:09,099
Forget about her, tiger.

1149
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,099
You got bigger fish to fry.

1150
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,099
You know what I'm gonna do?

1151
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,566
I'm gonna go back to Bangkok,
and I'm gonna find a phone,

1152
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:19,532
and then I'm gonna call her
parents in New York City collect.

1153
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,899
I'm gonna tell them their daughter is
sleeping with a gentile from Texas.

1154
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,100
- - You had
enough to drink, Larry.

1155
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,599
I'm celebrating now.

1156
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,967
Uh-oh.

1157
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,767
Chung mee, you shouldn't have.

1158
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:11,265
Hold your worm, asshole.

1159
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:14,566
You're better off with Beth. That
Lucille is bad news on wheels.

1160
01:17:14,567 --> 01:17:16,934
Take our money
and send her away!

1161
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:21,499
$48,000.

1162
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,199
All that great, green
American currency.

1163
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,466
Hey, look at this!

1164
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:30,133
I'll show you what this is
for later on this evening.

1165
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:34,066
And the… yes,
the plane ticket home.

1166
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:38,033
Coach?! that
cheap bastard.

1167
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,899
My god, I certainly hope
you don't wear contact lenses.

1168
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,299
- Shh.
- Oh, right, right.

1169
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,833
Oh, that feels so good
what you're doing.

1170
01:17:57,367 --> 01:18:01,799
- Asshole!
- At, get out of here now!

1171
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:06,899
Awfully sorry about that. You
really have to excuse him.

1172
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,399
He's just jealous.
You see,

1173
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,399
he's never had a woman,

1174
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,599
and I have to confess,
it's been quite some time

1175
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,065
since I've had one myself,
so I hope you don't mind

1176
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,899
if it takes me five, six,
seven, eight times

1177
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,066
for me to get my legs back.

1178
01:18:23,734 --> 01:18:25,399
Larry, I…

1179
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,532
- Larry, you have to listen to me.
- Shit!

1180
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:31,699
- I… she's… but wait…
- I had more privacy at Yale.

1181
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,399
Get out!

1182
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,332
- - That twit
has officially broken the mood.

1183
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,833
Whatso I get ourselves
a drink, eh?

1184
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:42,666
What's your pleasure?

1185
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:45,366
Ooh, boilermaker.
My kind of woman.

1186
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:49,499
Say, have you ever actually
slept with chung mee?

1187
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,432
He must be hung
like a cocktail frank.

1188
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:54,532
That would certainly explain his
less-than-social behavior.

1189
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:56,699
What say you become
a bodyguard of mine, huh?

1190
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,000
Not that I really
need one, but…

1191
01:19:00,633 --> 01:19:03,199
Jesus, at!
What was that? Hey!

1192
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,766
- I think I'm getting closer.
- She was trying to kill me.

1193
01:19:05,767 --> 01:19:09,599
- Were you trying to kill me?
- You know the problem? I think I'm left-footed.

1194
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,567
Nobody tries to kill me
and comes that close.

1195
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:17,866
…Yankee blood…
Dead meat.

1196
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:19,999
Huh?

1197
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,699
If you touch her
Beth is a goner.

1198
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,866
- How do you know she said that?
- I'm oriental.

1199
01:19:24,867 --> 01:19:26,899
Oh, yeah…
Beth is a goner?

1200
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,399
You told me Beth was with John.

1201
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,933
Now what is John
doing with chung mee?

1202
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:38,933
He must be in cahoots with him.

1203
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:42,165
I bet they have some big deal
going, and somehow Beth found out

1204
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,833
so he had to take her away to
make sure she doesn't tell.

1205
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:48,899
That would mean that
Beth doesn't like John!

1206
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,700
Oh god, that is a relief.

1207
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,266
Lawrence, Beth is in deep shit!

1208
01:19:57,133 --> 01:19:59,233
I realize that.

1209
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,033
Shouldn't one of us be
saying, "let's go save her?"

1210
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,032

1216
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,532
Who goes there?
Who goes there?

1217
01:20:27,533 --> 01:20:30,232
It's Lawrence. It's me,
it's Lawrence.

1218
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:32,232
What are you doing here?

1219
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:34,499
Guarding my bridge, that's all.

1220
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,699
Can we pry you away from it
for just an hour or two?

1221
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,566
It seems that Beth is in the
clutches of some Chinese warlord.

1222
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,599
At and I are going
up river to save her

1223
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,199
and reluctantly,
we need your help.

1224
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,332
That would mean I would
have to leave my bridge.

1225
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,699
- No, you could take it with you.
- I can't do that!

1226
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,065
I can't do that, no.

1227
01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:54,667
My mission is here.

1228
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:58,099
Fine. If I get
out of this alive,

1229
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,433
I'm never leaving
the east coast again.

1230
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,866
At, did you knock out
Lucille and tie her up?

1231
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:14,866
No, she did it herself.

1232
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:17,399
- You should've been there.
- I can't believe this.

1233
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,532
I'm risking my life
for a long island Princess

1234
01:21:19,533 --> 01:21:22,132
who thinks motives are more
important than actions,

1235
01:21:22,133 --> 01:21:23,966
father would be appalled.

1236
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:27,032
- Doggone it, I must be doing the right thing.
- Shh, Larry, be quiet.

1237
01:21:27,033 --> 01:21:30,933
We're right under the walls. We
don't want to disturb the guards.

1238
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:33,100
I bow to your expertise.

1239
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,866
What do you see?

1240
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:55,332
I see the holding area.

1241
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,933
That's probably where
they're keeping her.

1242
01:21:57,934 --> 01:22:00,032
Any guards?

1243
01:22:00,033 --> 01:22:03,232
A couple of those fat guys.

1244
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:05,999
Kiss, kiss.

1245
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,999
Lawrence…

1246
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,867
Ow!

1247
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,834
God, you are heavy for an Asian.

1248
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,132
So, what's your plan?

1249
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:20,899
- What plan?
- You said you were working on a plan.

1250
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,632
- Oh, I lied.
- Of course.

1251
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:25,933
I do have an idea.
All we have to do

1252
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:29,032
is distract the guards,

1253
01:22:29,033 --> 01:22:32,399
then sneak in and get Beth.

1254
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,899
You just come up with that
off the top of your head?

1255
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,466
It's my responsibility,
so I'll take the hard part.

1256
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:41,467
- I'll get Beth.
- So, what do I do?

1257
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,566
It's obvious, isn't it?
Those guards…

1258
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:48,432
They like you.
You just approach them,

1259
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:50,966
and, I don't know, bum a smoke
from them or something,

1260
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,432
- and before you know it…
- Those… those guards?!

1261
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:55,599
- No way, hotrod!
- Come on.

1262
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,032
Are you that unsure
of your masculinity?

1263
01:22:58,033 --> 01:23:00,466
I'd like to keep what I got.

1264
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:22,499
Hiya, fellas.

1265
01:23:38,867 --> 01:23:41,000
It's a heck of a night.

1266
01:23:41,967 --> 01:23:45,467
Got a smoke?

1267
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,900
You guys come here a lot?

1268
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,332
Yours is a difficult task.

1269
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:18,699
When you step on one ant,

1270
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,065
you allow his brother
to go around you.

1271
01:24:21,066 --> 01:24:23,399
I appreciate your
concern, chung mee,

1272
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,799
but I assure you, when we
get done with red-belly,

1273
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,033
there won't be
one goddamn red ant left.

1274
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,933
We all must do what we must do.

1275
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:33,766
For if we do not,

1276
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:37,834
- then what we must do does not get done.
- You betcha.

1277
01:24:39,367 --> 01:24:41,466
Well, at 0700 hours tomorrow

1278
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:43,766
we roll across that bridge
and secure the area.

1279
01:24:43,767 --> 01:24:45,599
And after that,

1280
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,633
you'll be free to fly your opium
in any direction you want.

1281
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,032
You'll be
international, chung mee.

1282
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:54,699
The well is deep.

1283
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,166
I wish you well.

1284
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
Beth?

1285
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,132
My god…

1286
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:09,966
I had visions of you stripped
naked and chained to a wall.

1287
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:12,599
Imagine my disappointment.

1288
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,666
Lawrence, hi.

1289
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:17,966
- You found me.
- Yes.

1290
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,233
Shit!

1291
01:25:26,066 --> 01:25:28,299
Lawrence…

1292
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:31,799
Come on, kiss my little piggy.

1293
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,065
Lawrence, huh?

1294
01:25:34,066 --> 01:25:37,299
Me and Mike'll make you
forget that no-account,

1295
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,232
liver-lipped, milk-toast,

1296
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:41,332
scrawny,
pencil-necked geek.

1297
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,566
You're gonna love me, Beth,

1298
01:25:43,567 --> 01:25:45,766
if I got to keep you
doped up from…

1299
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:48,867
Here to armageddon and a day.

1300
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:56,733
- Yikes.
- Bourne.

1301
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,799
Well now, you're the last person

1302
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,699
- I thought I'd see coming to save Beth.
- So…

1303
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,065
The surprise worked.

1304
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,199
Now, you're gonna
have to disappear.

1305
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,333
Well, I'm going to do my best.

1306
01:26:14,934 --> 01:26:17,065
Kill, kill!

1307
01:26:17,066 --> 01:26:19,566
- Damn!
- Ha!

1308
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:22,999
You can't do this to me. I'm very
rich, and I have certain rights.

1309
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,466
Shit! You ain't nothing now, boy.
You really thought

1310
01:26:26,467 --> 01:26:28,599
you was gonna come up
here and save this girl?

1311
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,699
You just a smart-talking
little piece of turd.

1312
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,599
You been taking up space.
Say your prayers, boy.

1313
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,733
Larry!

1314
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,699
- Fool with me… Good timing, at!
- Thank you.

1315
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,933
Come over here, we have
get her out of here.

1316
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,866
Come on, come on, Barbie.

1317
01:26:48,867 --> 01:26:51,332
This little piggy stayed home.

1318
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:55,032
- This little piggy had roast beef.
- Put her over my shoulder.

1319
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:57,265
- Way to go.
- This little piggy had none.

1320
01:26:57,266 --> 01:27:00,366
And this little piggy
went, "wee!"

1321
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:03,265
- It's dark in here.
- All the way home.

1322
01:27:03,266 --> 01:27:05,466
I saw this once on route 66.

1323
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:07,767
Let's go, let's go!

1324
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,399
- Which way do we go?
- Surprise me.

1325
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,967
- Go!
- At, shh!

1326
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:23,900
Come on, Mike.

1327
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:27,433
We got work to do.

1328
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,934
A leopard.

1329
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,366
I want you people to
spread out and find these folks,

1330
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:43,799
do you understand? And I want you
to bring that girl back alive.

1331
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,733
Move, goddamn it!

1332
01:27:45,734 --> 01:27:47,833
Yeah!

1333
01:27:47,834 --> 01:27:50,733
I'm sure I came
through this way.

1334
01:27:50,734 --> 01:27:53,065
Nope. Well, this one…

1335
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:56,766
Looks all the same to me.

1336
01:27:56,767 --> 01:27:58,767
Shh!

1337
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:10,300
Uh-oh.
- Oops, sorry.

1338
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:24,766
Sorry, chung mee, I've never
been so embarrassed.

1339
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,266
Larry, wait for me!

1340
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,566
Larry, if we get out of here
alive, I'm gonna kill you.

1341
01:28:49,567 --> 01:28:51,800
Well, take a numbe

1342
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:08,400
Ow.

1343
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,600
Howdy-do.

1344
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:20,032
Look, all right now…
If Mr. mee were here,

1345
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:22,232
or if I were mee…

1346
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:27,532
I would be the first to say
that this is nothing more

1347
01:29:27,533 --> 01:29:31,700
than a grave misunderstanding.
Quite simply, it's…

1348
01:29:36,066 --> 01:29:38,834
Here we go again.

1349
01:29:46,834 --> 01:29:49,834
- At!
- Okay, okay, go!

1350
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,699
Go, go, go!

1351
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,766
It's the river!

1352
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:02,265
- I can't do it.
- It's not like it takes a lot of skill.

1353
01:30:07,033 --> 01:30:09,299
Oh, my head is swimming.

1354
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,232
That's a start.

1355
01:30:12,967 --> 01:30:15,300
Wee!

1356
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,966
- This is wet!
- At! Where's at?

1357
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:30,499
- I'm under you, Larry.
- Downstream.

1358
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,333
Back to loong ta. Where'd
we leave the damn boat?

1359
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,899
Our bridge…
Our beloved bridge…

1360
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,666
At, are you all right,
my pathetic little pal?

1361
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:45,632
I'm fine.

1362
01:30:45,633 --> 01:30:49,265
So, I die before
I ever have a woman.

1363
01:30:49,266 --> 01:30:51,799
I helped build a bridge,

1364
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:55,532
some fat guys touched me…

1365
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,299
I've had a full life, Larry.

1366
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,632
If you want to enjoy any more of
it, we'd better get out of here

1367
01:31:00,633 --> 01:31:02,532
before chung mee and
his friends return.

1368
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:04,966
At sun-up all hell
is gonna break loose.

1369
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:06,799
Sun-up?

1370
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,900
And they busted the radio?

1371
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,265
Jesus, there's
nothing we can do.

1372
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:16,933
- It's too late.
- It's just one of those days, I guess.

1373
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:18,933
I'm gonna get my dope,

1374
01:31:18,934 --> 01:31:22,033
what's left of my booze,
you know, the essentials.

1375
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:26,065
- I'm taking my grandfather.
- Fine, fine.

1376
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:30,065
Just pack some of this hooch into
his jumper for me, will you?

1377
01:31:30,066 --> 01:31:32,599
What about our
genuine persian carpet?

1378
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,566
I don't care, just tear it down.

1379
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:37,399
We can always wrap it up
around your grandfather.

1380
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,399
Tear it down…

1381
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,199
Of course…

1382
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,065
We have the dynamite, we'll
just blow the bridge to bits.

1383
01:31:44,066 --> 01:31:46,199
Beth, we are in a hurry here.

1384
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,733
Blow it to bits.
That's a brilliant idea!

1385
01:31:48,734 --> 01:31:52,566
We'll show those warmongers that the
people won't stand for their tyranny.

1386
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:54,566
Wait a minute Beth, no, no…

1387
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:57,366
- yes, yes, yes.
- No, no… at, tell her it can't be done.

1388
01:31:57,367 --> 01:31:59,766
- It should've been done in the first place.
- Right!

1389
01:31:59,767 --> 01:32:02,032
- I'll help you, Beth.
- Thank you, at.

1390
01:32:02,033 --> 01:32:03,799
- I said no!
- Put me down!

1391
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,766
- No, I'm not gonna let you!
- Oh, why?

1392
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:07,933
Because I love you.

1393
01:32:07,934 --> 01:32:10,366
Who said that?

1394
01:32:10,367 --> 01:32:12,232
If you love me, you'll help me.

1395
01:32:12,233 --> 01:32:14,132
Whoa, I know I didn't say that.

1396
01:32:14,133 --> 01:32:17,500
Lawrence, you can't have me
unless we blow up the bridge.

1397
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,666
Okay, fine, I'll blow
up your silly bridge.

1398
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:35,700
- God knows I've done crazier things.
- No, wait.

1399
01:32:36,767 --> 01:32:38,599
Lawrence…

1400
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,799
I'm sorry. I know
that you think

1401
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,733
the right thing can be
done for the wrong reason.

1402
01:32:43,734 --> 01:32:46,366
But for me, motives
are important.

1403
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:50,032
You can't be part of this if
you're doing it for yourself.

1404
01:32:50,033 --> 01:32:52,299
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1405
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,032
Okay. I'm not just blowing
up the bridge for me,

1406
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:58,699
I'm blowing it up
for you, and for you, at,

1407
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,532
and for grandfather, and the people, and
America, and the universe, all right?

1408
01:33:02,533 --> 01:33:05,199
But please, now, let's just
blow up the goddamn bridge!

1409
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:09,132
- You really do love me.
- Yes, I do. Can we go now?

1410
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:12,300
- Right away.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

1411
01:33:39,367 --> 01:33:42,666
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

1412
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:46,133
They weren't too wild about the
bridge in the first place.

1413
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:49,299
Oh joy.
All right, now…

1414
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,600
What say we get the dynamite down
to the river, and let's hurry.

1415
01:33:53,266 --> 01:33:55,499
Dust to dust, if we must, we must.

1416
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,332
Tom! Tom!

1417
01:33:57,333 --> 01:34:01,265
Fools! Yankee
imperialist swine!

1418
01:34:01,266 --> 01:34:03,699
Running-dog lackey!

1419
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,799
Capitalist vermin!

1420
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,332
- Foul-breathed, counter-
revolutionary terrorists! -

1421
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:12,499
You didn't actually think I'd let
you get away with this, did you?

1422
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,866
Hey, tuttle!

1423
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:19,265
This is my birthday. What do you say
you let me blow out that candle?

1424
01:34:19,266 --> 01:34:21,132
I'm not afraid to die.

1425
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:23,699
Not for a cause!
Not for a cause!

1426
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,966
Sure, there'll be
some things I'll miss…

1427
01:34:27,233 --> 01:34:29,966
Tuna fish casserole with
little potato chips on top.

1428
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:31,766
Mmm…

1429
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:35,165
And Sandra Dee.
I always loved Sandra Dee.

1430
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:37,466
I've never told
anyone that before.

1431
01:34:37,467 --> 01:34:40,299
And I know that one day, she
would leave Bobby Darin for me.

1432
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,332
I just know that she'd do that.

1433
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:45,466
But that day will never be, now.

1434
01:34:45,467 --> 01:34:49,099
Happy birthday, Larry!

1435
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,566

1442
01:35:10,467 --> 01:35:14,166

I'll read the book,
I'll see the film,

1451
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,599
I'll wash the people's truck.

1452
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,899
I'll do whatever you want!

1453
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,399
It was the commies!
It was the commies!

1454
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,332
They wanted the bridge,
they wanted…

1455
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:47,833
See, I just wanted a little
snooze time, that's all.

1456
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:51,099
Just a little nap every now
and… they kept talking to me,

1457
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,933
and talking and talking. I
challenged myself to resist,

1458
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:56,766
- but who was I kidding?
- Tom, what are you talking about?

1459
01:35:56,767 --> 01:36:01,165
- Let's hit him again.
- The commies! The commies!

1460
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:04,899
The commies are coming. They're gonna
take over the village, and the bridge.

1461
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,566
And I helped them do it!

1462
01:36:06,567 --> 01:36:09,566
How's this gonna look
on my resume?

1463
01:36:09,567 --> 01:36:13,599
Peace corps, 1962. Handed
village over to the communists.

1464
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,499
Who's gonna hire me?

1465
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,566
Why can't everyone
leave this place alone?

1466
01:36:18,567 --> 01:36:21,332
Never mind!
It's almost dawn.

1467
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:24,165
I don't think we have time
to wire the entire bridge.

1468
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:26,265
You don't have to.

1469
01:36:26,266 --> 01:36:28,132
One charge of dynamite

1470
01:36:28,133 --> 01:36:30,666
placed strategically
in the middle of the bridge,

1471
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:33,366
and the whole thing
will collapse.

1472
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:36,632
Those dirty red bastards…

1473
01:36:36,633 --> 01:36:39,265
They'll never take loong ta.

1474
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:42,999
No, not as long
as there's freedom…

1475
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,632
And justice…

1476
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,766
And Tom tuttle
from Tacoma, Washington.

1477
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,032
Come on, come on!

1478
01:37:01,033 --> 01:37:03,100
Let's go!

1479
01:37:05,767 --> 01:37:07,866
We'll split off right here.

1480
01:37:07,867 --> 01:37:11,233
We'll keep these going all the way down.
Hurry, hurry!

1481

Go, go!

1482
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,799

1483
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,934
Hurry!

1484
01:38:43,066 --> 01:38:45,532
Where's the wire?

1485
01:38:52,333 --> 01:38:54,567
Out of my way!
Give me the wire!

1486
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:05,533
Oh shit!

1487
01:39:07,467 --> 01:39:10,500

Nice bridge, wasn't it?

1494
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:31,133
- Very nice.
- Blow it!

1495
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,066
What have I done?

1496
01:39:39,633 --> 01:39:42,065
You screwed it up!
What's wrong?

1497
01:39:42,066 --> 01:39:45,199
I don't know. Everything's a-okay.
Must be a loose connection…

1498
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,467

1503
01:40:59,433 --> 01:41:01,899
Bourne, this is
the end of the line.

1504
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,766
You make one move towards me,

1505
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,999
and I'll signal
my friends down there

1506
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,599
and they'll blow us both
to kingdom come, and…

1507
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,699

- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do…

1508

I'm gonna kill you,
I'm gonna skin you,

1509
01:41:14,467 --> 01:41:17,099
and I'm gonna use your
shinbone for a pencilbox.

1510
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,599
Ain't nobody around
this time, Bourne.

1511
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,600
It's just you, me…

1512
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,332
And Mike.

1513
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:28,166
- Well, that's fair.
- Stand up.

1514
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,632
You know, there never was a time

1515
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:36,499
when brains didn't
triumph over brawn.

1516
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,966
Let's see what you got, boy.

1517
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:41,165
Oh, I've got brains.

1518
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:44,265
- Is that a Russian mig-25?
- Where?

1519
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:46,400
Oh, darn!

1520
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,467
- Whoa!
- Hit it!

1521
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,734
Lawrence…
where's Lawrence?

1522
01:42:25,834 --> 01:42:27,967
- Lawrence?
- Oh my god!

1523
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:37,599
Out of the way.

1524
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,800
- Lawrence.
- Asshole?

1525
01:42:47,033 --> 01:42:49,700
Lawrence.

1526
01:42:59,367 --> 01:43:03,700
<i>♪ Fight, fight, fight for Washington… ♪</i>

1527
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,265
Dear mother and father,

1528
01:43:18,266 --> 01:43:20,265
I never thought
I'd say this to you,

1529
01:43:20,266 --> 01:43:22,265
but thanks, thanks a bunch.

1530
01:43:22,266 --> 01:43:24,532
The peace corps
has changed my life.

1531
01:43:24,533 --> 01:43:27,632
I've learned the true
meaning of self-reliance,

1532
01:43:27,633 --> 01:43:30,432
commitment, and yes, even caring

1533
01:43:30,433 --> 01:43:32,265
for another human being.

1534
01:43:32,266 --> 01:43:35,399
Now, for the first time in my
life, I'm doing the right thing,

1535
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,666
and for the right reasons.

1536
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:39,966
I'm opening a casino, dad.

1537
01:43:39,967 --> 01:43:42,366
It's called Lawrence's,
after me.

1538
01:43:42,367 --> 01:43:45,099
And this is just the beginning.

1539
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,632
Night elephant races,
professional kickboxing…

1540
01:43:47,633 --> 01:43:50,299
- It's going to be my kind of town.
- Lawrence! Lawrence!

1541
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,866
Well, I've got to run. Time
is opium… uh… money.

1542
01:43:52,867 --> 01:43:56,733
Your loving son, blah,
blah, blah, Lawrence.
