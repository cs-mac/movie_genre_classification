1
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:23,232
<i>As a child, I used to dream...</i>

2
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,359
<i>that I woke up in bed
in the middle of the schoolyard.</i>

3
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,029
<i>It was horrible...
and yet so delightfully wicked.</i>

4
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,949
<i>I'd stay snuggled in bed
- all nice and warm -</i>

5
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,243
<i>while the other kids
had to go to school.</i>

6
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,831
<i>But my happiness would quickly fade...</i>

7
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,792
<i>due to a feeling I could not yet name:</i>

8
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,127
<i>"Guilt".</i>

9
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:49,842
<i>Today, nothing's changed,
I still feel just as guilty.</i>

10
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,386
<i>I stay in bed, paralyzed...</i>

11
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,304
<i>deliciously paralyzed.</i>

12
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:57,808
<i>I think of the hundreds of women...</i>

13
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,018
<i>in hundreds of homes...</i>

14
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:05,065
<i>Energetic, responsible and perfect women...</i>

15
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,901
<i>who started their day hours ago.</i>

16
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:12,865
Mommy, Hector says I look like a dog turd.
It's not true, is it?

17
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,616
What time is it? Let's go!.

18
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,708
You're pathetic.

19
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:27,296
Let's go, time for school. Come on.

20
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:35,012
Shit! Mom...

21
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:37,139
Not now, Hector.

22
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,225
I forgot my gym clothes.
It's too late now!

23
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,897
Hurry up, Mom.
Run, run, we'll be late.

24
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,191
Come on, hurry up!

25
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,901
Goodbye, Mommy.
Goodbye, sweetie.

26
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:53,322
School hours are not made of Lycra,
Mrs. Marsiac.

27
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:58,035
Move your ass, lady!

28
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,498
But you see, life isn't a dream.

29
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,794
9:05 am: grocery shopping.

30
00:03:07,794 --> 00:03:08,921
I told you: no.

31
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,507
No Cocoa Krispies!
Why not a shortage of peanut butter?

32
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:15,093
9:48 am: the dry cleaner's.

33
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:18,013
10:00 am: work.

34
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:22,643
This lovely little piece
would look just fabulous on you.

35
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,520
4:03 pm: business meeting.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,939
Not terrific...

37
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,775
The necklace? No, you.

38
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,568
You look awful.

39
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,280
5:07 pm: home remodeling.

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,451
I understand, Mrs. Gonsalvo,
but he hasn't been here in three weeks.

41
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,204
Tell him I'm trying to reach him.

42
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:44,414
I don't know where he is!
You either?

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,833
5::20 pm: call dentist.

44
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,879
June! That's over three months away.
You're kidding me!

45
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,007
Pretty soon she'll have
two rows of teeth, like a piranha.

46
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:58,053
6:12 pm: bath time.

47
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,513
Hector?

48
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:00,597
Hector?

49
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,140
Hector?

50
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:03,600
Hector?

51
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:07,312
Hey Mom, I beat my record!

52
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,772
Wait till I tell Lucas.

53
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,274
Mommy, the house is on fire!
What?

54
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:12,901
My tablecloth!

55
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,612
Fire, fire!

56
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,538
6:20 pm: three-second rest.

57
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,041
I don't even have time anymore

58
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,668
to play with my man.

59
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,049
He's strong, courageous, solid as a rock,

60
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:37,217
and brawny...

61
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,803
The kind of guy you can depend on.

62
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,640
He'd never let me go hungry.

63
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,903
But that's in the past.

64
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:59,614
The truth is my husband always works.

65
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:02,033
He does have a flair for business.

66
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,493
Hugo,

67
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,747
they want the cement mixers
for two more weeks.

68
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,749
I say we tack on 25%.

69
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:12,878
No. No surcharge. But they sign
an exclusive 2-year contract with us.

70
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,214
He's awesome!

71
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:23,805
When my crazy day finally ends,
I wait for the hero to return.

72
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:10,227
Oh shit.

73
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:14,064
This can't go on, Ariane.
What?

74
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:18,235
What do you mean "what"?
We can't go on living in this mess!

75
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,528
I know...
Did you call Gonsalvo?

76
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,072
What do you do all day long?

77
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,490
I work like a dog.

78
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,617
I can't do everything.

79
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:29,329
You have one goddamn thing to do,
the remodeling!

80
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,914
And you can't even...

81
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,341
And sometimes, your nerves snap.

82
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:54,521
I'm so sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

83
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:59,150
If you'd done it,
I'd have gone straight to the police.

84
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,445
I'm tossing the idea around.

85
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:06,074
What's wrong, Ariane?

86
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,158
Nothing.

87
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,705
I mean, everything.

88
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:13,081
Nothing's right.

89
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,293
I don't get it, you have a dream life.

90
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,461
You have everything.

91
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:21,006
A dream life? You call this a dream life?

92
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,633
I feel like a secret agent:

93
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:27,679
I slave away at invisible missions!

94
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,723
Even the kids think I'm a robot.

95
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:33,601
"Mommy, I need you! Mommy, I want you!
Mommy, I want Mommy!"

96
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:36,062
And who cares about me? No one.

97
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:39,441
You think I enjoy talking money
all year long

98
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,651
while I miss seeing the kids grow up?

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,612
Look. You know what this is?

100
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,948
Fifteen years of business lunches

101
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:50,326
with guys who think you're gay
if you don't eat like a truck driver.

102
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:55,331
Sometimes I'd like to change places.

103
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,917
Ok.

104
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:02,005
Ok, what?
We'll change places. I agree.

105
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,675
I'm dead serious, Hugo.

106
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,763
I think we'd better go to bed.

107
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,644
Ok, I'll make an effort.

108
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,897
No you won't,
your priorities lie elsewhere.

109
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,940
Only your work counts.

110
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,443
That's not true.
Oh no?

111
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:25,570
Your daughter Louise just turned six.

112
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,239
Was her Daddy at her birthday party?
No!

113
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:31,034
Nor when she turned five, four or three!

114
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,786
You think that's normal?

115
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,747
I was there when she turned two.
It was on a Sunday.

116
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:39,667
Your kids are not a priority.
A priority is what comes first.

117
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,547
Ok, tell me what I can do.

118
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:50,803
You can take Louise to her 11:30
doctor's appointment tomorrow.

119
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,264
11:30 tomorrow?

120
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:55,058
Impossible.

121
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,267
There you go.
What?

122
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,394
"There you go" what?

123
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:02,315
The entire staff of Caterpillar
is coming at 11 :30,

124
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,816
so excuse me for hesitating!

125
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,860
Never offer your help again.

126
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:10,031
Hang on. I'll go.

127
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,617
I'll go, it's Ok.

128
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:25,588
Hello? Are they there? Already?

129
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:29,133
Ok, don't panic.
Show them our equipment.

130
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:32,804
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
Ok, see you later.

131
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:44,565
Already? What did you do,
run them through the place?

132
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,109
It's raining?

133
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,195
Ok, have them wait.

134
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:52,615
I don't know,
give them peanuts to nibble on.

135
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,033
Louise Marsiac? Yes!

136
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,285
It's your turn.

137
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,329
Ok. Quick, hurry up, move it!

138
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,458
Everything's fine. They're waiting.

139
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,626
I thought I'd never make it.

140
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:06,296
What happened to you?
My wife hit me.

141
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,589
Very funny!

142
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,721
Hello gentlemen. Hugo Marsiac.
Sorry I'm late.

143
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:18,057
Pleased to meet you. Ok, let's go.

144
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:28,276
Hello?
What the hell did you do?

145
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:29,235
What?

146
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,612
What did you do with Louise?

147
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:35,283
Louise?
You didn't forget her somewhere?

148
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,618
Forget her somewhere? Oh, shit!

149
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,039
Get in the car, sweetie. Come on.

150
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,293
Oh shit! Shit, shit, shit...

151
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:48,629
Yes, I know.
Ok, I'm coming, I'll be right there!

152
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:54,469
Daddy!

153
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:57,221
The police brought her home.

154
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,015
She was alone in the street!

155
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,808
Do you realize

156
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,603
you left her in front
of the doctor's office!

157
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:05,563
Do you realize?

158
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,485
Ariane, Ariane

159
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,363
Ariane, wait. Listen to me...

160
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,699
Ariane

161
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,578
Ok, I accept.

162
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:28,211
We'll change.
You take my place and I'll take yours.

163
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:57,949
She's replacing you... completely?

164
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,077
Yes, completely.

165
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:02,954
Hugo

166
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:08,709
did I ever once
lie to you during the past 15 years?

167
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,460
No.

168
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,836
Then...

169
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,215
why won't you tell me the truth?

170
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,009
I am telling you the truth.

171
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,094
Ariane, my wife...

172
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:23,808
is going to replace me...
for a certain period of time.

173
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,728
You're ill, aren't you?

174
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:30,940
And you're going away to a clinic.

175
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,787
You want us to go under?
I remind you, we sell jewelry.

176
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:45,871
So what?

177
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:50,084
So what? Your husband
can't tell pale pink from fuchsia.

178
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:54,297
Ariane, he only has yellow trucks!

179
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,551
Listen to me, Charlotte,

180
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,554
this is a highly unusual experiment.

181
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:04,056
I know most people won't understand,

182
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:06,976
but I'm doing it to save our couple.

183
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:08,894
And it's not my husband's
supposed bad taste

184
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:11,022
that'll stop us, Ok?

185
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:13,024
Ok.

186
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:17,528
Mr. Gon alvo, it's Ariane Marsiac.
Once again.

187
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:21,365
I understand you're busy,

188
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:26,912
but if you could find some time for us,
we'd really appreciate it.

189
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:30,124
I guess that's it.
I'll be expecting your call. Goodbye.

190
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:34,795
You'll never get anywhere like that.

191
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:37,089
Maurice Cantuis, judicial officer.

192
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,842
Member of the Judicial Officers' Union.

193
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:42,344
You contacted us I believe?
No.

194
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:46,390
Your husband left us a message
this morning at 8:30 am.

195
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,559
And we're not the kind to dawdle.

196
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,896
It's the Union's strength and motto:

197
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:55,107
"Act fast, act well, act."

198
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,904
You think you can do something?
Unfortunately, no.

199
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:03,324
Unless you signed
a late delivery clause.

200
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,076
No, I don't think so.

201
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,369
It can be a costly oversight.

202
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:11,707
If I may give you
some professional advice...

203
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,209
Please do.

204
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:15,461
You're far too accommodating,
Mrs. Marsiac.

205
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,591
This gentlemen...
Mr. Gon alvo.

206
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,677
He's playing games with you.
You think so?

207
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,137
Kindness will get you nowhere.

208
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:26,764
What should I do?

209
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,642
Don't say,
"l understand you're busy."

210
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:32,812
Say, "Frankly,
what do you do all day long?"

211
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:36,565
Mrs. Marsiac, you must provoke him.

212
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:38,651
I can't do that.

213
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:40,653
Do you have a choice?

214
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,660
Do you want things to change,

215
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,495
or continue like this?

216
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,248
I want them to change.

217
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:55,376
Then start by changing yourself.

218
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,419
The rest will fall into place.

219
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:01,841
Excuse me,

220
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,636
would you be free for dinner?

221
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,600
He thinks you're after him.

222
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,185
He won't when he sees you.

223
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,104
He'll think it's for a three-way.

224
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:18,858
Good evening.

225
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,737
Hugo, my husband.
Maurice Cantuis.

226
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,489
Come in.

227
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,470
Thank you.

228
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:57,730
You really impressed me earlier.

229
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,897
I did?

230
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:02,901
I knew at once we could get along.
Isn't that right, honey?

231
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,738
Yes.

232
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,490
Maurice... May I call you Maurice?

233
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,075
Yes.

234
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,661
My husband and I are going through

235
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,413
a difficult period.

236
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,709
But we've decided to save our couple.

237
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,337
Even if it requires audacity.

238
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:26,633
We have an offer to make...

239
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:31,263
I want you to know,
this wasn't my idea.

240
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,890
Are you backing out?
No.

241
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,725
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

242
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,477
Hugo, it's too late.
Maurice is here.

243
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:38,562
It's never too late.

244
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:42,441
My husband and I want to swap...

245
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,444
our lives.

246
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,073
For one year.

247
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,282
One year?

248
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:52,993
This is a novel experiment,

249
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:57,206
and we need someone
who can guide us along the way.

250
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,376
Someone disciplined,

251
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:01,835
who has thorough understanding
of human nature.

252
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,004
A "life coach", so to speak.

253
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:06,215
And we thought of you.

254
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:07,466
What do you say?

255
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,473
Well... think it over.

256
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:17,643
Yes. Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

257
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,159
Hello, who is it?

258
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,202
Maurice Cantuis.

259
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:38,372
Who?
Cantuis, the judicial officer.

260
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:39,289
Who is it?

261
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,041
Maurice what's-his-name.
The judicial officer.

262
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,794
Do you still need a coach?
Uh, yes.

263
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,546
Can I come over?
Now?

264
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:46,755
I changed my mind.

265
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,799
He wants to come over now.
Say yes!

266
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,676
Ok, see you in a while.

267
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:56,139
As a judicial officer
I often enter people's lives.

268
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,518
Twenty years of experience
gives you far better knowledge

269
00:17:59,518 --> 00:18:03,355
of human nature
than any psychology degree...

270
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,774
They took Mother's portrait!

271
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:09,361
I know, Anne-France.
I personally made sure it went.

272
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:10,487
Dirty bastard.

273
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,406
Especially couples' relations...

274
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:14,783
It's Chlo, from my gym class!

275
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,244
"l love your pussy"?

276
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,662
What'll we do?

277
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,331
What about our cycling holiday?
It'll be fine.

278
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,250
But they're taking the bicycles.

279
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:27,004
Observing couples

280
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:29,006
and their behavior has become
second nature to me.

281
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,596
The true interest of your experiment

282
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:37,848
is not simply swapping roles.

283
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,392
What you must do

284
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:43,979
is swap natures.

285
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:45,022
What's that mean?

286
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:48,817
"Romance" and "intuition" for Hugo.

287
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:52,362
"Simplicity" and "seduction" for Ariane.

288
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,283
Romance...

289
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:57,784
Seduction...

290
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:01,455
I have to face facts, my dear,

291
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,790
I completely failed your education.

292
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,459
Stop it, Mom.

293
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,587
My generation
fought to become free women,

294
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:09,838
not men.

295
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,799
Your generation made amazing progress.

296
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,802
But your daughters
are a bundle of complexes.

297
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:19,473
You always exaggerate.
No, I don't.

298
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:21,391
Not at all.

299
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,185
Social injustices are no reason
to wreck your couple.

300
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:26,730
I'm not wrecking it, I'm saving it.

301
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,231
What about the kids?

302
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,776
How are they going to react?

303
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:32,361
Kids are like everyone else.

304
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,654
You just have to explain things.

305
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:45,832
Well?

306
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:47,626
What do you say?

307
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,628
I want to stay with Mommy.

308
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:53,006
But we're not splitting up.

309
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:56,718
It's just that,
I'm going to do what Daddy did.

310
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:59,304
And Daddy will do what Mommy did.

311
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:01,181
It's an experiment, that's all.

312
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:03,433
I'd rather you got divorced.

313
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:08,605
Other parents don't do experiments,
they get divorced.

314
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,198
Maurice Cantuis/Judicial Officer

315
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:23,620
Your contract stipulates
a change of professions,

316
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,122
duties and timetables
for a one-year period.

317
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,666
The protocol includes
private coaching sessions with me,

318
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,752
and frequent updates.

319
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:35,340
Initial each page and sign at the end

320
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,176
after writing: "Read and approved".
There you go.

321
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:44,432
"Mr. Maurice Cantuis' fees: 1 0,000 euros"?

322
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:46,351
Plus expenses.

323
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,527
So?

324
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,406
Happy to start a new life?
Vert happy.

325
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:00,782
Me too.

326
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:04,744
I've been slaving away for 1 5 years.
I could use the rest.

327
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:17,674
Sweetheart...
Yes?

328
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,969
Your side now, is the other side.

329
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,053
Oh, yeah.

330
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:48,246
You didn't even notice.

331
00:21:48,246 --> 00:21:50,582
Yes I did, it's very pretty.

332
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:57,339
What's this?

333
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:58,840
What's this?

334
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,468
Chocolate teddy bears.

335
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:08,850
Chocolate teddy bears!

336
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,686
Chocolate...

337
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,153
6:00 am. Goodbye to the old me.

338
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,281
Hugo filled me in on my new job.

339
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,705
I'm ready to play "hero".
I've dreamt of this for so long.

340
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,459
After all, I went to college too.

341
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:41,591
Honey...

342
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,636
Honey, the keys.

343
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:47,180
The car keys.

344
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,849
I need them to go to work.

345
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,313
And where's your phone?

346
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,818
We said "everything".

347
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:14,707
No need to push the revs.
It's got power.

348
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:19,754
Two fingers on the wheel, Ok?

349
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,965
Ok, honey, you can go.

350
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:26,428
Come on, back up.

351
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:27,595
Is something wrong?

352
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:30,682
You're standing behind the car, Hugo.

353
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:32,225
Sorry, my mistake.

354
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:36,396
Easy does it.

355
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,148
I am!

356
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,882
Phase 1 : change your nature.

357
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:07,051
Don't focus on detail, have fun!
Ok.

358
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:11,097
"Simple and efficient."
Find the man lying dormant in you.

359
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:11,931
Got it.

360
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,148
The man lying dormant in me.

361
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:25,195
The man lying dormant in me.

362
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:49,886
The man lying dormant in me...

363
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,295
RENT-YOUR-TOOL

364
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,924
Supervise check signing
and survey her every move.

365
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:31,928
Trust me, Hugo.
I have to go, she's coming.

366
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,349
Hello.

367
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:38,810
Black coffee, like your husband.
Thanks.

368
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:44,691
Is it too hot?
No, no.

369
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:47,944
I'll introduce you around.
Welcome to Rent-Your-Tool.

370
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:52,115
I'd like a list of all female employees,
their wages and skills.

371
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,241
What for?

372
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,828
Gender equality is one of my priorities,
Mr. Nicard.

373
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:03,710
What exactly do you mean
by "gender equality"?

374
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:06,879
Ouch, that hurts.

375
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:09,507
Don't move. What's wrong?

376
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:12,468
There's no more Cocoa Krispies.
What do you mean?

377
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:13,761
What's that?

378
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,805
It's not Cocoa Krispies.
Are you sure?

379
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,559
It's even better.
No!

380
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,894
Add some Nesquik.
No!

381
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:25,106
Too late, you'll eat tonight.
Time to go, come on!

382
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:28,484
Are you in favor of outsourcing,

383
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:31,446
or do you believe
we should maintain full control?

384
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:38,161
Well...

385
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:45,293
We will continue to pursue
my husband and Mr. Nicard's strategy.

386
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,795
Which one's that?

387
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,965
Here's the school.

388
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:54,093
Let Daddy manage.
First we park the car, then we go in.

389
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:56,012
You leaving?

390
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:58,389
Nope, just got here. Tough luck!

391
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,515
Thanks.

392
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,277
There you are.

393
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:13,821
It's your obligation
to let kids into school!

394
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,700
It's our obligation from 8:45 to 9:00 am.

395
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,410
After that, gates are closed.

396
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,121
School is not a nightclub.

397
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:34,342
Very good idea, Steven.
You have the go-ahead.

398
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:37,053
Very well,
I think we've covered everything.

399
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:38,721
Unless...

400
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,097
As a matter of fact...

401
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:43,017
Yes, I have an announcement to make.

402
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:48,522
I've decided...

403
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:51,400
to replace the coffee machine.

404
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,738
The "6-8" timeslot is crucial.

405
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:59,825
Your average woman must be able
to juggle several chores at once.

406
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:03,287
Especially between six and eight o'clock
in the evening.

407
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:05,247
Ok, get ready...

408
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:09,502
3, 2, 1, go!

409
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:13,214
You have to start making dinner.

410
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,343
Help with homework...

411
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,512
Six times six?

412
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:21,430
Six times seven?

413
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,391
Six times eight?

414
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:24,642
Give them baths.

415
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:25,726
The bathtub!

416
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,108
Without forgetting dinner.

417
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,776
Dinner!

418
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:40,408
Or their bedtime.

419
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:41,367
Bedtime!

420
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:46,163
And the Prince jumped off his horse.

421
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,958
Yes.
He kissed the Princess.

422
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:52,128
Then they met up later

423
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:54,255
and went to the castle.

424
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:57,717
Then they went to bed...
I mean got married.

425
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,802
They had a big party

426
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:01,303
with the whole family.

427
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:06,726
And then they had lots of children
and lived happily ever after.

428
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:08,018
Not bad.

429
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,313
You need to work on the "bedtime".

430
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:13,941
You could show more affection.
Oh yeah?

431
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:19,905
Hello?
I'll never make it!

432
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:21,824
It's a disaster.

433
00:29:21,824 --> 00:29:24,243
I'll ruin my husband's business.

434
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,747
It's his life's work.
I'm calling it all off!

435
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,206
Excuse me, a client.

436
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:31,250
I'll be right back.

437
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:35,629
No, Ariane, don't do that!

438
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:38,048
Decision-makers
often feel like pretenders.

439
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:42,386
It'll pass.
You don't need to know everything.

440
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:45,347
Your role is to set the pace.

441
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:50,060
That's what people expect.
When you don't know the answer,

442
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,898
you simply say:
"I'll let you know in due time."

443
00:29:53,898 --> 00:29:56,442
Ok.

444
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:14,919
I'm going out for lunch.
Would you like anything?

445
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,218
I'll let you know in due time.

446
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:23,886
All right.

447
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:36,357
Paragraph 12:
"Every man, every woman..."

448
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,277
I imagined you differently.

449
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:44,990
Lise Honfleur. Recognize the name?

450
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,119
I hope your words
will carry more weight than mine.

451
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,287
Please, have a seat.

452
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,249
I need your help.

453
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:54,250
In what way?

454
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,087
To convince my daughter
to abandon this childish idea.

455
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:01,173
It's like a bad novel.

456
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,635
Mrs. Honfleur, I don't believe
you fully understand.

457
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,595
Understand what?

458
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:10,224
The sorry state
of your daughter's couple.

459
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:14,103
My daughter and son-in-law
have their problems...

460
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:17,314
Moreover,
they are two consenting adults.

461
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,150
Mr. Cantuis...

462
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,402
Call me Maurice.

463
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:22,695
Mr. Cantuis...

464
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:28,242
My daughter and her husband
are grownups,

465
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:30,995
they're free to play whatever
absurd and burlesque game...

466
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:34,498
But should anything
happen to my grandchildren,

467
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:35,958
I'll come after you.

468
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,251
Is that clear?

469
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:39,503
Very clear.

470
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:44,967
Adolphe Nicard
suggested something odd today.

471
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:45,968
What's that?

472
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:48,595
He wants us both to sign checks.

473
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:52,099
To avoid any "accounting mistakes".

474
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:54,727
What do you think?

475
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:57,146
I don't know, honey, you two decide.

476
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,148
Hypocrite!

477
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,942
He confessed. It was your idea!

478
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:04,319
You're in contact.
You've broken the rules.

479
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,864
Ok, we're in contact.
I'm worried.

480
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,324
A business can be fragile.

481
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:10,492
Cheater.

482
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:12,786
Liar.

483
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:14,663
Loser.

484
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:16,540
Traitor.

485
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:23,839
We agreed. I stay out of your life,
you stay out of mine.

486
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,049
Eat your dinner, kids.
I don't like it.

487
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,885
It's cold in the middle.

488
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:29,887
It's not cold, sweetie, it's lukewarm.

489
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,488
You know how long
that machine's been here?

490
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,364
200 years?

491
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:51,909
Believe me, it was time to change it.

492
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:57,539
Excuse me, here's the new lay-out
for our price brochure.

493
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:58,957
What do you think?

494
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:03,045
I'll let you know in due time.

495
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:17,184
I'm not sure about this pink.
What is it?

496
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,895
Topaz.

497
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,564
Isn't Topaz yellow?

498
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:28,237
Yes. Except when it's pink.
Like this.

499
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:29,863
What do you think?

500
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:33,492
It's functional.

501
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:38,413
Look...

502
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:43,627
It goes with everything.

503
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:45,462
It's waterproof.

504
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:48,840
And look... it's not flimsy.

505
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,634
It's sturdy material.

506
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:53,220
It's nice, no?

507
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:55,597
Well?

508
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:57,683
No.

509
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:05,315
Well?

510
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:08,735
I knew it.

511
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:10,862
You're not cut out for this job.

512
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:19,204
When you want something from a woman,
it all comes down

513
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:21,331
to one word: foreplay.

514
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't understand.

515
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:28,964
You lack patience.
You need to use a gentler approach.

516
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:33,385
You must touch their subconscious,
arouse their desire...

517
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:36,179
You must make them
want to make love with you.

518
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:43,687
Quality, advice and good prices:

519
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,981
that's what made
Rent-Your-Tool a success.

520
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:49,276
I was sincere, not a streetwalker.

521
00:34:57,284 --> 00:35:00,495
Ok. Even if I already know it,
tell me again.

522
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:03,498
Tell me exactly what "foreplay" is.

523
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:09,046
For the shrimp and avocado salad,

524
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:11,548
you need shrimp and avocados
that's easy so far

525
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:15,552
but first, let's discuss
the origin of the word "avocado".

526
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:20,682
The word "avocado"
comes from the Spanish word "aguacate"

527
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,185
And the Spanish word "aguacate"
comes from an Aztec word

528
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:25,062
which means "testicle"!

529
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:28,774
It is in fact an analogy
to the well-known organ.

530
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:32,486
That's what I call
a new take on recipes!

531
00:35:38,408 --> 00:35:40,452
I hung all the clothes to dry.

532
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:43,246
Everything.
Even the socks, one by one.

533
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,165
And I folded the rest.

534
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,755
You're not interested?

535
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,844
You want me to congratulate you?

536
00:35:57,844 --> 00:36:01,515
Very well, congratulations
for hanging the laundry.

537
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,392
I just wanted to talk about it.

538
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,686
I never used to talk about it.

539
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:13,151
I came across a new hiding place.

540
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,488
How many do you have?

541
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:20,575
By the way, did you call Gonsalvo?

542
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:24,704
I'm sorry... I didn't have time.
The day just flew by.

543
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:33,547
Gonsalvo, please leave a message.

544
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,465
Mr. Gonsalvo, it's Hugo Marsiac.

545
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:39,594
Ok, it's very simple:
either you show up soon

546
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:42,097
or I'll smash your house to smithereens.

547
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:43,139
I'm waiting for your call.

548
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,691
Mr. Gon alvo?

549
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,987
Mr. Gon alvo!

550
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,367
Did you see the time?

551
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:05,745
Don't think your threats scared me,
Mr. Marsiac.

552
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,372
No one threatens me.

553
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:08,331
Comprende?

554
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:11,793
The fact is,
I'm having a real hard time.

555
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,169
My wife left me.

556
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:15,964
Work is my only relief.

557
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:18,967
So I'll be here day and night,
even on weekends.

558
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,260
Even on weekends?

559
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,348
I've had my suspicions for weeks.

560
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:26,558
I don't understand.

561
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:29,352
Flanvart has been spying
for Big Machine.

562
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:31,271
His brother-in-law works there.

563
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,564
That's him.

564
00:37:32,564 --> 00:37:33,231
Are you sure?

565
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,150
No. I'm certain.

566
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,526
We must act fast.

567
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:40,739
In your position, Ariane,
you must not be perceived as weak.

568
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:42,824
You must act at once.

569
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:54,794
Why are you doing this?
You're not happy here?

570
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,380
Yes, but I have to protect myself.

571
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,381
How's that?

572
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,842
You really think
I'm spying for Big Machine?

573
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:02,927
That's absurd.

574
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:06,681
But I'll switch sides
before we go under.

575
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:10,060
Our competitors are slowly taking over.

576
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:16,649
I want a report.

577
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:21,654
Excuse me?

578
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:24,574
I want a detailed report
on our competition.

579
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:26,659
You want to fight, Nicolas?

580
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,286
We'll fight.

581
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:32,373
Efficiency and seduction...

582
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:34,417
After three months, look at me.

583
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,055
Mr. Marsiac?

584
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,187
I don't believe it.

585
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,275
It's not mine, it's my wife's.

586
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:05,073
Give it to your kids.

587
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:10,411
You got it?
Now we move on to another level.

588
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,082
It's time to charm them!

589
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,344
No, it's not quite right...

590
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:35,979
Did you read this?

591
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,773
Yes, why?

592
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,275
I loved it.

593
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:42,110
Really?

594
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,114
Yes. Oh, I know
it's not classical literature...

595
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:47,991
Oh, no...

596
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:51,160
But I don't care.
The story's well thought out.

597
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,454
It was almost... orgasmic!

598
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:57,333
I must say, I'm delighted...

599
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,877
To finally discover a man who...

600
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:03,923
And the end of the story...
it was so moving.

601
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:05,466
You know, when she...

602
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:08,803
When she discovers he's married!

603
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:11,639
I almost cried.

604
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,224
Me too.

605
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:18,646
You know what...

606
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:22,483
I think I'll take the whole set.

607
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:24,986
No...
Yes.

608
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,779
Is it reasonable?

609
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,049
My dear man.

610
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,051
We've got to immortalize this.

611
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,595
Stand over there.

612
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:52,430
Go on. Smile!

613
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,765
Look intelligent!

614
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,016
Perfect...

615
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:56,225
There we go.

616
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,817
What?
Nothing.

617
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,116
What's this?
My resignation.

618
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:15,328
Flanvart struts about,
bragging that you asked him for a report.

619
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:17,622
It's a slap in the face for me.

620
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:19,957
Never, Ariane,

621
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:23,086
in the 1 5 years that I've worked here,

622
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:25,546
have I felt so humiliated.

623
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,805
Come on.
What are you doing?

624
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,640
Taking you to lunch.
No, no.

625
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,810
What's that, Adolphe?
My coffee.

626
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,853
We need to talk.
No.

627
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,021
Yes.

628
00:41:42,522 --> 00:41:48,402
I'm hesitating between
kidneys and prime rib.

629
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:49,946
Prime rib.

630
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,656
And for the gentleman?

631
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:52,824
I'll take the same.

632
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:55,326
An appetizer?
Not for me.

633
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,245
I eat light at lunch.

634
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,704
How about snails?

635
00:41:58,704 --> 00:41:59,831
No, thanks.

636
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:03,292
You're right, we'll keep it simple.
Shrimp cocktails.

637
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:05,920
Half a bottle of house red?

638
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,380
Yes, please.
Oh, no!

639
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,133
St. Emilion '95. A full bottle.

640
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:13,386
I like it robust.
Otherwise, why not drink water?

641
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:14,387
Of course.

642
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:48,504
Can't finish?
No.

643
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:51,799
Two espressos?

644
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,385
Two espressos with apple brandy.

645
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:56,429
Perhaps you prefer cognac?

646
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:01,934
I must admit, you surprise me a bit.

647
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,020
Oh, really?
Yes.

648
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,521
I thought you were...

649
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,523
What?
I don't know...

650
00:43:07,523 --> 00:43:09,692
Like all these other women you see.

651
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:12,528
What are they like?
I don't know.

652
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,197
Not like you.
You're not like them.

653
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:19,660
You and them, you're not the same.
I can't explain.

654
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:23,372
Adolphe.
Yes, Ariane.

655
00:43:24,165 --> 00:43:25,750
Don't resign.

656
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,835
Oh no...
Give me three months.

657
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:31,172
After that,
you can leave if you want.

658
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:33,215
With severance pay.
No, no...

659
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,425
But for now,

660
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:36,510
I'm asking you to trust me.

661
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:44,935
Here's to three months.

662
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:51,067
I'd love a cigar. How about you?
Yes.

663
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,783
You behaved like a man, Ariane.
Brilliant.

664
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:02,203
You did exactly what you should've.

665
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:04,455
Yeah, right.

666
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,999
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.

667
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,793
Keep up the good work.

668
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:11,545
Thanks. Goodbye.

669
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:17,426
Stepping into Hugo's shoes
is no cup of tea.

670
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,138
I wonder how he's getting along....

671
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:24,141
This is my son, Hector. He's nine.

672
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,810
My daughter Louise is six.

673
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,479
They're so cute!

674
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:30,356
Yes, but he can be a real rascal.

675
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,357
Are you strict?

676
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:33,776
I can't be strict, I feel too guilty.

677
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:36,570
You know the secret to educating kids?

678
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,906
Accepting that they hate you.

679
00:44:38,906 --> 00:44:42,451
Hello, girls. Sweetheart, I'm off.

680
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,620
Hello, sir.
Hello.

681
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:46,414
See you later, darling.

682
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:47,581
What about the jewelry?

683
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:48,290
Yes, the jewelry!

684
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,750
We have plenty of time.

685
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,460
Let's see the jewelry.

686
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,089
I'd love some orange juice.
Oh no! The jewelry!

687
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,174
You're working me to the bone!

688
00:45:04,473 --> 00:45:05,975
Better and better!

689
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:07,268
But we've hit a ceiling.

690
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:08,435
What?

691
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:10,271
We'd sell far more

692
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,857
if the clients came to us.

693
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:15,609
It's impossible. The workshop's a mess.

694
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:17,653
I've thought it over.
What?

695
00:45:18,988 --> 00:45:21,657
Wow!

696
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:23,784
We'll totally rearrange it. Redecorate.

697
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:25,786
I'd like something kind of cozy.

698
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:33,002
Something refined,
inviting, comfortable...

699
00:45:33,002 --> 00:45:34,879
You like it?

700
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:37,840
We'll spoil them silly
and sell them tons!

701
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:41,927
What's wrong?

702
00:45:47,016 --> 00:45:49,435
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:54,982
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:54,982 --> 00:45:57,651
No. It's my fault. I'm sorry.
I'm the one who started.

705
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:00,863
No... Yes... No, we can't.
This is pathetic.

706
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:07,578
No, it's wrong.

707
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:12,458
No, no.
We can't, period!

708
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,002
Charlotte, no...

709
00:46:15,002 --> 00:46:16,837
No, you're right.

710
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:32,311
CUPlD'S lNN

711
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:42,529
Wait for me here.

712
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:51,705
Hello, sir.

713
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:53,040
Hello.

714
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:54,833
I'd like a room.

715
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,251
For how many people?

716
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:57,961
Two.

717
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,463
For how many nights?

718
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:03,300
This afternoon to start with.

719
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,343
Very well, sir.

720
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:06,470
Under what name?

721
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:10,724
What name do I put in our register?

722
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:13,602
What register?
The hotel register, sir.

723
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:15,646
Here you are.

724
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:19,566
Thank you.

725
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:22,653
Excuse me, is this a "c"?

726
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:28,409
Yes.
"Marciac"?

727
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:29,952
No! It's not a "c".

728
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:32,079
Oh, I'm sorry: "Mauriac".

729
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,038
No.

730
00:47:33,038 --> 00:47:34,623
Well, is it a "t"?

731
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:37,751
Yes, that's it, a "t".

732
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:39,753
"Martian"?

733
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:42,172
Yes.

734
00:47:42,172 --> 00:47:45,467
Very well, Mr. Martian. This way please.

735
00:48:00,107 --> 00:48:01,108
Hang on.

736
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:08,407
How about like this?

737
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:09,950
Oops, sorrt.

738
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,913
This isn't going to work.
You sure?

739
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:16,206
Yes.

740
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,834
You know what I think?

741
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:22,129
That we don't really want to make love.

742
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:24,548
Exactly. We're like two girlfriends.

743
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:30,512
My turn now.
Not of me.

744
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:34,057
Yes, you. Like a Roman emperor.

745
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,603
The right foot...

746
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:53,368
We're losing ground
with private rentals?

747
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:55,996
Evert day.

748
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,874
What do you suggest?

749
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,753
Hello?
Ariane, it's Charlotte.

750
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,588
Who?
Charlotte, your friend.

751
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:06,673
Sorry, I was elsewhere.

752
00:49:06,673 --> 00:49:08,675
How are you?
Uh, fine.

753
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:11,219
What can I do for you?
Nothing...

754
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,931
No, nothing.
I just wanted to tell you,

755
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,016
it's great working with Hugo.

756
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:19,144
I was totally wrong about him.

757
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:20,520
He's fantastic.

758
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,105
Listen, I can't talk now.

759
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:24,191
Sorry.

760
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,735
We'll get together for lunch.

761
00:49:26,735 --> 00:49:28,195
Sure. When?

762
00:49:28,195 --> 00:49:31,490
I don't have my calendar...

763
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,742
Ok, no problem.

764
00:49:33,742 --> 00:49:35,160
Bye.

765
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,120
We'll talk soon.

766
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,169
So...

767
00:49:47,255 --> 00:49:49,091
Want me to heat something up?

768
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:53,136
There's some spinach au gratin.

769
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,057
How's that sound?

770
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:00,560
That's it!

771
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:02,938
It'll be fabulous!

772
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:04,481
It's just spinach au gratin.

773
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:09,778
I'll heat it up

774
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,741
Don't thank me.
It was female solidarity.

775
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:16,326
Your wife washes your shirts?

776
00:50:16,326 --> 00:50:17,452
Yes.

777
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:29,589
We're going to make toys?
Not exactly.

778
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,092
Who's married here?

779
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:35,679
Whose wives do the heavy work?

780
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:40,726
What if their husbands
couldn't use tools?

781
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:43,478
Or if they were single,
like 30%% of women?

782
00:50:43,478 --> 00:50:45,063
Would they be clients?

783
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:46,356
No.

784
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:49,234
Rent-Your-Tool is going to help them.

785
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:53,989
We're going to rent our machines...

786
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,575
with workmen as an optional extra.

787
00:50:58,034 --> 00:50:59,703
Handsome ones, naturally.

788
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:03,582
Is your proposal a "service"
or prostitution?

789
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,208
It's a fabulous idea.

790
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,085
A stroke of genius.

791
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:09,171
And I weigh my words.

792
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,006
I love it.

793
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:14,092
It's terrific!

794
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:18,346
Gentlemen, a new era begins
for Rent-Your-Tool.

795
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:20,765
Hello, darling.

796
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:22,684
Oh, you're home. Hi.

797
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:25,562
I just put the kids to bed.

798
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:27,981
I promised you'd kiss them goodnight.

799
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,285
I love your ass.

800
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,999
Go kiss them goodnight, I promised.

801
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:49,252
Ok, I heard you. I'm going.

802
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:51,129
What's wrong?

803
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,298
I had a rough day.

804
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:06,102
Mrs. Legendre is requested at
the check-out stand for payment refusal.

805
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:08,897
He spent all his wife's money!

806
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,608
The posters are snazzy.

807
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:13,944
What about the 6 x 1 2s?

808
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:16,529
Spaces are reserved.
We're ready.

809
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:18,240
We still need the male model.

810
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:20,617
Yes, the male model...

811
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:22,494
One moment.

812
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,081
It's your husband.

813
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:30,210
Are you busy?
Sort of. What's up?

814
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,963
I'm at the grocery store.
My card's maxed.

815
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:37,217
I just transferred money
into your account.

816
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:41,805
There's a 20%%% sale on.
I saw no reason to wait.

817
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:44,224
Louise has nothing left to wear.

818
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:46,768
You know, I've had it.

819
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:49,312
You obviously don't do the shopping!

820
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:52,399
Ok, I picked blue clothes.

821
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:54,693
I'm sick of girls in pink.

822
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:58,780
And for some reason,
blue is more expensive.

823
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,323
Weird, isn't it?
I'll put it back,

824
00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:03,868
but then you do the shopping yourself.

825
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:07,288
I'm tired of you saying
I throw money out the window!

826
00:53:14,295 --> 00:53:17,882
I'll take care of it later.
I have to go now.

827
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,052
Where were we?

828
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:23,304
The advertising agency...

829
00:53:24,264 --> 00:53:25,724
Thank you, Adolphe.

830
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:34,441
I'm from a small town.

831
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:36,192
After you...

832
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:41,573
It was my mother
who wanted to move to Paris.

833
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:43,867
Do you like the countryside?

834
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:46,578
I like taking boat rides at sunset.

835
00:53:46,578 --> 00:53:48,747
It's very romantic. I love watching ducks.

836
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:51,082
Forget the ducks, lamb!

837
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:52,250
Here I am,

838
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,588
experimenting with
the "stronger sex's" behavior patterns.

839
00:53:56,588 --> 00:54:00,049
Come on, relax.

840
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:08,850
Good evening.

841
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:13,938
Don't think I proposed
this date to make peace.

842
00:54:13,938 --> 00:54:14,731
A pity.

843
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:16,483
My daughter's marriage is sinking.

844
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:19,777
It's time to act.

845
00:54:19,777 --> 00:54:23,573
Excuse my bluntness,
but a mother's viewpoint isn't best.

846
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,075
Whose is?

847
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:29,078
A woman's.

848
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:30,663
Women are often more...
No, spare me.

849
00:54:30,663 --> 00:54:32,415
I've heard your feeble theories:

850
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:35,877
"Men are dumb, women pains in the ass."

851
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:37,670
It's so banal.

852
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,048
I never said that.
Then what do you say?

853
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:45,178
Women are often too complicated,
and men not enough.

854
00:54:45,178 --> 00:54:48,723
I call that primitive psychology.

855
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:50,308
Soon you'll be telling me

856
00:54:50,308 --> 00:54:53,436
that lions hunts gazelles,
that it's all part of nature.

857
00:54:53,436 --> 00:54:56,481
Commonplace nonsense.

858
00:54:56,481 --> 00:54:58,024
And yet they do.

859
00:54:58,816 --> 00:55:00,276
Who? What?

860
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:03,571
Lions. They hunt gazelles.

861
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,699
Mr. Cantuis...

862
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:09,577
the only terms to describe you

863
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:11,913
are imposture and mediocrity.

864
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:14,207
At least I'm whole.

865
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:16,042
Sexual, if you prefer.

866
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:19,587
I don't hide under superior airs.

867
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:22,465
When I see you sitting here,

868
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,718
I see a woman, not a mental concept.

869
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:30,265
I see your eyes, your mouth...

870
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:34,852
The fullness of your breasts...

871
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:37,480
I feel your warmth,

872
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:41,693
I imagine the softness of your skin...

873
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:47,532
I feel desire, even excitement.

874
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,790
It's nature, you can't fight it.

875
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:00,086
Goodnight.

876
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:03,631
Thank you for the invitation.

877
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:09,679
But... I didn't invite you.

878
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:15,727
Daddy, Hector says
I look like a mammoth turd.

879
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:19,188
It's not true, is it?
Why are you up?

880
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:20,773
Oh, shit.

881
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:25,403
Come on. Hurry up!

882
00:56:25,403 --> 00:56:27,572
See you later, Daddy.

883
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:29,157
I'm so sorry.

884
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,078
You didn't need to run.
I'd have waited.

885
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:35,204
Thanks.

886
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:37,957
You're just adorable.

887
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:43,421
I'll get going.

888
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:54,348
Move it, buddy!

889
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:57,935
We don't have all day!

890
00:56:58,478 --> 00:57:00,021
TOOLS & MEN

891
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,063
RENT-YOUR-TOOL

892
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:23,711
Big Engine was preparing an attack.
We had to act.

893
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,713
It was the deal: separate lives.

894
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:27,215
It's brilliant!

895
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,551
You're brilliant!

896
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:31,677
Oh, yes.

897
00:57:32,178 --> 00:57:34,055
You really like the idea?

898
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:36,474
"Tools & Men".
You'll make a killing!

899
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:39,727
I'll push your services
to my jewelry clients.

900
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,486
Don't change a thing.

901
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:52,073
You seem to be doing better.

902
00:57:52,782 --> 00:57:55,409
Ok, I have to go.

903
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,663
How's it going?

904
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:03,417
Hey there. Working hard?

905
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:17,640
Some people claim
the die is cast at age three...

906
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:23,104
Hugo, at age 40, was completely
overhauling his personality.

907
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:23,164
Keep your shoes on, it excites me.

908
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:43,642
Total happiness.

909
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:44,894
Me as a man,

910
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:46,437
Hugo as a woman...

911
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,355
And all we had to do was do it.

912
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:49,982
It's like bungee jumping.

913
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:52,777
The leap is hard.
After that, it's pure bliss...

914
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:59,909
Only, you don't take the kids
bungee jumping.

915
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:01,368
What happened?
I don't know.

916
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:02,369
Hurry up!

917
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:05,831
It must be serious if they called.

918
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:08,459
It's just a parent-teacher meeting.

919
01:00:08,459 --> 01:00:10,211
Then why was it so urgent?

920
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,879
Calm down.

921
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:19,720
Hello.

922
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,388
Hello. Hello, Mr. Marsiac.

923
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:22,515
We came as fast...

924
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:23,974
What's this all about?

925
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:26,310
Hector's teacher alerted me at once.

926
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,187
It happened during recess.

927
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,074
He didn't deny it.

928
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:44,453
He said he didn't
have parents anymore.

929
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:49,041
We're considering expelling him.

930
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:53,754
There must be an explanation,
I know my son.

931
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:56,173
Your son is not well, Mr. Marsiac.

932
01:00:56,173 --> 01:01:00,094
His behavior indicates
a loss of emotional stability.

933
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:01,720
Ok, knock it off.

934
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,097
Excuse me?

935
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,975
Don't lay your guilt trips on me!

936
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:08,519
So what! Hector let off some steam.

937
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:12,731
He was right, this place is the pits.

938
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:15,192
At least his work shows character.

939
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:17,403
It looks like modern art.
I like it!

940
01:01:17,403 --> 01:01:19,697
Please excuse her. She's overworked.

941
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:22,658
I know the educational field
is very demanding...

942
01:01:22,658 --> 01:01:24,743
You want to expel Hector, you old bag?

943
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,704
Who cares! I'll put him in Montessori.

944
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:30,165
At least there
he'll be able to express himself.

945
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:31,792
We'll talk to him...

946
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:34,003
I can't believe how bitter she is.

947
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:39,800
We'll pay for the repairs,
it goes without saying.

948
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,138
Honestly, I don't think expelling him
will be necessary.

949
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:46,348
Thank you, ma'am. Goodbye.

950
01:01:50,102 --> 01:01:52,521
I didn't see a thing.

951
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:55,524
I've always felt connected
to my children,

952
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:57,484
but I didn't see anything coming.

953
01:01:57,484 --> 01:02:00,321
Our ten-year-old son
destroys his classroom,

954
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:03,741
at the risk of being
expelled from school...

955
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:05,659
And I saw nothing.

956
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,663
It's normal, I'm never here.

957
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,540
I'm always working.

958
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:13,959
What do you think?

959
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:15,169
About what?

960
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:24,428
I plucked between my eyebrows.

961
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:26,764
What do you think?

962
01:02:27,598 --> 01:02:28,474
It's better, no?

963
01:02:33,395 --> 01:02:34,396
What's wrong?

964
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,565
It'll grow back!

965
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:38,400
Don't get all worked up.

966
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:42,362
I'll use eye crayon.

967
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:43,822
There!

968
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:47,951
Cloudy skies and rain
on this first day of vacation,

969
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:52,456
but don't lose hope: things should be
looking up by tomorrow.

970
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:57,211
I have to go. You deal with it.

971
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:03,092
It's the protocol...

972
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:05,886
I don't have time,
my kids are going on vacation.

973
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:08,222
...for the campaign launch.

974
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:12,392
Could you...

975
01:03:12,392 --> 01:03:14,228
I don't have time!

976
01:04:02,818 --> 01:04:05,612
I know how it feels.

977
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,614
You want to talk about it?

978
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,378
I've been thinking...
Me too.

979
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:23,964
I owe you an apology.

980
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:28,594
You're a woman with class.

981
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:33,015
The experiment was so exciting...

982
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:34,308
I've been thinking...

983
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,976
...I lost it.

984
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:39,605
I know what you'll say
and you're right.

985
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:41,565
You can't play with people.

986
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:44,693
But you know what?

987
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:47,904
I'm sure changing roles
isn't a bad idea.

988
01:04:47,904 --> 01:04:49,489
We went about it wrong.

989
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:52,701
Maurice, you were right.

990
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:54,328
Right?

991
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:56,997
Yes.

992
01:04:56,997 --> 01:04:59,916
When Ariane's father
died 1 5 years ago,

993
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:03,128
I shut sensuality out of my life.

994
01:05:03,128 --> 01:05:07,883
I feel ready to let it back in now,

995
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:09,593
Maurice.

996
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:39,289
What about the lion and the gazelle?

997
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:42,459
Do I have to do all the work?

998
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:58,558
Stay calm!

999
01:05:58,558 --> 01:06:01,269
There's enough for everyone!

1000
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:02,646
Hello, miss.

1001
01:06:09,444 --> 01:06:10,779
Yes, at reception.

1002
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:12,823
Jigsaws? In the back.

1003
01:06:14,491 --> 01:06:16,201
Don't worry, miss.

1004
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,001
It's solid material.

1005
01:06:26,878 --> 01:06:29,548
Can we touch?

1006
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,849
Do the technicians
come dressed like in the photo?

1007
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:40,642
You'll have to ask.

1008
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:42,477
What page are you on?
I'm not.

1009
01:06:42,477 --> 01:06:44,479
Ask the guys in yellow hats.

1010
01:07:00,453 --> 01:07:03,415
Is that you, sweetie?

1011
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:05,292
You'll never guess where we are.

1012
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,043
At the beach.

1013
01:07:07,043 --> 01:07:09,713
In the land of the Sea Monster
who kidnaps children

1014
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:13,508
and buries them alive in the sand!

1015
01:07:16,595 --> 01:07:19,347
Can I talk to them?
You want to talk to the kids?

1016
01:07:19,347 --> 01:07:22,142
Little rascals, I'll eat you alive.

1017
01:07:22,851 --> 01:07:24,352
They're attacking me!

1018
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:28,481
Let me talk to them!

1019
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:30,650
Hector, say hi to Mommy.
No thanks.

1020
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:33,445
Louise, say hi to Mommy.
Hi, Mommy!

1021
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:35,655
Hello, sweetie.

1022
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,199
She's gone.

1023
01:07:39,868 --> 01:07:40,744
Hello?

1024
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:43,538
Hello?

1025
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:20,677
Louise, look a wave!

1026
01:09:20,677 --> 01:09:21,803
Hector, don't go too far!

1027
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:28,059
Not too far!

1028
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:30,687
Hector

1029
01:09:35,692 --> 01:09:37,443
Mommy!

1030
01:09:37,443 --> 01:09:39,571
My babies!

1031
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:43,658
My darlings, I missed you so much.

1032
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:57,505
My loves, my sweethearts...

1033
01:10:14,606 --> 01:10:15,815
I want to play with you.

1034
01:10:15,815 --> 01:10:17,901
No, leave me alone.

1035
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:27,035
I want us to stop.

1036
01:10:27,035 --> 01:10:29,871
I want to stop the experiment.
I'm losing my children.

1037
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:32,457
And I've finally found them.

1038
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,253
It's all thanks to me, you know.

1039
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:40,590
What's the difference?

1040
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,133
I want my children back.

1041
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:47,513
Ariane, I played by the rules.

1042
01:10:47,513 --> 01:10:48,973
It was hard work to get where I am.

1043
01:10:48,973 --> 01:10:52,769
I won't stop
because you've got the August blues.

1044
01:10:52,769 --> 01:10:54,479
You wanted to be a man?

1045
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,399
All men work while
their families take vacation.

1046
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:00,151
It's just a bad moment.

1047
01:11:06,991 --> 01:11:09,535
I'm stopping. I'm stopping it all.

1048
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:11,454
What about the contract?

1049
01:11:11,454 --> 01:11:13,247
Fuck it! We fulfilled it.

1050
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:15,875
Hugo's the perfect chick and I'm a man:

1051
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:18,252
stupid and lonely.

1052
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:21,714
What if Hugo challenges your decision?

1053
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:24,592
Then it'll be war.

1054
01:11:32,642 --> 01:11:34,686
Wow! It's beautiful.

1055
01:11:38,648 --> 01:11:39,982
Go ahead, touch it.

1056
01:11:39,982 --> 01:11:41,484
It's perfect.

1057
01:11:42,402 --> 01:11:44,821
The seal is uneven here.

1058
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:45,697
Where?

1059
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:46,948
Here, look.

1060
01:11:47,323 --> 01:11:49,701
Sorry, it must be my wife.

1061
01:11:50,993 --> 01:11:51,869
Hello?

1062
01:11:51,869 --> 01:11:54,705
Mr. Gonsalvo? It's Ariane Marsiac.

1063
01:11:54,705 --> 01:11:58,126
Listen very carefully
to what I'm going to say...

1064
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:00,878
The finish is important, you know.

1065
01:12:00,878 --> 01:12:01,879
Yes, of course.

1066
01:12:15,852 --> 01:12:17,520
I'm like you, Mr. Marsiac.

1067
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,981
I like good work.

1068
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,775
If it's not perfect, I start over.

1069
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,402
Any complaints about the living room?

1070
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:51,470
You must've done something
to irritate him.

1071
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,597
No, I swear to you.

1072
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:57,101
You don't realize, you're so bossy.
It irks people.

1073
01:12:57,101 --> 01:12:59,687
It'll take at least another month now.

1074
01:13:00,897 --> 01:13:05,401
I'm going to have to start
supervising things. This can't go on.

1075
01:13:08,529 --> 01:13:11,657
Have you been working out lately?

1076
01:13:11,657 --> 01:13:13,159
Yes, why?

1077
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:14,994
No reason.

1078
01:13:16,204 --> 01:13:18,539
Isn't your butt spreading?

1079
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:19,707
No.

1080
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:32,970
Hugo transformed into a woman!
This is horrible.

1081
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,347
It was his idea.

1082
01:13:34,347 --> 01:13:37,516
He couldn't cope with himself
as a man anymore.

1083
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:38,935
Oh my God.

1084
01:13:39,727 --> 01:13:43,397
He has to come back.
Only work will save him.

1085
01:13:44,315 --> 01:13:45,566
You have to talk to him.

1086
01:13:47,485 --> 01:13:48,903
What will I say?

1087
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:52,031
Use your imagination.

1088
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,284
Hugo?

1089
01:13:55,284 --> 01:13:57,954
Adolphe Nicard. Sorry to bother you.

1090
01:13:58,371 --> 01:14:00,998
No problem, what can I do for you?

1091
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:05,044
You must return to the office.

1092
01:14:05,044 --> 01:14:06,212
Why, what's wrong?

1093
01:14:06,212 --> 01:14:08,422
Well...

1094
01:14:08,422 --> 01:14:09,840
People are talking.

1095
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,175
About what?

1096
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:14,387
About your wife.

1097
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:17,014
Oh yes?

1098
01:14:17,014 --> 01:14:19,934
I won't beat around the bush.

1099
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:23,688
Your wife is having an affair
with Nicolas Flanvart,

1100
01:14:23,688 --> 01:14:25,648
the young sales rep.

1101
01:14:27,858 --> 01:14:28,943
Flanvart?

1102
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:35,199
I should've fired him at once.

1103
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,285
I'm so mad at myself.
So mad at myself!

1104
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:39,704
Come back, Hugo.

1105
01:14:39,704 --> 01:14:41,872
It's very humiliating for you.

1106
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:43,082
Believe me.

1107
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:45,209
There you go!

1108
01:14:47,503 --> 01:14:49,171
Why are you on the floor?

1109
01:14:50,715 --> 01:14:52,341
What did you just do?

1110
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:55,052
I don't know.

1111
01:14:55,052 --> 01:14:59,223
I used my imagination, didn't l?

1112
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:03,269
Nicard is stark raving mad.

1113
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:07,773
Flanvart confessed.
He begged me not to tell his wife.

1114
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:11,694
It was purely physical.
Don't make a big deal about it.

1115
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:14,697
It's just your pride
that's making you suffer!

1116
01:15:22,496 --> 01:15:24,165
Like 75%% of women,

1117
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,375
Hugo took the initiative to separate.

1118
01:15:27,835 --> 01:15:29,587
And like many men,

1119
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:32,256
I got thrown out
over one hot August afternoon.

1120
01:15:42,558 --> 01:15:44,977
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1121
01:15:47,354 --> 01:15:50,774
And like any 40-year-old man,
I went home to Mommy...

1122
01:15:52,109 --> 01:15:55,029
Don't mind me. Pretend I'm not here.

1123
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:14,006
Then Hugo counterattacked.

1124
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:15,966
He set loose his lawyers on Gonsalvo.

1125
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:18,177
Sign here.

1126
01:16:18,177 --> 01:16:20,846
It'll save you a trip
to the post office.

1127
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:25,517
What about me?

1128
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:27,770
Take the browned part.

1129
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,606
It's the tastiest.

1130
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:39,323
Good night kids.

1131
01:17:10,396 --> 01:17:11,563
Is this seat free?

1132
01:17:12,398 --> 01:17:13,941
Thanks.

1133
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:21,907
Combat 3.

1134
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,160
That's my son.

1135
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,537
Hector!

1136
01:17:39,425 --> 01:17:42,678
Little animal!
I'll teach you a lesson!

1137
01:17:58,193 --> 01:17:59,236
Shit!

1138
01:18:10,831 --> 01:18:14,168
Ariane, what I wanted to tell you...

1139
01:18:15,043 --> 01:18:16,795
What I want...

1140
01:18:17,129 --> 01:18:18,756
What I think...

1141
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:21,467
What I know is that...

1142
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:25,095
Ariane. You and l...

1143
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:29,224
You know what I mean.

1144
01:18:32,227 --> 01:18:33,854
What else is there to say?

1145
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:38,942
That you love her, you imbecile!

1146
01:18:38,942 --> 01:18:41,904
Tell her that you miss her,
that you're sorry...

1147
01:18:41,904 --> 01:18:43,906
Yes, of course.
Go on.

1148
01:18:46,408 --> 01:18:47,493
Say it.

1149
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:50,454
I will.

1150
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:27,699
It's me. Is this a bad moment?

1151
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:28,450
No.

1152
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:30,661
I mean...

1153
01:19:30,661 --> 01:19:32,871
I'm at the office right now.

1154
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:34,456
What did you want?

1155
01:19:34,748 --> 01:19:38,543
Nothing. I mean...

1156
01:19:38,543 --> 01:19:42,130
I was thinking that
if you had five minutes

1157
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,549
to stop by the house...
we could talk for five minutes.

1158
01:19:45,884 --> 01:19:47,511
Talk about what?

1159
01:19:48,136 --> 01:19:52,224
I'm asking you to come over to talk,
not talk on the phone.

1160
01:19:52,224 --> 01:19:54,476
Yes, but it's bad timing.

1161
01:19:54,476 --> 01:19:56,603
I'm in the middle of work.

1162
01:19:56,603 --> 01:19:58,563
Ok, forget it.

1163
01:19:58,563 --> 01:19:59,314
It doesn't matter.

1164
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:00,774
No... Ok, I'm coming.

1165
01:20:00,774 --> 01:20:02,317
No, drop it.

1166
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:03,694
I said I'm coming!

1167
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:31,847
I'm listening.

1168
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:35,809
Come in.

1169
01:20:44,484 --> 01:20:45,694
Ariane...

1170
01:20:45,694 --> 01:20:47,446
It's gorgeous.

1171
01:20:48,363 --> 01:20:49,448
What?

1172
01:20:52,826 --> 01:20:55,954
The job you did on the house.
It's stunning.

1173
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:58,290
Thank you.

1174
01:21:02,419 --> 01:21:05,589
Seeing the house finished at last...

1175
01:21:06,131 --> 01:21:08,050
It makes me feel all funny.

1176
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:12,929
What did you want to tell me?

1177
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:18,059
I wanted to tell you that...

1178
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:24,983
I decided to go for rose pink.

1179
01:21:26,526 --> 01:21:29,112
It's stronger than pale pink

1180
01:21:29,112 --> 01:21:30,989
and it ages well.

1181
01:21:30,989 --> 01:21:33,200
Yes, it's vert nice.

1182
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:37,662
And I wanted to say...

1183
01:21:42,542 --> 01:21:43,752
Do you have a glass of water?

1184
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:46,880
Water?

1185
01:21:47,631 --> 01:21:49,341
Flat or sparkling?

1186
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:50,926
Tap water is fine.

1187
01:21:50,926 --> 01:21:52,719
Flat? Yes, of course.

1188
01:21:56,598 --> 01:21:59,100
It was worthwhile
fighting for the cabinets.

1189
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,019
They look good.

1190
01:22:01,478 --> 01:22:05,440
Beech is nicer than golden oak.

1191
01:22:06,274 --> 01:22:07,901
It's great.

1192
01:22:25,502 --> 01:22:28,463
What I wanted to say is...

1193
01:22:31,007 --> 01:22:33,385
I love you.

1194
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:36,388
I miss you.
I'm sorry about what happened.

1195
01:22:37,472 --> 01:22:39,140
I'm sorry too.

1196
01:22:43,311 --> 01:22:44,479
Ariane...

1197
01:23:02,122 --> 01:23:03,915
Hugo, it's impossible.

1198
01:23:03,915 --> 01:23:06,459
Tell me what you said again.

1199
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:08,837
"l love you, I miss you. I'm sorry..."

1200
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:11,047
She must not have heard you.

1201
01:23:11,047 --> 01:23:12,757
Did you mutter?

1202
01:23:12,757 --> 01:23:16,428
No, I spoke clearly. I was very sincere.

1203
01:23:16,428 --> 01:23:18,179
Then why did she leave?

1204
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:19,472
I have no idea.

1205
01:23:20,265 --> 01:23:24,019
I'm sure she'll be back.

1206
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:26,396
You're right! Someone's at the door.

1207
01:23:26,396 --> 01:23:27,564
I have to run.

1208
01:23:32,235 --> 01:23:33,987
Mr. Marsiac?
Yes.

1209
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:36,114
Criminal investigation.

1210
01:23:39,367 --> 01:23:40,618
Thanks for coming so fast.

1211
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:42,078
What's going on?

1212
01:23:42,078 --> 01:23:44,414
The police are placing Hugo in custody.

1213
01:23:44,414 --> 01:23:45,582
Why?

1214
01:23:45,582 --> 01:23:49,127
A client is pressing charges for rape.

1215
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,963
She says one of our men abused her.

1216
01:23:52,589 --> 01:23:54,674
What's Hugo got to do with it?

1217
01:23:54,674 --> 01:23:56,593
For the law, he's the boss.

1218
01:23:56,593 --> 01:23:59,137
He could be charged with pimping.

1219
01:23:59,137 --> 01:24:01,014
Pimping? That's ridiculous.

1220
01:24:01,014 --> 01:24:02,891
Not really.

1221
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,101
Big Machine
is siding with the plaintiff.

1222
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:06,186
The filthy bastards.

1223
01:24:06,186 --> 01:24:07,937
My thoughts exactly.

1224
01:24:08,813 --> 01:24:11,524
Hello. Lieutenant Lorenzi.

1225
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:14,319
I'm leading the investigation.

1226
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:16,529
Please don't do that.

1227
01:24:16,529 --> 01:24:19,866
My husband's got nothing
to do with this.

1228
01:24:19,866 --> 01:24:20,909
It was my idea.

1229
01:24:20,909 --> 01:24:22,869
I know. He told us everything.

1230
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:25,580
But he's decided
to assume responsibility.

1231
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,581
I have to talk to him.

1232
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:29,834
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

1233
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,586
I can't help you.

1234
01:24:32,253 --> 01:24:33,922
The exit's that way.

1235
01:24:33,922 --> 01:24:35,465
Well, that's that.

1236
01:24:42,347 --> 01:24:44,682
How long have you been married,
Adolphe?

1237
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:48,186
Forty-two years in a few days.

1238
01:24:48,895 --> 01:24:50,271
What's your secret?

1239
01:24:51,147 --> 01:24:54,567
Antoinette needs me
and she's not ashamed to say it.

1240
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:55,944
And vice versa.

1241
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:06,788
Ariane...

1242
01:25:06,788 --> 01:25:08,331
Where are you going?

1243
01:25:10,124 --> 01:25:11,668
Ariane...

1244
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,212
Ariane, no!

1245
01:25:14,212 --> 01:25:15,672
Ariane, my dear girl.

1246
01:25:15,672 --> 01:25:17,715
Hello, Hugo?

1247
01:25:18,675 --> 01:25:20,969
I have to talk to you.

1248
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:23,221
Can you hear me, Hugo?

1249
01:25:23,221 --> 01:25:24,722
Hugo, it's me!

1250
01:25:24,722 --> 01:25:24,931
Ariane!

1251
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:26,140
Listen to me.

1252
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,810
Get out of there!

1253
01:25:30,019 --> 01:25:30,979
Let go of me!

1254
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:33,439
Forgive me, I was a fool.

1255
01:25:36,025 --> 01:25:39,195
But did you really
have to screw Charlotte?

1256
01:25:41,197 --> 01:25:42,532
Open the window.

1257
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:44,701
I'm sorry,
that's not what I wanted to say.

1258
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:49,247
What I wanted to say is that
I miss you.

1259
01:25:49,247 --> 01:25:53,042
I know, changing roles was my idea.

1260
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:55,670
I envied your life.

1261
01:25:59,257 --> 01:26:01,884
I goofed up. It happens, no?

1262
01:26:04,137 --> 01:26:05,305
Oops, sorry.

1263
01:26:05,305 --> 01:26:06,306
That's no good...

1264
01:26:07,181 --> 01:26:08,725
Who's the madwoman?

1265
01:26:08,725 --> 01:26:09,726
My wife.

1266
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:11,394
Oh, sorry.

1267
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,272
You became
the woman I wanted to be.

1268
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,898
But now I know.

1269
01:26:15,898 --> 01:26:17,734
I know that I need you.

1270
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:23,072
Don't move.

1271
01:26:23,072 --> 01:26:25,533
I need to feel
your strong arms around me.

1272
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:28,995
I need to feel
the weight of your body over mine.

1273
01:26:31,372 --> 01:26:34,208
I need to talk with you,
laugh with you...

1274
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,836
I need you, Hugo.

1275
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:39,714
I can't live without you.

1276
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:45,887
I'm begging you, my love,
please forgive me.

1277
01:26:47,138 --> 01:26:48,264
Please forgive me.

1278
01:27:12,205 --> 01:27:13,748
Come on.

1279
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:19,253
I'm sorry. I lied.

1280
01:27:19,253 --> 01:27:20,505
You lied?

1281
01:27:21,172 --> 01:27:22,381
I missed him too.

1282
01:27:23,549 --> 01:27:25,551
My husband.

1283
01:27:25,551 --> 01:27:26,761
I'm sorry...

1284
01:27:34,685 --> 01:27:36,479
You look totally healed.

1285
01:27:36,813 --> 01:27:39,941
I'll have to pay a fine.
It could be big.

1286
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,820
<i>Our experiment didn't exactly
work out as expected.</i>

1287
01:28:26,529 --> 01:28:28,447
<i>We almost ruined everything.</i>

1288
01:28:28,906 --> 01:28:32,243
<i>But I guess we needed it
to discover ourselves.</i>

1289
01:28:32,243 --> 01:28:35,788
<i>I mean, really discover ourselves...</i>

1290
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,751
Ariane, to you.

1291
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,673
You understood
that we were suffocating.

1292
01:28:45,673 --> 01:28:47,341
And you saved us.

1293
01:28:48,593 --> 01:28:51,345
To your courage...

1294
01:28:51,345 --> 01:28:53,931
to your beauty...

1295
01:28:56,142 --> 01:28:57,518
and to our love.

1296
01:29:00,563 --> 01:29:01,647
Here, here!

1297
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:09,322
Daddy, there's a fire!

1298
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:15,661
When problems arise now,
this is what I say to them...

1299
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:20,249
To my grandparents...

1300
01:29:20,249 --> 01:29:26,130
who loved each other their whole life...

1301
01:29:31,427 --> 01:29:33,721
Would you at least consider it?

1302
01:29:33,721 --> 01:29:37,224
I'm not getting married at my age.

1303
01:29:37,642 --> 01:29:39,018
It's so commonplace.

1304
01:29:39,643 --> 01:29:41,896
Do it for my parents.

1305
01:29:41,896 --> 01:29:43,356
I thought they were dead?

1306
01:29:43,356 --> 01:29:44,607
Exactly.

1307
01:29:46,734 --> 01:29:48,444
Come on.

1308
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:52,323
The bathroom's very nice.

1309
01:29:52,323 --> 01:29:55,284
Thanks.
But I didn't get it right first time.

1310
01:29:55,284 --> 01:29:58,245
Once you know, you can really see it.

1311
01:29:58,245 --> 01:29:59,330
See what?

1312
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:00,915
His hermaphrodite side.
