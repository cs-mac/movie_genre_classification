1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,707
Some events of this movie are based on fiction.
It is not possible to completely show...

2
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,408
the complexity of a man's life,
which everybody perceives differently.

3
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:06,638
Mesrine: Part 2 - Public Enemy #1

4
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,775
Paris: Porte de Clignancourt
September 2nd 1979

5
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,875
Go away!

6
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:20,208
- Sir, Inspector, only one question...
- There's nothing that will help him.

7
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,400
- How many of you were there?
- Maybe 30, not more.

8
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:26,908
- How long have you been following them for?
- You know all details...

9
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,233
- I'll inform you about everything.
- Couldn't you make the mistake?

10
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:31,533
No, I absolutely disagree.

11
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:35,616
- Did the operation go without any complications?
- Yes. Two teams worked on it,

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,016
detectives and guys from command center.

13
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,141
One last question...

14
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:51,058
Open the doors. We've seen him to carry the weapons.
He had two grenades.

15
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,116
We fired a warning shots...
He didn't want to give it up. We had no other choice.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,500
We would lose him if he managed
to get to the circle.

17
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,908
Jojo! Bring the stretchers!

18
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,783
We already seen everything important. Let's go.

19
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,158
Hold on.

20
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:06,100
Year 1973...

21
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,608
...thursday...

22
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,200
...eight...

23
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,425
...of march.

24
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,941
Testimony...

25
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:33,783
... of Mesrine, Jacques.

26
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,266
Hey, you clown.
What do you think would break first, handcuffs or radiator?

27
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,116
My last name is Mesrine not Merine!

28
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,666
Like the name "Miromesnil", it is with "s"
but you don't pronounce it.

29
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,150
That's enough Mesrine!
Let's talk about your friend,

30
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,541
- Grangier Ardouin.
- I don't know him.

31
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,075
Seriously, I don't know him.

32
00:03:55,141 --> 00:04:01,291
- Mister Jacques. Welcome.
- Hey, what's going on?

33
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,708
- Looks like you gained a few.
- Are you crazy? I'm on diet for last three months.

34
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,058
- Really? Let me see.
- You see?

35
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,491
- Armed to the teeth.
- Yeah, like it's supposed to be.

36
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,775
Clear.

37
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,108
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Come on, one more right here.

38
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,033
On the floor! All of you on the floor!

39
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,133
On the floor!

40
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,075
Nobody moves! Lie down!

41
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:42,233
I said don't move!

42
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,750
Put all money in the bag! Hurry up!
Everybody stays down!

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,033
Hurry! Hurry! Let's go!

44
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:54,041
- Good girl.
- We're outta here! We're outta here!

45
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
The bank teller... OK she recognized me...
sure, because I didn't have a mask on... so?

46
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:02,666
- She identified your accomplice too.
- I don't give a shit.

47
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,666
First, I don't know any of them and secondly,
my buddies always wear masks.

48
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,491
Maybe she eats too many carrots.

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,233
We caught you too easy.

50
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:23,133
Freeze! Don't move!
Hold him!

51
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:28,108
- You're confessing to the robbery and the murder attempt.
- Yes, I am.

52
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,116
- But you are not confessing to the kidnapping.
- Why should I admit something

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,166
that I haven't done.

54
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:36,608
It's completely logical I won't admit
something I haven't done.

55
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,023
We'll take you to the court in Compiegne.

56
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,775
You'll be locked up... for a very long time.

57
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,458
In three months I won't be there.
You wanna bet?

58
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,816
- What again?
- I have to go to bathroom.

59
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,891
- Hold it.
- I am sick! Am I supposed to shit my pants in front of judge?

60
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,400
- Mesrine, move.
- Sure.

61
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,035
Am I going to wipe my ass with my foot or what?

62
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,241
Hold on.

63
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,500
Now you can.

64
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:37,258
And what about you? What do you want? Are you gay or you want to smell
my shit? Let me shit!

65
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,575
Am I supposed to shit right here?
Loosen up the cuffs. I won't run.

66
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:50,908
Ah, what a relief.

67
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,016
Hurry!

68
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,458
Now I feel better.

69
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,525
Mister Mesrine, stand here...

70
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:29,091
Your honor, by the law I shouldn't
have the handcuffs on me.

71
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:30,708
It's the violation of my rights.

72
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:34,958
It's sounds very funny when
you talk about the law.

73
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:37,958
- For your defense you won't need to use your hands.
- Your honor...!

74
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,608
Enough! That's enough Mesrine!

75
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,616
Everyone on the ground! Let's go!

76
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:50,000
Unlock my handcuffs! Hurry!
Fat ass next to the wall, let's go!

77
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,616
Nobody moves!

78
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,550
Get out of there!

79
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,825
Stay on the floor!
You get up! Move!

80
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,425
On the floor!

81
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:07,325
Hands up! On the floor!

82
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,825
Everybody with your face to the floor!

83
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,825
Let's go!

84
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,225
Quickly after him!

85
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,325
This won't help your case, Mesrine.

86
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,625
- Don't shoot!
- Stay over there!

87
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,225
Put the gun down! Move!

88
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,825
- Hurry or I kill him!
- Easy, take it easy.

89
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,625
All of you back off!

90
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,225
- get out of here!
- move, go after him!

91
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,325
Go! Go!

92
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,425
- Why did you let the judge go?
- Move!

93
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:45,125
Go faster!

94
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,325
- Jacques!
- Watch out!

95
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,825
Hand me the gun.
Back up or I'll shoot!

96
00:08:58,658 --> 00:08:59,858
I said BACK UP!

97
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:02,358
I'll kill you, you moron!

98
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,258
Good bye, good luck!

99
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,158
Robert caught a bullet.
Can you take it out?

100
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,158
I don't know, I have to take a look.

101
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,358
Here.

102
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:45,458
- Jacques, I have a news from your family.
- What news?

103
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:48,358
Your father is sick...
Come, I'll take a look.

104
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,358
Shit!

105
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,258
Jacques Mesrine may have not committed
his most serious crime ever, yesterday,

106
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,358
but definitely his boldest.

107
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,558
At first, he chose the place of his escape.

108
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:04,658
After being arrested in march of this year,
Mesrine said he doesn't agree with the sentence.

109
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:07,058
He knew that his appeal hearing will be held in Compiegne court.

110
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,738
When they arrived he asked the guards a permission
to go to the bathroom.

111
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:15,258
He knew his accomplices hid the gun
in a toilet

112
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:20,116
without being noticed by the guards.
They didn't even realized and Jacques Mesrine was armed.

113
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:25,116
He yelled: "I kill the judge..."
- That's lie! I've never said that.

114
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,616
...all French cops now know

115
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:34,116
that Jacques Mesrine must be considered as "The Public Enemy
Number 1"

116
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:40,091
Number 1. Number 1!

117
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,008
Hello.

118
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:11,099
Dad. Dad it's me. Can you see?
It's me Jacques.

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,428
- Jacques.
- How do you feel? - You came...

120
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,008
I thought I'll pay you a little visit
since all banks are closed.

121
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,808
Fool.

122
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,838
- You came... Have you seen your daughter yet?
- No, not yet.

123
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,608
I wasn't the best son,
but my father was proud of me.

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,028
That's the way I was born. Forgive me.

125
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,350
That's the way I am.

126
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,891
- It's my fault.
- No, no.

127
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:07,708
What ever happens you always
will be her father.

128
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,241
I know.

129
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,008
Like you always will be my son.

130
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,416
Yes.

131
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:37,491
Forgive me, please forgive me.

132
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:49,833
- I think you should go.
- Yes, I will.

133
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,833
Except children, mother and friends
no one else is here.

134
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,233
He is not such an idiot to come here.

135
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,033
Paris, September, 1973

136
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:35,533
- What"s that? Remembrance from the fight?
- No, it's from boxing.

137
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,533
Oh, so you're a boxer.

138
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,133
Michel is a boxer too.

139
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,233
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,233
We're planning a small job.
Are you interested?

141
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:26,133
Stolen car have been reported.
It is a silver Renault 16,

142
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:31,233
license plate number is 7791YL75.
- We spotted the reported vehicle.

143
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:41,533
Unit... we got the car.

144
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:44,783
Shit!

145
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:53,033
The street is not an ashtray, sir.
We'll have to give you a fine.

146
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,023
Get out of the car and show us
your papers, please.

147
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:01,933
I'm waiting. Get out of the car!

148
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,233
Don't resist! Put the hands behind your back!
Quickly!

149
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:11,934
Shit.

150
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,533
Move out of my way.

151
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,933
Stop! Stop!

152
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:43,023
Get out of the car!
Open the door! Hurry!

153
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,233
Get out!

154
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,433
Don't move!

155
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:04,733
Go already!

156
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,733
Fast!

157
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,533
Step on it!

158
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,423
Faster! Faster!

159
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:06,333
Go!

160
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:13,500
Let's leave!

161
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,158
Out of way!

162
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,791
Come on, train is here!

163
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,758
Move! Quick! Jump in!

164
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,258
Nobody moves!
Shut up! Sit down!

165
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,686
Shit!

166
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,941
Who are you starring at? Stare at floor!

167
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,800
I knew he'd fuck it up. He's an asshole!
They almost got us because of him!

168
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,300
You're always the smartest one and I'm an idiot.
And now leave me alone!

169
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,540
Alone? What are you talking about?! Cops got him!
Now that moron is blabbing to them!

170
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,400
Listen to me! I only choose those
who knows how to keep their mouth shut.

171
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,000
Go fuck yourself!

172
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,032
Always!

173
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,400
If you're so sure about it
then you'll have to do it without me.

174
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm done Mesrine!

175
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,030
- Then just leave!
- I'm gone!

176
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:47,033
You get out of here too!
Come on! Get out!

177
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,658
Inspector Broussard!

178
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,836
- Are we going to wait any longer?
- I'll let you know.

179
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:35,133
- My guys are on the roof for 8 hours already and it's raining.
- I see. We have a plenty of time.

180
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,634
Moron.

181
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,916
Open! The police.

182
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,816
The Police! The building is surrounded!

183
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,016
The police! Open up!

184
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:10,916
- The house is surrounded!
- What? What's going on?

185
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:16,416
- Who is it? What do you want from me?
- Open or we kick the door!

186
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:21,816
Go fuck yourselves!
I belong to Baader's!

187
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,816
I'll blow it all up!
Long live revolution!

188
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,816
Quickly, get dressed! Move yourself!

189
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,116
Of course...
Danke schon.

190
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,316
That's enough Jacques, you lost.

191
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:41,275
- Who do you think you are talking to me like that?
- Robert Broussard, Police Inspector.

192
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,758
Aha, Broussard, the one with the moustache like a sailor.
All newspapers write about you.

193
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,408
Exactly.

194
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,938
- Let's end this circus. Give up!
- I don't care!

195
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,108
How can I trust you?
Slip your identity card through the door so I can see it.

196
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,838
- So you could shoot me?
- Or you me, when I try to pick it up?

197
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,308
You're right.

198
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,808
So then what? I'm giving you my word,
you can trust me.

199
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:23,008
I won't fire.
Come on Broussard, don't hesitate.

200
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,208
- OK Jacques.
- I'm waiting.

201
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,408
Catch.

202
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,408
So what?

203
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,308
- Broussard?
- yes?

204
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,208
- I have two requirements.
- I hope they're reasonable...

205
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,508
First one is that you won't touch the girl who's
here with me.

206
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:12,138
And second one, I need 20 minutes to get
something in the order.

207
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,208
Do you have any other wish?
Would you like a car with a driver?

208
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,238
If I want to maybe that too.
You are not in position to negotiate, Broussard.

209
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,238
So? I'm waiting!

210
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:26,428
So what is it!

211
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,908
You got 20 minutes, Jacques. 20 minutes!

212
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,308
Jacques, what should I do?

213
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,938
Answer me, Jacques.
Can I help you with something?

214
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,508
- What are they going to do with me?
- Bring me the matches from the table.

215
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:48,738
- I'm scared.
- Bring the matches!

216
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,308
Here you go.

217
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,508
They'll arrest me. You think they put me in jail?
I don't want to go to jail...

218
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,408
- Calm down. Easy.
- How can I calm down, they will...

219
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,608
Calm down!

220
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,208
Are you finished? Are you calm?

221
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:19,038
- What will they do with me?
- Don't worry. Everything will be all right.

222
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,508
Just easy, quiet...

223
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,908
What are you waiting for, Mesrine?
What are you trying to do over there?

224
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,608
We gave you 20 minutes not 40.

225
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:52,508
Broussard, are you brave enough to come in here without a gun
and bulletproof vest?

226
00:23:54,791 --> 00:24:00,508
- Why is that?
- I want to know, if you can do it.

227
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,408
So, are you coming in or are you scared?

228
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:11,508
Hey! Broussard?

229
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,308
Well, OK then.

230
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:30,908
See? I took the vest down and put gun away.

231
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,508
And what about you?
Do you have a courage to come out without the gun?

232
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,308
As you can see, I do.

233
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:51,608
Hey you the artist, take a picture of us together.
The big glory moment of Inspector Broussard!

234
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,608
If you insist.

235
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,338
Didn't you wonder why I didn't kill you and your buddies?

236
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,208
We cops do not wonder, but we act.

237
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:06,908
Just because the woman was here.
Just because of that... that she was here.

238
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:11,208
Next time there won't be a woman nor champagne.
Just two of us.

239
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:19,008
To our next meeting.

240
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,538
Prison de la Santé
Paris, 1973.

241
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:10,908
Guard!

242
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:14,908
Guard!

243
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:27,808
- What do you need Jacques?
- What kind of guy is he, that Pinochet?

244
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:33,108
- He's Chilean general.
- The general in Chile?

245
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,808
The whole page about some Pinochet
but no a word about me!

246
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:46,238
- There was a coup.
- A coup? Bring me the typewriter.

247
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,808
- I want to write something!
- Alright, I try.

248
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:50,908
Go!

249
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:55,908
Pinochet. Pinochet!

250
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,958
County jail...

251
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,708
" DEATH INSTINCT"
What do you think it is?

252
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:48,208
- This is my book.
- This is not a book, it is the death sentence.

253
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:54,408
You have a trial in two months and you're publishing a book in which
you're confessing to committing 40 murders.

254
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,708
At this moment all cops in France are studying your book.

255
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:02,808
And after they finish, they use everything from your
memoirs in a indictment against you.

256
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:08,408
- Well in that case they have to be retarded.
- What do you mean?

257
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:13,408
- This is not the truth?
- Audience loves the plot, the action...

258
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:18,208
- And?
- And I don't think that jury will believe

259
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:22,608
that I am such an idiot, that would confess to something
that would put me on guillotine.

260
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:28,208
And in the eyes of the nation I'm a Star.

261
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,856
You entertain the nation but at the same time you horrify it.

262
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:37,308
And as far as they can push the fear by not letting you go free,
they won't.

263
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:42,208
So middle-class, such a funny honest word.

264
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,338
They allowed you a visit.

265
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,608
- I grew up.
- I see.

266
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:41,708
- I cannot notice.
- I'm not a child anymore.

267
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:52,908
- You really are beautiful.
- Thanks.

268
00:29:57,741 --> 00:30:04,608
- And how are... your brothers?
- Boris and Bruno are doing fine,

269
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:08,008
they're acting like a fools otherwise nothing is new.

270
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:14,108
- That's weird.
- Yes.

271
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:21,908
- Didn't he ride his bike with some punks.
- Do you want play on a father...?

272
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:28,708
- I didn't come here to be lectured.
- Alright, just be careful.

273
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:47,108
- When you come back home?
- It won't be that soon.

274
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:59,108
Honey I'm sorry... I'd rather to meet you
under different circumstances.

275
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:05,008
At least I know where I can always find you.

276
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,308
I miss you.

277
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:36,408
Jacques Mesrine, are you still denying
contact with Michele Ardouin?

278
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:38,908
I already said I don't know him.
I do not know him!

279
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:42,908
Michel Ardouin stand up so
Mesrine can see you better.

280
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:49,108
I'm telling you I don't know him.
I would remember that nose for sure.

281
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:58,408
Do you admit that you took chief judge as a hostage during your escape?

282
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:02,208
I've hid behind the justice
as any decent citizen would.

283
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:03,508
What's wrong about that?

284
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,008
Nothing, if your escape doesn't change to kidnapping.

285
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:22,908
Sir, in clothes from 101 dalmatians,
escape is everyone's bounden duty and the right,

286
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,808
and it is a business too,

287
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:32,108
and so I wouldn't just talk in the wind,
ladies and gentlemen, in my hand I have a key. Can you see?

288
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:38,338
And do you know what kind of key it is?
It is by a coincidence a key for my handcuffs.

289
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:43,208
Just look!
And do you know how did I get a hold of it?

290
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:49,008
I simply bought it from my guard
for a half million of old franks.

291
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,608
Sirs journalists, dear jury,

292
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:58,108
this is your system, which you and prosecutor
are so defending it.

293
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:00,708
We are honored by his presence.
Inspector Broussard,

294
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:06,308
who's sitting right next to journalists.
Inspector! Look at it yourself.

295
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,308
I'm done.

296
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:13,208
Tell us Mr. Mesrine, why would you need such a big arsenal of weapons
we found at your place?

297
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,808
Your honor, how should I explain it...

298
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:24,808
Since I was a kid, this unexplainable
feeling of vulnerability is following me.

299
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,208
You should thank me...

300
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:33,908
I analyze murderers, I help cops,
I provide work for the doctors at the emergency rooms.

301
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,208
Before us we have a picture of nice looking man.

302
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:45,438
But he is a gangster,
who doesn't hurt any one,

303
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,008
he's even gentle to his victims...

304
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:58,308
All this is just a pretence,
a mask covering a bestial animal.

305
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:05,008
They don't exist good gangsters,
there are only gangsters and nothing more...

306
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,908
and before you is standing one.

307
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:16,108
Mesrine, you start shooting without thinking,
when you see that situation is getting out of your hands.

308
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:24,608
Ladies and gentlemen, dear jury,
you're deciding today about the justice

309
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:26,208
and you will bring the sentence.

310
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:30,808
The society which doesn't punish criminals,
cannot be considered righteous.

311
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:48,738
So I am the public enemy number 1?!
What?

312
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:51,808
This is all bullshit.

313
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,208
I am the enemy of the government, the banks,
yes, it is right and accurate to je pøesné a výstižné.

314
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,508
I steal from them, that's why they don't like me,

315
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:04,108
but when I steal from banks,
I don't feel like I'm breaking the law.

316
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:07,108
I'm stealing from a bigger thief.

317
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:14,908
Do you want to put me in jail,
throw out the key and forget about me?!

318
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:17,808
Go ahead, just stick me in there!

319
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:24,508
But remember what I said,
I'll run away from there. I promise you that!

320
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,608
The jury with eight votes
found guilty and sentenced...

321
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:34,738
Pierre Vondorin to 5 years
on probation.

322
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:39,208
Michel Grangier to 7 years
in prison.

323
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:45,208
Michel Ardouina to 10 years
in prison.

324
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:52,008
Accused Jacques Mesrine
to 20 years in prison with maximum security.

325
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,438
March, 1978

326
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:16,308
- Do you have a light?
- Sure I do, Mr. Jacques.

327
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:22,308
Thanks.

328
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,708
- Hi, Luc.
- Hey Jacques.

329
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,208
Hi.

330
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,008
Are you sweating on purpose or is this normal?

331
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:02,908
Could you at least answer me,
I am Jacques Mesrine.

332
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,808
So what?
What you doing in my yard?

333
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:14,808
Here, is not a custom to forbid anything from me.

334
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,108
Yeah , I've noticed.

335
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:25,708
- By the way, I have 3 escapes behind me.
- Me too.

336
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,708
Maybe...

337
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:39,938
...i'd like to try one more time.

338
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:48,908
- My name is François Besse.
- I know.

339
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,908
Control.

340
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,508
Control.

341
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,938
- It's OK boss, a tin foil is inside.
- Alright

342
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:38,408
Mr. Jacques, your lawyer is here.

343
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:06,538
- Boss, I'm cold I want to go back to cell.
- In two minutes, first we'll take Jacques back .

344
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,108
Two minutes?

345
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,508
Hello.

346
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:32,238
- What's going on?
- It's about the story in Canada.

347
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:37,308
- But I don't have your manuscripts.
- Then let's get it right.

348
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:39,808
Boss! Boss!

349
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:45,008
- What do you want?
- I need my manuscripts,

350
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,808
I gave them to my neighbor.

351
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:50,208
- To Bess?
- Yeah.

352
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,208
Can you do me a favor and bring them here,
as fast as you can, please.

353
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:59,138
- OK.
- Thanks chief.

354
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,408
If someone will get to know about this, nothing will help me.

355
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:51,308
- I'm done.
- Don't worry,

356
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:56,808
you are saving my life
and I won't be destroying yours.

357
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:02,308
- Will everything go smoothly?
- Already did.

358
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,508
Mesrine wants his manuscripts.

359
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,808
- We got a problem.
- Move back.

360
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:47,508
What's going on, why are you over here?

361
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:54,308
Hey, what's happening here?!
Both of you go inside, hurry!

362
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:55,808
- Pistols.
- Catch!

363
00:42:56,891 --> 00:43:00,008
- Lets go, take off your clothes! Quick, Quick!
- Hey, what's going on over there?

364
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:03,308
- Hurry! move!
- what's going on?

365
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:07,508
- Move on!
- I'm with you,I'm with you!

366
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,808
- To the wall! Face to the wall! Move!

367
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:14,508
- Shut up!
- Guys, take me with you.

368
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:20,808
- I save your life.
- Move it! Get in the cell!

369
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:24,208
Lets go, Lets go! Get in the cell!
Move it!

370
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,908
Listen to me! You're a prisoner, get it?!
Prisoner!

371
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:35,608
Here, catch!

372
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:40,408
Seven, eight...
Put your hands closer to each other...

373
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:11,008
let's go, quit twitching!

374
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,208
Go! Go, be quiet!

375
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:17,408
Not a word! Move yourself!

376
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:21,908
- Hey, you! Get down!
- Quick! Move!

377
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:30,108
Who wants to go with us?
Let's go! Bad for you! - Move it!

378
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:31,908
Quickly, Quickly!

379
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,908
Don't move! Put the gun down!

380
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,908
Put it down!

381
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:56,608
- To the wall! To the wall! Hurry!
- Catch!

382
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:06,008
- Take it off! Take it off!
- Done!

383
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:11,308
Give me the gloves!

384
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,408
Francois, here are the gloves!

385
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,308
- Cover us!
- What? - Cover us!

386
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:32,908
Whoever moves I'll shoot him!

387
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:40,808
Hang the rope.

388
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:18,238
Stop! Police is confiscating the car.
Get out!

389
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:22,638
- Move yourself! Jump off the rope, quick!
- Get out of the car.

390
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:27,608
- Step out, please.
- Get out of the car!

391
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:33,408
Get out!!

392
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:42,108
- Jump in! - Chris!
- Get inside, quick!

393
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,808
Jump in!

394
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,208
Lets go!

395
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:11,638
Shocking ending. The pursuing by Red brigades
from all over Italy.

396
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:13,308
Ended by murder.

397
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,208
Alda More is dead.

398
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,608
Leader of Christian Democrats
paid by his life

399
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:23,838
for hideous intimidating by terrorists.
This threat could be avoided.

400
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:28,108
Anonymous caller noticed parked car
near to headquarters...

401
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:33,508
of Communist party,

402
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:36,508
inside of which was found dead body
of man, Alda Mora.

403
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:43,938
- Where you been? You could say something.
- Jean-Luc, it's my honor and pleasure,

404
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:50,038
to introduce to you princess Annie
and princess Christiane.

405
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,708
- Good evening.
- My cousin Jean-Luc,

406
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:54,708
- as you can see, he's armed.
- Yeah.

407
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,808
Take a seat next to him and surround him
by your warm and charm.

408
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:02,308
You see, how badly he needs it?

409
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,908
- Is it real?
- Take your hands off it!

410
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:17,808
- So, do we begin?
- Bruno, come here for a moment.

411
00:48:18,691 --> 00:48:26,308
My princesses, excuse me for a moment.
Wait here, I'll be right back.

412
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,308
- What's up?
- What kind of whores are they?

413
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:34,308
- François, they're not whores.
- Then who are they?

414
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:39,208
They're two charming students,
who wants to have fun and we gonna help them with it.

415
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:45,808
We have to inform you that public enemy
number 1 is still free.

416
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:47,308
- Wait.
- What for?

417
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,908
- We don't have a time for this.
- François, sexual passion...

418
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,608
is natural human necessity.

419
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:57,308
- I didn't have a girl for 5 years...
- Do what I do, devote yourself to sport.

420
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,408
...two other prisoners ran away
with Mesrine,

421
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,208
one was shot and the other succeeded
to escape.

422
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:06,808
Escapees are armed.
They managed to obtain the gun,

423
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:09,608
which helped them to remove all witnesses
during the jailbreak.

424
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,908
- François, don't spoil my plans.
- Go fuck yourself!

425
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:18,138
We're gonna go. Your friend doesn't
like our presence.

426
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:25,408
Wait, wait! Come to me!
François, shit, you frightened them.

427
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,608
Turn the TV on.

428
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,308
- Don't trust journalists, they babble nonsense.
- I think I'll take a walk.

429
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:37,838
Come on, again? François! François!

430
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:41,908
- That was you on TV, wasn't it?
- You know the answer.

431
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,408
- Jacques Mesrine.
- No, Mesrine.

432
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:46,608
Jacques Mesrine.

433
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,208
- Nice to meet you.
- Jacques Mesrine, nice to meet you too.

434
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:10,808
Police Inspector Vaugier and
Divisional Inspector Lerio.

435
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,508
- Hello.
- Hello.

436
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:18,038
- Is your boss here?
- No, he isn't. I'm covering him today.

437
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:23,408
- Is always so many people here?
- You arrived from Paris

438
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:26,838
to find out how many people is here?
- Without comments, corporal.

439
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:35,108
- Tell me, how many of you are working here?
- Here, a few tens of employees.

440
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:41,138
- Well, what did I say? It's not that bad.
- Not at all. - No doubt.

441
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:45,508
- Why are you here?
- Obviously you know,

442
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:50,008
that your cutthroats escaped from prison.
Did you hear any gossip about their plans?

443
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:57,138
- It's about Besse and Mesrine.
- No, I didn't. And you think they could come here?

444
00:50:57,341 --> 00:51:00,038
You never know with these guys, corporal.

445
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:04,408
Be careful, especially the shorter one,
because he is very dangerous.

446
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:07,308
- Sure.
- Sure...

447
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:14,138
Henry, we should be on our way.
We have a lot of work to do. Thank you, corporal.

448
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:20,338
What we can do.
See you later.

449
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:29,338
We thought there will be like 5 of them
but they have the whole regiment there.

450
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:33,238
Don't whine! Even if they had a whole army in there
you would act like a chicken.

451
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,608
See you.

452
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:25,038
- Are you talking about counterfeit money?
- Yes, exactly.

453
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:29,608
And you'd probably like to check my safe.

454
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:31,708
That would be nice.

455
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,908
Do you have a court order?

456
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:48,938
No no, please.
The court order.

457
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:51,308
- Court order.
- Yes.

458
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:58,908
He's right. Do you have a warrant, Inspector?
I have it...

459
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:03,608
I have a brilliant order, clearly it is a metal one.
Let's go grandpa, fill up the bag.

460
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:09,708
To the safe, move! Let's go, hurry!
Open the safe!

461
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,508
Don't stare at me, help him out!
Hurry up!

462
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:02,838
Run!

463
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,008
Get in!

464
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:30,108
Come on, go already!

465
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:42,808
Hang on!

466
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,008
Move!

467
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:03,108
- Shit!
- What? Why did you stop?

468
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:05,908
Damn!

469
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,108
Platoon ready.

470
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:31,908
Only leg...

471
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,138
Leaders of platoons. Get ready for the operation!
Turn right!

472
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:39,708
Give me your tie.

473
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:41,408
Get in!

474
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,508
Hang on.

475
00:56:56,791 --> 00:57:02,908
Jacques Mesrine together with his accomplice
François Besse...

476
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:11,238
ran away from the crime scene in a car. Gangsters...
- Enough of it, right?

477
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:18,738
This is a way better.
We change the clothes...

478
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:27,908
Thanks for them.

479
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:21,108
What do you say
if instead of school...

480
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:25,638
we would make a trip with uncle François
and uncle Jacques?

481
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:31,838
with dad and mom too, if they want to?
What?

482
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:37,138
We'll vote.
I'm for it. François, what about you?

483
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:49,708
Aha, now it's two of us.
And dad? He agrees too. And mom?

484
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:56,938
and kids.
Excellent, everyone agrees.

485
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:00,708
Great, perfect!

486
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:08,108
So, are we going?

487
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:26,108
- careful... hang on.
- Damn!

488
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:33,908
- Come here. What's your name?
- Daniel.

489
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:38,608
Do you know how to get to Chafourux?

490
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:43,008
You take us and drop us off over there.
Do we have a deal?

491
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:49,708
I don't have to tell you what happens if...

492
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:53,908
Good.

493
01:00:00,391 --> 01:00:01,808
We can go.

494
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,908
Go, Go, faster!

495
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,908
Keep going, keep going.

496
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:12,308
Faster, faster!

497
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,308
Hello, madam. Control.

498
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:31,908
What's going on?

499
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:35,908
Control.

500
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,908
Could you please open the trunk?

501
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:42,608
- Put the armrest back and turn off the radio!
- Kids, put it back.

502
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,408
God, help us.

503
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:59,908
Keep going please.
Faster, go.

504
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,008
Stop!

505
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:07,108
Madam, have you noticed anything out of ordinary?
We check your car.

506
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:09,028
Open the trunk please

507
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:19,108
OK thank you.

508
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:20,808
Just sit here quietly.

509
01:01:23,191 --> 01:01:24,248
Bye madam.

510
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:32,808
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

511
01:01:33,091 --> 01:01:36,338
- You haven't noticed on your way anything out of ordinary?
- No.

512
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:45,808
- Everything alright kids?
- Yes.

513
01:01:45,991 --> 01:01:48,808
- We must to check your car.
- I'm on the road from 4 am!

514
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:52,008
- When do you finally get that Mesrine?
- Step out of the car.

515
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:57,908
- Open the trunk.
- What's going on? I don't have anything there!

516
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:07,108
- Don't argue, we must to check it out.
- I said I don't have anything there!

517
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:11,008
You can go sir. Go, Go already!

518
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:47,108
Nobody is here.

519
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:24,608
Daniel, come closer.
Come here! Don't be afraid!

520
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:36,208
Here, it's yours.

521
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:43,008
Reward for your trouble,
but mainly for being quiet.

522
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:45,738
I understand. OK.

523
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:49,508
- How much did you give him?
- Some change, around hundred.

524
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:54,208
- Hundred thousand for these lousy clothes?
You're some businessman. - Come on, stop!

525
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:57,138
- You good. Go.
- Thank you.

526
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,408
Bye.

527
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,137
Soldiers just arrived.

528
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,237
- Here it is.
- Are you sure?

529
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:06,437
We can cross here. Look.
Hand me that wood. Do you doubt that?

530
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:11,362
- Well it doesn't seem...
- Do you see that? Look.

531
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:15,162
- He's not sure. See?
- OK?

532
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:21,062
Well, go.

533
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:29,762
You see? Here is shallow water, look and
you didn't believe me.

534
01:05:30,345 --> 01:05:33,162
Oops, a little bit deeper here.

535
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:35,462
Shit!

536
01:05:35,787 --> 01:05:36,962
Are you coming?

537
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:47,162
Here, hold on to it.

538
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:53,962
Good, good... Watch out there's a hole!

539
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:58,262
- Here, take it. Hold it!
- What are you doing?

540
01:05:58,545 --> 01:06:01,262
- I'll throw the money on river bank.
- Cut it out! It's too far!

541
01:06:01,315 --> 01:06:07,262
- Calm down! Don't you trust me again?
- Don't throw it! Don't do it, it's too far!

542
01:06:11,845 --> 01:06:16,162
- Shit!
- Stop! Watch out!

543
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:19,062
Come back François! François!

544
01:06:20,345 --> 01:06:23,562
- Shit!
- François, they drifted away!

545
01:06:27,745 --> 01:06:29,962
- That was your share!
- Good then.

546
01:06:32,645 --> 01:06:39,862
- What's in those bushes over there? Look Jacques!
- A little boat. You kidding me.

547
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:12,862
...and the search of the area
continued the whole night,

548
01:07:13,145 --> 01:07:17,662
despite the effort of the dogs,
helicopters and armed forces,

549
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:24,462
we must confirm that their effort was fruitless.

550
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:05,972
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hello.

551
01:08:15,245 --> 01:08:24,562
- So? Are you gonna buy me a drink?
- Champagne, the best one you have.

552
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:27,982
- Do you have Crystal?
- Yes, of course.

553
01:08:28,845 --> 01:08:30,362
Give me the bottle.

554
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:44,262
- What's your name?
- Sylvia.

555
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:49,862
And you? What's your name?

556
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:56,062
- Jacques! Jacques! Jacques!
- So what's my name? What is it?

557
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:15,062
- I read my horoscope in the morning.
- And? What did it say?

558
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:20,462
That I fall in love.

559
01:09:21,845 --> 01:09:24,762
Paris, July 1978.

560
01:09:24,845 --> 01:09:26,862
So, Isabelle? Where's my gift?

561
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:40,462
- Thanks.
- Can we begin?

562
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:42,762
Be brave Isabelle, get on me.

563
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:48,862
Why are you doing this?

564
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,262
Because I don't like the laws.

565
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:07,762
I don't like the laws and I don't want
to be a slave of the alarm clock the whole my life.

566
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:10,762
I don't want the whole my life just to dream.
I don't want always to think,

567
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:14,562
how I have to work a half year,
so I could buy some thing.

568
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:17,862
- No. No!
- What do you expect from the life?

569
01:10:19,745 --> 01:10:23,692
-Recognition? Money?
- Money, Money! All of you...

570
01:10:23,745 --> 01:10:27,762
just keep talking about them, always the same.
But I'm completely different.

571
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:33,162
What exactly am I doing?
I'm looking for the money in the places where they are, that means in the banks.

572
01:10:35,345 --> 01:10:37,992
Regarding the politics,
are you on the left or the right?

573
01:10:38,545 --> 01:10:42,762
Neither side. I think politics are dirty game
it's better to keep the distance from it.

574
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:45,262
I don't trust any politician.

575
01:10:45,845 --> 01:10:53,892
- Do you consider yourself as a dangerous individual?
- Dangerous... And according to you?

576
01:10:55,245 --> 01:11:00,162
I don't know, maybe I'm dangerous. I don't know.
Why are you asking?

577
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:07,162
Depends to whom.
For instance I don't play with cops...

578
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:09,862
Shoot it!

579
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:12,862
Good photograph, publish it!

580
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:21,562
Dangerous...
Probably yes. I'm probably dangerous.

581
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:29,862
- What kind of old age and death will you have?
- Old age. Honestly, I don't think I'll live that long.

582
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:36,762
One day they shoot me to death, it completely makes sense.
Natural.

583
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:42,362
After all for some one who was in prison with maximum security,
there are no rules.

584
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:46,362
- Like me, I live without rules.
- Without rules and without hope?

585
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:51,862
- Do you have any plans?
- I've got a lot of plans. Plans...

586
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:55,062
Close the prison with maximum security.
I lived there for 5 years.

587
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:59,692
Can you imagine? The whole 5 years!
I want all of those who sit there to let go!

588
01:12:00,045 --> 01:12:01,862
I've seen over there, how they break people,
how they destroy them.

589
01:12:03,245 --> 01:12:06,562
But our Mr. Minister, Alain Perfite
he didn't get it yet,

590
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:11,362
I am an excellent shooter and I can kill a few judges.

591
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:15,892
Do we need in France gangs of Bordeleo?
Do we need Red brigades?

592
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:19,862
Let them ask themselves the question.
Because if there will be need to go in their neighborhoods,

593
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:23,962
to train with Palestinians, I'll go!
They can shit their pants!

594
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:28,292
- Do you want something to drink? Coffee?
- with delight. - Sugar?

595
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:47,962
- Jacques Mesrine.
- Yes? - They write about you in "Match".

596
01:13:05,445 --> 01:13:09,492
Not even a year have passed.

597
01:13:14,745 --> 01:13:21,262
Today's menu, lamb legs.
I'm getting sick of these English meals.

598
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:32,562
"if there will be need to join Palestinian,
I'll come..."

599
01:13:33,645 --> 01:13:38,162
"if there will be need , I'll start wave of violence
France never seen before".

600
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:43,462
- I said it and I will do it.
- "I'm the expert on explosives". Moron!

601
01:13:43,745 --> 01:13:47,262
- Next?
- "...can kill a few judges"

602
01:13:47,345 --> 01:13:52,062
- What kind of nonsense is this?!
- It's not a nonsense.

603
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:55,462
- It's a revolution.
- A what? - A revolution!

604
01:13:55,645 --> 01:13:58,862
We are a criminals, not a revolutionists.
We are not going to destroy the system.

605
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,362
You see honey? This is typical
little cry baby.

606
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:07,662
Sam is short, his ideals are small.

607
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:15,862
I'm not overestimating my power
and I'm not calling for vendetta against the state.

608
01:14:15,945 --> 01:14:17,462
- That's it!
- Yeah, that's it.

609
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:23,292
Well, I won't sign your magazine then.

610
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,793
You can wipe your ass with it.

611
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:33,962
- Please stop it. François, come to the table.
- I don't work like this.

612
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:37,762
Simple just know how to use media.
That's all.

613
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:41,992
- We have to talk.
- Anytime. But now come to the table.

614
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:47,492
I'm inviting you to the table of accused.

615
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:56,862
I have a great plan.
we kidnap a billionaire.

616
01:14:59,545 --> 01:15:02,262
- What are we going to do?
- What kind of question is that? Think about it.

617
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:11,862
I tell you, the one I've chose
is a big fat cat.

618
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:14,862
Old fart is forcing people to live in rabbit holes.

619
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:23,262
It's a serious thing, you can trust me.
And then... You know what we gonna do then?

620
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:28,862
We'll buy the bazookas and we attack the prison.

621
01:15:34,445 --> 01:15:37,982
Listen Jacques, we attack the prison,
again why not...

622
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:45,592
- And then? What else do you want to drag me in to?
- After all... - Besides you're not going ever stop.

623
01:15:46,745 --> 01:15:50,992
You want to destroy this system
and on contrary I want to profit from it.

624
01:15:53,495 --> 01:15:57,762
simply you're fool,
you don't realize the consequences.

625
01:16:00,695 --> 01:16:05,992
- Fool? - Fool.
- What's this fool? I don't understand you at all.

626
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,192
Sarthe, June 1979.

627
01:16:26,045 --> 01:16:30,992
- Hi, how are you? Is Mr. Leliévre at home?
- I'm his son. And you are?

628
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:38,762
Inspector Vaugier, police.
Can we go in?

629
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:50,092
- What's going on?
- Do you own a few houses for rent?

630
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,262
We'd like to talk about that.

631
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:56,962
Wait.

632
01:16:57,545 --> 01:16:58,462
Thank you.

633
01:17:03,645 --> 01:17:06,262
Two cops are here and they
want to talk to you.

634
01:17:19,695 --> 01:17:23,762
- How can I be to use for you gentlemen?
- We received a complaint from...

635
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:26,392
a few renters of your apartments,
regarding a bad living conditions.

636
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:29,062
We ask you to come with us
to police station.

637
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:33,262
- Couldn't we to take care of it here?
- Please, how would it look like.

638
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:39,692
Well in that case let's go.
I hope it won't take too long.

639
01:17:40,595 --> 01:17:44,692
- Tell Charly, to get the car ready...
- That won't be necessary, we have a car.

640
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:50,892
- We can bring you back.
- Excellent, lets go then.

641
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:54,262
Thank you for understanding.

642
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:07,762
From now on you're in hands
of Palestine Liberation Organization.

643
01:18:08,045 --> 01:18:14,092
What? Palestine?
And what's my connection with it?

644
01:18:14,745 --> 01:18:19,662
We rent apartments in Paris and
I'm not a Jew.

645
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:21,262
What's the difference?

646
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:31,592
- You will pay me. I'm Jacques Mesrine.
- Mesrine? - right.

647
01:18:35,045 --> 01:18:36,562
How long am I gonna be here?

648
01:18:42,145 --> 01:18:47,162
Depends on you.
If you reach deep in your pockets you can go home.

649
01:18:49,045 --> 01:18:52,162
- How much do you need?
- 10 millions in cash.

650
01:18:53,445 --> 01:18:55,062
- 10 millions?
- Yeah.

651
01:18:55,145 --> 01:19:05,792
What are... 10 millions is too much.
I'll disappoint you, but I'm 82 years old. I rather be killed.

652
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:20,962
- Then give us eight.
- No. - I didn't understand. - No.

653
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:23,562
Do you think we are morons, you old fart?

654
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,862
- Seven and we go separate ways for good!
- No!

655
01:19:28,945 --> 01:19:36,492
- How much can you pay me then, you penny pincher?
- Six... in four payments.

656
01:19:36,695 --> 01:19:39,862
Aha, in four payments?! In four!

657
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:45,692
So, you'll pay in three payments
and if you try to screw me,

658
01:19:45,795 --> 01:19:50,762
I put the bullet in you, for free! Got it?
- Yes.

659
01:19:51,445 --> 01:19:53,862
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did.

660
01:19:56,545 --> 01:19:58,162
Right word of obedient old man.

661
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:05,862
Excellent, really good cognac.
We are not that different Mr. Mesrine.

662
01:20:06,145 --> 01:20:10,192
We both like good things and to get them,

663
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:17,562
we have to steal from honest hard
working man. And why not?

664
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:24,362
What are you talking about? We've got nothing in common.
You are an exploiter and I'm a revolutionary.

665
01:20:24,545 --> 01:20:25,762
It's not the same thing.

666
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:33,862
- Mr. Mesrine, what's the difference
between a revolutionary and gangster?
- What is it, a riddle?

667
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:43,762
A Revolutionary would already put a bullet in my head
and left my body in a trunk of some car,

668
01:20:44,145 --> 01:20:53,762
in the meanwhile gangster needs a ransom,
he wants the money and then he let me go free.

669
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:56,062
Will you do it too?

670
01:20:58,745 --> 01:21:00,362
You forgot the third option.

671
01:21:02,695 --> 01:21:06,662
I'll take your money, put a bullet in your head
and I put you in a trunk.

672
01:21:07,945 --> 01:21:11,362
- How about that?
- In that case, everything they write about you in newspapers,

673
01:21:11,445 --> 01:21:18,762
Mesrine is honorable gangster,
he stands behind his word, all of it is just crap.

674
01:21:21,845 --> 01:21:24,962
- Jacques, look!
...accomplice of wanted Jacques Mesrine,

675
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:29,162
François Besse, with whom he escaped
from prison in De la Santé.

676
01:21:29,163 --> 01:21:30,163
Mesrine...

677
01:21:30,245 --> 01:21:34,862
After a few months Besse
parted ways with the public enemy number 1.

678
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:39,862
Belgian police arrested Bessa
and his three accomplices not far from Brussels,

679
01:21:39,945 --> 01:21:43,862
in cooperation with French counter-terrorist agency.

680
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:47,862
Belgian police...
- Only the biggest moron...

681
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,262
could get caught by Belgian cops.

682
01:21:52,745 --> 01:21:55,862
As I know him he won't stay
there for too long.

683
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:02,162
Your excellency, I invite you to the table.

684
01:22:11,245 --> 01:22:14,362
- For now it's calm, nothing is happening.
- Have a look.

685
01:22:19,945 --> 01:22:25,162
- We've been stuck here for too long. When will we go to get the money?
- Let him wait. It's better to wait...

686
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:08,862
- Wait, somebody stopped next to Lefebvre's car.
Let me see.

687
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,962
Asshole, I saw it.

688
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:19,062
They're cops, scumbags.

689
01:23:21,245 --> 01:23:25,862
Let's test the toughness of their glasses.

690
01:23:28,345 --> 01:23:31,962
So you brought the cops?
Here you go!

691
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:41,962
You wanted to screw me!
Just wait.

692
01:23:58,645 --> 01:24:00,762
Let's split. Move it!

693
01:24:21,945 --> 01:24:24,262
Your shitty son double crossed me,
he talked to cops!

694
01:24:29,645 --> 01:24:32,262
I swear, it won't happen again.

695
01:24:39,545 --> 01:24:43,362
It's in your interest,
trust me.

696
01:25:01,045 --> 01:25:04,562
I have two good news.

697
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:10,762
First: old grandpa can go back home
because his famous son...

698
01:25:11,645 --> 01:25:17,062
paid first payment of ransom.
And second news... watch...

699
01:25:18,745 --> 01:25:23,762
Hold it! I'll take a picture of you.
"BESSE: MESRINE STYLE ESCAPE"

700
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:29,862
Say cheese.
One, two, three... cheese.

701
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:31,962
Done.

702
01:25:35,445 --> 01:25:36,362
Here!

703
01:25:38,645 --> 01:25:40,862
Life is beautiful and full of surprises.

704
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:56,762
Hello. Welcome.

705
01:25:56,845 --> 01:25:59,692
- If you allow me I'd like to show you...
- Stop it, I'll take this one.

706
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:01,682
- I'll get the key right away.
- Hurry up!

707
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:29,962
...la la la, don't give a shit.

708
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:43,862
Move!

709
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:46,162
Where are the cops?

710
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:55,262
And here we are.

711
01:27:20,645 --> 01:27:21,762
Try that one.

712
01:27:27,745 --> 01:27:28,862
How much is it?

713
01:27:37,745 --> 01:27:39,862
- I give up.
- You're under arrest.

714
01:27:40,745 --> 01:27:41,862
Do you like it?

715
01:27:42,645 --> 01:27:43,562
Here you go.

716
01:27:55,245 --> 01:28:00,762
Last year, in may of 1979, when was Mesrine
sentenced to 20 years in prison,

717
01:28:01,145 --> 01:28:05,862
the only thing was on his mind, how to escape,
because he always needs...

718
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:09,862
to draw attention on himself and confirm
his reputation as "The Public Enemy Number 1".

719
01:28:10,595 --> 01:28:13,662
Paris, August of 1979.

720
01:28:29,745 --> 01:28:30,762
Charly!

721
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:35,307
Charly Bauer, invisible man.

722
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:41,762
- It's not easy to get together with you.
- You know, I have so little time, Jacques.

723
01:28:41,945 --> 01:28:44,962
Organization, comrades to which
I report...

724
01:28:45,645 --> 01:28:51,362
I completely forgot, your ultra-left
comrades want to thank you...

725
01:28:51,445 --> 01:28:56,962
something to drink, to eat, to go out. Is it true?
- You think, you destroy the system by yourself?

726
01:28:57,745 --> 01:29:01,162
No, I don't think so, I know so.
I know what I am doing.

727
01:29:02,195 --> 01:29:03,962
Have you read the newspapers? And my book?

728
01:29:04,015 --> 01:29:10,162
- Have you read my book?
- Some parts. And not all of it I liked,

729
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:13,962
because there's nothing in it I could relate to.

730
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:16,062
nor what I fight for...

731
01:29:16,445 --> 01:29:17,762
I tell it to you this way,

732
01:29:17,945 --> 01:29:22,862
if we've met during the war in Algeria,
we would fight against each other.

733
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:29,762
- I know that and I would kill you.
- Don't be mistaken,

734
01:29:29,945 --> 01:29:32,292
just because you and me don't have anything...

735
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:43,862
Ok... I've to go
home, to my family.

736
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:46,362
- Keep in touch.
- Yeah.

737
01:29:56,345 --> 01:30:02,062
- If you need something don't be shy.
- It'll happen soon, friend.

738
01:30:09,045 --> 01:30:14,842
What kind of moves are these? What?
Where are your manners?

739
01:30:15,645 --> 01:30:18,762
- What manners?
- Shaking your butt in front of my friend.

740
01:30:27,245 --> 01:30:31,062
- What should I say to you. You're just a cheap whore.
- What's that?

741
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:37,762
- Should I remind you where I bought you?
- You bought me? Nobody ever bought me!

742
01:30:38,595 --> 01:30:42,562
- Anybody with some extra money.
- I said that nobody ever paid for me!

743
01:30:42,845 --> 01:30:45,862
I'll never be bought!
If you'd just appreciate me a little bit,

744
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:49,162
you wouldn't talk like that.
- You talk about respect? Come here!

745
01:30:50,295 --> 01:30:53,862
You're going talk about respect?
And the same time you're acting like a whore
in front of my friend!

746
01:30:53,945 --> 01:30:56,162
- What friend?
- Shut up! Listen to me.

747
01:30:56,445 --> 01:31:00,762
He was in jail with me. In jail!
And that's enough.

748
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:12,762
François was your friend, but you always must have
the last word, that's why you're alone!

749
01:31:14,545 --> 01:31:16,862
That's how you end up... completely alone!

750
01:31:20,545 --> 01:31:28,562
- Why? You want to leave me?
- What are you talking about?

751
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:34,262
- Sylvia, you don't love me anymore?
- Leave me alone.

752
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:38,562
- Don't you love me anymore?
- I want us to leave. To leave.

753
01:31:38,745 --> 01:31:41,862
- We'll leave, honey.
- You always lie. - No, I don't.

754
01:31:42,145 --> 01:31:47,662
We won't go anywhere, they'll kill you. You will
get killed. - No, nobody will die.

755
01:31:49,445 --> 01:31:53,962
- Promise it. Promise it!
- I promise you, no one will die.

756
01:32:09,445 --> 01:32:13,882
- Charly.
- Hi.

757
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:20,162
Hey you little. My little man.

758
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:27,062
You're my little man.

759
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:32,762
No, that's not your mom.
Dear, take a care of visitors.

760
01:32:36,745 --> 01:32:41,762
Awful conditions and at the same time an effort
to break you down, humiliate you.

761
01:32:42,545 --> 01:32:46,562
That's true. They lock you up so they can
make an animal out of you, living dead.

762
01:32:46,745 --> 01:32:49,062
We need to end this repressive, aggressive system,

763
01:32:49,095 --> 01:32:51,382
whose existence is based on judgements.

764
01:32:52,245 --> 01:32:54,862
Are you aware, that guillotine compared to prison
with maximum security...

765
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:56,692
it's like amnesty?

766
01:32:59,195 --> 01:33:03,982
1) blow up the prison
2) free up our comrades

767
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:06,862
3) build an army together.

768
01:33:07,245 --> 01:33:10,592
Do you want to screw the system?
Then you're only pickpocketing thief.

769
01:33:11,245 --> 01:33:14,862
- The need to rob from banks and not...
- Banks will always be around.

770
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:22,762
What are you doing with the money after robberies?
You're buying expensive jewelry for your girl
and cars for yourself.

771
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:28,592
Actually you're not fighting the system
but you're supporting it.

772
01:33:31,845 --> 01:33:36,292
- I escaped from prison many times.
- How many times did you get caught?

773
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,862
- Have you given any thought to it?
- They won't get me anymore.

774
01:33:40,945 --> 01:33:44,092
They'll have to kill me.
They won't have any other choice.

775
01:33:45,095 --> 01:33:48,492
Otherwise I'm going to die by natural death.

776
01:33:51,445 --> 01:33:52,862
Honey! Where you going?

777
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:57,607
- Well, well.
- I can't talk about anything in front of her.

778
01:33:58,745 --> 01:34:02,062
She would cut my balls.

779
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:15,992
- What are you doing?
- I want to scatter the smoke.

780
01:34:16,545 --> 01:34:20,692
- It's bad for your health.
- Stop it! You think you'll get killed by cigars?

781
01:34:21,795 --> 01:34:22,762
You never know.

782
01:34:38,795 --> 01:34:49,092
- Tell me you're happy.
- I'd like to go away from here.

783
01:34:51,195 --> 01:34:55,462
We stay for a little while and
then we leave this country.

784
01:34:58,795 --> 01:35:04,292
Don't worry if we stay together,
nothing will happen to us.

785
01:35:06,595 --> 01:35:07,682
We love each other forever.

786
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:12,962
You're my treasure.

787
01:35:15,745 --> 01:35:19,062
- I love you.
- I love you too.

788
01:35:27,745 --> 01:35:29,062
That's Charly.

789
01:35:44,795 --> 01:35:49,692
- Do you know Dallier? Jacques Dallier?
- Fascist journalist.

790
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:55,762
Corrupted journalist who works for
minuscule newspapers...

791
01:35:59,245 --> 01:36:02,562
Read it. Read!
Read it out loud!

792
01:36:04,245 --> 01:36:10,092
- "Mesrine, gangster without a bit of honor".
- He writes about me!

793
01:36:13,195 --> 01:36:18,292
"The kind who doesn't stand behind his word
and snitches on his friends".
Asshole!

794
01:36:21,845 --> 01:36:24,662
So what do you intend?

795
01:37:26,745 --> 01:37:27,862
Let's go.

796
01:38:25,845 --> 01:38:27,562
In the car! Get in the car!

797
01:38:31,695 --> 01:38:32,562
Charly!

798
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:53,462
Reveal to me, your newspapers "Minute"
are they only for prisons with special regime?

799
01:38:53,745 --> 01:38:58,762
"Minute" are too extreme. As soon as I get the money for interview
I'll go to live on an island.

800
01:38:58,945 --> 01:39:03,162
An island?
And why not a French countryside?

801
01:39:03,645 --> 01:39:12,192
French? Maybe when France was proud and respected...
But then, in 40's it surrendered to Hitler

802
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:17,562
and 20 years later to strong Africa and Arabs too.

803
01:39:17,645 --> 01:39:21,362
- So you think Algeria doesn't belong to Algerians?
- And America belongs to Indians?

804
01:39:23,245 --> 01:39:25,992
Who makes the country strong, savage or white man?

805
01:39:29,295 --> 01:39:36,462
- You used to be a cop. What do you think about them?
- They're idiots, bunch of scumbags.

806
01:39:37,745 --> 01:39:41,962
You should see how he crawls around you
big Jacques here, Mesrine there,

807
01:39:42,245 --> 01:39:43,662
despise them.

808
01:39:45,245 --> 01:39:50,062
In October of 1961 police was completely different.
Knew how to stand up to criminals.

809
01:39:50,345 --> 01:39:58,909
But back then they had old Papón.
He was a powerful director.

810
01:40:03,345 --> 01:40:07,692
If it would be you I would take care of
Broussard. He intends something with your daughter.

811
01:40:09,245 --> 01:40:14,262
- That's true. And what plans they have regarding me?
- They want to kill you.

812
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:27,762
I'm sure about that.

813
01:40:52,745 --> 01:40:53,662
Wait here!

814
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:28,362
- Do you want a piece of gum?
- No.

815
01:41:47,445 --> 01:41:48,962
Kalashnikov is good weapon.

816
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:01,262
- Dallier!
- Go.

817
01:42:04,745 --> 01:42:05,662
Here you go.

818
01:42:04,745 --> 01:42:05,662
Go!

819
01:42:22,295 --> 01:42:23,262
This way.

820
01:42:24,245 --> 01:42:27,862
Go, keep going! Quickly! Move!

821
01:42:44,028 --> 01:42:49,222
- You think he's capable of it?
- What do I know what these types are capable of?

822
01:42:54,345 --> 01:42:55,662
Do we start the interview?

823
01:43:00,645 --> 01:43:04,592
I will speak to Jacques Mesrine
who's ready to answer my questions.

824
01:43:06,395 --> 01:43:08,262
- Are you Jacques Mesrine?
- Maybe I am.

825
01:43:09,745 --> 01:43:10,762
So, you are Jacques Mesrine.

826
01:43:15,095 --> 01:43:19,062
I don't know what you have been told,
but you seem nervous.

827
01:43:19,945 --> 01:43:21,962
- Are you scared of something?
- It only seems to you.

828
01:43:25,645 --> 01:43:26,862
You're not comfortable.

829
01:43:31,845 --> 01:43:34,492
- I'm shocked.
- Why are you shocked?

830
01:43:34,745 --> 01:43:36,562
After all you came to do interview with me.

831
01:43:38,085 --> 01:43:39,962
Have you kidnapped Mr. Lelievre?

832
01:43:44,245 --> 01:43:48,162
- Put the microphone down.
- What's that?
- I told you to put the microphone down!

833
01:43:48,945 --> 01:43:52,662
Take all of your clothes off!
You want interview? We do it right now.

834
01:43:53,845 --> 01:43:57,262
But first we have to see you.
Let's go, get undressed! Take them off!

835
01:43:59,045 --> 01:44:01,292
So we see you came here
for an interview.

836
01:44:01,645 --> 01:44:05,392
Take them off! They could think you belong to us,
but you don't.

837
01:44:05,845 --> 01:44:08,192
- But you said that...
- Move!

838
01:44:05,845 --> 01:44:08,192
- You always need a material, aren't you?
- What do you mean?

839
01:44:15,395 --> 01:44:17,962
And then we put handcuffs.

840
01:44:18,645 --> 01:44:24,892
- And now, my dear... we'll play.
- Hands! Hands behind your back!

841
01:44:25,195 --> 01:44:27,392
- Mesrine, we are...
- Shut up! I'm talking now!

842
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:29,962
- Listen to me...
- Shut up!

843
01:44:31,245 --> 01:44:35,792
I explain to you what we're going to do.
Dallier won't be doing the interview...

844
01:44:37,345 --> 01:44:42,562
...but Jacques Mesrine will ask the questions.
- Wait, don't do it!

845
01:44:51,145 --> 01:44:56,192
- What's your name?! What?
- Your name!
- Jacques Dallier.

846
01:44:51,145 --> 01:44:56,192
Jacques Dallier. That's right, Dallier.
That's the name of this dirt!

847
01:44:59,495 --> 01:45:02,962
- Who do you work for? What cheap newspapers you work for?
- "Minute".

848
01:45:04,945 --> 01:45:09,692
- What?
- "Minute".
- Oh yes, for "Minute", the fascist newspapers.

849
01:45:13,445 --> 01:45:17,892
Did you write this? Did you write an article
about me? It is your article, isn't it?

850
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:20,262
- That's not my article.
- I advise you, you better don't lie to me.

851
01:45:23,145 --> 01:45:26,892
That was you! You wrote the article!

852
01:45:31,145 --> 01:45:34,687
What? You wrote that I'm not honest
to my friends!

853
01:45:38,395 --> 01:45:41,292
I don't deal with my friends like that.
You tarnished me!

854
01:45:45,445 --> 01:45:48,862
My friend is here. Ask him if I'm honest man!

855
01:45:50,045 --> 01:45:51,362
If I'm honest!

856
01:45:53,045 --> 01:45:57,892
Journalists, who talk shit about me,
I break their neck! I break it!

857
01:46:10,945 --> 01:46:16,492
I show you how we used to do it in Algeria.
Look! You die, you asshole!

858
01:46:16,645 --> 01:46:20,092
That's enough. Stop!
Don't be a fascist like him!

859
01:46:21,245 --> 01:46:26,392
Stop!
If you want to, shoot him and let's end this.

860
01:46:26,393 --> 01:46:27,393
You right.

861
01:46:36,545 --> 01:46:38,662
Not necessary! We already made too much noise.

862
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:42,562
Anyway he's dead.

863
01:46:52,945 --> 01:46:54,662
- You read the papers?
- Why?

864
01:46:55,945 --> 01:47:00,962
- That dick Dallier is alive. Would you believe it?
- He's alive? So? Only better.

865
01:47:01,145 --> 01:47:05,262
Better? What's so better about it? It's a disaster!
I told you not to send the photograph.

866
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:07,462
Even journalists, your followers
are shocked!

867
01:47:08,945 --> 01:47:14,262
He wasn't even a reporter, just a regular snitch.

868
01:47:14,945 --> 01:47:21,962
Judge however you want. You pissed off
journalists! You attacked one of them!

869
01:47:22,045 --> 01:47:27,062
- Oh, one of them. So what? Just one.
- Read what the press is writing.

870
01:47:27,945 --> 01:47:33,262
From now on, my friend,
bear the repercussions yourself.

871
01:47:41,945 --> 01:47:47,162
HI my love. If you're listening this cassette
my little Sylvia,

872
01:47:47,395 --> 01:47:53,962
I won't be here. It's only my voice,
my voice for your remembrance .

873
01:47:55,595 --> 01:47:59,162
That's the way it is my baby, your man is dead.
He was shot in barrage of police bullets.

874
01:48:00,945 --> 01:48:07,162
You know kitty, the man who chose
the life of war, robberies,

875
01:48:09,395 --> 01:48:11,162
won't die by a natural death.

876
01:48:13,945 --> 01:48:19,292
At the end, it's not important
if I died alone or in police fire.

877
01:48:19,845 --> 01:48:27,062
My death is like meaningless airplane catastrophe
or unfortunate coincidence.

878
01:48:29,195 --> 01:48:32,262
You know, death doesn't even exist.

879
01:48:33,545 --> 01:48:36,092
Death doesn't mean anything for someone
who knew how to live.

880
01:48:36,945 --> 01:48:41,262
I can say I didn't waste my life.

881
01:48:41,845 --> 01:48:47,162
A love for the law didn't work out,
but I had other love...

882
01:48:48,545 --> 01:48:50,762
...a love for woman, for you .

883
01:48:50,945 --> 01:48:54,392
I became a gangster.
That was my choice.

884
01:48:56,345 --> 01:48:59,762
I chose such life ,
an easy one, a criminal one,

885
01:49:00,545 --> 01:49:05,392
my victims have always been
or almost always been a filthy rich.

886
01:49:09,845 --> 01:49:13,392
After death I won't be guilty any more,
because I'll pay for everything.

887
01:49:14,145 --> 01:49:18,492
It's weird, people think of you as hero.

888
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:22,562
but honestly, in the world of gangsters
heroes don't exist.

889
01:49:22,945 --> 01:49:25,362
In this world there are only people,
who live outside of the law.

890
01:49:26,945 --> 01:49:30,262
I would die with gun in my hand even
if I couldn't use it.

891
01:49:30,945 --> 01:49:33,262
I can't know that, but I know this...

892
01:49:33,945 --> 01:49:39,262
If you're listening this cassette, I am in cell
I can't escape from.

893
01:49:40,945 --> 01:49:44,262
November 2nd, 1979.

894
01:49:49,445 --> 01:49:50,762
Your newspapers Robert.

895
01:49:55,045 --> 01:49:57,262
Barre pays off his last debt
to Robert Boulin

896
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:02,463
Once again they're full of crap...

897
01:50:03,464 --> 01:50:05,164
Forget about it.

898
01:50:15,145 --> 01:50:16,262
Coming out! Coming out!

899
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:28,292
Woman came out... with dog.

900
01:50:33,445 --> 01:50:36,462
She's walking down on Billiar.
She's going towards Monceni.

901
01:50:39,795 --> 01:50:41,382
She'll show up in three seconds.

902
01:50:44,745 --> 01:50:46,462
This is Dom.
What's she doing?

903
01:50:50,045 --> 01:50:51,382
She's looking around.

904
01:50:57,895 --> 01:51:00,292
A man is coming out of the building.
He's looking around.

905
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:21,092
He's getting closer...
He's on Billiar.

906
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:47,162
- What's he doing?
- He's heading toward Monceni.

907
01:51:52,445 --> 01:51:54,362
He's getting away from me. He's coming your way.

908
01:51:58,645 --> 01:52:01,082
Yeah, I see him, he's on Billiar.

909
01:52:07,445 --> 01:52:08,562
I lost him!

910
01:52:09,045 --> 01:52:11,192
Gégé, do you see him?

911
01:52:11,445 --> 01:52:13,762
I repeat , I don't know where he went.

912
01:52:17,045 --> 01:52:17,862
Damn!

913
01:52:23,745 --> 01:52:26,062
I see him.
He's walking slowly but not stopping.

914
01:52:35,045 --> 01:52:41,762
Shit! What am I going to do
if he'll find me here? Boss, what should I do?

915
01:52:41,845 --> 01:52:44,262
Relax Gégé, he won't notice anything.
- He's coming, He's coming

916
01:52:47,345 --> 01:52:49,762
He's looking at the truck.
He's getting closer!

917
01:52:50,045 --> 01:52:51,762
That's all. I'm turning it off!

918
01:52:53,745 --> 01:52:54,762
Gégé.

919
01:53:03,895 --> 01:53:04,762
Gégé!

920
01:53:19,145 --> 01:53:19,962
Gégé!

921
01:53:49,745 --> 01:53:52,762
- I don't see them.
- What do you mean you don't see them?

922
01:53:53,845 --> 01:53:57,862
They were next to me, but I lost them.
Do you see them? I don't see them.

923
01:53:58,645 --> 01:54:00,062
Good, just calm down.

924
01:54:09,745 --> 01:54:11,762
I don't see anybody...
They just showed up!

925
01:54:16,745 --> 01:54:17,562
Idiot!

926
01:54:20,745 --> 01:54:24,062
I see Mesrine! He's with girl friend
in his BMW.

927
01:54:32,445 --> 01:54:34,992
83CSG75. I repeat...

928
01:54:39,845 --> 01:54:41,662
Gégé, he's backing up towards you.

929
01:54:57,645 --> 01:55:01,662
Copy. BMW is backing up towards me.

930
01:55:01,945 --> 01:55:02,862
It stopped.

931
01:55:05,945 --> 01:55:08,062
Both of them are getting out of the car,
she first.

932
01:55:16,345 --> 01:55:20,692
She went in the building.
He got out of the car.

933
01:55:23,645 --> 01:55:25,862
He's walking towards me.
- Calm, keep calm.

934
01:55:26,145 --> 01:55:27,962
He's coming towards me. He's coming towards me!
What should I do?

935
01:55:31,745 --> 01:55:33,462
Speak Gégé! Do you copy?

936
01:55:40,745 --> 01:55:41,762
Gégé!

937
01:56:03,745 --> 01:56:08,092
he was leaning on me.
I almost shit my pants. Shit!

938
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:11,092
He's putting things in the trunk.

939
01:56:19,745 --> 01:56:21,262
She got in the car again.

940
01:56:27,945 --> 01:56:30,962
- They're going your way.
- I see them.

941
01:56:34,745 --> 01:56:36,062
We're moving towards Monceni.

942
01:56:38,645 --> 01:56:41,762
- In a few days I'll go to Milan to see Charly.
- Milan? What for?

943
01:56:41,945 --> 01:56:44,062
- I have to.
- Why?

944
01:56:44,545 --> 01:56:47,362
He wants to introduce me to his friends
from Red brigades.

945
01:56:47,745 --> 01:56:50,262
- Will you take me with you?
I can't. Maybe next time.

946
01:56:51,245 --> 01:56:54,062
BMW went by me.
Is going by an average speed.

947
01:56:59,445 --> 01:57:04,692
- Don't be sad. You can furnish our new apartment,
while I'm away. - Not without you.

948
01:57:11,895 --> 01:57:17,362
- Suspect is standing three cars from me.
- All cars: Move towards Porte de Clignancourt.

949
01:57:24,645 --> 01:57:25,892
I'll be back soon.

950
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,962
This is Dom. We're approaching Cornenau.

951
01:57:35,745 --> 01:57:37,962
- Do you love me?
- Sure.

952
01:57:49,685 --> 01:57:54,062
Suspect went on green light.
All units: The operation started!

953
01:57:59,245 --> 01:58:00,962
This is Gégé.
I'm moving to Clignancourt.

954
01:58:30,745 --> 01:58:31,562
Shit!

955
01:58:33,445 --> 01:58:36,862
Did you know I was born just a half mile from here?

956
01:58:41,345 --> 01:58:42,662
BMW is approaching the square.

957
01:58:44,945 --> 01:58:46,162
BMW is arriving at square.

958
01:58:46,295 --> 01:58:47,262
Shit!

959
01:59:24,445 --> 01:59:25,562
Go ahead, go.

960
02:01:06,345 --> 02:01:13,062
Get out! Get out! I said get out!
Did you understand?!

961
02:01:13,745 --> 02:01:18,062
Let's go! Move, quickly!
Get on the ground! On the ground!

962
02:01:18,745 --> 02:01:24,062
- Lie down! Don't move. Stop twitching!
- You killed my dog!

963
02:01:36,145 --> 02:01:40,562
Hold her. Hold her!
Stop twitching!

964
02:02:05,545 --> 02:02:08,862
Dog is here.
Take him to a veterinarian.

965
02:02:10,145 --> 02:02:11,262
Seal it over here.

966
02:02:13,245 --> 02:02:14,662
Where did the truck go?

967
02:02:20,595 --> 02:02:23,662
It's over.
He's dead.

968
02:04:42,372 --> 02:04:47,876
- Hold her. Shut your mouth! Shut up!
- You killed my dog!
