<i>Oh yeah.

<i>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Come on baby.
Come on. Come on.</i>

<i>Oh yeah. Yeah.

<i>Oh, oh, oh yeah.
Oh yeah. Yeah.</i>

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,770
<i>Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.</i>

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,850
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,980
<i>- Come on baby.

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,960
<i>- Oh. Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,040
<i>Yeah.</i>

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,190
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Fucking kids and
their fucking chocolate.

20
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,500
What about What's-Her-Name at the office?
The strawberry blonde.

21
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,730
- Who?
- Who? You know who.

22
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,860
She does not like me.

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Hey, my picklock.

24
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,380
Oh... magic!

25
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,940
I'm telling you,
she likes you, man.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,470
Listen. She's always on your case.
You know what it means, don't you?

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,820
No. She's never on my case.
She's always on your case, my friend.

28
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,660
On the cactus...
Mike, on the cactus.

29
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,340
Nice.
Yeah.

30
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,240
She does not like me.
Stop saying that.

31
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,240
- I'm too fat.
- You're not fat.

32
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,470
You're just a little fat.

33
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,660
You're counteracting what you're doing.
You're working out, eatings carrots,

34
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,080
doing the proteine shake and then
you shovel ice cream in there.

35
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,120
I see you do it.
It's disgusting.

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,570
- Stress.
- Have some respect for yourself.

37
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,100
- That's enough.
- It's never enough.

38
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,410
OK.
Now it's enough.

39
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,490
Daddy.
Daddy!

40
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,000
What?
What is it?

41
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,860
Where are my easter eggs?

42
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,180
Dumb furs.

43
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,000
- What's so funny, huh?
- Nothing.

44
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,310
OK.
Where'd you hide them?

45
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,820
If I'd my way, those kids
would never find those eggs.

46
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,730
- What?
- I'd hide them eggs in the ocean.

47
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,230
Compost bin?
Septic tank? What?

48
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,370
Kitty litter?
Oven?

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,820
Oh, it's the oven!

50
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,460
It's half past.
Honestly.

51
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,590
<i>No one will ever love me.</i>

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,880
<i>I just feel like
there is no hope.</i>

53
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,160
<i>I'll never be skinny.</i>

54
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,410
<i>I just want to die.</i>

55
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,690
<i>Does this sound familiar?</i>

56
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,130
<i>Do you like thousands of others believe,
that life holds no hope for you?</i>

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,060
<i>If you're considering suicide anyway,
don't make it a waste.</i>

58
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,330
<i>With our specialized corporate branding,
your family stands to make big money.</i>

59
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,680
<i>Here is how it works: You select

<i>Giving our corporate sponsors

<i>Give the gift that keeps on giving:

66
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,910
<i>Do the right thing.</i>

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,650
<i>PMJ Marketing is a subsidiary of MDK,
a part of VIOK international, a division of...</i>

68
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,210
- I was there.
- I know.

69
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,560
OK. Let's just get this over with. So I don't
have to see any of you for another month.

70
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,110
I know you've all seen
the numbers from last year.

71
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,730
They're predicting this year
will be even worse.

72
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,040
It seems our dismal
fiscal performances

73
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,000
finally caught the attention of
the big boys at the head office.

74
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,510
So...

75
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,970
They sent a Bogeyman to scare us
out of the red and into the black.

76
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,800
Most of you will recognize Conrad Hubriss

77
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,370
as the genius behind Sponsored Suicide.

78
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,930
Mr. Hubriss...
Whip out your dog and pony.

79
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,390
Thank you, Mr. Pan.

80
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,710
Easter bunnies...

81
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,550
are on the payroll year-round.

82
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,470
They do not however,
work 365 days a year.

83
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,230
Now I understand that most holidays
happen only once a year,

84
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,880
but their profits justify
their expenditures.

85
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Not so with Easter.

86
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:14,640
Therefore my recommendation is to reduce
said delivery staff by 11.341 percent.

87
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,170
You can't fire Easter bunnies.

88
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,970
They're...
They're Easter bunnies.

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,030
As it stands Easter is currently
a second tier holiday.

90
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,150
Christmas, Hanukkah, Thanksgiving,
Valentine's Day, 4th of July.

91
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,220
Those are your tier 1 holidays.

92
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,970
High profits, international profile.
Strong, strong merchandising.

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,060
And there's Halloween, Kwanzaa,
Easter and Canada Day.

94
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,780
Or your second tier hollidays.

95
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,400
Less profits. Less visibility.
Less perceived importance.

96
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,350
What we have here, ladies and gentlemen
is a holiday that does well.

97
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,730
Not great.
But well.

98
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,200
And manages to chug along,
year after year, just getting by.

99
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,240
My job is to stop that sinking ship
ladies and gentleman.

100
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,540
And start making our
shareholders some money.

101
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,180
- How'd it go boys?
- Oh, same shit, different year.

102
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,690
- How's things on your end, Phil?
- A fucking nightmare.

103
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,870
A gear got jammed on the egg-painter.
Now I've got to wait for a new part.

104
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
They tell me it's gonna take an hour.
I'll believe it when I see it.

105
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,950
Goddamn it, Nicholas!
How many times I gotta tell you.

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,820
You've got to move the basket or that
scissel won't shut up.

107
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,070
# Speaking Chinese #

108
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,480
# Speaking Chinese #

109
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,330
I got over 6.5 mil eggs that I got to
get over eight timezones by four.

110
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,830
- That's a fucking nightmare, I tell you.
- That's bullshit, man.

111
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,080
You know these goddamn machines -
They give me a hernia.

112
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,160
Remember the good ol' days when
we used to paint all these by hand?

113
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,080
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

114
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,960
It took a long time, but goddamm it -
We got it done!

115
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,440
Yeah.
Ok.

116
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
You get some sleep, Phil!

117
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,240
- He's gonna have a heart attack.
- Guaranteed.

118
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,170
- Hey, one more for the good guys.
- Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,870
What the hell?

120
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,090
This is just like that dream I have.

121
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,300
- Only I'm not on fire.
- Hey Mike.

122
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,140
Hey Lena.

123
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,580
- What's the good word?
- Restraining order.

124
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,710
- That's two words.
- Lena, what's going on here?

125
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,200
Actually, that's what I need to talk to you both.
You missed a house on your route.

126
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,510
Hey, you know who you're talking to?
We never miss a house.

127
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,060
Easy.

128
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,530
That can't be right.
As he said, we never miss a house.

129
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,350
You sure, you got the Sulsky house?
Because the computer shows...

130
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh, fucking computer!
It's probably got worms.

131
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,350
The Sulsky house was the last house
on our route. We got that one.

132
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,380
OK.

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll tell you what I'll do.

134
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,250
I'll... write out the report personally
and I'll e-mail it to you right away.

135
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,560
Perfect.

136
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,550
You know what, actually my
office inbox gets really packed.

137
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,670
So, I'll just give you
my personal address.

138
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,090
Sure.
That would be great.

139
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh. Great.
Putting it in my basket.

140
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,830
- So, I'll see you at the party tonight?
- Oh yeah. We will be there.

141
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,440
Great.

142
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,440
Dude, that was great.
You seen that look she gave you?

143
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,260
When you put her on the place.
"My inbox gets packed."

144
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,420
She loves it. She's a dirty, dirty girl.
You ask her out. Alright?

145
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,280
Dry spell over, Mikey. Ask her out.
I'll see you in the locker room.

146
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,860
What look?
What look?!

147
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah.
I got a look.

148
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,810
That was definitely a look.

149
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,720
Hey Lena.

150
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, okay
Umm...

151
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,470
I know, you can't love someone,
'till you learn to love yourself first.

152
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,050
But I just wanna let you know,
that I am...

153
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,410
Im working on that.
It's going good.

154
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,450
Anyways,
I was wondering, maybe if, sometime...

155
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,270
When, you know,
when you have some free time.

156
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,930
You know, no pressure.
Maybe...

157
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,910
You'd like to get together,
outside of the workplace environment.

158
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh yeah.

159
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,890
- Hey Mikey.
- Hi.

160
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,280
Roulette tables are not perfect, right?
You've got like a number one

161
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,550
and number four is gonna hit
every single time.

162
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,790
OK. One more.
One more.

163
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,100
Okay. Take it.
Take it. Take it.

164
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,850
Hey.

165
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,940
- How's the knee, Chunky?
- It's fine.

166
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,470
I heard about that stunt
you pulled today.

167
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,200
What you guys are retarted?
And I can say "retarted."

168
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,910
Cause I got a retarted brother.
So I can say "retarted."

169
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,110
- That was a computer glitch.
- Come on.

170
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,300
You guys are an embarrassement.
You embarrass the company.

171
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,520
You embarrass Liam
and you embarrass me.

172
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,750
You know Mike, steroids have
a wide array of devastating side effects.

173
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,410
You know that?
Yeah.

174
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,310
Jaundice, fluid retention,
severe back acne or bacne.

175
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,470
Infertility, liver tumors, baldness.

176
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,020
- Testicular shrinkage.
- Really?

177
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,880
Testicular shrinkage,
I didn't know that one.

178
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,860
Testicular shrinkage.

179
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,080
Well... I don't have back...
back... Bacne.

180
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,160
Cocksuckers!

181
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,570
You embarrass Liam.

182
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,590
We embarrass Liam.

183
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,820
Oh man.

184
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,890
What's this?

185
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,310
Big guy wants to see us.

186
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,350
You didn't talk to her, did you?

187
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
Listen.
I did my best.

188
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,380
Yeah. I know.
I know you did.

189
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,090
Rookie.

190
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,830
Come on.
Make it right.

191
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,520
Fuck.

192
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,690
So hey Brenda.
Was meaning to call...

193
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,600
You are such an asshole.

194
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,400
You like telling everybody at the company
softball game that I was easy, huh?

195
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,190
You like spreading rumours?
Yeah? OK.

196
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,400
How about I spread a rumour?

197
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,100
About how little Hanky-poo,
begged a certain executive assistant

198
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,670
to wear a strap-on
and fuck him in the ass.

199
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,450
Hard.

200
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,300
Good morning, Mr. Pan's office.
Brenda speaking.

201
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,000
Crazy.

202
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,810
She tore you a new asshole, huh?

203
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,950
Again!

204
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,820
Shut up.
Hey, fuck you, Luiz!

205
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,210
- Culo!
- Next.

206
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,420
Sit down.
Fuck you.

207
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,410
Culo.

208
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,970
Close the door.
You're creating a draft.

209
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,000
There you go.
Beautiful.

210
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,890
You asked to see us, sir?

211
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,050
I love nudes.

212
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,420
Do you know why I love nudes?

213
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,670
'Cause there ain't no boobs
on a bowl of fruit.

214
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:59,690
It's misogyny like that, which keeps
women from Fully blooming in this world.

215
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,560
That's why you was excommunicated
from the Mormon Church, sir.

216
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,690
Thank you, darling.

217
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,500
- Sit down, boys.
- Excuse me.

218
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,320
Well...
I've been looking over your files.

219
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,100
Mike:
Top Bunny 17 years in a row.

220
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah.

221
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,450
Volunteer work.

222
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Warmer!

223
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,550
Warmer!

224
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,540
You found it!

225
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,460
Yay!

226
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,080
Tore up your knee in Bosnia.

227
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,700
And most notably: Recepient of the
golden egg for outstanding performance.

228
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,610
Impressive, Mike.
Very impressive.

229
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,260
Hank, your file is
a little more... colorful.

230
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,330
- What the fuck is that?
- Hmmm?

231
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,460
How many times, have
you been on probation?

232
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,310
- Once?
- Twenty four.

233
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,680
Is it twenty four?

234
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,110
Feels like less.

235
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,940
Stealing office supplies.

236
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,170
Fighting with fellow employees.

237
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,390
You've got it in backwards in the feeder.
You've got to twist it around a little bit...

238
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,320
Sexual harassment.

239
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,270
Yes.

240
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,390
Colorful.

241
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,570
What happened?

242
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,860
Sir?

243
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,410
With what?

244
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,560
You know what.

245
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>This morning,
six year old Lucy Sulsky,</i>

246
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,350
<i>Was shocked and heart-broken
not to find any Easter eggs.</i>

247
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,490
<i>Did I do something to make
the Easter bunny mad?</i>

248
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,200
<i>Is there anything you'd like
to say to the Easter bunny?</i>

249
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,350
<i>Where's my fucking chocolate?</i>

250
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,660
<i>There has been a national outcry for
the misery, that befell little Lucy Sulsky.</i>

251
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,090
<i>Early child trauma has
severe damaging effects, and...</i>

252
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,910
<i>...over the next five hours...</i>

253
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,050
No Child Left Behind.

254
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,360
You remember?

255
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,700
Anyone near retirement, new on the job,
or facing disciplinary problems:

256
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,900
Will be downsized.

257
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,150
- What?
- Wait a second.

258
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,000
You can't fire an Easter bunny.
I mean... We are Easter bunnies.

259
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,960
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

260
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,760
- That's fucking bullshit. You can't fire me.
- No. No. No. It's...

261
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,630
You think you can fire me after
all the eggs we hid for this company...?

262
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,560
- Little Lucy Sulsky, she made a mistake.
- Call my union rep!

263
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,080
Then we'll see, then we'll see!
- We can call the parents and explain...

264
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,780
No, we can explain...
Tell... Tell him.

265
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,330
Hank.

266
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Hank.

267
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,030
I didn't do it.

268
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,970
What?

269
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,960
I didn't hide the eggs.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,910
Look, sir.

271
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,760
Mike had nothing to do with this.
Alright? It's all me.

272
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,580
He didn't know anything...
Look at his face.

273
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,430
He doesn't know anything.
Look at him. Look at him.

274
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
He's the best goddamn bunny
you ever had. You said so yourself.

275
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,510
If you're gonna fire somebody...
Fire me.

276
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,150
She was on your route.

277
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,490
You two are a team.

278
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,650
You think this is easy for me?

279
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,960
Mike...
Hank...

280
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,200
You're fired.

281
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,280
Hey neighbour.

282
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
- Hey Leon.
- You guys wanna buy a waffle maker?

283
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,060
Dude.
We already got a wafflemaker.

284
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,160
Yeah, but this one makes up to
four slices at the same time.

285
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,670
Dude.
We got a waffle maker!

286
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,570
Mike, please.

287
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,270
I'll eat out your asshole
for fifty bucks.

288
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,030
Thirty?

289
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,590
Ten?

290
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,970
Please. Mike.
For child support.

291
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,170
We're neighbours.

292
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,530
Weren't you a lawyer?

293
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,990
Oh, man.

294
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,830
<i>...nine from their own 35</i>

295
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,200
<i>just over nine minutes to go
in the quarter</i>

296
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,150
<i>And they need to score on this drive.</i>

297
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,260
<i>Looking for the blitz
that he knows is coming.</i>

298
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,360
I need...

299
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,520
...to get out...

300
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,720
...of this house.

301
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,810
<i>Brought down at the fifties</i>

302
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,340
OK.

303
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,260
- Tons of people in there.
- Mike...

304
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,490
No, no, I changed my mind.
I don't wanna go.

305
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,430
Mike. It's gonna be fine.
Alright? These are our friends.

306
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,760
- It's awkward.
- It's not gonna be awkward.

307
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,530
It's gonna be awkward,
if you make it awkward. Alright?

308
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,250
I'm tired of your moody shit.
Let's go. Have some fun.

309
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,480
How's everybody doing?
Hey baby, how you doing?

310
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,280
Come find me after the party alright?
Hey everybody!

311
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,520
We're pink, we stink
and we're here to drink!

312
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,080
How you doing?
Hey Frankie, what's going on, man?

313
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,280
Good man.

314
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,270
You know it.
Don't drink too much.

315
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,110
Nice.
Nice.

316
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,080
- Hey Danny. What's shaking?
- Fucking back, what can I say?

317
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,600
By the way, your new shower curtain?
Bit gay.

318
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,410
- No. No, it's not.
- It's a bit gay.

319
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,790
No. It's realy nice. The lilacs
and the hummingbirds... It's good.

320
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,270
- That's not gay at all.
- Listen, first of all...

321
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,860
How the fuck you guys know
that I got a new shower curtain.

322
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,190
- Ummm...
- Hello.

323
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,010
You're on our route, Danny.

324
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,780
Jeez!
Gives me the creeps!

325
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,620
Anyways, what's going on?
What's new?

326
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,670
We got fired, Danny.

327
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,630
- Fired?
- You believe it?

328
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,720
You're fucking Easter bunnies.
Can't fire Easter bunnies.

329
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,200
Well... Write a letter.

330
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,240
What can I get you guys?
C'mon. On the house.

331
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,040
- The usual.
- What? Steak and a face dance?

332
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,390
- Alright.
- No, no. The other usual.

333
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,910
Two bourbons and
two beerchasers.

334
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,000
How about you Mikey?

335
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,190
- Cranberry soda.
- Yeah, alright. Coming up. Right away.

336
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,440
Alright.
I am getting drunk.

337
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,830
I am getting dirty drunk.

338
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,620
- Surprise...
- Ladies...

339
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,060
- Thank you.
- No problem.

340
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,550
It's very good.

341
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,860
Ladies, I'd like to introduce you
to my friend Mike.

342
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,210
Mike, this is... Athena?

343
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,720
And her lovely friend...

344
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,780
- Estress.
- Estress. I know baby.

345
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,780
Are you really an astronaut?

346
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,570
- Look. We got to hide the eggs.
- Right.

347
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,570
And not good enough,
because the kids,

348
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,940
who couldn't care less, by the way,
got to find the eggs.

349
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,260
- That's doing the job half way.
- That's your opinion.

350
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,520
You know. I mean does the Tooth Fairy
give twelve and a half cents?

351
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,120
- Hmmm?
- No.

352
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,960
Does a fireman put out half the fire and
you know, the rest of the family burns?

353
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,740
- No.
- It's bullshit.

354
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,110
We're fucking jokes, Mike.

355
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,700
Fucking jokes.

356
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,220
You know Easter just used us...
and spit us out.

357
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Easter was our pimp.

358
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,700
We were Easter bitches.

359
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,310
Hey. Hey.
Who am I?

360
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Hey.
Who am I?

361
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,930
Heyyy!
Pretty lady!

362
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,590
We are going for now
to cut the company cake.

363
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,610
I'm just messing...
We were drinking with these russian dudes.

364
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,790
"Na zdorovye!"

365
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,210
Come on, seriously.
They want us back there.

366
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,110
Let's go.
Wow.

367
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,930
I said... the company cake.

368
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,180
It's double fudge delight.

369
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,800
Fuck you!

370
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,690
I've never done it
with an Easter bunny before.

371
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,010
Oh yeah? Well, this'll be
the best 8.5 seconds of your life.

372
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,440
Oh God.

373
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,420
Major Hank.

374
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Ten, nine, eight, ...

375
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,400
Seven, six, five,

376
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,010
four, three, two...

377
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,560
- Oh.
- Yeah.

378
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,840
Good morning.

379
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,270
Got any jerky?

380
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,980
Umm...

381
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,760
No.

382
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,100
- I was just on my way out.
- Oh.

383
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,680
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

384
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,810
Oh.
Good luck in space!

385
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,800
What's that Watermelon Man?

386
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,630
Oh, that's absurd.

387
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,300
You're my BFF...

388
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,220
Best Friend Forever.

389
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,520
First of, kudos on reducing the delivery
work force as per our discussion.

390
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,930
Now that that's dealt with,
I've got another great idea.

391
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,580
As it stands the company's biggest
expenditure is chocolate.

392
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,150
You're wasting your time.

393
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,710
That's what they said about
my little Sponsored Suicide idea.

394
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,980
- We all saw how that turned out, didn't we?
- Yes. We did.

395
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,010
Now, it's been nice chatting with you,
but I have somewhere more important to be.

396
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:47,300
<i>And a lot of these bunnies, they're just
coasting by and not doing their jobs,</i>

397
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,080
<i>and they were acting all retarted.</i>

398
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,230
<i>No. It's ok.
I got a retarted brother.</i>

399
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,040
<i>Look.</i>

400
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,410
<i>You play with fire - You get cut.</i>

401
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,690
Hey.
Where have you been?

402
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,430
Hey.
Nowhere.

403
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,670
What'd you do all day?

404
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,080
Nothing. I went to the store and
got some stuff. Paper towels, pudding.

405
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,850
What?
I tell you everything I do now?

406
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,820
You got pudding?

407
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,130
- I went to the office.
- Oh, motherfucker!

408
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,700
What? You get down on your bum knee
and beg for your job back?

409
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,290
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,430
"I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry."

411
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,390
Here, I'll give you sorry.

412
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,550
Here's sorry. Come on, fatass.
Come on. Fool.

413
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,690
- You're crazy.
- Come on!

414
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,540
- You...
- Want crazy, huh?

415
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,160
Come on.

416
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,790
No.

417
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,490
- Don't...
- Get off.

418
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,460
OK.

419
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,970
How come we never hug?

420
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,740
What?

421
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,470
How come we never hug?

422
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,030
Hi. I'll have an extra grande moccha latte
with raspberry and banana shots.

423
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,110
Skim milk, no foam and four of these
almond & white pepper biscottis, please.

424
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,010
And for you sir?

425
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,130
- Coffee.
- Tall, grande or robust?

426
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,920
I will fight you.

427
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,890
Well.
I could donate my body to science.

428
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,180
Let them test shampoos
and makeups on me.

429
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,590
That'd be loads of fun.

430
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,020
Hey. I can get that
race track job, you know?

431
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,730
Let them shove a stick up my ass and
have dogs chase me round and round.

432
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,160
Listen, there's still hope. We've just
gotta tighten our belts a little.

433
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,140
Cut down on the non-essentials, ok?

434
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,510
- Go.
- No more eating out.

435
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,010
- You'll have to cut down on cigarettes.
- Nope.

436
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,400
- No more Pilates classes for me.
- You did Pilates?

437
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,110
We'd have to cut the cable and internet.

438
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,550
Dude, we don't pay for that.
I stole Leon's dish.

439
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,370
No more deep tissue massages.
No, no. Wait. No, no.

440
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,120
- Those are partialy coverd.
- Were partialy covered...

441
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,300
- You'll have to drink domestic beer.
- Nope.

442
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,020
- I'll have to eat domestic ice cream.
- There you go.

443
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,570
And...

444
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,160
Non-organic carrots.

445
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,720
So listen, Mike.

446
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,600
I didn't wanna bring it up earlier,
but...

447
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,680
Your golden egg, man.

448
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,990
No.

449
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,100
Dude, it's worth a ton, we could get
like six months rent for that.

450
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,650
No.

451
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,120
Alright.
Good.

452
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,500
We tighten our belts.

453
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,520
We're gonna be fine.
For quite some time.

454
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,060
Here we go.

455
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,750
- Yeah. That's a good one.
- Yeah.

456
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,300
Good one.

457
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,460
- They're all good. All these will get you high.
- And what's that? What's that there?

458
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,030
- Yeah. That makes grilled cheese.
- Grilled cheese. Take five for it?

459
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,890
- Makes waffles, too.
- Anything.

460
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,710
- Five?
- Five bucks.

461
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,890
Thanks.
Alright.

462
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,330
- Thanks guys.
- Thanks Ralphie.

463
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,010
Next.

464
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,650
Next.

465
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,860
<i>Next.</i>

466
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,200
You really think they got
something for us?

467
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,470
Yeah. Mike, come on.
Stay positive. Alright?

468
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,960
Look, we're... We are smart,
We're good-looking...

469
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,080
We'll find a new job.
No problem.

470
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,640
I don't know. Who's gonna...
Who's gonna hire an ex-Easter bunny

471
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,050
with a bum knee, and
no computer skills, Hank?

472
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,120
- You need computer skills.
- Next.

473
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,520
- I've got a complaint.
- What's your complaint?

474
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,830
I hate my life.

475
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,240
Yeah, well...
Get in line.

476
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,520
I am in line.

477
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,260
<i>Number 722.
Number 722.</i>

478
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,230
That's me.
Wish me luck.

479
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,010
Wait. Wait.
Hold up.

480
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,710
I thought, we talked about this...
We were gonna go in together...

481
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,510
Yeah, but look. That's not how it works.
You'll be fine.

482
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,080
- Name?
- Hank.

483
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,590
Former occupation?

484
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,110
I defused landmines.

485
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,910
Chew-chew.

486
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,610
I'm good.

487
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,400
Oooh.

488
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,780
I would...
Love a Chew-Chew.

489
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,500
- Fat.
- Hank!

490
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,870
What was the reason
for your termination?

491
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,300
We got fucked in the ass.

492
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,850
Oh.

493
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,350
Your files say:
Downsizing.

494
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,530
Yeah.
It's a synonymn.

495
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,390
Lady, our asses are broke. OK?
So, we just really need a job.

496
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,760
But it's... It's got to be together.
Because...

497
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,270
- We work better as a team.
- Like Tonto and Lone Ranger.

498
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,250
Do you have any special skills?

499
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,000
I make marshmallows really well.
On the fire. Campfire.

500
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,920
It's not a skill, though.
I'm a semi-professional break dancer.

501
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,460
I've got my own cardboard.

502
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,980
- So, that's lots of skills.
- Yeah.

503
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,330
- You've got plenty to put in your files.
- And delivery.

504
00:39:57,385 --> 00:40:02,580
Well now you...
That is so much more than just delivery.

505
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,840
We provide wonder and magic...
to children.

506
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,620
- But we deliver it. So, it's still delivery.
- We deliver wonder.

507
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,470
And the way we do that is umm...
We're a conduit for joy.

508
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,040
Computer skills?

509
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,930
I can do some Excel spreadsheet.

510
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,230
- There's got to be something...
- No. But not just anything. Alright?

511
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,820
Look: No buying, no selling,
no math, no heavy lifting.

512
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,330
No skinning rabbits, no shit,
no talking to people.

513
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,410
- No...
- No, no, no.

514
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,140
...and no shit.

515
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,860
I... had a powerful jet of excrements
scratch my cornea.

516
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,070
Sorry.

517
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,320
Kids.
Kids!

518
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,130
Look.
We got a special visitor today.

519
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,980
It's Easter bunny!

520
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,530
Yay.

521
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,070
Wow.

522
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,650
Some reason, this guy has
made it personal. Like it's my fault,

523
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,980
that his sister likes to sleep in the nude
and I have a polaroid camera.

524
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,260
Hey, it's not like there was a
trespassing sign. But the next year,

525
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,560
- the dip shit lays out a bear trap, OK?
- Oopsie! No, no, we don't...

526
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,700
No, this is a good one.
This is a good one.

527
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,260
A bear trap.
You believe the balls on this guy, huh?

528
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,690
Alright.
Who knows what a bear trap is?

529
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,880
Yeah.
It's these big giant metal teeth.

530
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,170
They lay them down on the ground
and cover 'em with leafs.

531
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,350
And it's just waiting there for you.
You know what I mean?

532
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,260
You're walking, doing your job,
trying to making an honest living.

533
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,230
And these things are just there.
You step over them and CRUSH!

534
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,380
Take off your leg.

535
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,740
- Did you get away?
- Shit yeah.

536
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,370
Listen. I've got full medical,
but there is no way...

537
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,460
That I'm letting some sister fucking
good ol' boy make an amputee out of me.

538
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,290
No fucking way.

539
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,710
So I went over to his
house the next year.

540
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,020
- And I took a giant bamboo...
- Yay. Lunchtime everybody!

541
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,830
- So let's thank Hank.
- That's a true story, by the way.

542
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,460
- Yeah.
- Know what I mean? Hey!

543
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,580
No. No. No.

544
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,580
Someone farted.

545
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,030
Come on.
OK, kids.

546
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,980
You're gonna love today's lunch.

547
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,590
We got chocolate burgers,
chocolate dogs,

548
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,850
chocolate tacos with
chocolate sauce.

549
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,830
Fajita con chocolate.
And for dessert...

550
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,210
Chocolate!

551
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,710
Chocolate pasta?
Nice.

552
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,010
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, lunchlady.

553
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,510
Hey, this job ain't so bad.
I was talking to these kids in class.

554
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,190
And now...
What the..?

555
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,490
Oh, it's on motherfuckers.

556
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,130
This time it's chocolate.
Should've seen the other guy.

557
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,620
You ever see "Apocalypse Now?"

558
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,400
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

559
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,310
Yeah.

560
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,270
You ever see
"The making of Apocalypse Now?"

561
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,690
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

562
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,070
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

563
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,030
Yeah.

564
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,250
Good.

565
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,300
So, we understand eachother.

566
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,510
Every Easter you give away
billions of chocolate eggs.

567
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,180
Your company doesn't benefit
from this at all.

568
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,600
In fact all you're doing is getting
kids hooked on chocolate.

569
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,150
Who then pay somebody else good money
to acquire more said chocolate.

570
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,750
You can't justify this expense.

571
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,360
I have come up with a sure-fire way

572
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,710
to not only cut costs,
but also turn a phenominal profit.

573
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,070
These fourteen times less expensive
than traditional chocolate eggs

574
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,520
have an infinite shelf life
and are lighter.

575
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,640
And here is the best part:

576
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,760
We advertise on the surface
of the egg.

577
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,970
Think about it. We deliver to
every household in the world.

578
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,970
Companies will be lining up,
stepping over eachother

579
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:50,160
to pay through the tooth for us to
advertise their product on our eggs.

580
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,430
- Hubriss...
- In the first year alone, your profits...

581
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,110
- Hubriss...
- Yes?

582
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,880
I can't go with you looking.

583
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:04,440
In the first year alone,
your profits will raise 3.421 procent.

584
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,590
It's all in my report
that I'll be delivering

585
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,930
to the Board of Trustees,
at next month's meeting.

586
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,910
This company has been
around a long time.

587
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,970
Wonder.

588
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,990
Magic.

589
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,400
A child smiling from ear to ear.

590
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:25,300
These were once the
life-blood of this company.

591
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,960
Now when I see what
I've allowed to happen.

592
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,820
It disgusts me.
You disgust me.

593
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,700
Do you even know
what magic is, Conrad?

594
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,700
This company will do exactly
as my report suggests.

595
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,220
Well.

596
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,680
Last time I checked, Sparky,
I still ran this company.

597
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:58,670
Not when the board votes with me.
Sparky.

598
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,560
It won't pass, dude.
That's... That's...

599
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,040
- That's just too much.
- Stop being fat. I'll stop smoking.

600
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,210
- And there's the cherry.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,300
That's just great.

602
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,620
That's great.

603
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,060
Now, we're gonna be homeless.
Great.

604
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,070
<i>We're gonna travel the country
in boxcars</i>

605
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,440
<i>and get into just...
splendid adventures.</i>

606
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,140
<i>Oh.
It's my dream come true.</i>

607
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:33,180
<i>Now we... we got to get
a lovable mutt named Scruffy</i>

608
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,390
<i>And, and... We got to learn
to play the harmonica.</i>

609
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,400
<i>And eat lots
and lots of baked beans!</i>

610
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,630
<i>Hey.</i>

611
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,770
<i>Good night.</i>

612
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,960
Shut up.
Shut up.

613
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,700
You motherfucking, cock sucking,
backstabbing asshole!

614
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,100
- Mike, listen.
- I want my egg back.

615
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,870
I don't care what you did with it
or what you have to do to get it back.

616
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,740
I want my egg back.

617
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,340
- Mike, Mike.
- Please, get my egg back.

618
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,460
What for, man? It's just a reminder of
how they fucked you.

619
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,570
No they didn't fuck me.
You fucked me!

620
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,860
Mike... I know you are upset, man.
They fired you for no reason.

621
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,410
No, they didn't fire me
because of no reason.

622
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,480
They fired me...

623
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,290
'Cause of what, huh?
Because of me?

624
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,700
Huh?

625
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,600
Come on.
Come on. Say it.

626
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,210
Come on. Say it.
Come on. Say it, fuckface. Huh?

627
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,940
What you wanna do?
What you wanna do, huh? Come on.

628
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,610
You wanna hit me?
Yeah?

629
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,890
Yeah.
You wanna punch me?

630
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,910
Come on.
Come on. Punch me.

631
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,320
Come on, Mike.
Punch me. Huh?

632
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,370
Come on, huh!
Punch me, huh!

633
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,270
You like that?
Feel good. Oh yeah.

634
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,280
It feels good to stand up
for yourself, doesn't it?

635
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,710
If anything...

636
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,000
I did you a fucking favor.

637
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,610
A favor?

638
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,850
Your little favor cost me
the only thing I had.

639
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,540
The only thing I had. In my miserable
fucking, goddamn, fucking life!

640
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,780
It's my fault your life is miserable?

641
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,230
If it wasn't for me, your life would
be shit. You would fucking sit in there

642
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,390
and stuff your fat face
'till you fucking blew up.

643
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,880
Listen man, I give that company
as many years as you did.

644
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,400
The difference is, when I get shat on:

645
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,500
I don't put on a raincoat
and say "thank you".

646
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,240
Are you Easter bunny?

647
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,770
No.

648
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,730
You want some soup.

649
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,220
Who are you?

650
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,650
We're Team Jesus.

651
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,800
Here you go.
Nice warm soup.

652
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,820
It's gonna feel really good, going down.
The merciful burning light of Jesus.

653
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,170
<i>- Praise Jesus.
- Praise Jesus.</i>

654
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,890
Don't worry.
We're just here to help.

655
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,900
Little warm soup.
Nice blanket.

656
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,950
And the merciful burning light
of our Lord and savior.

657
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,390
<i>- Praise Lord Jesus.
- Praise Lord Jesus.</i>

658
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,450
No, no...
Fear not Pagan.

659
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,510
Cause your soul...
Can still be cleansed.

660
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,880
You gotta let me in.
You gotta let me in.

661
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,820
Just let go...

662
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,840
Just...
Gotta let me in.

663
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,580
Wait.

664
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,060
You'll..
You'll burn in hell, infidel.

665
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,520
You'll burn in hell.

666
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,940
Get back in the van.

667
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,550
I pushed too hard, too fast.

668
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,810
There's your fucking chocolate.

669
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,340
What's up?

670
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,890
Mike?

671
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,810
Hey, Lena.

672
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,750
- How you doing?
- Oh, good. Good.

673
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,640
Just... stretching it out.

674
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,870
I haven't seen you since the party.
What have you been up to?

675
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,800
Oh. You know.
Stuff. Yeah.

676
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,750
On the burner.
Yeah.

677
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,960
Freelance, portfolios,
expanding, assist, you know.

678
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,620
- The usual.
- Yeah.

679
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,950
Mike, let's have a coffee.

680
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,210
- You can lay eggs?
- Me? No.

681
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,300
No.

682
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,420
- What about you?
- What about me?

683
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,510
I don't know.
Tell me something I don't know.

684
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,940
- Like what?
- Anything.

685
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,530
Well, Easter always reminds me
of my grandmother.

686
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:45,630
And she was Ukrainian. She would always
paint these amazingly beautiful eggs.

687
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,140
They're called pysankies.

688
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,540
- Yeah. I know.
- Oh yeah. Of course.

689
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,200
And every year when we went over
to her house for Easter dinner...

690
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,200
She would hide one of them for me.

691
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,420
And I never saw her do it.
You know, she was old.

692
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,930
- She moved really slowly,
- It's tricky.

693
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,260
but I never saw her do it!

694
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,010
But at the end of the night,
when we're getting ready to leave.

695
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,140
I'd put on my coat, put my hand
into my pocket and there it was.

696
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,840
This, gorgeous gift.

697
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:15,030
She would always tell me that
the Easter bunny had put it there.

698
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,940
Looked forward to getting
that egg every year.

699
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,020
Just made me happy, you know.

700
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,160
She died six days before Easter.

701
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,940
On Easter morning,
when I put my hand into my pocket...

702
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,510
I half expected my fingers
to find it there.

703
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,080
Isn't that silly?

704
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,740
No.

705
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,270
No.
It's not silly at all.

706
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,510
It's really sweet.

707
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,990
- You're sweet.
- Thank you.

708
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,630
<i>This is one extremely cold spring</i>

709
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,070
<i>and it looks it will stay that way
at least until the weekend.</i>

710
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,400
<i>We have two low pressure systems
converging over the city,</i>

711
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:01,030
<i>that result in high winds overnight
and possibly snowballs tomorrow</i>

712
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,460
<i>Thursday, the risk of freezing rain and
Friday overcast and cold...</i>

713
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,760
<i>So, hope you're enjoying the clear
weather and sun...</i>

714
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,840
- Oh.
- Hey, Hank. Got any aspirine?

715
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,890
- What the fuck happened to you?
- I tried it.

716
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,920
Tried what?

717
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,870
Sponsored Suicide.

718
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,570
- Why the fuck would you do that?
- 'Cause I'm a loser.

719
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,510
I got fired from my job and
gambled away our life savings.

720
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,600
My wife left me.

721
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,990
I offered Mike ten bucks to eat
out of his asshole.

722
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,200
Yeah, that was weird.

723
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,000
- Well, looks like you're still breathing.
- That's the problem. I screwed up.

724
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,530
How can you screw killing yourself?

725
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,880
Sometimes,
you just don't die.

726
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,030
I'm gonna ask for another chance,
you know. I'm gonna beg.

727
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,870
Beg 'm for another chance 'cause
I know I can do this, you know.

728
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,030
Why?

729
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,790
Sometimes you just get in the way.

730
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,460
I'm just tired of being in the way.

731
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,570
Just wanna get out of the way.

732
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,380
I've learned the most important thing
in life is to love someone.

733
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,770
God, I hated her.

734
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,670
Once she left, I realised
I didn't hate her.

735
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,870
I hate me.

736
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,510
I hate me, Hank.

737
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,050
I hate me so much.

738
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,570
I hate you too, Leon.

739
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,150
Thanks, Hank.

740
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,400
Hold on.

741
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,350
This was fun, Mike.

742
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,380
I really had a good time.

743
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,930
Is everything ok?

744
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,850
I'm secretly in love with you.

745
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:21,150
No, I've been secretly in love with you
since the first time I saw you and...

746
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,610
I wanted to tell you
so many times, but...

747
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,680
But I was a coward.

748
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,990
Even came by here a few times, but...

749
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,090
Never mustered up the courage
to actually tell you so.

750
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:40,520
I've been watching you. Outside
your window for a long time now.

751
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,460
Yeah. You walked across
your bedroom to your bed

752
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,970
and take out your change
and receipts from your pockets.

753
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,690
And you put them in the little blue
ashtray on your night table.

754
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,870
God knows why you have an ashtray.
You don't even smoke.

755
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,920
You take your clothes off.

756
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,100
And I wanna look away.

757
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,800
But I can't.

758
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,430
You were so beautiful.

759
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:24,080
And I watch you.
Till you fall asleep.

760
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,530
I wonder what it would feel like
to be lying there next to you.

761
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,410
Hey, Mikey.
How you doing?

762
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,320
Whiskey.
Leave the bottle.

763
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,030
Oh Mikey. Come on, man.
It's been three years.

764
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,560
How about I get you a nice steak
and a face dance?

765
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,100
I need to get so drunk
I forget I exist.

766
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,460
Jesus Christ, Mikey!
It can't be that bad, can it?

767
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,720
Just bring the bottle.

768
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:31,510
Oh yeah, OK. Fuck, I'll bring you
the fucking bottle. Alright.

769
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,600
Here.
Here's the fucking bottle.

770
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,960
Love.

771
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,800
I fell in love once.

772
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:01,130
And give up everything for it.
My desire

773
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,830
my ambition to make
a mark on this world.

774
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:10,440
- I don't deserve to be loved.
- That's the problem right there.

775
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,850
It feels like the world
owes 'em something.

776
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,970
Can't count on anything, anymore.

777
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,890
Not your job,
not your friends, not...

778
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,580
You know at the end of the day,
The only thing you can come home to...

779
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,390
The only thing you can snuggle up

780
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,330
in bed with at night is the bottom line.

781
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,850
- To bottom line.
- Guys, please...

782
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,690
For fuck's sake.
Steak and face.

783
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,980
<i>Love,
it's like a hurricane,</i>

784
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,020
<i>it happens in Florida</i>

785
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,400
<i>it gets into everything.</i>

786
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:20,790
<i>Love,
it's a like a marmoset,</i>

787
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,000
<i>it may be small and cute,</i>

788
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,820
<i>but sometimes it eats its young.</i>

789
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:35,570
<i>Love,
it's like a trailer park,</i>

790
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,490
<i>ugly but functional,</i>

791
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,320
<i>the rent is cheap enough.</i>

792
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:50,920
<i>Love,
it's like an interstate,</i>

793
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,900
<i>gets you from place to place,</i>

794
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,320
<i>but it's littered with dead racoons.</i>

795
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,560
<i>But love,
love's like a garbage man,</i>

796
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:09,020
<i>it collects wasted filth</i>

797
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,810
<i>and it smells like rotten flesh.</i>

798
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:20,930
<i>Love,
it's like hurricane,</i>

799
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:24,490
<i>it happens in Florida,</i>

800
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:30,580
<i>and destroys everything.</i>

801
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,390
<i>It destroys everything.</i>

802
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:48,750
<i>Yes, it's love,
love, sweet love,</i>

803
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:56,900
<i>sweet, sweet love.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

804
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:02,000
<i>Yeah.
Love.</i>

805
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,390
He's here again.

806
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:29,560
Oh.
He's waking up.

807
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,240
Fuck!

808
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,120
When I look in your face,
I know by seeing in your face,

809
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:26,000
That you look at me and you know,
you know, you know you can't...

810
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:30,800
Tell me, I should not've gone fired
from this company.

811
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:34,990
Huh? Can you?
Don't give me that face.

812
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:38,130
You look at me in the face
with my face you tell em to...

813
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,310
Alright. That's enough.
That is enough.

814
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,310
It's one thing for you to act
retarted for our amusement.

815
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,270
- Oh.
- Stop.

816
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:52,190
But it's another thing, when you come in
here and you make a disgrace of yourself.

817
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,620
This is your golden egg winner, folks.

818
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,300
You're an embarrassment to me.
You're an embarrassment to Liam.

819
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,380
And you are an embarrassment
to this company.

820
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,810
What..?
Oh shit.

821
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,870
- What'd you do that for?
- Oh fuck.

822
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,200
- Hey Gimp.
- What?!

823
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,750
- Oh.
- Oh.

824
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,510
Hey.
Hey! Oh!

825
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,080
<i>You have one pencil...
That's my coffee, rabbit!</i>

826
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:48,430
<i>You have one pencil.
Everyone's missing a pencil?</i>

827
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:49,380
<i>Oh.
And it's a mid-court reception.</i>

828
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,650
How you doing?

829
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,250
Good.

830
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,840
<i>Let's check it back on the
instant replay. And it's out.</i>

831
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,400
Really good.

832
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,500
You?

833
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,310
I'm alright.

834
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:15,900
<i>...and here comes Chen, mid-court</i>

835
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,560
<i>Walking down the alley. Confident, confident,
haven't seen him like this in a while.</i>

836
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,610
<i>Chen is not in the game today.</i>

837
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,285
<i>There we have it. We're gonna
take a short break right now.</i>

838
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:55,490
<i>and come back with the
exciting second half.</i>

839
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,720
<i>...at 7:04 am, we were issued
a press release stating:</i>

840
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,510
<i>It's business as usual
in Easter Enterprises.</i>

841
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,440
<i>But with the monthly meeting of the
Board of Trustees, tomorrow morning,</i>

842
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,860
<i>rumours the speculation
of future layoffs</i>

843
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,140
<i>have many wondering how this will effect
their Easter celebrations.</i>

844
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,930
Hey.
Where you going?

845
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,200
I just got a crazy idea
how to get our jobs back.

846
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,860
You coming?

847
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,730
Easy Breezy.

848
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,260
Booyaaa.

849
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,670
- Good morning.
- Hello.

850
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,540
- Good morning.
- Hey.

851
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,270
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

852
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,670
How are ya?

853
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,830
- Ladies...
- Good morning.

854
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
So...

855
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,720
OK.

856
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,300
Let's just get this train wreck started.

857
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,220
Thank you.

858
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,060
Money.

859
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,760
Profit.

860
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,530
And Cha-Ching
to everyone here.

861
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,520
Rich,

862
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,800
Double,

863
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,300
Triple,

864
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,020
For your children.

865
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:42,010
For your children's Cha-Ching
Grandchildren.

866
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,240
Tax free.
fat cats,

867
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:48,790
Big Cahunas,
head honchos,

868
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,420
High-rollers and
rodeo drive legacy-be-damned.

869
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:58,880
Are all but early Cha-Ching retirement
and executive washroom.

870
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,430
Cha-Ching!

871
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,090
Fortune.

872
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,580
Big shots.

873
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:09,120
Do you wasted sidelines
microwave dinner?

874
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,660
Huh?
Do you?

875
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,680
- No, sir.
- Not anymore.

876
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,350
Not anymore now.

877
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:21,650
Now is aggressive for money.

878
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,460
- Yeah.
- and Cha-Ching.

879
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,910
- Cha-Ching.
- Cha-Ching.

880
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,300
- Cha-Ching.
- Cha-Ching.

881
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,700
- Cha-Ching.
- Cha-Ching.

882
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,880
- Cha-Ching, Cha-Ching.
- Cha-Ching.

883
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,520
- Cha-Ching!
- Cha-Ching!

884
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:37,000
- To everyone, the bottom line.
- Yeah. The bottom line.

885
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,590
Yeah.
The bottom line.

886
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,680
- Alright.
- Alright.

887
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,800
Mike?

888
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,150
Excuse me.

889
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,800
You are retarded.

890
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:52,010
- Is there a..?
- Mike?

891
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,590
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey.

892
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,690
- Hey.
- Hey. No, no.

893
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,100
- Those are new suits, aren't they?
- Yeah.

894
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,610
They look good.

895
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,280
You look good.

896
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,480
They do.
I... See ya.

897
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,590
Hey, no.
Hey. No, no, no.

898
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,430
There is a meeting in there.

899
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,980
Hey, gentleman.
You can not go in there.

900
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,010
That's right.

901
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,830
Good morning.

902
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,060
So this is where
the real magic happens, huh?

903
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,610
Oh my god.

904
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,380
Don't shoot.

905
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,790
We don't have a gun.
Where would we have a gun?

906
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,820
- Shoot me in the head so I don't suffer.
- Are you retarded?

907
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:53,340
We're not gonna shoot you.
We're not postal workers.

908
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,100
Who are you?

909
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,510
- I'm a fucking Easter bunny.
- Yeah. Me too.

910
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,140
I'm a fucking Easter bunny too.

911
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,060
- You can't come in here...
- Oh, shut up!

912
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,720
Thank you.
We're here to get our jobs back.

913
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:09,190
We're in the middle of a
very important meeting here.

914
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:13,610
Would you please air your grievances
to your union rep or... whomever?

915
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:16,770
Who the fuck are you?
I will shit in your mouth.

916
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,570
How typical...
How typical...

917
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,550
No one is accountable for their actions.
Listen bunnies...

918
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:28,530
You weren't let go out of malice, ok?
You were downsized for the bottom line.

919
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,540
- Oh, the bottom line?
- Yes.

920
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,790
- Alright. Fine. Bottom line.
- Whip it out.

921
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:37,030
Burt "Sweet cheaks" Wachowski.
You've got four grandchildren, right?

922
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,370
Michael, Sara, Victoria and Matt?

923
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,020
They look forward to Easter every year.

924
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:46,900
Just like you look forward, to no one
finding out about the 4.7 million dollars

925
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:49,010
you embezzled from this company.

926
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:51,780
- No, no. Why?
- Right here.

927
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,570
Didn't have to be like this.

928
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:56,160
Jill O'Brady, 531 Grands Road.

929
01:17:56,210 --> 01:18:00,100
Husband Simon, two kids.
Philip and Tim.

930
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,670
Although Philip's real dad...
Uncle Steve.

931
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:05,850
Ooh.
Shame on you.

932
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:07,900
Mr. Jenkins.

933
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,670
Mr. Jenkins, 212 Belgravia street,
1204, right?

934
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

935
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,320
When you were a kid,
you could not wait for Easter.

936
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,940
You would sleep on the coach
the night before,

937
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:21,010
just waiting to get a glimpse
of that magical Easter bunny, mmm?

938
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,990
That was many years before you killed your
twin brother and assumed his identity.

939
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,210
Booyaaa.
Nice.

940
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:31,090
You should've just... shot me.

941
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,100
- Want some more?
- We can go on.

942
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,470
I found a giant black dildo.
I'm not gonna say who's it is.

943
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,520
Giant black dildo.

944
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:45,030
It's funny the things you can learn
about people hiding eggs in their homes.

945
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,160
You think you know anything
about the bottom line?

946
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,950
You've got no idea
how to play this game, amateurs.

947
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,960
For every bit of dirt you can pull up.
I can unearth a mountain.

948
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,420
This new corporate policy
will go through.

949
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,580
Oh yes.
It will go through and then...

950
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:08,660
You will feel the full brunt
of my bottom line.

951
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:15,220
What are you gonna do?
You have no power here.

952
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,800
What are you gonna do?

953
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,370
Bring it.

954
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,230
<i>...and we are back with Mr. Pan,</i>

955
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:28,270
<i>one of the most magnanimous and
mysterious business tycoons...</i>

956
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,370
<i>Oh.
I'm no tycoon, sir.</i>

957
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,270
<i>Let's agree to disagree
on that one.</i>

958
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,510
<i>Downsizing.
Speculation of health problems.</i>

959
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,500
<i>Not to mention pressure on the Senate,
to ban Sponsored Suicide.</i>

960
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,700
<i>The age of hubriss
has come to an end.</i>

961
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,710
<i>- It's been an eventful year.
- It's been colorful, Charlie.</i>

962
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,320
<i>Pretty damn colorful.</i>

963
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,040
<i>You know,
business is a lot like life.</i>

964
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,130
<i>And life is a lot like the weather.</i>

965
01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:00,650
<i>When it's warm and sunny.
It's easy to smile.</i>

966
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,760
<i>But sometimes...
It's not so simple.</i>

967
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,970
<i>Sometimes you look out the window
and don't see the sun.</i>

968
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,110
<i>You give up hope.</i>

969
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:16,900
<i>Sometimes the cold gets so bad,
you lose a toe.</i>

970
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:23,050
<i>Maybe, that little Piggy that
went to market never comes home.</i>

971
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,700
<i>You say...
What's the point?</i>

972
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,980
<i>I'm not going out there.</i>

973
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,970
Lucy?

974
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:46,750
<i>But funny thing... the sun.
It's always there.</i>

975
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,530
<i>Yeah.</i>

976
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:53,610
<i>That beautiful ball of fire
is always there.</i>

977
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,700
<i>But sometimes,</i>

978
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,100
<i>sometimes,</i>

979
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:04,750
<i>it's waiting for you
to come out.</i>

980
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,690
I'm hungry.

981
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,380
You know what I could go for?

982
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,270
- Steak 'n' face.
- Steak 'n' face!
