1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm surprised you'd
show your face around here

2
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:10,835
after what you did to me last night.

3
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:13,605
What the hell are you talking about?

4
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:14,973
Oh, right. Sheldon.

5
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,541
I thought you were someone else.

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,709
Sheldon.

7
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,978
What are you doing here? Are you lost?

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,746
Do I need a reason

9
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,682
to drop by my favourite little tea shop?

10
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:27,017
I just came in

11
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,853
to take in all this... Great stuff.

12
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,856
And do I hear gongs?

13
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,524
They're Tibetan Peace Bells.

14
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:35,758
Even better!

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,461
I love the tibetans. Snappy dressers.

16
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:39,596
And you know what?

17
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:40,896
Why don't you give me a hit

18
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:43,899
of whatever you got brewing right in there?

19
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:47,870
And, man, those bells just
keep on ringing, don't they?

20
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:50,672
This is from our premier line.

21
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,107
It's made from durian fruit.

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,008
Mm.

23
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,847
Yummy.

24
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,015
Really?

25
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:03,285
Look, I, uh... I've gotta tell ya, Kim,

26
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:05,687
this is really quite the place.

27
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,055
But you know what'd make it perfect?

28
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:09,990
A brand-new display case.

29
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,425
You know, somethin'

30
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:12,860
seven feet long,

31
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:14,595
four feet wide,

32
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,564
beautiful satin interior,

33
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,699
worm proof finish.

34
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:21,636
I'm not buying one of your big-and-tall
caskets, Sheldon.

35
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,236
Come on! I can give you a fantastic deal.

36
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,104
It's a return.

37
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,073
A returned casket?

38
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:29,075
Look, relax. It's not what you think.

39
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:31,511
The guy was only in it, what, 10 minutes?

40
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,147
The tags are still on it!

41
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,915
Pass.

42
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,184
Oh, for cr...

43
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:41,086
if you come in here
again, I'm gonna call the cops.

44
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,121
No, I'm Sheldon.

00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:46,024

I'll just wait outside.

his ex-wife has a Wikipedia page,

Surgeon, Mountain-Climber, philanthropist.

No wonder you're still hung up on her.

I'm not saying she's not amazing.

Hi, guys.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who died?

74
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,726
And was he fat?

75

And does he need a casket?

No, I was just handed this.

My new court-appointed case.

00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,735
I'm supposed to defend Wayne Hilicky.

79
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,670
He's been charged with armed robbery.

80

Who's Wayne Hilicky?

81

That's some kid Danny grew up with.

82
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,041
There was a little problem with bullying.

Oh, wow!

00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,711

My bro didn't take any beat-downs.

doing the pounding! Huh?

You're serious?

93
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,695
Danny was a bully?

94
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,298
Well, he wasn't a bully, all right?

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,932
It was an isolated incident.

96
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,734
He beat Wayne up once.

97
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,135

98
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,937

You don't think Danny
could be a good bully?

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,780
Danny was a great bully!

104

I was going through a rough time.

107

After our parents died,

108

Danny was angry at the entire world.

109
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,757
But since you can't punch the entire world,

110
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,826
he punched Wayne.

111
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:10,860
Look, the whole Hilicky thing

112
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:13,863

I used to push down into the
ravine behind the school.

116

Took me eight hours to climb out.

00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,776
I threw you a rope.

118
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:30,912
You attached it to a squirrel.

Danny you're looking at
this all wrong, okay?

123

This is an opportunity to make amends.

00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,087
Huh? For closure.

125
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,789
Or at the very least,

126
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,024
take another whack at him.

127
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,160
Look, all I'm saying

128
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,962
is that by helping Wayne
overcome his troubles,

129
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:49,930
you could overcome your own.

but you never came back
to school the next year.

172
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,461
it was from a blow to the head.

173
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:35,195
Like when I punched you?

174
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,932
What? No! Of course not.

175
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:40,935
It's from where my head hit the pavement.

176
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,369
After you punched me.

But it all worked out.

180

After an agonizing year of recovery,

181
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,611
I went back to school,
got myself a great job,

182
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:53,279

Huh. I never thought of that.

But then I married the girl of my dreams.

I feel like I
shouldn't get my hopes up here.

She left me.

I think it was because of

00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:38,275
Don't ask.

338
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:40,244
I want that thing out of here.

339
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,945
You know what? You're right.

340
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,280
I agree with you.

341
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,615
But let me ask you something.

342
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,284
Do you have kids?

343
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,219
Yeah.

344
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:51,287
Okay, check it out.

345
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,423
You get rid of the ice,

346
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:54,524
you dump your rugrats in here,

347
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,359
and is this or is this not

348
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,561
the best little playpen you've
ever seen in your life?

349
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:00,695
But wait! There's more!

350
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,030
[Laughter]

351
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,500
For an extra $800,

352
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,169
I'm gonna febreeze it!

353
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:09,204

How's he doing?

356
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,448
Amazing.

357
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,416
He made two eye-witnesses cry.

358
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,485
And he got the security tapes thrown out

359
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,220
because they were black and white,

360
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,522
which he somehow convinced them was racist.

361
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,090
[Audience laughing]

362
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,724
That's our boy.

363
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,960
[Bellows]: Give 'em hell, Danny!

364
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,066
[Quieter]: Go get them, kiddo.

365
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,805
Your honour.

366
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,240
We've heard a lot of "Proof" today

367
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,310
about what Wayne Hilicky was going to do

368
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:53,678
that crisp September evening.

369
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,081
But the truth is,

370
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,550
we'll never know what he was going to do,

371
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:01,253
because before he actually did anything,

372
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,154
he was pushed to the ground

373
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,657
by a violent thug of a cashier.

374
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,026
[Laughter]

375
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:11,129
Everyone just assumed,

376
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,597
because of his grubby appearance,

377
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:16,134
that he was there to commit a crime.

378
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,602
To them, I say this...

379
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:20,570
"You're funny, says your wife."

380
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:24,174
"Your monkey plays the fife."

381
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:27,676
"Your money or your life."

382
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:30,513
They all sound very similar, don't they?

383
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,717
The world has never
smiled on Wayne Hilicky.

384
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,786
The world pushed him down,

385
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,222
and the world stole his lunch money.

386
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,590
The world pantsed him in
front of susie Doyle.

387
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:45,193
She never touched a man after that.

388
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:47,595
This isn't the first time

389
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:50,431
the world has pushed Wayne Hilicky around,

390
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,667
and I know, if you look hard enough,

391
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:56,103
you'll see Wayne Hilicky is good.

392
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,272
Wayne Hilicky

393
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,140
is decent.

394
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,142
Above all,

395
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:05,412
Wayne Hilicky

396
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,647
is...

397
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,649
[Thud]

398

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,191
Oh, yeah.

[Laughter]

402
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,472
Still.

403
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,358
One hell of a closing argument.

404
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,427
You know, if Wayne hadn't died,

405
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,228
you would've gotten all
those charges thrown out.

406
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,764
I ruined the man's life,

407
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,333
and now I can never make it up to him.

408
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,602
You did the best you could.

409
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,838
What more could Wayne have asked for?

410
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,039
Not to die?

411
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,541
Penniless and on trial?

412
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,009
Well, maybe if your closing statement

413
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,911
had just been a little shorter.

414
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:53,749
I thought it was beautiful, Danny.

415
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,819
You know what might help give you closure?

416
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:00,623
If you said a few words at his funeral.

417
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,359
Or throw him the nicest
funeral anyone's ever had!

418
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:08,630
Not to take advantage of
a tragic situation, but...

419
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,500
I can give you a sweet deal

420
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,267
on a pre-owned casket.

421
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,875
Danny, this is amazing.

422
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,843
You did a great job.

423
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,479
The room and the flowers.

424
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,381
And the mugshot?

425
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,984
I wanted to use the surveillance photo

426
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:31,084
from the convenience store,

427
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,853
but I couldn't Photoshop the gun out.

428
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,424
Oh. Wayne looks tiny.

429
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,793
What is all the stuff around him?

430
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,294
Oh, these? These are, uh,

431
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:43,663
packing peanuts.

432
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:44,931
Well, I don't want him

433
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,933
to roll around in here and get hurt.

434
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,735
And by the way,

435
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:51,703
I sold these to you at cost.

436
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:54,039
The humiliation never
ends for the guy, does it?

437
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,576
I still feel like I failed him.

438
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:58,544
I can't believe this is happening.

439

Alison totally deleted the
stuff I put on her Wikipedia page.

This is a funeral.

444

My first big funeral, and
you're bumming me out.

Get over here and take some pictures of me

in front of my casket.

So sad.

448
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:27,438
He was much too young.

he'd be very pleased.

I don't know.

452
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,747
He was allergic to flowers.

I'm Wayne's brother, Dwayne.

My brother and I weren't close.

He had a lot of issues.

It seemed to all start
for him in seventh grade.

thanks for paying for all this.

can do to make it up to you,

just, uh, just let me know.

I just got thanked for
ruining a man's life.

You know, I thought giving
Wayne the perfect funeral

471
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:26,827
would give me closure,

but if anything, I feel worse.

but so did you.

00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,950
I used to do it for free!

506
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:29,720
That was me.

507
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,921
I know this sounds odd, but please,

508
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:34,791
it would really mean a lot to me.

509
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:37,694
Well, I...I guess I could use the money,

510
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,495
if you're sure.

511
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,629
I am.

512
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

513
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,766
Danny, um...

514
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:44,734
You don't want to do this.

515
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,668
I really do.

516
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,069
Look, I deserve to get punched.

517
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,137
I've deserved it for a long time.

518
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,740
Yeah, I'm more worried about
what my therapist calls

519
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,108
the "Reflexive defense" response.

520
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,142
What's that?

521
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,512
[Smack]

522
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,446
[Thud]

523
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,819
Yeah, it's really difficult to take a punch

524
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,954
and not automatically defend yourself.

525
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,122
Huh! Cool.

526
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,057
We should probably go.

527
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,592
What have I done?

528
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,128
And we're walking, we're walking...

529
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,197
[Audience laughing]

530
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:20,834
Again, so sorry for your loss.

531
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,539
[♪]

532
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,975
Here. Let me look at that.

533
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,211
Yeah...

534
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,046
Looks like you're still an idiot.

535
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,749
I can't believe I hit another Hilicky.

536
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:38,817
Maybe it's just me,

537
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,186
but, you know, I
thought things went really well.

538
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:42,788
Not without a hitch,

539
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,490
but overall, a good day.

540
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:48,293
Hey, check this out.

541
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:50,828
Alison finally put me
on her Wikipedia page.

542
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,596
"From 2007 to 2012,

543
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,898
Alison was married

544
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,266
to an anal-retentive pain-in-the-ass
house-husband

545
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,401
named Ryan White."

546
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:01,305
About time I got a little respect!

547
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:03,174
