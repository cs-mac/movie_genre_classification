1
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,550
Fidencio!

2
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,055
Shut all the doors!

3
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,753
I'll be with this woman.

4
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:47,397
- Hail Mary.
- Conceived without sin.

5
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,555
How long since your last
confession, daughter?

6
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,622
Father Salvador, it's Esperanza,
the mother of the girl who died.

7
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,720
Except she's not dead, Father.

8
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,356
What?

9
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:04,264
SaintJude told me.
My saint of desperate causes.

10
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,924
IThappened righTafter The funeral.

11
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:25,836
Look Dominga, how come I'm always
the one who ends up fixing dinner?

12
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,960
Esperanza.

13
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:49,495
Whoever told you your daughter died
of this unknown disease, lied to you.

14
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,860
Thank God I'd run out
of Easy-Off, Father.

15
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,432
If I hadn't, where the hell
could my saint have appeared?

16
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,279
That oven is so grimy, it's embarrassing.

17
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:07,512
What should I do, Father?
Clean it or leave it as it is?

18
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:12,943
For now let's keep
this miracle a secret.

19
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:16,389
Leave the oven as it is.

20
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,761
This kind of filth is not a sin.

21
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,481
Do you have a filthy sin to confess?

22
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,294
Not really.

23
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,597
Except cursing at my friend Soledad.
But it's not fair, Father!

24
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:33,339
I work all day in the hardware store
and come home to a pile of ironing,

25
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,840
and she's camped
in front of her soap opera.

26
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:40,599
Well, when you're hooked on a soap,
you're hooked.

27
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,013
Like me with Tania's Promise.
Do you watch it?

28
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:47,671
No, Father. I don't watch soaps.

29
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:51,361
All right, then. Just try
to understand your friend Soledad.

30
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,644
And say five rosaries, just in case.

31
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,089
And not a word about our miracle...

32
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,595
to anyone!

33
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,361
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

34
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,023
Amen.

35
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:12,996
Hey, Father, can I tell Soledad?

36
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,980
- No!
- Just her, I promise.

37
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,714
Not even her.

38
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,402
- Father, don't be such a...
- What?

39
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,710
How can I keep it from her?

40
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:27,785
You know we've lived together
since our husbands died.

41
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:31,854
We're like sisters.
We raised Blanca together.

42
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:36,482
You need a lot of faith to believe
in miracles, and not everybody has it.

43
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:41,248
By the type of apparition, it's clear
your saint wants only you to see him.

44
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,618
Otherwise he'd appear
before everybody...

45
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:49,809
on the side of the bridge,
like SaintJohn did five years ago.

46
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,562
- Where were you?
- You scared me!

47
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:32,249
The Espinozas came to give you their
condolences. I didn't know what to say.

48
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:35,102
I went to see Father Salvador.

49
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:13,195
So much grief.

50
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,859
What are we going to do with it?

51
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:21,097
We've been crying for no reason.

52
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:25,556
What?

53
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,210
Blanca is not dead.

54
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,189
What are you saying?

55
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,739
SaintJude told me. In person.

56
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,341
For God's sake, Esperanza.

57
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,330
- You're all I have left.
- Yes.

58
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,920
Don't go crazy on me, please!

59
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:07,470
SaintJude, you know I'm not crazy.

60
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:12,310
I just want my Blanca back.

61
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,598
I wore This slip
aTmy fifteenTh birthday, darling.

62
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,102
I'd stitch it a bit shorter.

63
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,952
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

64
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,090
Don't tell me you filled this out, Mom.

65
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,866
One always finds a way.

66
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:46,031
You'll see...

67
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:48,876
when you're fifteen you'll fill it out.

68
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,951
I'm sure God will give you
the breasts of an angel.

69
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,918
- It's really shaping up.
- It is.

70
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,431
I'm going to try the mantilla on you.

71
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:05,650
SainTJude,
you've always been aTmy side.

72
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,321
Tell me where my daughter is.

73
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,977
If all this is a lie,

74
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,688
Then she wasn'Tin The hospiTal
when I wenT To pick her up.

75
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,002
Good afternoon.

76
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:49,066
Afternoon. What's up?

77
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,819
I came to pick up my daughter.
Is this where you pay?

78
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,810
What's the patient's name?

79
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,208
Blanca Diaz. I'm her mother.

80
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,426
Hi.

81
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,383
Blanca Diaz.

82
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:09,454
Blanca Diaz.

83
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,290
She had her tonsils out.

84
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,193
Mrs. Diaz, haven't you been notified?

85
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,165
No. What happened?

86
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:28,031
You'd better go find Dr. Ortiz.

87
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,566
Doctor! Excuse me.

88
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,790
I'm so glad I found you, Doctor.
How is Blanca?

89
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,377
We don't know what happened...

90
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,209
but your daughter passed away.

91
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,241
Blanca.

92
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,008
Easy.

93
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,594
I got the news when I came in.

94
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,064
They have her in the morgue.

95
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:10,981
Can I see her?

96
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:14,012
I'm afraid not, Esperanza.

97
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:18,428
She died of a virus we're not
familiar with. We can't let it spread.

98
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,421
She has to be buried immediately.

99
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:31,401
Sign here, please. Here.

100
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,100
And your initials here.

101
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,208
Thanks.

102
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,363
Let them out.

103
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:48,351
But I have to see her, please!

104
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:58,062
"Do not open. Danger of contagion."

105
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,177
Esperanza.

106
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:06,022
- I'm very sorry.
- Idiot!

107
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,008
Oh, dear!

108
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,464
SainTJude, are you lisTening?

109
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,328
You know I'll do
whatever you ask me to.

110
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,289
Are you listening?

111
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:02,472
Sorry I'm late, Father. It was my turn
to close the hardware store.

112
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:05,130
- Hello, Fidencio.
- How have you been, my child?

113
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:10,047
If I tell you SaintJude has reappeared,
can you keep it quiet?

114
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,725
Fidencio, leave us alone.

115
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:20,126
This time he appeared when I was
baking stuffed chicken breasts.

116
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:29,104
Esperanza, you must find your daughter.

117
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:30,984
Yes, SaintJude, but how?

118
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,581
Search for her.
Whatever it takes, find her.

119
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,609
Search for her!

120
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:45,045
I'm positive she's not there.

121
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,325
Impossible.

122
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,136
But Sir, it's my daughter!

123
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,988
I'm sorry, but I can't authorize
an exhumation,

124
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:53,639
even if God Almighty
orders it himself.

125
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,007
It was SaintJude.
Don't get confused! It's not the same.

126
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,232
All I ask is that you
open the casket...

127
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,265
to see if the body is there or not.
That's all.

128
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,903
Without orders
from the Forensic Service...

129
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,061
I can't exhume a little finger.

130
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:10,437
And don't lean on my desk,
can't you see the glass is broken!

131
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,539
I'll walk you to the door.
There's more people waiting.

132
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:17,918
If it was your daughter, you'd be
digging her grave with your fingernails!

133
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,009
What's wrong with you?

134
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:23,072
What do you want? A bribe?
Want to take your little bite?

135
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:26,201
Police!

136
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:32,247
I should have you arrested!
Crazy bitch!

137
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:36,492
Why do I need a permit,
with an order from above?

138
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,014
For God's sake, daughTer.!

139
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:48,878
I'm only following the orders
from my little saint.

140
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,046
What do you think, Father?

141
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:53,548
I think...

142
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:57,262
there's nothing more
to be done in a legal manner.

143
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,732
Just what I thought.

144
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:03,776
So I went to the doctor
for a forensic order.

145
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,415
Good morning.

146
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,696
Good morning, Mrs. Diaz.

147
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,718
I'm looking for Dr. Ortiz.

148
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:16,266
I'm afraid he doesn't work here anymore.

149
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,914
Dr. Ortiz? Are you sure?

150
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,698
Look...

151
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:25,409
they say he got sick
and they took him away.

152
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,408
Can some other doctor help you?

153
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:32,267
When did this happen?
Which day, precisely?

154
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:07,899
Father, can you believe he disappeared
the day after my girl died?

155
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,703
How do you explain that?

156
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:14,644
I don't know, a coincidence maybe...

157
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:17,330
or perhaps he caught the virus, or...

158
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:22,821
Or he took her! That's it!
The doctor kidnapped her!

159
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:26,716
SaintJude is right!
That's why he's a saint!

160
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,402
Careful, my child...

161
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,948
you have to know
how to read his messages.

162
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,945
It's very easy to misinterpret.

163
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,975
If you think the doctor kidnapped her,

164
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,047
be very careful in your search.

165
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:48,283
Every day I read stories like this
in the tabloids.

166
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,452
Oh, Father...

167
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:52,953
you mean the doctor
could have sold her into...

168
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:56,668
Don't even say it!
Don't even say it!

169
00:18:56,785 --> 00:19:00,913
Think about what you can do.

170
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,082
Then tell me when I get back.

171
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:06,175
I need to excuse myself for a moment.

172
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,335
Are you going to the bathroom?

173
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,492
Yes, my child.

174
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:20,577
Holy Soul,
I believe the words of SaintJude...

175
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,604
but who did I bury?

176
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,559
Saint Anthony,
most miraculous of all...

177
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:01,253
who can find a grain of sugar
in the desert...

178
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,932
help me find my Blanca.

179
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:25,077
Father, what a scare you gave me!

180
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:29,568
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
your prayer, but it's time to close up.

181
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,534
Yes, yes. I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time.

182
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:36,563
It's all right,
my soap doesn't start until eight.

183
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,724
But just in case,

184
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:41,675
say five rosaries before daybreak.

185
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,660
Yes, Father.

186
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:50,650
And stay out of trouble.

187
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:54,689
- Remember that I'm here.
- I promise, Father.

188
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:02,589
Lord, I just don't know
what to do with Esperanza.

189
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:06,480
She tells me what she's done,
but not what she's about to do.

190
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:11,764
If nobody can stop her,
you've got to watch over her, I beg you.

191
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:42,667
Go away!

192
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,323
Get out of here!

193
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:24,444
Beat it! You stinking, wet dogs!

194
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:33,463
Please, Saint Isidro, don't make it
harder on me! Take the rain away!

195
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:42,018
You won't find any bones here!

196
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,201
Who's out there!

197
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,443
See, I told you. A grave robber.

198
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,042
Fuck off, dogs, let us work!
You get up here!

199
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:30,176
Leave me alone, you idiots!

200
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:31,635
It's my daughter in here!

201
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,840
This ground is mine!
My property!

202
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:37,162
I paid in perpetuity!

203
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:55,679
Here are your Tools back, Don Arlindo.

204
00:23:55,785 --> 00:24:00,684
- I needed a hand last night...
- I don't know what's gotten into you!

205
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:04,235
I'm sorry, please don't get mad.
It makes you look ugly.

206
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:10,393
I've told you zillions of times
not to open the store at night!

207
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:16,307
And coming to work in this state!
You're a disgrace!

208
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,624
I don't know what's going on
with you, Esperanza...

209
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:24,824
and I hate to say this
after your tragedy...

210
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,546
but you can't work here anymore.

211
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:31,759
You haven't even finished the tax forms!

212
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:36,514
You're making a fool of yourself!

213
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,000
Thank God!
I've been looking for you everywhere!

214
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:43,549
- Soledad...
- Don't even talk to me!

215
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:53,496
This is the last straw!

216
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:58,260
You're even in the newspaper!
What's the matter with you?

217
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,111
I'm only following orders from my saint.

218
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,905
Esperanza, sit down.

219
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:18,549
Look, I know we're devastated
by what happened to Blanca...

220
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,823
and sometimes we imagine things.

221
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:28,051
But isn't your saint
too busy with his miracles...

222
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:31,704
to worry about us?

223
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:39,107
You spent the night out of the house!

224
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,917
You've never done this before.

225
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,603
I went to help Father Salvador
with his herb garden.

226
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,149
I'd rather you not say anything
than tell me lies.

227
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:52,603
Just look at yourself,
walking around like this in public!

228
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:58,902
For the sake of your dignity,
you can't do this to yourself!

229
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,726
Mama.

230
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:22,847
Mama.

231
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,845
You and I will always be TogeTher.

232
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:51,239
Saint Michael Archangel...

233
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:55,199
Divine Protector,
you must know that...

234
00:26:56,006 --> 00:27:00,240
Blanca is in danger
and needs your help.

235
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:03,795
I've always prayed to you
for the victims of the drug lords...

236
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:07,510
but now I pray for my own daughter.

237
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,023
With all my strength.

238
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,951
Father, you always startle me!

239
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,344
- Do you want to confess?
- Yes.

240
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:25,153
Fidencio!

241
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:28,283
Go tell Dona Carmelita...

242
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,881
not to make my cocoa yet.
It'll get scummy.

243
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,944
Be with you in a second, folks.

244
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:50,378
Get started with your penance:
Pray one rosary to begin with.

245
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:55,043
I haven't even seen you in Mass.

246
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:59,044
Father, it happened again!

247
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,811
My saint appeared for a third time...

248
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,359
to tell me my Blanca
was in a Pink House.

249
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:10,802
You know what he meant by that...

250
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,830
- don't you?
- Of course!

251
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,513
They must have her
in one of those dirty places...

252
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:19,015
one of those brothels that smell of sin,

253
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:22,943
pleasing men who come and go.

254
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:27,879
Men wiTh huge bellies
and lice in Their body hair.

255
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:33,002
Bricklayers wiTh repTile hands
ThaTdraw blood wiTh each caress.

256
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,416
Married bureaucraTs
cheaTing on Their innocenT wives.

257
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,816
Go ahead, my child.

258
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:48,274
Father.

259
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:53,591
Is it true they steal little girls
to sell to brothels?

260
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:58,878
Unfortunately, these types
never make it to my confessional box.

261
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:01,142
- But they do exist?
- Yes, my child.

262
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:06,813
They have her living in hell!

263
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:10,193
What should I do?

264
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:14,372
You can only search for the truth.

265
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,874
Come what may.

266
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:19,034
That's exactly what I thought...

267
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:22,923
so I got a job at 'La Curva'.

268
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:27,376
- Have you ever been there, Father?
- Esperanza!

269
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:32,840
It's that little blue hotel
with the red door, by the hairpin turn.

270
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,631
Excuse me.

271
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,871
Excuse me.

272
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:06,977
Excuse me.

273
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:14,415
I changed The sheeTs and washed
The baThrooms on The second floor.

274
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,455
I had To waiTfor couples To come ouT.

275
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,659
SomeTimes I cleaned one room
eighT Times in a day.!

276
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,344
I Told Soledad
I was working in a hoTel.

277
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:31,111
IT was half True, buTI didn't
wanTher To worry abouTme.

278
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,808
Catch me!

279
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,565
I've changed sheeTs sTained wiTh blood,

280
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:15,892
booze, urine.

281
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:20,656
Covers were so ripped
I had to throw them away.

282
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,168
But not a trace of Blanca.

283
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:26,016
I'd smell the sheets,
but never the scent of Blanca.

284
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:28,003
For God's sake, daughter!

285
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:33,883
I want to confess on her behalf.

286
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:39,033
Forgive her. She must not be able
to come close to a church.

287
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:43,969
You know that I can't absolve
through third party confessions.

288
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:48,043
Don't be a pain, Father.
What have you got to lose?

289
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll give her a temporary absolution...

290
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:55,208
until she can come in person.

291
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:59,633
So, do you know where she could be?

292
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:02,655
More or less.

293
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:04,911
I finally got a clue...

294
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,730
in 'La Curva;

295
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,477
Sure, they've got them young.

296
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,807
Really hot, too.

297
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:33,973
I don't believe you.

298
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:37,798
Thirteen, fourteen years old.

299
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:40,301
But you have to ask in advance.

300
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,876
They don't let just anybody have them.

301
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,597
How much?

302
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:51,357
Neither of us could afford it.
They come from all over.

303
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:54,391
Oaxaca, Veracruz...

304
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,553
Young girls.

305
00:32:56,657 --> 00:33:00,512
- How about from the north?
- From the north too.

306
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:02,675
They have to be virgins though.

307
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,529
They are precious.

308
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,148
A marvel.

309
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:18,707
Excuse me, where is the place
you're talking about?

310
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,647
Hey, it's a secret.

311
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,544
But if you want
I'll whisper it in your ear.

312
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:33,597
What? Afraid to do this in public?

313
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,628
- No.
- Come with me upstairs.

314
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:57,437
I'm not what you think I am.

315
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:01,148
Then what are you doing in this joint?
You come here to pray?

316
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:02,962
The truth is...

317
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,524
Catch me!

318
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:19,769
So, we didn't come here to pray?

319
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,575
Give me that!

320
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:28,541
Let's see, let's see.
What happened?

321
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,908
Come on out of there. Come on.

322
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,257
You're making me late. I have to go.

323
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,236
- And the secret?
- What secret?

324
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,927
The place you were talking about
downstairs. Is it the Pink House?

325
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:44,994
That's up in Tijuana.
Only gringos go there.

326
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,843
They happily pay big bucks...

327
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:49,829
to bang teenyboppers.

328
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:53,485
All the way to Tijuana?
How can I get up there?

329
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,645
Listen, why don't you stay here?

330
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:59,153
At least we like them
all grown up in this place.

331
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,481
Here, take it. It's on the house.

332
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,421
Besides, you're out of practice, honey.

333
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,886
Jumping on customers like that.

334
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,086
May the Archangel Raphael
safeguard our journey...

335
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:59,139
in mind, body and spirit.

336
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:08,074
May the Archangel Raphael
guide us through all danger.

337
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:10,926
That kid is not a kid. He's a midget.

338
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,298
What's your name?

339
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:25,372
Paloma.

340
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,843
- Travelling alone?
- Uh-huh.

341
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:33,892
Where do you live?

342
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:40,498
In Monterrey, in Guadalajara,
in Mexico City, in Acapulco.

343
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:41,655
You?

344
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,812
In Tlacotalpan, Veracruz.

345
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,493
What are you going to do in Tijuana?

346
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,515
What everyone goes there to do.

347
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,617
And you?

348
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,999
Me too. Me too.

349
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,751
It's a long fuckin' haul, huh?

350
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,557
Yeah.

351
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,243
Listen, could I lie down here?

352
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:39,124
Sure, of course.

353
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,382
I'll be your pillow.

354
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:47,788
- Can you hold this too?
- Sure.

355
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,881
I'll take one of these, and a statue
of the Holy Child of Atocha.

356
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,840
How about a Juan Soldado?
He's the best.

357
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:55,047
Beautiful! I'll take one.

358
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:03,605
Oh, my God!

359
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,071
Grab him! Slimebag!

360
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:17,867
I fucked up! I could have
grabbed your suitcase too!

361
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:21,652
Don't worry.
This is the important one.

362
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,641
All right, kid. See you around.

363
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,482
Are you sure you'll be okay?

364
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:27,646
I could ask the same about you.

365
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:30,811
- Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
- All right.

366
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:33,944
Boy, that fuckin' guy. Asshole.

367
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,336
I'm stuffed!

368
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,413
Excuse me.

369
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:50,396
Do you know
where I can find the Pink House?

370
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:52,308
They told me it's here, in Tijuana.

371
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,609
The Pink House?
Are you sure you got the name right?

372
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,420
Positive.

373
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,407
No. I don't think so.

374
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:01,877
Could you bring me the bill, please?

375
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:05,082
Look at you!
Who could have guessed!

376
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,553
Oh, my God!

377
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:19,616
Hey, it's my treat.
And I'm outta here!

378
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:23,928
Shit!

379
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:28,350
Oh, Holy Child of Atocha, forgive her.

380
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:31,380
Blanca could be in the same situation.

381
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:35,725
Ask for Cacomixtle.

382
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,935
Cacomixtle? As in "weasel"?

383
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:45,959
Cacomixtle!

384
00:42:57,754 --> 00:42:59,450
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

385
00:42:59,563 --> 00:43:03,347
Someone told me I could get directions
to the Pink House here. Do you know?

386
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,677
Are you going to look for work there?

387
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,487
Yes, work.

388
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:11,739
Do you have any references?
They don't let just anybody in.

389
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:15,807
References? Yes, I have eight years
experience, with tall ones, shrimps...

390
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:18,312
white guys, black guys, Chinese...

391
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,453
That so? Maybe I can help you.

392
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,613
I've got a client who might know.

393
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,935
- Really?
- He should come by tonight.

394
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:31,355
Really? All right,
I'll come back tomorrow.

395
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:33,686
You got a place to stay?

396
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:37,168
I'm going to look for a hotel.

397
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:40,304
And what's this?

398
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:06,286
Jose Luis, please understand me.

399
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,538
Is the client here yet?

400
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:16,445
No, but I brought you a little present.

401
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,985
If you're a whore,
I must be Michael the Archangel.

402
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,972
- What makes you think I'm not... that?
- What's you angle?

403
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,688
What are you after?
Let me guess...

404
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:36,732
you need dough to cross the border and
you think you can make it hooking, huh?

405
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,952
- Easy, right?
- No, that's not it.

406
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:41,950
Women like you ruin
the reputation of the trade.

407
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:44,040
Reputation?

408
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:46,364
Reputation. And well earned.

409
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:50,713
Face a guy ready to pop his rocks...

410
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:53,401
and you'll run like hell.

411
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,149
Hooking is like killing:

412
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,526
Sounds easy,
but not everybody's got the nerve.

413
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:33,790
May I?

414
00:45:36,613 --> 00:45:41,263
So you're into costumes, sweetheart?
All right, then.

415
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:46,000
I meant what I said about killing.

416
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:48,958
But only the first time is tough.

417
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,509
Then it becomes a habit.

418
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:56,223
Like this, like this.

419
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,080
That's it!

420
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:07,222
In this profession there are
basic rules you've got to learn.

421
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:11,296
And the first one, baby,
is called intimacy.

422
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,311
I think the client's
not coming tonight after all.

423
00:46:43,622 --> 00:46:45,152
Where should I leave them?

424
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,383
They're for washing.

425
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:50,362
Come here.

426
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,104
Come here!

427
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,827
The madame is called Trini.

428
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,632
Don't mention my name.

429
00:47:24,398 --> 00:47:27,908
Say that Mr. Scott Haynes sent you.

430
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:29,404
Mister who?

431
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,329
Scott Haynes.

432
00:47:45,377 --> 00:47:46,729
Thank you.

433
00:47:47,813 --> 00:47:49,342
No problem.

434
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:56,333
Nothing like recommending
an experienced whore.

435
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:01,202
You're fucked.

436
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,010
Jealous?

437
00:48:10,427 --> 00:48:15,077
The devil doesn't fall in love,
asshole!

438
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:08,146
Yes?

439
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:11,442
Good morning, sir.
I'm looking for Dona Trini.

440
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:14,404
Who's calling?

441
00:49:16,183 --> 00:49:18,579
Mr. Scott Haynes sent me here.

442
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,732
The San Diego judge?

443
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:28,940
Yes. He says that maybe
I could work here.

444
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:32,252
Come in.

445
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,364
What a weirdo.

446
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,381
This isn't a whorehouse or a love hotel.

447
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:49,892
It's a service institution.

448
00:49:50,975 --> 00:49:54,759
We only cater to important gentlemen,
like Mr. Haynes.

449
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,968
Our clientele is very demanding.

450
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:00,291
Are you tested for AI DS?

451
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:02,731
No, but...

452
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:08,534
I'll send you to Dr. Oseguera.
He examines all my girls.

453
00:50:08,649 --> 00:50:12,433
- Does this mean I'm hired?
- You're on a trial basis.

454
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:18,043
Saint Theresa ofJesus!

455
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,997
Thank you.

456
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,434
Esperanza will stay in Yuriria's room.

457
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:34,805
That girl's not coming back!

458
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:35,960
Thank you.

459
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:40,159
You may only enter your own room
and the public areas of the house.

460
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:44,439
You understand
that this is my guest lounge.

461
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,816
Oh, one last thing.
Hide your little box somewhere.

462
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,807
Yes, Dona Trini.

463
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,810
This is your room.
You can do whatever you wish.

464
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:15,971
Your monthly rent
is three thousand dollars.

465
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,128
What? Three thousand?

466
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,453
Includes meals. Don't worry,
you'll make much more than that.

467
00:51:24,565 --> 00:51:27,067
Listen, is there an oven in the kitchen?

468
00:51:27,175 --> 00:51:29,915
- She cooks too?
- Yes, and really well.

469
00:51:30,028 --> 00:51:32,245
I could make you
some fried pork and beans.

470
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:35,277
No way, Missy! I'll bloat!

471
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:40,601
And the other girls?

472
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:42,927
You'll get to know them.

473
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,257
There are hangers in the closet.

474
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:49,649
And all these clothes?

475
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,441
They are Yuriria's.
But if they fit, help yourself.

476
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:56,603
Except for this one.

477
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:23,389
Please, SaintJude,
don't leave me alone!

478
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,199
I've made my way here.

479
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:28,646
I've done
what I never thought I could.

480
00:52:28,756 --> 00:52:30,832
And not a signal from you!

481
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:34,732
I hope you're not the kind that goes
on binges. My budget's very tight!

482
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,896
No, Cesar.

483
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:10,587
Esperanza!

484
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:30,762
Fidencio? It's Esperanza.

485
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:34,481
I need to talk to Father Salvador.
Hurry, it's long distance!

486
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:41,789
- Hello?
- FaTher? IT's me.!

487
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:44,786
No, I'm in Tijuana.

488
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:48,859
Soledad came to see
if I knew where you were.

489
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:53,558
She wants to find you.

490
00:54:53,663 --> 00:54:57,269
A lot has happened, Father.
I need to confess.

491
00:54:57,386 --> 00:55:01,099
You know you can't confess over the
phone. More so if it's long distance.

492
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,954
You and your rules!

493
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,542
What if I call it a confession
and you call it a confidence?

494
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,153
All right. Go ahead.

495
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:14,673
I came to this house owned
by this Trini, and I met this gringo.

496
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:19,992
What?

497
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:22,502
You said I recommended you.

498
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,963
Forgive me, Mr. Haynes,

499
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:27,168
but I really needed the job
and somebody gave me your name.

500
00:55:27,272 --> 00:55:29,490
- Who is 'somebody'?
- Yuriria.

501
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:31,477
She let me have her room, Mister.

502
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:33,461
Call me Scott.

503
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:38,706
Thank you, "Escot",
but you're not mad at me?

504
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:43,307
I won't, until I find out
if I made a good recommendation.

505
00:55:57,262 --> 00:55:59,315
I'll spare you The deTails, FaTher.

506
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,567
I know I'm surrounded by filTh...

507
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:04,599
buT This man has been
good To me so far.

508
00:56:05,682 --> 00:56:08,220
He's come back several Times.

509
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:16,811
What's this?

510
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:19,317
That's four thousand dollars there.

511
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:23,174
But the last time
you gave me three hundred.

512
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:25,340
I don't want you having other clients.

513
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:28,469
- But four thousand?
- You need more?

514
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:31,671
No, that's not it. But, why?

515
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,190
I want you only for myself.

516
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:57,823
He Told me I reminded him
of his moTher, FaTher.

517
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,590
"BuTshe musTbe as blonde as you';
I Told him."

518
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:08,747
"No, iT's The way you look aTme';
He answered."

519
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:12,587
What a crazy gringo.

520
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:21,620
So I haven'Thad To worry
abouToTher clienTs.

521
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,522
I jusTdo Things wiTh him,
buTI don'Tknow if They're sins.

522
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:29,240
If you feel a need of repentance,
then it's a sin.

523
00:57:29,357 --> 00:57:33,247
If not, it's not.
You'll be able to tell.

524
00:57:34,227 --> 00:57:40,171
I jusT wanTmy girl To know ThaTI'll do
anything To rescue her from her TormenT.

525
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:01,569
I don'Tknow how much
you know abouT women, FaTher,

526
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,731
buTyou wouldn'Trecognize me.

527
00:58:03,835 --> 00:58:06,408
I never ThoughTI could look This way.

528
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:20,879
Enjoy. She's still tender.

529
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:29,503
Nobody can be suspicious
of whaTI'm doing.

530
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,983
Be careful, my child.!

531
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,970
Yes.

532
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:43,562
She is my daughter.

533
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,545
She's so blonde!

534
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,257
I've been able To search for Blanca
everywhere, excepTfor one room.

535
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:59,845
IT's nexT To Trini's salon,
buT Cesar waTches iTlike a bodyguard.

536
00:59:04,268 --> 00:59:08,052
FaTher, I'm sure my daughTer
is jusTa few feeTaway...

537
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:10,561
buTSainTJude has forgoTTen abouTme.

538
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,888
He's so unreliable.!

539
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:16,263
Don't lose faith, my child.

540
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:21,027
I won't. I have to go now.
It's long distance! Bye!

541
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,604
Esperanza.!

542
00:59:28,623 --> 00:59:30,319
Esperanza!

543
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:38,572
Lord.

544
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:45,103
I can't deal with Esperanza anymore.
She's got me crazy.

545
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:49,972
You know why you sent her down
this road, but I don't have a clue.

546
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:54,573
If Dr. Ortiz is dead, what do you want
with this poor woman?

547
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:57,220
It's an enigma I can't solve.

548
00:59:57,325 --> 01:00:00,587
And she hung up on me!

549
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:05,351
That's why the Church forbids
long distance confessions!

550
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,611
It must be that girl.
I told her to come by in one hour.

551
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:26,164
Come in.

552
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:30,063
Ma'am.

553
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,708
I'm going to be straight with you.

554
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:39,073
Business is off, and the word
about your altar has spread around...

555
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,928
and lots of clients want to see you.
I need you to take care of them.

556
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:45,054
But Mr. Scott asked me to...

557
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:47,454
He doesn't have to find out.

558
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,098
Madame Trini, lying to Mr. Scott
won't fix the problem.

559
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,509
What this house need is a spiritual
cleansing, like we do back home.

560
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,672
Why risk your best client?

561
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:04,254
You'll see what a cleansing can do.

562
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:16,231
It's vital that I enter every single
room in the house, public and private.

563
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:19,078
Don't get fresh with me!

564
01:01:42,049 --> 01:01:44,551
No wonder, Dona Trini.
Somebody cast a spell on you!

565
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:48,024
- That must have been Cacomixtle!
- But it's out now.

566
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,233
The evil. See?

567
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:55,995
I need to open every door...

568
01:01:56,105 --> 01:02:00,376
to eliminate any spell
that they may have cast on the property.

569
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:01,531
Let's go!

570
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,493
Go away!

571
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:25,186
You must swear
that you'll keep this...

572
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,869
to yourself.

573
01:02:27,974 --> 01:02:29,504
Amen.

574
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:39,103
Holy Virgin!

575
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:14,906
There are no girls locked up here!

576
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:18,109
You're not helping me find Blanca!

577
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,415
Forgive me! Forgive me!

578
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,573
Forgive me!

579
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:43,571
I don't know whether to hate you,
or to worship you!

580
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:45,808
First you order SaintJude
to send me on this search,

581
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:47,890
then you take him away
when I need him the most!

582
01:03:48,865 --> 01:03:51,783
Give me back my Blanca!

583
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:08,899
Why did you waste my time there?
That Trini doesn't have any girls!

584
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:10,184
Dona Trini.

585
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:13,736
I didn't know you liked girls!

586
01:04:13,846 --> 01:04:18,673
Don't be stupid, I don't like girls.
I'm looking for my daughter.

587
01:04:18,786 --> 01:04:20,838
She was kidnapped.

588
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,866
No wonder they took her.

589
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,806
Though her mama is even prettier.

590
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,964
Do you know where she might be?

591
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:38,508
And do you know who her father is?
Or was it Immaculate Conception?

592
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:42,057
You don't know what you're
talking about. I'm a widow.

593
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,791
What a pity! Divorcees forget
their husbands quick,

594
01:04:47,907 --> 01:04:51,168
but widows carry them
around their necks like holy medals.

595
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:53,155
I don't care for threesomes.

596
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,138
Do you have an idea
where she could be?

597
01:04:56,431 --> 01:05:00,737
They might have taken her
to the other side.

598
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:02,545
You mean the United States?

599
01:05:04,084 --> 01:05:08,212
SaintJude, what am I going to do?
I don't know what's worse,

600
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:11,069
that she's gone to the Other World
or to the First World.

601
01:05:15,148 --> 01:05:19,347
There's a spot in Los Angeles...

602
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,833
you should check out.

603
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:27,769
The owner is my buddy, and he knows
where these girls might be working.

604
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,579
Ask for Doroteo.

605
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:34,171
But I don't even have a passport!

606
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:36,882
Since when has that been a problem?

607
01:05:43,226 --> 01:05:45,278
PleaseJuan Soldado...

608
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:50,460
this is your land,
you've helped so many immigrants...

609
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:53,835
Please hold our hand.

610
01:07:05,578 --> 01:07:07,796
So, are we gonna send you
to a paradise place?

611
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:10,482
No. I saw your ad.

612
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:16,772
Unfortunately, I can't choose
till I've interviewed everybody.

613
01:07:16,885 --> 01:07:21,404
Well, let me know soon
so I can tell Mr. Scott Haynes.

614
01:07:23,147 --> 01:07:24,500
What did you say?

615
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:28,048
Mister Haynes told me to see you.

616
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:33,402
You should have told me right away.
How do you know Scott?

617
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:36,955
We're practically related.

618
01:07:37,064 --> 01:07:39,567
He got me out of a fuckin'jam.

619
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:42,769
They threw me in the can
and he got me out.

620
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:44,748
They thought I was some fucking guy.

621
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:46,032
Holy Virgin!

622
01:07:46,144 --> 01:07:48,540
But, hey, ancient story.

623
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:56,337
I want you to help me with ticketing,
confirmation, money exchange, income tax.

624
01:07:56,443 --> 01:08:02,457
I also sell tickets
for wrestling events, you know?

625
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:03,609
Yes.

626
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,732
- So, what's your name?
- Esperanza Diaz.

627
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:09,551
See you tomorrow at eleven.

628
01:08:09,664 --> 01:08:12,202
Welcome to Paseo Travel.

629
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:18,979
This apartment's nicer
than the other...

630
01:08:19,092 --> 01:08:23,220
but nobody wants it
because a guy was murdered here.

631
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:27,465
Don't worry,
I already washed it down,

632
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:31,164
redecorated, fixed it up nice.

633
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:39,062
I'll take it.

634
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:44,305
Terrific! We'll be great pals.
Come on, I'll give you the key.

635
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:01,043
If the job interests you, it's yours.

636
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:03,729
Cacomixtle and I
have done a lot of business...

637
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:06,930
and he always sends good material.

638
01:09:08,636 --> 01:09:12,835
Come with me, I'll give you a tour.

639
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:18,095
This theater is unique.
There's nothing like it in the world.

640
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:21,643
Why? Because I created it.

641
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:25,192
Look, the girls go up these stairs.

642
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,530
Come.

643
01:09:30,277 --> 01:09:34,725
And the clients
can do their browsing down here.

644
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:39,461
See? Clients can watch their individual
show through these sex-o-scopes.

645
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,962
Go ahead, take a peek.

646
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:51,632
And what's the show?

647
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,004
The girls put on their uniform...

648
01:09:55,117 --> 01:09:58,213
and do what they normally do
when no one's watching them.

649
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:03,882
They dress, undress,
comb their hair, masturbate,

650
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:07,773
battle their cellulite.

651
01:10:09,556 --> 01:10:11,608
But what's the point, Doroteo?

652
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:16,270
The violation of intimacy.

653
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:52,846
Please, SaintJude, tell me if I'm
getting warmer or getting colder?

654
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:55,697
I'm losing hope and don't know
in which oven to look for you.

655
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,965
How will I ever find Blanca
in this city? It's huge!

656
01:12:41,143 --> 01:12:43,884
Vicenta, it's the man who called
this morning. What do I tell him?

657
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:47,507
Tell the bastard we'll check
for a direct flight and get back to him.

658
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:51,921
Yes, sir, and you're in luck,
I've got the last tickets.

659
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:55,996
But hurry! We close at six!

660
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:59,200
If you have any left, I'll buy you one.

661
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:03,268
I don't want to miss this match.
It's with the Angel ofJustice, right?

662
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,008
And he's fuckin' hot, man.
I was gonna go by myself...

663
01:13:06,124 --> 01:13:08,864
but if you wanna see the Border Patrol
get stomped, tag along.

664
01:13:08,978 --> 01:13:10,959
What about your night gig?

665
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:14,505
If they fire me, who cares?
I'll find another job.

666
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:20,701
Presents the season's
top wrestling match!

667
01:13:20,806 --> 01:13:22,573
That's La Migra.

668
01:13:22,685 --> 01:13:24,310
That's the bad guy, yeah?

669
01:13:24,424 --> 01:13:30,118
Tonight's Referee: Furia!

670
01:13:31,626 --> 01:13:35,659
Entering the ring,
the immigration monster:

671
01:13:38,654 --> 01:13:40,943
Border Patrol!

672
01:13:44,638 --> 01:13:50,167
Risking his Championship of All Masks
tonight and challenging from the heavens:

673
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:53,086
The Angel ofJustice!

674
01:13:59,877 --> 01:14:02,759
We worship you! We worship you!

675
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,089
Angel!

676
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:42,839
Give the pig a tombstone piledriver!

677
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:49,584
Border Patrol! Border Patrol!

678
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:51,193
Look!

679
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,474
Tear him apart!

680
01:14:58,884 --> 01:15:03,855
Slimebag!
How can you do that to him?

681
01:15:03,963 --> 01:15:06,739
Give him a neckbreaker!

682
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:27,335
Grind his bones!

683
01:15:33,745 --> 01:15:36,212
Hey! Watch it, fucker!

684
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:48,526
Don't mess with his balls!

685
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:59,204
Vicenta, careful!

686
01:16:00,813 --> 01:16:02,165
Hide there, you idiot!

687
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:12,426
Watch out!

688
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:53,587
This fabulous combat
has come to an end...

689
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:57,825
with the victory
of the Angel ofJustice...

690
01:17:00,795 --> 01:17:05,801
we'll know the identity
of Border Patrol!

691
01:17:10,571 --> 01:17:16,265
There you have it,
the new champion:

692
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,477
The Angel ofJustice!

693
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,996
Good night.

694
01:17:55,695 --> 01:17:57,748
What a catharsis!

695
01:17:57,853 --> 01:17:59,929
- You scared me!
- Now what?

696
01:18:00,045 --> 01:18:02,333
I'm looking for the wrestler.
I have his boot.

697
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:05,150
Angel, are you decent?

698
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,616
It depends.

699
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,942
There's a lady who wants to see you.

700
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:10,585
Okay.

701
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,969
Won't you be needing this?

702
01:18:16,084 --> 01:18:20,603
You're making me feel like Cinderella.

703
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:25,747
Why didn't you catch me out there?

704
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,734
We haven't even been introduced.

705
01:18:27,843 --> 01:18:30,939
Heaven forbid!
The Angel ofJustice, at your service.

706
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,926
My pleasure. Esperanza Diaz.

707
01:18:34,036 --> 01:18:35,352
Can I walk you to your car?

708
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:38,210
No.

709
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:40,854
Well, I could give you a ride.

710
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,036
I won, you see, and there's a party
with my manager and the boys...

711
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,953
and whoever catches the boot.

712
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:35,369
How do you have any strength left
to dance after the beating you took?

713
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:39,369
I dished out more than I took.

714
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:48,591
I'm really sorry.

715
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:57,636
Does it hurt?

716
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,423
Here, let me rub it.

717
01:20:02,372 --> 01:20:04,946
No! Don't take my shoe off! Please.

718
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:08,171
Are you embarrassed?

719
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:10,470
But you were carrying my boot.

720
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:14,510
It's just that have a bad habit
of losing my shoes...

721
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:16,908
and these are my favorite ones.

722
01:20:17,994 --> 01:20:20,319
Yeah?

723
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:25,507
Well you can't lose them here.

724
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,187
Who are you?

725
01:20:40,296 --> 01:20:43,594
Don't ask. There's no hurry.

726
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,402
Are you?

727
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,438
Can we see each other soon?

728
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:55,533
God willing.

729
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:10,486
May I help you?

730
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,128
Yes.

731
01:21:15,922 --> 01:21:17,096
Your foot!

732
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,783
No, no. You could get hurt.

733
01:21:21,941 --> 01:21:26,069
It looked really awful when he gave you
the flying axhandle. Did it hurt?

734
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,716
The flying axhandle?

735
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:30,917
- Yes, did it hurt much?
- No.

736
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:35,783
Then...

737
01:21:40,102 --> 01:21:41,455
Good night.

738
01:21:42,538 --> 01:21:44,068
Good night.

739
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,917
Did you forget something?

740
01:22:15,033 --> 01:22:17,251
My favorite one!

741
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,623
I'm glad you came back...

742
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:26,305
because I'm going to give you
the chokeslam, the powerbomb,

743
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,462
and then, I'll unmask you.

744
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:31,034
And I'll punish you
with the wristlock,

745
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:35,376
give you a Hurricane, and if you're
not careful, the Crucifixion.

746
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,080
The Crucifixion?

747
01:22:39,249 --> 01:22:40,292
On this side...

748
01:22:41,058 --> 01:22:42,825
Let's see. Catch me!

749
01:22:43,911 --> 01:22:46,093
She gets the Neck Stretcher.

750
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:51,588
And she gives him the Head Vice!

751
01:22:54,696 --> 01:23:00,081
But he escapes with a Tiger Pounce!

752
01:23:00,193 --> 01:23:03,288
There she goes... No, no wait!

753
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:06,490
- What are you going to do to me?
- Careful, my hair.

754
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:09,512
There she goes, like a shot!

755
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:13,409
Now I hold your arms.

756
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,441
- And the Crucifixion.
- The Crucifixion?

757
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,740
First we roll to our right.

758
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:36,503
Esperanza, that's a Spine Cracker.

759
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,972
Yes, sir.

760
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:41,522
- And now, the mask!
- What are you doing?

761
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,504
No, please, Esperanza, not yet.

762
01:23:43,613 --> 01:23:47,254
You did this to the other guy.
Why can't I?

763
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:49,244
Off it goes!

764
01:23:51,789 --> 01:23:54,185
But the wrestler covers his face.

765
01:23:56,277 --> 01:23:58,744
She can't see him!

766
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:03,703
What happened?

767
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:08,458
Nothing. You unmasked me.

768
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:11,601
My name's Angel Galvan.

769
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:18,900
But not even my mom knows my true
identity, so, your lips are sealed.

770
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:27,148
Saint Anthony,

771
01:25:27,257 --> 01:25:31,041
please don't play a bad joke on me
with this Angel guy.

772
01:25:31,154 --> 01:25:33,425
I've never put your statue upside down
so you'd find me a man.

773
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:35,526
So, don't make me fall in love with him.

774
01:25:35,643 --> 01:25:38,216
What if he's just playing around?

775
01:25:38,322 --> 01:25:40,231
You send me off in search of Blanca...

776
01:25:40,339 --> 01:25:42,213
and you put an angel on my path!

777
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,098
I can't look for my girl
and fall in love at the same time.

778
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:48,581
Why don't you two
get your act together?

779
01:26:42,895 --> 01:26:44,519
Fucking whore!

780
01:26:44,635 --> 01:26:47,624
- Who do you think you're laughing at?
- What are you doing here?

781
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:49,355
Shut up!

782
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,636
That's how I wanted to see you, slut!

783
01:27:03,109 --> 01:27:05,576
Come here, fucking whore!

784
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:09,297
That's how I wanted to see you,
Peeping Tom!

785
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,364
Where are you! Where are you!

786
01:27:17,478 --> 01:27:19,281
Where are you, fucking whore?

787
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:22,417
There are no little girls here either!

788
01:27:26,524 --> 01:27:28,576
What's going on?

789
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:32,264
Nothing. Just having a chat
with your friend from Tijuana.

790
01:27:32,369 --> 01:27:33,412
Stop her!

791
01:27:38,457 --> 01:27:41,375
You had to be another bitch!

792
01:28:39,169 --> 01:28:42,265
You ended up all the way up here too?

793
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:48,693
It's amazing what one will do
for one's children, isn't it?

794
01:28:56,182 --> 01:28:57,534
SaintJude...

795
01:28:57,643 --> 01:29:00,419
please tell me
if I've understood your messages.

796
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,558
We've gone a little too far,
haven't we?

797
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:13,121
Saint Anthony, I guess
you'll have to wait. I'm sorry.

798
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,267
SaintJude, I'm going back home.

799
01:29:23,528 --> 01:29:26,102
And you better be there.

800
01:31:03,067 --> 01:31:05,285
Good lord! Just look at you!

801
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:07,617
Look at you too!

802
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:11,184
Watch out!

803
01:32:15,887 --> 01:32:18,460
You brought back a refrigerator!

804
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:24,193
Oh, Dominga. Dominga.

805
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:38,150
Mama, you and I
will always be together.

806
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:55,092
I brought you some presents.

807
01:32:55,201 --> 01:32:56,755
Thank you!

808
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,127
SaintJude.

809
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,375
What did you do to the oven?

810
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:28,530
What do mean?

811
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:30,617
With this!

812
01:33:31,594 --> 01:33:34,061
I just cleaned it. That's all.

813
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,437
Dammit!

814
01:33:46,449 --> 01:33:47,979
Oh, my Lord!

815
01:33:49,059 --> 01:33:51,277
How are you, Father Salvador?

816
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,086
Esperanza!

817
01:33:55,843 --> 01:33:58,061
Where have you been?

818
01:33:59,149 --> 01:34:02,066
In Los Angeles.

819
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,923
Look at you.

820
01:34:06,176 --> 01:34:08,573
You've changed so much!

821
01:34:11,674 --> 01:34:13,726
Do you want to confess?

822
01:34:15,674 --> 01:34:18,936
I don't know what to do, Father.

823
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,623
I don't know what to do.

824
01:34:34,114 --> 01:34:37,139
Our Father will never abandon you.

825
01:34:39,855 --> 01:34:44,339
He's aware of everything you've done
to find your daughter.

826
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:50,075
Everything, Father.

827
01:35:01,878 --> 01:35:03,752
Everything.

828
01:36:04,295 --> 01:36:05,469
Mama.

829
01:36:08,087 --> 01:36:09,616
Mama.

830
01:36:13,653 --> 01:36:15,705
My little darling!

831
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,840
You and I will always be together.

832
01:36:34,528 --> 01:36:36,058
Blanquita.

833
01:37:05,702 --> 01:37:08,442
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

834
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:10,951
now and at the hour of our...

835
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:13,977
Let's go outside.
I can't be in church dressed like this.

836
01:37:14,086 --> 01:37:15,783
What are you doing here?

837
01:37:33,256 --> 01:37:34,953
How did you find me?

838
01:37:35,065 --> 01:37:38,161
There is only one Tlacotalpan,
Veracruz, Mexico.

839
01:37:38,267 --> 01:37:40,840
But what are you doing here?

840
01:37:40,945 --> 01:37:44,065
I have orders to find you.

841
01:37:49,783 --> 01:37:52,879
Why did you disappear just like that?

842
01:37:52,983 --> 01:37:56,910
Same way you appeared just like that.

843
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:59,831
Esperanza, come with me.

844
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,964
I can't, Angel.

845
01:38:04,048 --> 01:38:08,176
Why did you leave so suddenly?

846
01:38:09,266 --> 01:38:11,318
Things happen in a strange way.

847
01:38:11,424 --> 01:38:18,411
Funny, I had to travel so far
to find what was in my own house.

848
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:24,078
What can I do to convince you?

849
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:02,838
My daughter!
