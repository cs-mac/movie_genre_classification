00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
PEEP WORLD (2010)

2
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,357
Henry Meyerwitz
had never wanted any children.

3
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:32,527
But when he had his first,
he remembered an old proverb:

4
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:36,448
"Commit a sin twice,
and it Will not seem a crime."

5
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:37,824
So he had more.

6
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:42,370
And once a year, his sins,
all grown up,

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,124
gathered to celebrate
his birthday.

8
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,918
He didn't want to be there.

9
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:52,839
They didn't want to be there.

10
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,174
This year, however,

11
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:58,011
a book came out
that made it even Worse.

12
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,055
And I want to make a toast
to my fabulous son Nate

13
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:02,223
and the great success

14
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:03,975
he's having with his book,
Peep World.

15
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,727
Thanks, Dad.

16
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,104
Oh, pardon me If I don't toast
a man who's ruined my life.

17
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:10,023
And I don't know how
any of you could.

18
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,276
I ruined your life?
And what did I do?

19
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,362
Did I make you more unemployed,
more dysfunctional?

20
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:17,364
You stabbed us all
in the back, you motherfucker!

21
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:18,782
You're a fucking bitch.
Okay?

22
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:20,408
You honestly have wasted
your entire life

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,868
being an asshole.

24
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:23,703
Look at yourself in the mirror.
You're a fraud.

25
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,747
- You're the fucked-up version
of Amy Winehouse..

26
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:11,668
There were
four Meyerwitz children.

27
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,548
Jack was the responsible son.

28
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:18,717
Like the main character
in Peep World,

29
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,593
he was a struggling architect

30
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:22,846
Whose father made him
feel inadequate.

31
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:24,931
Bastard.

32
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,725
There were
other things in his life

33
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,977
that made him
fee! inadequate foo.

34
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:31,354
Piece of shit.

35
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:36,651
Liar.

36
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:38,820
Pervert.

37
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:40,488
The first time
Jack heard Laura

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,367
curse in her sleep, he assumed
she was having a nightmare.

39
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,578
Fucker.

40
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,079
Fuck you.

41
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:52,792
By the second night,
he knew the nightmare was him.

42
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,842
Cheri Meyerwitz
was a would-be artist,

43
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:04,888
poet, actress, dancer,
and singer-songwriter.

44
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,640
But the only thing
that had brought her

45
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,351
any measure of recognition

46
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:12,020
was the Way her brother Nathan
had portrayed her

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,813
in his book, Peep World..

48
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:15,899
AH right, folks,
here we go.

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,941
This is Peep World..

50
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:21,029
Scene 24, take four.

51
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,365
To make matters Worse,

52
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:26,326
they just happened to be
shooting the movie version

53
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,703
right in front
of her apartment.

54
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,539
We gotta go.
We gotta get a shot off.

55
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,042
31 apple, take one.

56
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,710
Action.

57
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,087
How do I look?

58
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,922
You look good.

59
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:41,257
Good? Just good?

60
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,093
I can't go to my audition now.

61
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,552
My confidence is shot.

62
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:49,516
God damn it,
what the fuck was that?

63
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,393
Cut!

64

89
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,958
Nathan,
the youngest Meyerwitz,

90
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,586
had relished every moment
of his book tour

91
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,213
except for today.

92
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:05,342
That's because
he was facing his family

93
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:07,886
for the first time
since Peep World came out.

94
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,471
They'll be ready for you
in a minute.

95
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:11,514
I told them not to mention
your sister's lawsuit.

96
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:12,640
Good. Thank you.

97
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,184
Thank you very much.

98
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,354
You have a little something.

99
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,316
Do you want me to get you
another green tea?

100
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,901
No, I'm fine.
You can do whatever you do.

101
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,402
Okay.

102
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,529
Nathan's favorite
part of his book tour

103
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,865
was getting to work
with attractive assistants.

104
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:30,283
He treated them
condescendingly...

105
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:31,659
Uh.

106
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,828
Because he read
Norman Mailer did that.

107
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,705
I'm sure you get this
all the time.

108
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,707
Do you have any
sort of advice at all

109
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,626
fora young struggling writer?

110
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,586
I mean, I love doing PR work
and everything,

111
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:42,837
but in my heart,
I'm a writer.

112
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,005
Of course you are.

113
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,924
So, like, any sort
of experience at all

114
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,092
that you could
kind of pass...

115
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,176
Listen. Listen.

116
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,594
There's nothing that
I can tell you

117
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,262
that's gonna
magically make you a writer.

118
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,014
You either have talent,
or you do not.

119
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,891
Writing is something
that you were born with.

120
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,893
It's not something
that you can just pick up.

121
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,645
Okay?
It is not like Spanish.

122
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:00,230
Okay.

123
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:01,564
Okay, do you understand?

124
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:03,316
I'm gonna go see
if they're ready for you.

125
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:04,818
Well, you know what?

126
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:05,860
Can you wait one second?

127
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,237
Can you wait one second
actually?

128
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:09,447
I need your opinion
on something very important.

129
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,532
Really?

130
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,741
Yeah.
This is huge.

131
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,243
- Okay.
- Okay?

132
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:14,244
Yeah.

133
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,871
Okay.
Okay, gather yourself.

134
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:20,208
Which one do you prefer?

135
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,043
Really look at them, right?

136
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:23,461
They're works of art.

137
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,922
Uh, they're both good.

138
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,382
Everybody knows
they're both good.

139
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:29,426
Everybody can look at them
and say they're both good,

140
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,844
but I need you to pick one.

141
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,096
Okay, well that one makes you
look a little more literary.

142
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,514
Yeah, because
of the turtleneck?

143
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:35,765
Yeah, and it's... the tilt.

144
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:36,891
Yeah, a crafty head tilt.

145
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:37,976
It's a veteran move, right?

146
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,394
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:41,187
And by the way, I know I looked
just okay in Peep World.

148
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,064
It's fine.
It was a bit of a cliché.

149
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,190
A cliché, right, this?

150
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,900
I know.
I told them that.

151
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,277
I didn't want to do that.

152
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:50,238
Okay, and for my next novel,
the photo is going to match

153
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,032
the power of the writing.

154
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:54,284
You take Philip Roth on the
back of Portnoy's Complaint...

155
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:55,785
Did you read it?
Yes.

156
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,412
- Do you want to know why?
- Great book.

157
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:58,580
It's a... it's a good book.

158
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,081
It's a good book.

159
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:03,877
No, you read it because he looks
unbelievable on that back cover,

160
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,212
like a Jewish Casanova, right?

161
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:07,797
Like he could pick up a shofar

162
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,467
and make it sound
like a jazz saxophone.

163
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:13,094
That photo had
a hypnotic effect on women.

164
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:16,598
So that's why men write,
to get women?

165
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,100
That's why men do everything.

166
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,478
They're ready for you,
Mr. Meyerwitz.

167
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,813
Please, you can just
call me Nathan, right?

168
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,190
She can just call me Nathan.

169
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,941
Where you from?
Cuba.

170
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:29,694
Oh, get out of here.
I love Cuba.

171
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,116
Honey! Wake up!

172
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:38,203
Oh, my god.

173
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,454
Ah, don't do that!

174
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:41,122
How can you read this
before you go to bed?

175
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,208
No wonder you have
trouble sleeping.

176
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:45,960
There you go.

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,961
Thank you.

178
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:48,171
Your brother's on TV again.

179
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,882
How does he look?

180
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,218
Smug

181
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,261
Our next guest
is causing quite a stir

182
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,305
with his first novel,
Peep World,

183
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:58,932
the number one
best-selling novel.

184
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,058
Welcome, Nathan Meyerwitz.

185
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,184
It's a pleasure to be here.

186
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,644
That is one disturbing novel.

187
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,145
And that family... Whoo.

188
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:07,190
So will he be gracing us
with his presence tonight?

189
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,983
Yeah.

190
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,152
I wonder if it's too late
to sit him at another table.

191
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:13,279
My own life experience.

192
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,989
So I'm taking a mirror,
and I'm putting it up

193
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,200
to all families, and I'm saying,
"Take a look at yourself.

194
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:19,202
Take a good, hard look."

195
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,787
Ooh, he kicked.

196
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:22,998
So it's safe to say
that Peep World is at least...

197
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,290
somewhat autobiographical?

198
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,500
- Yes.
- Oh, yes, of course.

199
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,543
What time is it?

200
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,585
I've got an appointment.

201
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:28,670
I better get in the shower.

202
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:29,838
Save some hot water for me.

203
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,880
Okay.

204
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,716
Dysfunctional family.

205
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,009
And your own family?

206
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,510
How do they feel about
the incredible

207
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:37,303
attention that
Peep World is getting?

208
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:38,638
They love it.
They're excited.

209
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,723
- No.
- Yeah.

210
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,516
- Wow.
- Yeah.

211
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,184
Your brother's supposed
to protect you.

212
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,770
Your brother isn't supposed
to betray you.

213
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,065
Christ was betrayed too.

214
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,902
Yeah, that's true.

215
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,324
Cheri sought solace
in her friend Ephraim,

216
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,910
who would patiently listen
to her in hopes that one day,

217
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,039
Cheri would sleep with him.

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,791
They've been seeing each other
for eight years.

219
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,918
You know it is
a sad commentary

220
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,670
on our society indeed

221
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:14,215
that we allow someone
to use a trusting relationship

222
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:15,467
for their own material gain.

223
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,552
And he made a fortune
on that book.

224
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:18,845
And that's before the movie.

225
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,930
And now I walk
out of my apartment,

226
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,432
and I step straight
into Peep World.

227
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,600
It's like rape.

228
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,352
It feels like rape.

229
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:27,395
Yeah, and by your own brother.

230
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:29,939
Oh, I went to an audition
the other day.

231
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,733
All the director
could talk about

232
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,068
was Peep World and Peep World

233
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,486
and can I introduce him
to Nathan,

234
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,655
like he's a goddamn deity
or something, no offense.

235
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,032
None taken.

236
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,034
He's had it in for me ever
since he was born,

237
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,285
literally since he was born.

238
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:43,328
I used to be the favorite.

239
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,537
I was the youngest.

240
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,081
Now Nathan's the youngest.

241
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,123
He was a mistake.

242
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,667
You know he was
a mistake baby?

243
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,710
- No, no, I didn't know that.
- I didn't tell you that?

244
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,420
- Is this clean?
- Yeah, all washed.

245
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:57,092
It was Jack, uh, Joel, me,
all two years apart,

246
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:58,593
and then seven years later,
Nathan.

247
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,637
Nobody wanted him.

248
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,138
I should have done
everybody a favor

249
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,599
and put a plastic bag
in his crib.

250
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,810
No, no. That's one
of the seven dead lies

251
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:12,482
I will be civil tonight
at Daddy's birthday.

252
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:13,942
I will be civil,

253
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:19,072
but he better watch himself,
because I have fucking had it.

254
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:21,241
Cheri, I will be standing
right by your side,

255
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:23,576
and if you decide
to go all the way with this,

256
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,538
go to trial,
I will be there for you too.

257
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:27,622
Do you think I'm a monster?

258
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:29,165
No, no.
Of course not.

259
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,500
You don't think
I'm a monster?

260
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,627
Not at all.

261
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,591
Can you get my spot?

262
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,634
Yeah.

263
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,137
That's it.

264
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,556
I hate to break it
to you Effie,

265
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:48,643
but that is not a Jewish man
I'm looking at.

266
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,571
To his children,
Henry Meyerwitz

267
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,949
was more of a face
on a billboard than a father.

268
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,368
He was like the Marlboro man,

269
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:08,705
but shorter and Jewish.

270
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,002
Jack.

271
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:15,086
Good morning.

272
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,129
Morning.

273
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,297
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

274
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,757
That's okay.

275
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,967
That's when your Dad and I Won
the tournament at Riviera.

276
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,135
Do you remember that?

277
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,179
- Not really.
- The man is an animal.

278
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,847
He's an absolute killer
at the net.

279
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,058
I don't doubt that.

280
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,352
So I see you've been looking
at the plans.

281
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,519
Yeah.

282
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,063
Looked them over
pretty carefully,

283
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:35,899
and, um, they're good.

284
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:43,031
But I... I kept hoping
that they would be, um...

285
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:45,533
Better?

286
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,410
No. No, not better.

287
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,537
Just...

288
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:52,540
different.

289
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:55,543
Maybe, um, next time?

290
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:58,713
Un, now many times are you
going to remodel the den?

291
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:03,718
Say hi to your Dad for me.

292
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,095
Will do.

293
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,515
Your card is no good, man.
It's been rejected.

294
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:09,557
No good?

295
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:11,434
That's impossible.

296
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,644
It's my brother's..

297
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,687
I'll take care of this.

298
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:16,606
When Joel was seven,

299
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,233
he asked his father
to give him a dollar

300
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,901
to buy some candy.

301
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,070
His father turned him down.

302
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:23,363
So he asked his brother Jack.

303
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,825
He's been borrowing money
from him ever since.

304
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,201
Hello?

305
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,120
Jack, hey, it's Joel.
How you...

306
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,206
Jack? Jack?

307
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:37,669
Dropped call or...

308
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,800
What?

309
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:44,926
Hey, Jack. Hey.

310
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:46,428
How are you?
Lost you back there, bro.

311
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,637
You didn't lose me.
I hung up.

312
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,472
This is serious.

313
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,391
There's something wrong
with your credit card.

314
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,934
There's nothing wrong
with the card.

315
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,811
I trusted you.

316
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:55,812
Look at the thanks I get.

317
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:56,980
What are you talking about?

318
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:58,606
The monthly statement.

319
00:12:58,648 --> 00:12:59,983
You think I don't read it?

320
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,360
$800 dollars
at the Pump Station.

321
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,862
What is that,
another strip club?

322
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,572
No, it's not a strip club.

323
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:07,490
It's a personal training center.

324
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:09,284
I'm kickboxing now.

325
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:11,494
- You're boxing?
- It's not just boxing.

326
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:12,579
Muay Thai.

327
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,955
You know, it's...
if you want to get

328
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:16,124
in the best shape of your life,
then trust me on this one.

329
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,917
You should try it.
Kickboxing is the way to go.

330
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,002
Are you there? Jack?

331
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:21,296
Are you listening?
This is important.

332
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:22,714
Look, Joel.

333
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,382
I'm having a rough morning,
all right?

334
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:26,676
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

335
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,470
Yeah, of course there's
something you can do.

336
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,013
Stop asking me for money.

337
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:31,639
Stop creating crises.

338
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,640
You know what,

339
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:34,434
I believe
that people can change,

340
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,727
and I'm gonna
turn things around,

341
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:36,770
and you're gonna see that.

342
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:37,979
I am gonna turn this around.

343
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:39,189
I'm gonna take care of my debt.

344
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,732
I'm gonna get
my practice going again.

345
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:43,651
I'm gonna get married,
and I am gonna have a good life.

346
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,153
Well, I really hope so, Joel.

347
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,363
Yeah.

348
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:47,864
And I'm gonna retire at 40.

349
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:49,240
You're 38, Joel.

350
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,492
You're broke.

351
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:52,869
Well, that's...
see, that's negative.

352
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:54,371
How do you expect me
to be positive

353
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,498
with all the negativity
raining down on me all the time?

354
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,041
And I'm gonna tell you
something else.

355
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,669
I have a new girlfriend,
and she is wonderful.

356
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:01,920
She believes in me,

357
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,546
and she's trying to make me
a better man.

358
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:05,131
And she's not some whore either.

359
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,050
Well, that sounds good...
Joel.

360
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,301
Yeah. It is great.

361
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:09,803
It is great.

362
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:11,346
So what I'm gonna do is,

363
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,598
I'm gonna just put you
on the phone, um,

364
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,683
With, uh, What's your name?

365
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:15,892
Maduk..

366
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,186
Ma... Maduk?

367
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,229
Maduk?

368
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,397
Maduk..

369
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:21,439
Uh, where are you from?

370
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,482
Sudan.

371
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,525
Sudan? Ooh.

372
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,236
Sexy. Grr..

373
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,029
Uh, Maduk from Sudan
and, uh,

374
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:30,115
all you have to do is give him
your credit card number.

375
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,241
Thank you so much, brother.

376
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:32,367
Thank you.

377
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,369
Hello?

378
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,249
What's this gonna cost me?

379
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,251
$483.

380
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:47,716
Hey, Jack.

381
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:49,217
Your father called.

382
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:52,846
He said he wanted to know
about Thomkins

383
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:54,472
We really needed that one.

384
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:55,974
I know.

385
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,434
I'll be in my office.

386
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,978
- And don't forget,
Laura's stopping by at 1:00.

387
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,065
He's a good guy,
my brother, right?

388
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:09,362
My brother would have told me
to go fuck myself.

389
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:12,282
Families. Right?

390
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:18,246
Okay.

391
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,497
Wait, do I ride with you?

392
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,587
I ride with you.

393
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:26,629
Maduk..

394
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:29,841
Come in.

395
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:35,972
Sorry, Jack, but, uh,
we have to go over this.

396
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:38,099
We can pay the rent,

397
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:40,685
the electricity,
and the phone bill.

398
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:41,770
But that's it.

399
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,980
There's at least $17,000
in other bills.

400
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:51,404
Jack.

401
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:54,449
Your brother's on the phone.

402
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,451
I need to take this
in private.

403
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,915
What do you need now, Joel?

404
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:03,458
No, no, no.
It's not Joel.

405
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,335
It's Nathan,
your successful brother.

406
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:06,461
Oh. Hey.

407
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,338
Jesus.

408
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,840
Every developer in this city
is going out of business,

409
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:12,801
but leave it to Dad
to make money.

410
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:15,011
Yeah.
That's what he's good at.

411
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,596
Hey, so how's Laura
holding up?

412
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:21,017
She's, uh...
she's great.

413
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,852
Despite
being betrayed

414
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,354
by Nathan
in his book Peep World,

415
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:27,941
Jack had
an almost masochistic desire

416
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,193
to open up
to his youngest brother.

417
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,363
I'm not sure, but she's been
talking in her sleep.

418
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,698
Should hear her.

419
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,199
"You fucker."

420
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,200
"Fuck you."

421
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,493
"Liar."

422
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,453
How long has this
been going on for?

423
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,373
Uh, that's enough.

424
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,500
I can't believe
I told you that much.

425
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,002
Come on.
You can trust me.

426
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,212
Look, I'm through being fodder
for your imagination.

427
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:50,547
Please, okay.

428
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,132
We have...
Jack, I gotta take this, okay?

429
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:53,717
I'll talk to you tonight
at Dad's party.

430
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:57,637
All right.

431
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,097
Hello?

432
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,432
Yeah, this is he.

433
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:03,226
Fantastic. Cancellation.
At what time?

434
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,853
I will be there.
I am on my way right now.

435
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,521
I will be there.
Uh, where?

436
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,273
Hey, drop me off
at Mariposa and Sixth.

437
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:09,649
You have a 1:30 book reading.

438
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,734
If I'm late, I'm late.

439
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:11,943
That's rude.

440
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,695
Well, the world
isn't always polite.

441
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:15,739
Or didn't they teach you
that over at UCLA?

442
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,240
I must have missed that class.

443
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,534
You obviously didn't miss
the one on condescension

444
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:21,536
I actually majored in it.

445
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,459
That's fine.

446
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,501
- Nathan.
- What?

447
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:29,544
Nathan.

448
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,920
What?

449
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,547
If you're not there,
my boss will kill me.

450
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,965
I will be there.
I promise.

451
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,425
Please.

452
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,761
Stop it.
I will be there.

453
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,138
Hemingway
found his courage

454
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,349
by running with the buffs.

455
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,143
Nathan found his by visiting
a highly recommended doctor

456
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,062
on craigslist.

457
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,063
And you are?

458
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:49,356
Jack. Jack Meyerwitz.

459
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,024
I'm an architect.

460
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:54,861
Nathan knew it was
Wrong to use Jack's name.

461
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:56,112
But in his mind,

462
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:58,531
he couldn't risk
his secret getting out.

463
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,284
Premature ejaculation
is a common problem.

464
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:04,746
Now, there's no reason
to be embarrassed about this.

465
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:08,249
It's a simple mechanical problem
that we can now fix.

466
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,585
Let me ask you.

467
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:13,296
Are you able
to achieve penetration

468
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:14,798
before ejaculation?

469
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,758
Some of the time.

470
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:18,134
Good.

471
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:19,469
That's good.

472
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:23,056
In those instances,
how long before you orgasm?

473
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,182
One minute?

474
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:25,767
Two?

475
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,227
Okay.

476
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,354
How would you like
to last an hour?

477
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,064
What about two or three?

478
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:34,317
Five minutes
would be unbelievable.

479
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,444
We've developed
a patented compound

480
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,446
that takes effect
almost immediately.

481
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,990
Jeez.

482
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,033
It opens up the veins...

483
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,159
Naah..

484
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,161
In the sponge tissue
of the penis,

485
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,497
the capora cavernosax

486
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,165
Keeps them open
and maintains an erection

487
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,208
for at least an hour,

488
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,210
allowing you to perform
without the fear

489
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:53,837
of ejaculation.

490
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,840
Now just... just think
of the hours of pleasure

491
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,592
you'll be able to give,
and receive, as a result.

492
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,136
For the first time,
you'll be able

493
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,429
to be with a woman

494
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,015
and feel fully confident
of your abilities.

495
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,350
That would be amazing.

496
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,643
Okay, I need you to stand up.

497
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,479
Salvador,
come in here please.

498
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,647
Who is Salvador?

499
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:13,773
Oh, he's my nurse.

500
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,358
You're gonna love him.

501
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,860
Full-dosage cartridge.

502
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:17,902
Very good.

503
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:19,487
- Is it a pill?
- No.

504
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,031
Now, I don't want you
to be worried.

505
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,198
Holy shit.

506
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,700
- It Won't hurt at all.
- Nope. Nah.

507
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,701
No, we don't have to.

508
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,202
Normal, very normal.

509
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:28,163
No.

510
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,289
Jesus Christ.

511
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,332
Okay.

512
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:31,624
Now...

513
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,543
You said something about being
an architect, huh?

514
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:35,211
What kind of architecture
do you do, Jack?

515
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:36,254
I do... Aah!

516
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,339
No.

517
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:38,465
I told you it Wouldn't hurt.

518
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:39,632
Oh, it kills.
That kills.

519
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:40,842
See how easy that was?

520
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:42,510
Oh. Ah.

521
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:44,804
Now, your erection
will come on rapidly

522
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,682
once the medication
takes effect.

523
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,392
It should subside
in about 15 minutes.

524
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,728
15 minutes...
are... are you sure?

525
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,313
Maybe 20, more or less.

526
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:54,773
You might feel some discomfort,

527
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:56,483
but that's a normal part
of the diagnostic.

528
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:57,984
Don't worry.
Very normal.

529
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:11,414
If had taken Joef
eight times

530
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,042
to pass the California bar.

531
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,252
So most people
wouldn't trust him

532
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,380
to handle their divorce...

533
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,422
Hey.

534
00:20:19,464 --> 00:20:20,715
Except for Mary...

535
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,092
Joel Meyerwitz.

536
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,343
His girlfriend.

537
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:24,886
I've been waiting
for you all morning.

538
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,179
I'm sorry.

539
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,181
You promised me you would
help me with my divorce.

540
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:29,974
I don't want to be married
to that man forever.

541
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,559
- I know, I know.
- I want to be with you.

542
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,644
- Oh.
- Okay?

543
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,021
Mmm.

544
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:36,106
Mmm.

545
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,232
You smell nice.

546
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,692
Thank you.

547
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,859
The judge is pissed.

548
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,902
Oh, God.

549
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:42,529
My car broke down again.

550
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,240
You have no business
driving a car like that,

551
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:46,866
and you know it.

552
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,118
Who do you think
you are anyway,

553
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,160
Johnnie Cochran?

554
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:55,333
Baby, what is it?

555
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,085
- Hmm?
- What's wrong with you?

556
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,420
Why you look sick?

557
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,587
No, I'm... I'm fine.

558
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:00,964
You need to take care
of yourself.

559
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,590
I know, with your help.

560
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,092
- Okay.
- Okay?

561
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,927
- What would you do without me?
- What would I do?

562
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:07,595
Come on, let's reschedule
this hearing.

563
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:08,722
Yes, officer.

564
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:13,810
Hey, you know what,

565
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,146
I just need to finish up
one piece of business,

566
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:19,065
and, uh, I'll be
right in with you.

567
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:20,108
One minute.

568
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:21,443
Okay.
You look cute today.

569
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,028
Oh.

570
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:24,612
Hurry up.

571
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,742
Joel Meyerwitz.

572
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:33,163
Mr. Meyerwitz, We represent
the Honduran Credit Association.

573
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:35,832
Let's go for a walk.

574
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,174
Okay, is this really
necessary, guys?

575
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,176
If We were gonna Whack you,
We Wouldn't do it here.

576
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:47,802
Okay, wait.

577
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:50,096
See, now the fact that you're
even mentioning whacking...

578
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,474
Your loan with the HCA is
substantially in the arrears.

579
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:53,600
Okay, okay.

580
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,185
Well, hold on a second.
Hold on.

581
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,770
We can work this out.

582
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:59,189
All right there's... there's
some kind of misunderstanding,

583
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,607
and I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

584
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:01,816
I'm just gonna call Felix and...

585
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:03,318
Felix is the one
that sent us.

586
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,653
We need to collect $12,000.

587
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:06,863
Are you serious?

588
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,032
I don't carry that kind of cash
around with me.

589
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:10,658
- You got a car?
- Yeah.

590
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,826
Give us the keys.

591
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:12,869
What? Are you crazy?

592
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,372
My car's Worth, like, 50 grand.

593
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,706
Keys, Mr. Meyerwitz.

594
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:17,999
Okay.

595
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,377
You know what,
I have a solution to this.

596
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,420
I know how to take care
of this situation.

597
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:23,672
Okay, guys?

598
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:27,133
We are simply going to talk
to my father.

599
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:31,221
Yeah, We're having dinner
tonight downtown at the Madison.

600
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,556
Come on by,
and he will write you a check.

601
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,684
- No checks.
- No, no, no.

602
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:38,061
You don't understand.
My father is Henry Meyerwitz.

603
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,191
Real estate guy.

604
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:45,068
Why don't you fix me
and Wizdom up

605
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,319
with a bottle of champagne too?

606
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,362
Yes.

607
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:49,114
Champagne. Surf and turf.

608
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,323
Anything you want.

609
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:52,367
He'll have an open tab,
so just go crazy.

610
00:22:57,122 --> 00:22:58,915
All right, guys.

611
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:01,459
Hey, is that, uh...
Wizdom is your real name?

612
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,961
It's Wizdom with a Z.

613
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,045
With a Z?

614
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:05,714
Is that on
your birth certificate?

615
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:07,424
Because you can get that
legally changed.

616
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:09,175
I could take care of that,
change it to an S.

617
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,385
Are you playing with me?

618
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:13,638
I... I would never play
with you, Wizdom..

619
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,767
And Z is...
it's perfectly fine.

620
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,144
Okay.

621
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:22,981
All right, we'll see you
tonight, guys.

622
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,535
Ma, it's me.

623
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:37,203
Always a pain
in the ass,

624
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:38,830
Cheri's mother dreamed
of the day

625
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,373
her daughter
would finally run away.

626
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:42,292
Ma!

627
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:45,128
But she never did.

628
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:49,591
Mom!

629
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:52,594
In the back.

630
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:55,972
Right.

631
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:03,313
Your son is a dead man.

632
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:06,149
I swear to God,
the next time I see Nathan,

633
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:07,442
I'm gonna kill him.

634
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,735
Hi, Cheri.

635
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:10,528
Hello, princess.

636
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,113
You look beautiful.

637
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,281
Hi, Ted.

638
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,783
Why are you making him
do that?

639
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:17,452
He's practically blind.

640
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:23,333
Is that supposed to be that?

641
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,584
Wow.

642
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:25,794
All right.

643
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:26,878
Come. Help your mother.

644
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,962
Let's go.

645
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,506
Great.

646
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,007
Ugh.

647
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,846
Peep World
is everywhere I look.

648
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:38,723
They're shooting
right outside my apartment.

649
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:40,058
Did you know that?

650
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,227
You don't think Nate did that
on purpose?

651
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,645
I doubt it.

652
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,146
Hey, you want to help me
with the socks?

653
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:47,023
No, I don't want
to help you with the socks.

654
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:50,610
I didn't come here
to fucking fold laundry, Mom!

655
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:52,028
I haven't been able
to eat anything

656
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,405
since this book came out.

657
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:54,948
Well, it doesn't show.

658
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:57,325
Oh, thank you so much.

659
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:00,245
You know I'm going through
a really painful time,

660
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:02,205
and you're acting like
you don't give a shit.

661
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,790
It's just a book.

662
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,250
And a movie.

663
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,210
Still, it doesn't matter.

664
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,212
It does matter.

665
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:12,173
I need you to sign this.

666
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:13,800
No.

667
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:17,303
I am not gonna help you
sue your brother.

668
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:19,431
For the sake of the family,

669
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:21,683
would you just give up
your lawsuit?

670
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,643
I will not.

671
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:41,828
It's gonna be okay.

672
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:44,539
I disagree.

673
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,251
Half the stuff in that book
Nate made up.

674
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,586
This is a work of fiction.

675
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:53,131
I have lost friends
over this book, mother.

676
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,467
People look at me now,
and they just...

677
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:57,010
they think I'm a bitch.

678
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:04,392
Oh, you agree.

679
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:07,729
I'm outta here.

680
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,858
Ooh. Wow.

681
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:13,777
Somebody's excited
for Daddy's dinner tonight

682
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:15,153
He's bringing
his new girlfriend.

683
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,196
Did he tell you?

684
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:17,739
No.

685
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:21,284
I bet she's really young
and pretty.

686
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,709
Ah.

687
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,461
Aah.

688
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:34,339
Salvador.

689
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:36,091
Ah.

690
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,467
Salvador.

691
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:40,637
Normal.

692
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,721
Very normal.

693
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:43,264
But, uh, it's really aching.

694
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:44,432
It's really throbbing.

695
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,560
Whoa? What is whoa?
What does whoa mean?

696
00:26:47,602 --> 00:26:49,270
Uh, could you please
lift your gown for me?

697
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,313
Come on.

698
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,481
Please.

699
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:56,736
Salvador, come take
a look at this.

700
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,071
No. Don't...

701
00:26:58,113 --> 00:26:59,197
See?

702
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:02,200
The level of tumescence
is off the charts.

703
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:03,993
Look. See the expressiveness
in the veins?

704
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,079
Prominence of the head?

705
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:07,789
What level dosage
did you give me?

706
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:08,957
- You said full.
- I did?

707
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,543
Yes, you did.

708
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:14,004
Well, in rare cases,
the erection will not dissipate.

709
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:16,464
If your penis stays erect
for more than eight hours...

710
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,466
Eight hours?
Are you kidding?

711
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,969
Your penis will need to be
drained before gangrene sets in.

712
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,554
Gangrene?
Perfect.

713
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:23,972
Fantastic.

714
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:26,141
Jack, Relax.
Calm down, okay?

715
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:27,475
Relax?
You know what?

716
00:27:27,475 --> 00:27:29,602
Let me drain your penis
and see how calm you'd be.

717
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:30,979
Listen.
You're going to be fine.

718
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:33,148
Just call your girlfriend,
explain what happened here,

719
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,691
go home, and get busy.

720
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,651
And don't stop.
Don't wait for an orgasm.

721
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:39,154
Just keep going until
your erection subsides

722
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:42,032
I don't have a girlfriend.

723
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,509
I am so sorry.

724
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,136
I'm sure he'll be here
any minute.

725
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,804
He doesn't show up
in five minutes,

726
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,973
I'll have to cancel.

727
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:08,683
Writers.

728
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,852
Tell me about it.

729
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:13,730
Hey.

730
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,065
Nathan, you're late.

731
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:17,400
What's wrong?
You sick?

732
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,236
Nathan talk to me.
What's wrong?

733
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,404
Oh, my God.
What is it?

734
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:22,697
- It's an erection.
- What?

735
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:24,032
I need to be drained.

736
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:26,034
I'll explain later.

737
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,579
You're gonna be all right?

738
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,122
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

739
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:33,166
- You walking okay?
- Yeah, it hurts.

740
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:38,004
A book came out last year,

741
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:44,010
a brutally honest portrayal
of a dysfunctional family

742
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,431
on the brink of implosion.

743
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:51,851
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a great honor

744
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:56,106
to present to you the new voice
of a generation,

745
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,108
Nathan Meyerwitz.

746
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:06,741
Nathan.

747
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,043
Thank you.

748
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:37,439
"The far side of 30

Shit.

753
00:29:48,158 --> 00:29:49,784
Mother...

754
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,544
Oh.

There it is!

759
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,832
Okay. I'm fine.

760
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:38,958
No.

761
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,001
No, I'm not fine.

762
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:42,462
Oh.

763
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,172
God damn.

764
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:12,158
Um...

765
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:15,453
We're leaving.

766
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,414
Sorry, Jack.

767
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:19,749
We have bills to pay.

768
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,753
Wow.

769
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:28,425
I appreciate that you hung in
there as long as you did.

770
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:34,389
Thank you.

771
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:37,308
Thank you.

772
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,855
Thank you
for all your hard work.

773
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,398
I'll pay you what I owe you.

774
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:45,358
I promise.

775
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:54,200
Take care of yourself, Jack.

776
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:18,350
Hello?

777
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:19,517
Mister Meyerwitz?

778
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,311
I'm calling to confirm
your reservation

779
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:22,354
at the Madison tonight.

780
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:24,064
12 people at 8:00.

781
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:25,857
Yep. We'll be there.

782
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:26,941
I think your father will be

783
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:28,943
very happy with
your menu choices,

784
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:31,363
uh, Dom Pérignon,
Chateau Lafite,

785
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:32,655
Beluga caviar.

786
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,783
I would be remiss, however,
if I did not inform you

787
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,743
that the market price
of the stone crab legs

788
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:38,203
have gone up to $60 a pound.

789
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:39,496
Do you still want them?

790
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:42,123
Your father does love them.

791
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,333
Oh, yes.

792
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,417
Wonderful.

793
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,460
We will see you tonight.

794
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,629
Good-bye.

795
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,594
Do you think he'll like it?

796
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,596
Of course he will.

797
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,682
All dads like
what their sons get them.

798
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,642
You don't know my father.

799
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:03,395
Mm. When are you gonna wash
this truck?

800
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:05,063
It's dirty.

801
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,315
Oh.

802
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:09,192
Thank you.

803
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:10,860
You know what I love about you?

804
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:12,153
My oar?

805
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:14,030
Ha! Besides that.

806
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,366
You are so sweet

807
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,576
and so thoughtful.

808
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:21,371
My husband never opened
the door for me.

809
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,665
He never listened to me.

810
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,084
Sorry, what were you saying?

811
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:29,212
Get in the car.

812
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,008
Almost here.

813
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:34,634
I know.

814
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:37,262
I can't believe I'm finally
gonna see your apartment.

815
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,181
Okay.

816
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:41,182
Here we go.

817
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:42,308
Yay.

818
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:44,019
Ooh, God.

819
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:48,940
You live here?

820
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:51,234
Well, it's just temporary,

821
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:53,319
till I, uh, move.

822
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,362
Yeah.

823
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:55,363
Okay.

824
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:00,035
You Wouldn't make it one day
in the army.

825
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:03,288
How about some wine?

826
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,331
Sure.

827
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:05,707
Okay.

828
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:10,962
Okay, baby,
this place is nasty.

829
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,589
It's... ew.

830
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:14,924
No, no. No, no.

831
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:15,967
Don't do that.
That's...

832
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:17,010
No, it's pine.

833
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,178
Oh, I'm sorry.
Lilac Valley.

834
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,387
Uh, yeah.

835
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,556
Um...

836
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:24,267
You could use order
in your life.

837
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,560
You need some...

838
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,770
discipline.

839
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,688
Yes, I know.
You're right.

840
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,940
You're absolutely right.

841
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:32,734
To order and discipline
in my life.

842
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:35,236
Better yet,
to a workin progress.

843
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:36,780
Work in progress.

844
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:37,822
Cheers.

845
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:42,994
EW.

846
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:46,956
Hey, Mary, could I talk to you
about something?

847
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,458
Yeah, sure.

848
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:58,635
Oh, baby, what is it?

849
00:34:58,677 --> 00:34:59,678
What's bothering you?

850
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,929
Just tell me.

851
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:07,602
I just-
I need to ask you.

852
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:09,104
Am I anything like Jason
from the book?

853
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,146
No.

854
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:11,648
You know, all needy
and everything?

855
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:13,066
No. No, way.

856
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,318
Do you think
that I'm a loser?

857
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,153
No.

858
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,488
Why would you think that?

859
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,739
Who thinks that of you, Joel?

860
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:20,907
Who said that?

861
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:21,991
My father.

862
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,787
My Whole family.

863
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:27,330
Pretty much everyone I know.

864
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,623
Let me tell you something.

865
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:31,751
I don't hang out
with losers, okay?

866
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:33,211
And you know what,
fuck them.

867
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:35,046
You don't even have to go
to that dinner tonight

868
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,131
if you don't want to.

869
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,632
Yeah, I do.

870
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:39,551
I actually really do.

871
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:52,939
Uh, Kimmy?

872
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:54,357
Kimmy out.

873
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:56,693
She leave early today,
go to daughter's recital.

874
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:57,986
Oh, no.

875
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:58,987
Oh, no, no.
No worry.

876
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:00,155
No worry.

877
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,531
Lily take care of you.

878
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,450
She good too. Lily.

879
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:04,993
Oh, um, sit down.
Sit down.

880
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:06,578
This is mine.

881
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:14,836
I just usually have Kimmy.

882
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,212
Yeah, she's very good, so...

883
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,547
Oh. Well, Kimmy good.

884
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,007
Lily better.

885
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:20,008
Here.

886
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,426
You have a...

887
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:23,011
I need a very good pedicure.

888
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:25,347
I am wearing
open-toed shoes tonight,

889
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:27,390
and I need to be
the prettiest girl in the room.

890
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,641
So...

891
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,810
Aw, you go out
with your husband?

892
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,479
No.

893
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,688
With your fiancé?

894
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,857
- No my...
- The boyfriend?

895
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:38,693
No. Uh, my father.

896
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:40,487
Oh, you daddy's girl?

897
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:41,529
- Uh-huh.

898
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:42,906
Oh, that's so nice.

899
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:44,616
I don't remember my father.

900
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:46,201
He died.

901
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:49,079
My father and I are,
uh, very close.

902
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,580
We, um...

903
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:52,040
We're very close.

904
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,876
We're, uh...

905
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:59,130
basically best friends.

906
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,092
Like BFS.

907
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,414
Thank you for calling JMA.

908
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:34,290
Our office is currently closed.

909
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:08,700
Agh..

910
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,900
May I help you?

911
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,277
No, thank you.

912
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:38,999
Jack?

913
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:41,876
Spread your legs.

914
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,628
Jack?

915
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:47,090
Jack?

916
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,341
What are you doing?

917
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:49,676
My husbands in here.

918
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:51,219
Madam, this is a place
of business.

919
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:53,096
These gentlemen have a right
to their privacy.

920
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:55,432
Jack, I know you're in there.
I saw you Walk in the building.

921
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,100
Get the fuck out of here,
you crazy bitch!

922
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:58,435
Jack?

923
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:00,520
You're going to have a brawl,
please take it outside.

924
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:01,813
Jack! Jack!

925
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,481
Gentlemen, we're having
an emergency.

926
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:05,400
The shop is closed.
Jack!

927
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,735
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Jack!

928
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:08,903
- Sorry, sir.
Leave. Good-bye, sir.

929
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:10,030
Jack?

930
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,823
Please come back again, sir.

931
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,283
Sir, I'm very sorry.
Madam!

932
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,827
- Jack!
- Madam, one second please!

933
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:18,413
Madam, please.

934
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:27,672
Sir.

935
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:29,215
The shop is closed.

936
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:31,926
I ask you to leave
your booth now.

937
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,472
I will count to three.

938
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:37,974
One, two...

939
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:43,063
Ugh.

940
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:49,402
Laura!

941
00:40:56,868 --> 00:40:58,828
Laura, wait!

942
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:02,332
Where are you going?

943
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,627
We have to talk about this!

944
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:12,676
Hello?

945
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,010
Jack, it's Cheri.

946
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:15,970
And I need you to tell Nathan
that he cannot...

947
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,473
Shut up!

948
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:59,639
Laura!

949
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:04,519
Let me in.

950
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,525
This is ridiculous.

951
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:12,485
Let me in.
We have to talk.

952
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:16,156
I can't believe I found you
at that disgusting place,

953
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,658
inside one of those booths,
masturbating.

954
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,410
I don't jerk off in there.

955
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:28,043
I mean, that is worse
than cheating on me!

956
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,962
At least that's normal
if not typical.

957
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:33,423
But this...

958
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:35,925
This is... this is just...

959
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,218
This is ridiculous.

960
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,386
Honey, let me in.

961
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:39,804
I can't talk to you like this.

962
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:41,806
You said that Nate
made it all up!

963
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,604
How are you?

964
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:59,449
Are you gonna
tell me the truth?

965
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,451
Yes.

966
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:09,501
I'm waiting.

967
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:15,757
Everything in Peep World...

968
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:17,926
it's all true, all of it.

969
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:24,724
I needed to talk to somebody.

970
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:26,643
I confided in Nathan.

971
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:28,478
I didn't know he was gonna
put it in his book.

972
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,024
I didn't even know
what he was writing about.

973
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,903
When it came out, I was...

974
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,825
I was embarrassed.

975
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,702
It was humiliating.

976
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:47,080
I lied.

977
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:09,436
Laura.

978
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:11,187
What do you watch in there?

979
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:12,439
The usual.

980
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:13,481
What is that?

981
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:14,941
It's just the usual.

982
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,276
Laura, what's the point
of that?

983
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:17,485
How often?

984
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:18,778
Now and then.

985
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,821
How often?

986
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:21,197
- Now and then?
- What? Once a Week?

987
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:22,490
Twice a day?
What?

988
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,284
Stop it, will you?
You don't...

989
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:28,163
You just... you don't know
what it's like, Laura.

990
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:29,164
No, I don't..

991
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:30,498
I'm fucking tired.
Okay?

992
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:32,375
Of what?

993
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:39,382
Of always having to be
the good one.

994
00:44:40,884 --> 00:44:42,218
The good son.

995
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,471
The good brother.

996
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,473
I'm sick of all
the fucking responsibility.

997
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:48,099
I hate it.

998
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,061
Well, um, that's
kind of too bad, Jack,

999
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:52,604
because you're gonna have

1000
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:55,315
a lot more responsibility
in seven weeks.

1001
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:57,359
I know.

1002
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,576
That's what I'm afraid of.

1003
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,328
What if I do to our son
what my father did to me?

1004
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,038
Then he'll hate you,

1005
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,831
and every year, he'll hate
having to throw you

1006
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:13,708
a birthday party.

1007
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:24,844
I'm not going tonight.

1008
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:28,098
Laura.

1009
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:30,100
I'm sorry.

1010
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:33,603
I lied to you.
I'm an idiot.

1011
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:34,979
I'm sorry.

1012
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,737
Please.

1013
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:46,658
Fine.

1014
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,913
I'll be there with you tonight,
but I won't be there for you.

1015
00:45:58,253 --> 00:45:59,254
Ah, ah.

1016
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:00,797
Ah.

1017
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:05,593
I can't do this.

1018
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:07,721
Okay, it says here if
Pseudoephedrine doesn't work,

1019
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:09,389
intense, sustained
physical activity

1020
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:11,307
is the best way
of dealing with this.

1021
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,935
You think it's working?

1022
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:15,311
Not yet.

1023
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:16,896
Great.

1024
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:19,524
This is it.
This is it.

1025
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:22,986
God is punishing me
for what I did to my family.

1026
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,738
I can't go to my dad's party
like this.

1027
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,281
I am fucked.

1028
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:27,574
Yeah. You are.

1029
00:46:27,615 --> 00:46:29,242
You know, a little sympathy
would be nice.

1030
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:30,827
Well, the world
isn't always polite.

1031
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:32,495
Or didn't they teach you that
at Berkeley?

1032
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:34,497
Fine. Fine.

1033
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:36,333
I... I deserve that, okay?

1034
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:38,209
And I'm sorry the way I yelled
at you in the limo.

1035
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:39,294
Okay?

1036
00:46:39,336 --> 00:46:41,463
Thank you.

1037
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,886
Ah, ah.

1038
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,680
Oh, my God,
my dick hurts.

1039
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:53,600
Why would you do something
so drastic?

1040
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,394
Because for once, I wanted
to know what it's like

1041
00:46:56,436 --> 00:46:59,481
to be with a woman and not have
to apologize afterwards.

1042
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:05,278
Well, plenty of guys have
premature ejaculation problems.

1043
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,821
When they're 14.

1044
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:09,616
I'm 29, relatively well-known.
It is embarrassing.

1045
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:11,534
Okay, well speaking
as a woman,

1046
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:14,621
there's a lot more to a guy
than his sexual performance.

1047
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:16,122
Okay?

1048
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:17,540
There's his heart,

1049
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,833
his kindness,
his sensitivity.

1050
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,960
Ah, I'm screwed there too,
so...

1051
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,464
You're really not
such a bad guy.

1052
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:27,884
I mean you're really full
of yourself, but...

1053
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:30,345
I mean, you're
an incredible writer.

1054
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:33,765
Thank you, Meg.

1055
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:36,309
With a dysfunctional penis.

1056
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:46,486
Ugh.

1057
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,571
Ugh.

1058
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:50,782
All right,
we tried the hot bath.

1059
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:52,033
It did not work.

1060
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:54,244
We tried running in place.

1061
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:55,829
Stupid.
I looked like an idiot.

1062
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:59,874
There is...

1063
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:03,628
one more thing...

1064
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,673
that we haven't
quite tried yet.

1065
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:14,806
You and l... could...

1066
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:17,934
Okay, this is way,
way beyond the call of duty.

1067
00:48:17,976 --> 00:48:19,102
I know.

1068
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:25,025
Just relax.

1069
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:27,444
We have two hours
before your dad's dinner.

1070
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:15,760
It's gonna be okay.

1071
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:17,804
It's gonna be okay.

1072
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,230
Okay, there he is.

1073
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,565
Hey, Jack.

1074
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:30,358
All right.

1075
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:31,526
Good to see you,
sweetheart.

1076
00:50:31,568 --> 00:50:32,902
You too, Mom.

1077
00:50:32,944 --> 00:50:34,904
Hey, how late do you think
that Dad's gonna arrive?

1078
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:36,031
The over under's 8:48.

1079
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:37,323
Uh, we'll see.

1080
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:38,867
Guess who else
is fashionably late,

1081
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,410
our brother Nathan.

1082
00:50:40,452 --> 00:50:41,911
Fucking asshole.

1083
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:43,204
Everything okay with you two?

1084
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:46,750
Jack, what did you do?

1085
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,084
Nothing.

1086
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:49,377
I'm gonna get a drink.

1087
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:52,339
Why are you
always blaming him?

1088
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,007
Because he does things, Mommy.

1089
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,342
Like what?

1090
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:56,593
Exactly.

1091
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:58,928
Not tonight.
Not tonight, Cheri.

1092
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:07,354
Could I get
a double scotch, neat?

1093
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,147
Why don't you make it
a club soda?

1094
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:12,192
If I can't drink through this,
neither can you.

1095
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:17,322
So how many more weeks
of freedom you guys have?

1096
00:51:17,364 --> 00:51:18,365
Uh... seven..

1097
00:51:18,406 --> 00:51:19,616
Mazel tov..

1098
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:21,618
Do you need
receiving blankets?

1099
00:51:21,618 --> 00:51:23,536
I saw these really fun,

1100
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:26,665
Austrian, really?

1101
00:51:26,706 --> 00:51:27,957
Austria's actually

1102
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,377
really famous
for their children's clothes.

1103
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:31,419
- Huh.
- And Hitler.

1104
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:32,545
He was German.

1105
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:33,713
Austrian.

1106
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:34,923
Are you serious?
He's German.

1107
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:36,174
He was born
in Austria, Cheri.

1108
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:37,634
Look it up.

1109
00:51:37,676 --> 00:51:39,844
Well, they're famous
for children's clothes as well.

1110
00:51:39,886 --> 00:51:41,388
Beef skewer?

1111
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:42,889
I can't eat that;
I'm a vegetarian.

1112
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:44,432
You know,
Hitler was a vegetarian.

1113
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:46,601
Jack, if I have to hear
one more thing about Hitler,

1114
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,978
I am gonna lose it.

1115
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:10,917
It's gone.

1116
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:12,127
It's gone.

1117
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:13,420
It's gone.
Did you hear me?

1118
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:14,713
That's... that's good.

1119
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:15,797
Calm down.

1120
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,549
That was amazing.

1121
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,968
Did you feel something?
'Cause I totally felt something.

1122
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:21,386
It was just sex, Nathan.

1123
00:52:21,428 --> 00:52:22,971
It's not the end of the world.

1124
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:24,931
Yeah, but it was great sex.

1125
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:27,267
It was fine.
You did very well.

1126
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:31,229
You were great too.

1127
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:35,025
Can I ask you another favor?

1128
00:52:35,025 --> 00:52:36,526
Don't ever tell anyone
about this?

1129
00:52:36,526 --> 00:52:37,652
Besides that.

1130
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:43,324
I have to see
my family tonight.

1131
00:52:43,324 --> 00:52:47,037
It would be a lot easier
if I had someone in my corner.

1132
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:49,873
Well, why do you need someone
in your corner?

1133
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:57,922
Because everything I wrote
in Peep World is true.

1134
00:52:57,964 --> 00:53:00,925
Oh, Nathan.

1135
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:02,510
Even the part about your sister

1136
00:53:02,552 --> 00:53:07,015
sleeping with the entire cast
of Tony N' Tina's Wedding?

1137
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,892
She really loved that show.

1138
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:16,524
Well, hey, at least your dad
comes off looking okay.

1139
00:53:18,068 --> 00:53:20,320
Yeah, that's the only thing
I lied about.

1140
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:23,239
People are always telling me
how great of a man he was.

1141
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:25,492
Thought maybe if I wrote him
that way,

1142
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:27,535
I could finally see it.

1143
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:31,790
What time is it?

1144
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:33,708
I don't know.

1145
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:34,876
- Holy shit.
- What?

1146
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:35,919
- It's 8:15.
- Okay.

1147
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,253
- Okay, the party started
at 8:00.

1148
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:38,755
Are you gonna come?

1149
00:53:38,755 --> 00:53:40,757
Yeah, just don't tell anyone
I'm your girlfriend.

1150
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:42,133
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll ease into it.

1151
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:44,052
No, no. Don't tell anyone
I'm your girlfriend.

1152
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:45,887
Right, right.
We'll talk about it in the car.

1153
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:49,808
So have you decided
on a name yet?

1154
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:53,144
Um, not yet.

1155
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:54,646
Abraham's a good name.

1156
00:53:54,688 --> 00:53:57,440
Abraham
is a strong Jewish name.

1157
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,860
I have a Sudanese friend,

1158
00:54:00,902 --> 00:54:02,570
and his brother
is named Abraham.

1159
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,239
And he lost him.

1160
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,409
He got out in the desert
and eaten by... shot.

1161
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:13,456
Excuse me a second.

1162
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:17,794
Right here, guys.
They're with me.

1163
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:19,295
What's up man?
You have our money?

1164
00:54:19,295 --> 00:54:21,214
Yeah, my dad's not here yet,
but just come with me.

1165
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:23,216
Have a seat at the bar, okay?
I'll set you up.

1166
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:25,802
Hey anything they want,
on our tab, all right?

1167
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:27,846
Just make yourselves
comfortable.

1168
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:29,597
Let me get a shot of tequila.

1169
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,266
Champagne.

1170
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:33,143
Okay.

1171
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:34,769
Good? You're good?

1172
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:37,063
I was brought up a Jew
in a Jewish home

1173
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,107
with very strict
Jewish traditional...

1174
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:40,650
Jesus fucking Christ.

1175
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:44,112
I can't believe he had the nerve
to show his face here.

1176
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:45,780
Unbelievable.

1177
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,781
Cheri, be nice.

1178
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:47,991
Jack, talk to her.

1179
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:49,034
What am I gonna say?

1180
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:50,076
Hello, Nathan.

1181
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,327
Hey, how is everybody?

1182
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:52,871
Dad's not here yet?
No.

1183
00:54:52,912 --> 00:54:54,039
Hi, I'm Meg.

1184
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,290
You look beautiful.

1185
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,083
- Ted.
- Hi.

1186
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,835
Cheri.

1187
00:55:00,754 --> 00:55:02,797
Who are you?

1188
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:03,965
Uh, Meg.

1189
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:06,134
I'm doing, um,
PR for his book.

1190
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,848
So what did we interrupt?

1191
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:13,183
Ephraim was just explaining

1192
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:15,226
the whole
Jews for Jesus thing.

1193
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,270
I was on a wrong path.

1194
00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:18,480
Very scary.

1195
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,398
You know what,
don't say anything else, honey.

1196
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,650
You might end up as a character
in Nathan's next book.

1197
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,820
Hey, Jack.
Do me a favor?

1198
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:28,073
Want to remind Cheri that
We're not permitted to speak

1199
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:29,866
during the discovery phase
of the lawsuit.

1200
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:31,659
Come on, everybody,
just relax.

1201
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:33,036
We're supposed to have
a good time.

1202
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:34,621
This is supposed to be
a happy occasion.

1203
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:36,331
I'd have a good time
if Nathan wasn't here.

1204
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:37,499
Cheri, do you want me
to leave?

1205
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,541
- Yep.
- Fine, I'm gone.

1206
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:39,584
- Okay.
- Take care.

1207
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:40,627
Bye.

1208
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:42,045
Nobody wants you
to leave Nathan.

1209
00:55:42,045 --> 00:55:43,546
No, no, no. I do.
I want him to leave.

1210
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:45,215
And I can't believe
you're defending him.

1211
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:46,591
Let me tell you something, Jack.

1212
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,551
You don't come off so great
in the book either.

1213
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:51,346
No wonder Laura is miserable.

1214
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:56,226
Go fuck yourself, Cheri.

1215
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:57,727
Go fuck yourself.

1216
00:55:57,769 --> 00:55:58,853
That's original.

1217
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,897
You're original.

1218
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:02,774
Wow.

1219
00:56:02,816 --> 00:56:04,693
All this over a book?

1220
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:08,571
I got cousins that shot
each other that got over it.

1221
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:47,819
I am starving.

1222
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:49,863
If he doesn't get here
in the next five minutes,

1223
00:56:49,904 --> 00:56:51,114
I'm gonna eat Ted.

1224
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:07,547
Ah.

1225
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:09,758
Henry Meyerwitz
Walked into every building

1226
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:11,259
like he owned it.

1227
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:13,345
Let them know who you are,

1228
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:15,722
so you can put them
in their place.

1229
00:57:15,722 --> 00:57:16,890
He did that in business.

1230
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:18,141
He's here.

1231
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:19,559
He did that with family.

1232
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:20,602
Daddy!

1233
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:24,564
Daddy!

1234
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:26,107
Happy birthday.

1235
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:27,817
- Uh-huh.
How are you, sweetie?

1236
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,444
Hey, Dad.
We're right up here.

1237
00:57:29,444 --> 00:57:30,653
Up there, huh?

1238
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:32,322
It's too close
to the bathroom, Jack.

1239
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,657
Dad, We're not moving.

1240
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:36,701
Hey, how is everybody?

1241
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:37,869
Hi.

1242
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:39,079
Hey, Dad.

1243
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,121
Nice to meet you.

1244
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:41,206
Look at that tummy.

1245
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:42,499
Whoa.

1246
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,541
Glad to see you.

1247
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:44,584
Yeah.

1248
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:47,962
Nice.

1249
00:57:48,004 --> 00:57:49,381
Is this your girlfriend?
Look at...

1250
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:50,423
Yeah, yeah it is.

1251
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:51,633
No, my name's Meg.
Hi.

1252
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:52,926
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Henry.

1253
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:54,094
Nice to meet you.

1254
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,721
Oh, Marilyn.
Aren't you gorgeous?

1255
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:57,764
Hey, Ted.

1256
00:57:57,764 --> 00:57:59,516
Hey, Joel.

1257
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:00,558
Hi.

1258
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,685
Hi. Good.

1259
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:03,186
How are you?

1260
00:58:03,228 --> 00:58:04,229
This is Mary.

1261
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,605
Hi, how are you?

1262
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:06,856
She's...my girlfriend.

1263
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:09,109
So...hi.

1264
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,151
This is Amy!

1265
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:11,319
Everybody.

1266
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:12,320
Amy... Amy Harrison?

1267
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:13,613
Yes.

1268
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,323
Amy Harrison?
Guys, she is in the movie.

1269
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:16,866
She plays Teri in the movie.

1270
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:17,909
Oh, Teri.

1271
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:19,160
Oh, she's my sister.

1272
00:58:19,202 --> 00:58:21,246
Yeah, she plays your sister.

1273
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:24,332
You must be Nathan.

1274
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:27,752
My dad is fucking the actress
that plays his daughter?

1275
00:58:27,794 --> 00:58:29,546
That's what it looks like.

1276
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:31,673
So I'm actually something
of a Writer myself.

1277
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:33,008
I would really love

1278
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:34,676
to pick your brain
about the process.

1279
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,302
It would be my pleasure.

1280
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:38,722
That's the best thing
about writing.

1281
00:58:38,763 --> 00:58:40,682
It's something you can
develop overtime,

1282
00:58:40,682 --> 00:58:41,891
and with the right mentor...

1283
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:44,019
Excuse me, mentor.

1284
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,562
Would you pass the bread,
please?

1285
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:55,113
That was sick.

1286
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:57,032
Oh, wow.

1287
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:00,869
You're Teri Markowitz.

1288
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:01,995
Uh, yeah.

1289
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:03,204
Oh.

1290
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:05,081
Teri's based on me.

1291
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:07,334
Hmm.

1292
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:10,837
Of course
a very distorted version

1293
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:13,631
that says a lot more about
the author and his problems

1294
00:59:13,673 --> 00:59:16,801
than it does about me,
but it's still my life,

1295
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:18,303
thus the lawsuit.

1296
00:59:18,345 --> 00:59:19,346
So...

1297
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:20,638
Oh, oh.

1298
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,349
Did daddy tell you
I'm an actress?

1299
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:24,893
Ha.

1300
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,061
Oh, no.

1301
00:59:26,102 --> 00:59:27,228
I'm studying with Anton.

1302
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,313
- Anton.
- Pitzelhoffen

1303
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:29,356
Pitzelhoffen

1304
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:30,857
- Do you know Anton?
- No.

1305
00:59:30,857 --> 00:59:32,776
No one knows who Anton is.

1306
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:34,652
I have to say, I just...

1307
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,279
I didn't imagine imagine you for
this part.

1308
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:37,322
Like, I just...

1309
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:38,448
Oh yeah?

1310
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,866
That's not what
I pictured at all.

1311
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:40,992
It's weird.

1312
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:42,535
Did you imagine...

1313
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:43,745
Nobody specific.

1314
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:45,413
I just, um...

1315
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:46,414
I guess..

1316
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:47,707
someone famous.

1317
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:49,084
- Nice, nice.
- Cheri.

1318
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,086
More known.

1319
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,921
I wanted you
to have this, so...

1320
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:54,047
happy birthday.

1321
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,548
What is that?
Thank you, Joel.

1322
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,092
And I was hoping...
a little bit later,

1323
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:58,677
I needed to speak
to you about something.

1324
00:59:58,718 --> 00:59:59,803
Hey, we said no presents.

1325
00:59:59,844 --> 01:00:01,262
There are not supposed
to be gifts.

1326
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:02,806
The whole deal is,
you come to the dinner

1327
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:04,391
and there are no presents...
Jack, right?

1328
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:06,434
I paid for the party.

1329
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:07,727
Oh, "I'm paying
for the party."

1330
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:09,104
Good point.

1331
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm sorry not all of us
can be rich architects.

1332
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,109
- Look at that face.
- It's just a picture.

1333
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,485
Absolutely unbelievable.

1334
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:18,321
All the potential you had
back then, Joel.

1335
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:21,908
It was amazing.

1336
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:23,618
- Mr. Meyerwitz.
- Yeah?

1337
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,578
Some people are
just late bloomers.

1338
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,706
And so?
What is that supposed to mean?

1339
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:29,124
Don't be so hard on him.

1340
01:00:29,124 --> 01:00:31,001
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1341
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,836
Dad, I really need to speak
to you about this.

1342
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:34,045
Okay, Joel.

1343
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:36,089
If it's that important.

1344
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:40,760
Thank you.

1345
01:00:40,802 --> 01:00:42,971
Aw, we said no presents.

1346
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:44,055
Hey.

1347
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:45,432
Okay.

1348
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:48,309
Well, Dad,
you see, there's this, um...

1349
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,646
I'm waiting, Joel.

1350
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:00,030
Joel, spit it out.

1351
01:01:06,953 --> 01:01:08,538
Do you have something
to say to me or not?

1352
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,123
I want to go back to the table.

1353
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,002
Where can I buy shoes
like that?

1354
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:17,672
You've got to be kidding me.

1355
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:19,841
That's what you... that's what
you dragged me here for?

1356
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:20,967
Yeah.

1357
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:22,510
They're too expensive
for you, kiddo..

1358
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:23,678
That's what I thought.

1359
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,639
Oh, boy.

1360
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:35,899
Oh, I am going to miss
that car.

1361
01:01:35,899 --> 01:01:37,025
Okay.
So how is everybody?

1362
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:39,569
This is a great dinner.

1363
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:41,946
Look, I know that this
is a celebration for me...

1364
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:43,365
I love you.

1365
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:45,492
For my 70th birthday,
and I really appreciate it,

1366
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:47,827
but at this point, I just want
to make a toast.

1367
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:51,665
To my fabulous son Nate,

1368
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:52,999
And the great success
he's having

1369
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,250
with his book, Peep World.

1370
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:55,877
Congratulations, Nate.

1371
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:57,045
You did it, kid.

1372
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:58,797
Thanks, Dad.

1373
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:01,800
Oh, pardon me if I don't toast
to a man who's ruined my life.

1374
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:03,051
And I don't know how
any of you...

1375
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:04,260
I ruined your life?

1376
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,262
And what did I do?
Did I make you more unemployed?

1377
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:07,722
More dysfunctional?
More fucked up?

1378
01:02:07,722 --> 01:02:09,724
You stabbed us all
in the back, you motherfucker.

1379
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:10,975
You're a fucking bitch, okay?

1380
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:12,227
You honestly have wasted

1381
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:14,145
your entire life
being an asshole.

1382
01:02:14,187 --> 01:02:15,480
Look at yourself
in the mirror.

1383
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:17,482
You look like a fucked-up
version of Amy Winehouse..

1384
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:18,733
Nate!
Cheri!

1385
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:20,735
Just save your drama
for the stage,

1386
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:22,112
where you don't get paid.

1387
01:02:22,112 --> 01:02:23,822
And you stop laughing.
It's not funny.

1388
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:25,949
I want to tell you
something, Nate.

1389
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,785
I want you to be proud
of yourself.

1390
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:30,370
When you're successful,

1391
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:32,205
there are always people
who will tear you down.

1392
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:33,289
That's what they do.

1393
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,083
It's something
that your brothers

1394
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,710
and your sister
Wouldn't understand.

1395
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:38,420
Thanks, Dad.

1396
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:40,505
Everybody at the firm tells me
it's a hell of a book.

1397
01:02:40,547 --> 01:02:41,548
What did you think?

1398
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:43,758
I haven't read it.

1399
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:49,806
You haven't read it yet?

1400
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:51,433
Well, come on, what do I have
to read it for?

1401
01:02:51,474 --> 01:02:52,726
I lived it.

1402
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:55,270
You didn't read
your own son's novel?

1403
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,063
I haven't read
my own son's novel.

1404
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:58,898
But you know, obviously,
I'll get around to it.

1405
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,817
What? What is it that you
don't understand, Nate?

1406
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:03,611
You. Okay?
I don't understand you.

1407
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:04,863
Can somebody please tell me

1408
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:06,573
what the hell
he's talking about.

1409
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:07,615
Don't worry, Nathan.

1410
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:09,284
Dad's proud of you...

1411
01:03:09,325 --> 01:03:11,494
as long as people at the firm
are patting him on the back.

1412
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:18,418
I would be just as proud
of you, Jack,

1413
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,086
if you ever built
something substantial,

1414
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,339
if you built a building
and I walked down the street

1415
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,466
and I could point to it and say,
"Look at that building.

1416
01:03:24,507 --> 01:03:26,343
That's my kid.
My kid built that building."

1417
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:28,970
Once again,
it comes back to you.

1418
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,597
What are you saying?

1419
01:03:30,638 --> 01:03:32,557
You're saying I only think
about myself?

1420
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:36,811
I see.

1421
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:39,856
Well, then, let me
ask you something.

1422
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,650
Who the fuck paid
for your architectural school?

1423
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,027
Huh?

1424
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:45,528
And what about your nose job,
princess?

1425
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,155
How many nose jobs
did you have?

1426
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:49,657
One, and then one
for maintenance.

1427
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:51,076
Rehab. How many times?

1428
01:03:51,117 --> 01:03:52,452
Three.

1429
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:53,787
Three times.

1430
01:03:53,828 --> 01:03:54,954
That's ridiculous.

1431
01:03:56,539 --> 01:03:59,334
I didn't near any complaints
when the cash machine was open.

1432
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:02,253
Speaking of which,
Jack, how's business?

1433
01:04:02,295 --> 01:04:04,756
I had a nice chat today
with Brad Thomkins

1434
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:06,800
Told me that your drawings
Weren't up to par.

1435
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:09,219
But that's fine, not to worry.

1436
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:11,346
As a favor to me, he said
he'd give you another shot.

1437
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:16,226
I don't want
another shot, Dad.

1438
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,649
My business is over.

1439
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:25,068
I don't want to be
an architect anymore.

1440
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:26,903
Look, Son.
Nothing is over.

1441
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:28,321
Business is cyclical.

1442
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:29,781
It goes in stages.

1443
01:04:29,823 --> 01:04:31,533
You had a few bad months.
That's okay.

1444
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,702
You just...
you gotta stick to it.

1445
01:04:35,328 --> 01:04:36,371
Why?

1446
01:04:36,371 --> 01:04:37,622
Because it's yours.

1447
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:39,165
But I don't want it, Dad.

1448
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,584
My heart is not in it.

1449
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:42,877
I don't think it ever was.

1450
01:04:45,755 --> 01:04:47,674
Okay, fine.

1451
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:48,842
Fine.

1452
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,593
Let's eat.
Come on.

1453
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:53,221
No problem.

1454
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,390
I just want to know one thing.

1455
01:04:55,432 --> 01:04:57,267
What are you gonna do
about money?

1456
01:04:58,852 --> 01:05:00,395
I don't know.

1457
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:02,272
You don't know.
That's great.

1458
01:05:02,313 --> 01:05:04,024
I have news for you.

1459
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:05,734
Being a father is expensive.

1460
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:07,610
No kidding.

1461
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:11,156
I'm surprised
you're even having a kid,

1462
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:13,324
because as far back
as I can recall,

1463
01:05:13,366 --> 01:05:16,119
you never had any balls at all.

1464
01:05:16,161 --> 01:05:17,620
Ooh.

1465
01:05:17,662 --> 01:05:20,415
Henry, that's enough!

1466
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:22,417
Mom.

1467
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,586
Mom, it's okay.

1468
01:05:24,627 --> 01:05:26,463
I'm okay.

1469
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:28,006
I didn't raise my kids
to be quitters

1470
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:32,469
You didn't raise us
at all, Dad.

1471
01:05:40,226 --> 01:05:42,103
God.

1472
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:43,980
I may never make as much money
as you, Dad,

1473
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,399
but I know one thing.

1474
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,109
I'll be a better father
than you ever were.

1475
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:50,570
Give me a break.

1476
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,823
That's right;
walk away.

1477
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:55,116
That's right, Jackie boy.

1478
01:05:55,116 --> 01:05:56,618
Leave. Walk away.

1479
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:00,955
Come on, Laura.

1480
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,248
Don't worry
about the business.

1481
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,667
Deep down, he's just like me.

1482
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,960
No, Henry.
He's nothing like you.

1483
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,759
Another petit Syrah?

1484
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:13,843
Are you fucking kidding me?

1485
01:06:13,885 --> 01:06:15,178
Wrong time.

1486
01:06:17,514 --> 01:06:18,682
Can I get a shot of something?

1487
01:06:18,723 --> 01:06:19,808
Anything.

1488
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:36,074
You okay?

1489
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:42,998
He'll get over it.

1490
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,167
I don't care.

1491
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:49,004
For the first time in my life,

1492
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:51,548
I honestly don't give a shit
what my family thinks about me.

1493
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,634
How's that feel?

1494
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:57,721
Fucking fantastic.

1495
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,060
All I care about is us.

1496
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,854
And the baby.

1497
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,524
Laura, I'm sorry.

1498
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:11,568
For everything.

1499
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:13,737
I don't know how,
but I promise you

1500
01:07:13,778 --> 01:07:14,904
I'll make it work.

1501
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,781
We'll make it work.

1502
01:07:28,418 --> 01:07:29,419
Ugh.

1503
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:32,005
Mm.

1504
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:33,923
Do we have to go back
in there?

1505
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:35,383
Yeah, I'm hungry.

1506
01:07:36,926 --> 01:07:39,929
Ephraim, I'm bored.

1507
01:07:53,526 --> 01:07:54,778
What the hell are you doing?

1508
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:57,572
Put it away.

1509
01:07:57,572 --> 01:07:59,741
Hey, slow down.
You're gonna make yourself sick.

1510
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:13,213
Okay.

1511
01:08:13,254 --> 01:08:14,673
In the spirit of goodwill,

1512
01:08:14,714 --> 01:08:16,341
I just want
to ask you something.

1513
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,634
What do you want from me?

1514
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:21,221
What do you want?

1515
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:24,391
You want me to tell you
what a bastard I've been?

1516
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,601
Why I didn't go
to your stupid hockey games?

1517
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:29,354
Or why I didn't come
to your dance recitals?

1518
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,397
Okay.

1519
01:08:30,438 --> 01:08:31,731
I'll say it.
I'm sorry.

1520
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,483
There. I said it.

1521
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:35,360
All right?
Do you feel better?

1522
01:08:36,903 --> 01:08:38,113
I think we should go.
Let's go.

1523
01:08:38,154 --> 01:08:39,280
You hear that?

1524
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,657
You see the way
she takes care of me.

1525
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:41,950
Come here, sweetheart.

1526
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:42,951
Ugh.

1527
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,121
We're gonna have a baby.

1528
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:47,247
Are you kidding me?

1529
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:48,540
Wait.. What?

1530
01:08:48,581 --> 01:08:49,624
Amy's pregnant.

1531
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:50,792
- L'Chaim..
- What?

1532
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:51,918
How far along are you?

1533
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,378
You're having a baby?
Again?

1534
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,547
You're, like, 100 years old.
You're gonna have a kid?

1535
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:56,881
No. Hey!

1536
01:08:56,923 --> 01:08:58,341
I have something
to say to you guys.

1537
01:08:58,341 --> 01:08:59,968
You should be happy
for yourfather..

1538
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,469
You know what,

1539
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:03,596
you all talk about him like
he's some sort of a monster.

1540
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:04,973
I mean did he...
did he hit you?

1541
01:09:04,973 --> 01:09:06,141
Did he molest you or something?

1542
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:07,517
No, he didn't..

1543
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:09,602
The only thing ne's guilty of
is being successful.

1544
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:11,312
Your father is
the most generous,

1545
01:09:11,354 --> 01:09:12,856
kind, thoughtful,

1546
01:09:12,897 --> 01:09:14,691
sincere man I have ever met
in my entire life.

1547
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:17,152
And I'm just really sorry
you all can't see him like that.

1548
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:18,153
Amen.

1549
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:19,904
And that is why I love her.

1550
01:09:22,657 --> 01:09:23,825
I'm gonna be sick.

1551
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:25,660
- Stop kissing her.
- I'm gonna be sick.

1552
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,203
And as far as you people
are concerned,

1553
01:09:27,245 --> 01:09:29,205
I want to tell you something.

1554
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:31,833
You want to know who to blame
for your shitty lives?

1555
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,918
Blame yourselves,
because I am sick and tired

1556
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,087
of your Whining
and your complaining.

1557
01:09:36,129 --> 01:09:37,714
Your lives would have been
miraculous

1558
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,965
if I hadn't been your father.

1559
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:40,216
Well, bullshit.

1560
01:09:40,258 --> 01:09:41,968
You don't like being part
of my family,

1561
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,595
go find your own family.

1562
01:09:43,636 --> 01:09:47,057
Okay?

1563
01:09:59,402 --> 01:10:00,987
Goddamned spoiled brat kids.

1564
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,364
I know. I know.

1565
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:07,660
You're just jealous
of my Will.

1566
01:10:07,702 --> 01:10:09,788
Daddy, nobody's interested
in your will..

1567
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:11,373
We want you to live
a long, happy life.

1568
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:13,667
Not that will.
What is wrong with you?

1569
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:14,959
How old are you?

1570
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:16,127
Not my... that will.

1571
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:17,504
My will to live,

1572
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:19,714
my life,
any damn way I please.

1573
01:10:19,714 --> 01:10:20,840
Are you ever gonna grow up?

1574
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:23,051
Shut up.

1575
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:25,095
Shut up!

1576
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:28,515
All my life, I've been listening
to your fighting

1577
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:30,558
You hate her.
She hates you.

1578
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,602
You all hate your father.

1579
01:10:34,062 --> 01:10:37,774
Not once did any of you have
the common courtesy

1580
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:39,984
to ask me how I felt,

1581
01:10:40,026 --> 01:10:43,113
the pain that I
was going through.

1582
01:10:43,154 --> 01:10:44,739
Well, now you're all gonna
hear about it.

1583
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,161
Honey? He's choking!

1584
01:10:50,203 --> 01:10:51,413
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1585
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:52,706
He's choking!
Daddy!

1586
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:55,208
Jack!

1587
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,376
Henry!

1588
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,169
Make him stop the choking!

1589
01:10:58,211 --> 01:10:59,963
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1590
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,089
Henry.

1591
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,925
Call an ambulance.

1592
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,176
Help!

1593
01:11:05,218 --> 01:11:06,219
- Oh, my God.
- Dad?

1594
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,262
Daddy?

1595
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:08,263
- Dad.
- Dad.

1596
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:10,598
Henry, Henry?

1597
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:11,725
Henry, can you hear me?

1598
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:12,767
I don't know.

1599
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:13,977
- Please.
- Call 911.

1600
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,563
Does he have a pulse?

1601
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:17,981
Dad, can you hear me?

1602
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,357
Henry.

1603
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:20,734
Dad.

Doctor Calder, please,
for emergency.

1615
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,998
Nathan,
why don't you sit down?

1616
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,375
I can't..

1617
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,628
There are consequences.

1618
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,339
You know,
there's a price to pay.

1619
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:27,467
What did you say?

1620
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,386
I'm saying it's karma, Nate.

1621
01:12:29,427 --> 01:12:31,971
You... you caused a lot of pain,

1622
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:33,306
and you caused
a lot of suffering,

1623
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,016
and now there's a price.

1624
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,895
So my book brought this on?

1625
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,189
Is that what you're saying?

1626
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:42,816
Know what,
fuck you, Cheri.

1627
01:12:42,857 --> 01:12:43,858
Hey, guys.

1628
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:46,361
This is not the time.

1629
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:48,988
Nathan, you're not responsible
for what happened to dad.

1630
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,699
Cheri, come on.

1631
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:57,706
That was pretty hurtful
what you did, Nathan.

1632
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,208
I tried reading Peep World,
and I had to put it down.

1633
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:03,753
It was like looking at...

1634
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:06,715
a bad photograph of yourself

1635
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,676
or hearing your voice
on a tape recorder

1636
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,513
for the very first time.

1637
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,224
Pshh, only worse.

1638
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:22,522
I did finish it eventually,
but it hurt.

1639
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,566
And it still hurts.

1640
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,030
And you want to know
the worst thing?

1641
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:36,494
You're my brother,

1642
01:13:36,536 --> 01:13:38,997
and you see me as a joke,

1643
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,250
a fat one, a fool.

1644
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,755
I expected more from you, Nate.

1645
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:49,591
I'm not angry.

1646
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,593
I'm telling you.

1647
01:13:51,634 --> 01:13:55,180
It hurt.

1648
01:14:00,852 --> 01:14:02,812
I'm sorry.

1649
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:11,321
I'm sorry.

1650
01:14:13,823 --> 01:14:15,241
I'm sorry.

1651
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,456
I'm still gonna sue.

1652
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,585
Dr. Reidl, please call 600.

1653
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,839
Dr. Reidl, cab' 600.

1654
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,807
Not now.

1655
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,350
Well, now would be
a good time.

1656
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:43,978
I know.
But it's just so jangly.

1657
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:44,979
It's too much.

1658
01:14:45,021 --> 01:14:46,022
Okay, okay.

1659
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,364
What are we gonna do
if he dies?

1660
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,037
We'll live.

1661
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,277
Are you the Meyerwitz family?

1662
01:15:35,947 --> 01:15:37,282
Yes.

1663
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,832
Even though
it was never his intention,

1664
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,834
Henry Meyerwitz
had finally brought

1665
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,545
his family together.

1666
01:15:50,545 --> 01:15:52,881
It nearly killed him.
