136
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:50,182
Fixed my hair,

I went over her house one Sunday mornin'.

140
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:02,780
Her mom had just gone to church.

141
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:09,287
And we had the place all to ourselves.

142
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:13,334
So, you know, we got

must have forgot her purse or somethin',

147
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,772
'cause she came back home.

148
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:35,818
I guess she could smell the sex in the air.

149
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,738
I got a surprise for you.

150
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,991
And that's when things really got freaky.

151
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:44,829
Before I knew it, the door burst open
and there was her momma.

152
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,414
Oh.

153
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,043
Hold him down, baby,
Let Momma have him.

154
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:53,088
I grabbed my things and got out of there.

155
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:54,507
Yeah,

156
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,802
I sure do hope you get her number,
- The girl?

157
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,263
Hell, no, Her momma, She the freak,

158
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,225
Don't go up too high in the back,
- Don't worry.

159
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,479
You all done, There we go.

160
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:12,569
I got somethin' for you to make
the girls think you're smellin' good.

161
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:17,116
All hooked up, partner,
Give me my $1 3,

162
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,670
.

163
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,426
Give it up.
This is a jack move, fool.

164
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,470
Just don't shoot.

165
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:41,353
Come back here with my truck.
Give me that truck back.

166
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:46,609
Man, you got any spare change?

167
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:49,070
Sorry, bro, I'm all out, man.

168
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,449
Man, I got these cheeseburgers, man,

169
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,913
I don't want any cheeseburgers,
- Please, man,

170
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:00,333
I'll suck your dick,
- Ew.

171
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,295
Get outta here, man.
Get outta here.

172
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:07,759
It hurt me to wake up
and see my beautiful black people suffer.

173
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:12,222
Victimized by the oppressive
harsh realities of the 'hood.

174
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,725
I guess, even though we were free,

175
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:18,313
we were still slaves in the mind.

176
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,357
Message.

177
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,820
Luckily, I wasn 't alone here in the 'hood.

178
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:28,408
My cousin Loc Dog
lived right across the street.

179
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,786
Loc Dog was America 's worst nightmare.

180
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,080
Raised in a house with three generations...

181
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,542
of hopelessness, poverty and profanity.

182
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,461
.

183
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:42,382
Loc Dog, turn that
Loud-ass motherfuckin' music down.

184
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,094
You wakin' up the babies, motherfucker.

185
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,722
This still my house, motherfucker.

186
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,600
Who the fuck is that on my porch?

187
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,398
Hey, Miss Dog,
- Hey, Ashtray,

188
00:10:56,691 --> 00:11:00,445
You stayin' with your daddy for good?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,449
Come on in.

190
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:12,334
You tell your pretty-ass
motherfuckin' daddy I said hello.

191
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,047
Yeah.

192
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:22,429
Baby, do me a favor
and pass me that shit over there,

193
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:32,024
Care for a little soup?
- No, thanks, I'm cool, Is Loc Dog here?

194
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,195
Yeah, that Lazy-ass motherfucker's
back there doin' nothin' as usual,

195
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,158
OK, well, I'll see you Later,
- All right, then.

196
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,329
Hey, Grandma.

197
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,793
Ashtray, you little bitch-ass motherfucker.

198
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,005
Come over here
and give your grandma a hug.

199
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,133
That's my nigga.

200
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:57,345
You been wearin' them jimmy hats
that Grandma gave you?

201
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,223
Yes, ma'am, How are you?

202
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,559
Oh, my old stinky ass is fine.

203
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:05,771
Except for my arthritis in my trigger finger,

204
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:09,651
But I can still stick and move,
- I'll bet you can.

205
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:14,323
That beatin' the police give me
didn't slow me down a bit.

206
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:18,495
Come on, motherfucker,
Give me your best shot.

207
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,790
Come on, Grandma,
I don't wanna do nothin' Like that,

208
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:26,170
Come on, nigga,
- Come on, Grandma, I don't wanna.

209
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,139
Damn, them fake teeth are hard.

210
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:37,183
Bye-bye.

211
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,148
You still hit Like a bitch, motherfucker.

212
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:48,488
Loc Dog was gonna teach me to survive
in the 'hood, even if it killed me.

213
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,699
.

214
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:04,590
Tray, is that you?

215
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:09,763
You better start announcin' yourself
before you get smoked up in here, nigga.

216
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,391
You know that chronic
make me paranoid, baby.

217
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:16,395
Come here, you old fool-dog,
mark-ass trick, Give me some Love,

218
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,189
What's up, cuz?
- What's up?

219
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:24,655
That's enough of that Love, I don't play
that sentimental shit, Come on, come in.

220
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,616
Quick fashion question.

221
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:29,077
Should I wear this TEC-9, , ,

222
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,498
with the high tops?

223
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,252
Or should I wear this Uzi, , ,

224
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,255
with my Low tops?

225
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,097
I'll just wear these then.

226
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:54,648
Tray, scoot over, Rumor has it your
bitch-ass is in town for good, nigga.

227
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,152
Yeah, man, Mom says
it's time for me to become a man.

228
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,406
Nigger, my mom said the same shit,
Sweatin' me, nigga.

229
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,452
Yeah, man,
I don't care, though.

230
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,705
I told her,
I don't wanna be on welfare my whole Life.

231
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,292
For real, I got bigger and better plans.

232
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:14,088
Figured I'd get me a job at the post office,
maybe at a bank,

233
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,842
That's all good, man,
- Work hard, Work my way up to manager,

234
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:21,305
We need more black people Like this,
- Learn the system.

235
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,183
Then I'll rob that motherfucker blind.

236
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,352
Break all yourselves.

237
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:32,276
Hold up,
Whatever happened to your pops anyway?

238
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:37,657
That old mark-ass nigga
ran out on us Like a little biznitch.

239
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,078
You know, it's, , .

240
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,209
It was kinda tough, , .

241
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,591
Growin' up in the 'hood without a, , ,

242
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:57,347
without a positive
male role model to Look up to.

243
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,641
Message.

244
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:05,106
Nigger, come on, Let's go get Preach and
Crazy Legs and go to this picnic real quick.

245
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,483
Come on.

246
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,545
Damn.

247
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:27,924
This is some good shit.

248
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,803
You have your black ass
back here by Friday.

249
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,433
The social worker's comin'
and I'm still claimin' your ass.

250
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:38,311
Quit sweatin' me, Shoot.

251
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,398
Grandma, you better stay off my end
or I'll smoke your ass.

252
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,651
Oh, go fuck yourself, nigga,

253
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,280
Preach was
a former gang member turned activist.

254
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,325
But now, he's just plain confused.

255
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,413
Preach, What up, nigga?
- Y'all need to stop usin' the word 'nigga, '.

256
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,126
You see, it's terms Like the word 'nigga'
that the white man uses...

257
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,587
to take away
the self-esteem of another race.

258
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,214
Word.

259
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:08,555
Remind me to pick my Laundry up
from that Chink motherfucker up the street,

260
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:14,395
Crazy Legs used to be
the best dancer in the 'hood.

261
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,316
But now he's paralyzed
from the waist down after a drive-by.

262
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,031
What's up, Crazy?
- What's up, y'all? I'll be right there.

263
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:32,583
That's the way to start the day,
How you doin'?

264
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,379
My little pigmy brother,
- All right, African brother,

265
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,215
Loc Dog didn't have the fliest ride,

266
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:43,220
but it was reliable in rain, sleet or snow.

267
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,574
Hey, you guys,

268
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:02,785
Y'all wanna see a dead body?
- Yeah.

269
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,829
Come on.

270
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,632
I told you he was dead.

271
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,759
Man, he stinks,

272
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,970
...

273
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,601
♪ Here comes Lil' Bud with another hit...

274
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,521

that the busters can't get with...

275
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,149

276
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,443
What's up, baby boy?

277
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:44,458
Damn. Hey, Tray, if you can't
get nothin' here, you're gonna die a virgin,

278
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:55,471
Hey, y'all, Look at them freaks
gettin' busy on the dancefloor.

279
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:58,767
There's all kinds of bitches up in here.

280
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:02,104
What did I tell you
about disrespectin' my Nubian princesses?

281
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,815
Quit disrespect, , ,
You need, , .

282
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:09,905
Oh, my God, The mother of Mecca
is right here before me.

283
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:16,412
Do my eyes not deceive me
or am I Lookin' at the goddess Isis herself?

284
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:21,376
Can you, , , Can you do me a favor,
my brown-skinned angel?

285
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:25,423
Can you tap that white girl for me?

286
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,719
My milk of magnesia.

287
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:36,143
After the devil made you,
he broke the mold.

288
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,315
Maybe you and I
could make a little jungle fever?

289
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:50,202
This one to all my dead homies,
you know what I'm sayin'?

290
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,509
I remember
the first time I saw Dashiki.

291
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:07,972
She was fine enough
to be 'Jet' Beauty of the Week.

292
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:12,311
Yo, Loc, Come here,
- Hey, what's up? What's up, nigga?

293
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,314
Yo, man, Who's this fine girl over here?

294
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:18,109
Oh, nigga, that's Dashiki.

295
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:22,155
Stay away from that, Everybody
in the 'hood 's been up in her,

296
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,743
She got more kids than Ms, Wayans,
- Damn.

297
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:34,044
Anyway, that's Toothpick's ex-girl,
You don't want any of that boy's old scraps,

298
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,842
Toothpick got used to bein' in jail.

299
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:43,305

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,661
Because all the rappers
are takin' all the good actin' jobs.

606
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:32,708
Listen, Doo Rag,
Havin' a gun doesn't give you any power,

607
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,419
Know where the real power is?
- In the bullets.

608
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:38,006
No. In the books.

609
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:42,386
See, , .

610
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:45,890
Doo Rag, your mind, , ,

611
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:49,352
it is Like a gun.

612
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:52,523
And you wanna Load it up...

613
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:56,611

614
00:41:56,736 --> 00:41:59,656
bullets of knowledge.

Message.

616
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,795
Hey, what are you doin'?

617
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,882
Writin' a poem.

618
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:19,930
See, my poetry helps me escape
the harsh realities of Livin' in the 'hood.

619
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:22,391
Ah, that's deep.

620
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:25,227
Hey, you wanna read me one?

621
00:42:25,227 --> 00:42:27,355
OK.

622
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,482
Let me see.

623
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:39,369
Love is by far
the most precious thing on Earth.

624
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:45,251
Like a rose's fragrance or a child's birth.

625
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:49,172
Love me and Leave me.

626
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:52,676
That's the story of my Life.

627
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,096
But it won't happen again, see.

628
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,390
Since I bought a butcher's knife.

629
00:42:57,432 --> 00:43:02,437
Yeah, see, the next man
who Loves me and Leaves me so quick.

630
00:43:02,437 --> 00:43:05,274
I'm gonna cut off his balls
and chop off his dick.

631
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,860
I'm gonna shoot that motherfucker,
Kill him.

632
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:11,156
I'm gonna stab that motherfucker
for fuckin' with me.

633
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,534
I'm gonna run him over with my car, see.

634
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:16,412
He fuckin' with the wrong motherfucker,

635
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:20,751
I will kill that motherfucker,
- Baby, baby, baby,

636
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:24,880
I get the point, That was, , ,
- You Liked it?

637
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:27,050
That was good.

638
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:31,430
It touched me in a really special place.

639
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:35,351
You wait right here.

640
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:37,562

Dashiki was far more
sexually experienced than I was.

644
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:12,936
She taught me all about foreplay.

645
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,482
Until then,
I ain't never done foreplay before.

646
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:21,238
But then again, who needs foreplay

Fool, Dashiki was born pregnant,
What else is new?

What else is new? It's mine,

706

Thank you, Lord,
-  Are you sure?

707
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:07,947
She said I was the only one she'd
been with in the past 20 minutes.

00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:10,116
Yes. Yes.

00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,661
And you believed her?

710
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:18,626
Here you go, sucker,
I mean, brother,

711

That'll be 1 0, 38,

712
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:29,097
So what you gonna do now, Tray?

713
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:32,392
I don't know,
I might move out of the 'hood with her.

714
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,270
What?

715
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,147
Oh, fool.

716
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,026
Look here,
Let me tell you somethin', Tray.

717
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:42,696
You could take Dashiki out of the 'hood,

718
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:46,284
but you can't take
the 'hood niggas out of Dashiki,

719
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,328
...

720
00:49:52,624 --> 00:49:54,835
Damn five-o,
- Damn.

721
00:49:55,878 --> 00:50:01,259
You there. Get out of the truck
and put your hands in the air.

722
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:03,304
Stand on one leg.

723
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:08,768
With the tip of your finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

724
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:12,940
Now in a circular motion,
rub your stomach and pat your head...

725
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:15,693
while saying,
'Rubber baby buggy bumper. '

726
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:17,904
Rubber baby buggy bumper,

727
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:20,198
Strike a pose. Now Vogue.

728
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,494
.

729
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:32,212
Now walk slowly toward the car.

730
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,779
We didn't even do nothin'.

731
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:55,531
What?

732
00:50:55,573 --> 00:50:57,867
You think you're tough.

733
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:04,792
You don't Look so tough now,
little nigga.

734
00:51:06,836 --> 00:51:10,590
I hate you black bastards, You stink.

735
00:51:11,299 --> 00:51:13,969
I hate your black skin.

736
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:16,722
I hate your black pants.

737
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:18,975
I hate black pepper.

738
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:22,312
I hate black keys on a piano.

739
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:26,067
I hate my gums, 'cause they black.

740
00:51:26,776 --> 00:51:29,696
I hate Whoopi Goldberg's Lips.

741
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:33,867
I hate the back of Forest Whitaker's neck.

742
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:39,082
And most of all,
I hate that black ass, Wesley Snipes.

743
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,169
Move it.

744
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:45,047
Come on,
- Let's go,

745
00:51:47,342 --> 00:51:51,179
We got arrested
for bein' black on a Friday night.

746
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:53,599
Don't try anything, all right?

747
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:58,772
It was a misdemeanor,
so I thought we'd be out right away.

748
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:07,949
Right there, right there.

749
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:21,506
All right get in there.

750
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:33,103
What's up, young blood?
- What's up?

751
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:36,566
Swine, my brother?

752
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:39,819
No, thanks,
- Now Let me tell you somethin'.

753
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:45,576
If you hit a man,
in time, his wounds will heal.

754
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:48,413
And if you steal from a man,

755
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:51,625
you can replace what you steal.

756
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:56,839
And always cross in the green,
never in between.

757
00:52:57,006 --> 00:53:01,094
Because the honorable
Elijah Mohammad Ali...

758
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,682
floats Like a butterfly and stings Like a bee.

759
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,977
Thinkin' about
another minute with Farra-convict...

760
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,897
made me never want
to do time in the joint again.

761
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:15,069
Boy, am I happy to see you, man,
- Always remember, my brother,

762

Get the head.
Come on. Move your body.

What's up now, partner? Huh, partner?

Stay right there. Stay there.
- We shouldn't, , .

801
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:42,074
Nice execution.
I'm gonna give that a 8.

Yeah, make him cripple. Make him
cripple Like me. Stomp him. Yeah,

803
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,963
After stompin' one of Toothpick's
boys, we knew we had to get backup.

804
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:56,674
So we went to our homie
Old School's house.

You sure this guy's gonna have our back?

Let me tell you about Old School.

He's the most dangerous OG on the set.

00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:06,978
Let me tell you young punks somethin'.

809
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,899
I've been down on this 'hood a Long time,
I seen a Lot of things.

810
00:56:11,024 --> 00:56:15,571
I survived the Watts riots gang wars,
And you know how I did it?

811
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:17,407
How?

812
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,744
By standin' my ground
and havin' my homies watch my back,

813
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,749
Word.
- So don't Let nobody mess with your set.

814
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:28,545
And Like me,
don't Let nobody give you no shit.

815
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:31,590
Yeah, Old School.

Come here, boy.

00:56:39,724 --> 00:56:44,897
What did you say, boy?
- I said, 'Oh, shoot, ' Ma, Shoot.

819
00:56:45,064 --> 00:56:47,358
Didn't I tell you to clean your room?

820
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:52,322
Oh, Ma, come on,
The gang needs me, I'm their Leader.

821
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,201
Gang?

822
00:56:56,035 --> 00:56:59,080
Get in there and clean that room
in the next ten minutes...

823
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:03,544

00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:23,442
Oh, the police is after you, huh?

829
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:29,240
Nah, I'm on punishment,
My mom says I can't Leave the porch.

830
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:32,411
Come on, Let's hold the porch down.

831
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:38,084
Say, that's a nice walker, Lady,
Cough it up. Turn around. Snap.

832
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:40,670

00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:48,137
Man, I need to get out of this place.

834
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:50,599
What you talkin' about?
Leave the 'hood?

835
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:52,684
This is home sweet home.

836
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:59,651
I Love the smell of gun smoke

That's more than most homies in the 'hood.

839
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,702
Why, little Foots, you got a dream?

I went to see Jason's Lyric this weekend.

882
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:33,609
Gee, wasn't he cute? Did you see
his butt, though? It was hairy.

883
01:01:33,776 --> 01:01:36,487
I didn't think that ass-fro was cute.

Come on, We're gonna do it,

897
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:28,214
Between Crazy Legs bein' hit
in a drive-by, the Korean store shootings,

898
01:02:28,339 --> 01:02:33,596
jail and Dashiki bein' pregnant,
I felt I was about to explode.

899
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:12,724
What are you doin'?

900
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:18,481
Tryin' to win Best Actor
on the Soul Train Awards.

901
01:03:26,115 --> 01:03:30,078
Look, Dashiki,
I'm sorry about Last night.

902
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:36,836
I thought about it
and I wanna be a father to my child.

903
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:40,924
And another thing.

904
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,972
I also realized how much I Love you.

905
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,227
And I wanna Leave the 'hood with you.

906
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:56,692
But there's somethin'
we need to do before we go.

907
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:05,536
I'm takin' the kids
and I'm movin' out of the 'hood.

908
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:09,457
I wanted them
to say goodbye to their daddies.

909
01:04:11,168 --> 01:04:13,545
Give me the man.

910
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,645
You're a good brother, Tray, Dad.

911
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:30,440
Me?

912
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:34,779
I've been in jail a Long time, T.

913
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:38,450
Sometimes I feel Like a caged animal.

914
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:45,625
How come you never came

to be really intimidated by me.

1010
01:11:14,411 --> 01:11:16,914
But I don't know why.

1011
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:21,378
Well, you know.

1012
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:25,967
I can understand how a pretty girl Like
yourself might make a man a little sick.

1013
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:28,219
I mean nervous.

1014
01:11:28,344 --> 01:11:32,224

1018
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:53,248
You ain't my daddy

1019
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:59,631

Keisha, what do you say we go back
to my place and have a nightcap?

1026
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:29,582
I don't know,
I just met you.

1027
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:34,213
Hey, girl, the dog don't bite

1028
01:12:37,216 --> 01:12:39,094
OK,

1029
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:41,346

Baby, you really Love me.

I really shouldn't.

1033
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,676
Come on, girl,
It ain't gonna hurt you.

1034
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:19,808
It's just that, when I drink,
sometimes I get a little crazy.

1035
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:21,977
And that's what l want.

1036
01:13:26,274 --> 01:13:29,361
I don't want you to think
I'm a freak or nothin' Like that.

1037
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:33,866
I usually don't even go home with guys
when I first meet them.

1038
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:37,954
But I just feel so comfortable with you.

1039

Hey, that's good, girl.

1040

Whenever you with me, I want you
to just relax and be yourself.

1041
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:54,390
You are so nasty,

01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:08,448
Loc Dog's gonna take

1046
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,618
Are you sure it's OK?

1047
01:14:16,249 --> 01:14:19,878
I want you to just be yourself, OK?

1048
01:14:20,462 --> 01:14:23,549

Nothin' Like the great outdoors, huh, Pop?

1056

- Oh, no, it ain't nothin' Like that, son,

1062

1063
01:15:41,139 --> 01:15:45,394
Nothin', son, Go ahead,
Tell me about this girl.

1064
