1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:03:18,000
4 Minutes Trailer without subtitles.

2
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:30,995
Honey, I'm home!

3
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,641
- Hi.
- Hi, love.

4
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,562
Thanks.

5
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:47,079
Jacob speaking ...
Hi, lnge! That's so sweet of you.

6
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,557
How about seven o'clock?

7
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:54,915
Oh, we've got loads of food ...
Perhaps some crisps and dip, lnge?

8
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:57,239
Dip-lnge!
- Oh, put a sock in it!

9
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,721
Have you made dip, lnge?
Dip-lnge!

10
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:06,438
There's lashings of garlic in it.
- Dip-lnge!

11
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:10,558
It's from the cats as well,
of course.

12
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,921
Thanks ever so.
- Genuine Biedermeier.

13
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,159
It's late Victorian, silly!
- Oh, wow!

14
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:21,321
Actually, these usually
hold six pieces of toast.

15
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,435
But this one holds eight.
- Oh, right.

16
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:28,842
It was used in Blythe Splrit.
- Oh, the pirate film ...?

17
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:32,001
Stick it in your mouth.
Yummy.

18
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,276
That'll be your mum.

19
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:39,552
Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

20
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,718
Where is Oskar?

21
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,359
How about I drop him off tomorrow,
so you can rest?

22
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,235
I suppose so.

23
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,358
You look fabulous!
Where are you off to?

24
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:52,519
To Jacob and Jørgen's.
It's Jacob's birthday.

25
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,795
Ifyou can guess what's inside,
you get a CD.

26
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,075
Happy Birthday.

27
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:01,638
And happy birthday.
- This is Swallow.

28
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,232
Skylark!

29
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:11,113
Adrian, Palle! This is Finn, Jacob's
boss, so be good. All right, girls?

30
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,435
What?
- Come on.

31
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,839
Are you gay too?

32
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,198
What?

33
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,482
Sit down.

34
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,232
This is a lousy time
to play doctors and doctors.

35
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,791
Where's Tom?
- He'll be round later.

36
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,722
Who's looking after Oskar?
- Andreas.

37
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,834
Anjawas a bit tired and emotional.

38
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:49,516
Will you marry me?

39
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,275
Are you a student, then?
- I'm at high school.

40
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:04,839
Any nice-looking girls in your class?
- Yeah.

41
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:07,836
There they are.
Hi!

42
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,439
SHAKE IT ALL ABOUT

43
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,111
Cheers!

44
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:18,722
How's it going with Sailor?

45
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,561
He picks me up
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

46
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:22,640
The two luckiest days of the week.

47
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,799
And then
it's up the creek all summer.

48
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,040
Without a paddle, right, lnge?
- Actually he's got a real creek.

49
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:32,634
You should've seen me and
Fabienne bowling the other night.

50
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,482
Fabienne?
- I worked with her at the C.H.

51
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:38,755
Orwe go to Boggy Marsh.
Buggery Marsh, more like.

52
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,476
The C.H.?
- The County Hospital.

53
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,560
She's a fab anaesthetist.

54
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,835
When I'm out with him
I practically have to wear awig.

55
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:48,273
A wig?
- So nobody'll recognise me.

56
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,997
Nothing kinky, though.
He's not into kinky.

57
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,081
That's where I draw the line, too.
At wigs, not kinky.

58
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,955
But he'll never leave
his wife and children.

59
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,161
Tom!
- Welcome, dear brother.

60
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,354
Happy Birthday.
- Thanks.

61
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:11,433
I can't stay long.
I'm down to fly tomorrow at ten.

62
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:14,760
I told Oskaryou had tomorrow off.

63
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:18,240
You could be a model.
Seriously!

64
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:23,675
Caroline said Anja's back on the ...

65
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:27,197
Shall I have
a chat with her?

66
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:35,833
Jacob, you were born
under a lucky star.

67
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:38,193
He's the only person
over the age of 7 I know -

68
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:41,440
- who truly believes
the sun rises for his sake.

69
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:46,034
Jacob's mother Bine, whose super
potterywe all know and love, -

70
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:49,041
- has a great story about Jacob.

71
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:51,313
Bine couldn't come tonight.
But that's OK.

72
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,037
She wasn't invited.

73
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,756
I'm always coming
without being invited.

74
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:59,512
Shut up, you slag!
- Quiet! Jørgen is telling a story.

75
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:01,315
You always give the nail head.

76
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:04,037
You mean
"hit the nail on the head ..."

77
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:10,514
Back to Bine's story. Jacob used
to do quite a bit of horse-riding.

78
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:15,080
And as you most ofyou will know,
we actually met on horseback.

79
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:19,117
I was out running in the park
in a fit of spring fever.

80
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:24,602
Anyway, when Jacob was ten
he reallywanted a horse.

81
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,759
Oh, no! Mummy!

82
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:33,311
So off theywent to the stud farm.
- The stud farm? Can I come?

83
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:40,876
On the farm Jacob saw two horses
he just couldn't take his eyes off.

84
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,793
One was a beautiful grey gelding,
the otherwas a lovely brown mare.

85
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,359
And Bine asked:
"Jacob, which horse would you like?"

86
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:53,192
And Jacob answered,
"That one ... and that one."

87
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:59,914
And so he got them both, because
Jacob always gets what he wants.

88
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:03,640
And now he wants me.

89
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,561
And yes, I will marryyou.

90
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,476
I'll be with you
for better or forworse, -

91
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:14,598
- and I'll bearyour children ...
Well, anything's possible nowadays.

92
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:19,034
Three cheers for my beloved
and future husband.

93
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,713
Jacob, long mayyou live!

94
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,558
And a long one for luck!

95
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:59,437
I'm going home
before the little one gets too tired.

96
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:03,716
Put her in the bedroom,
we have The Llon Klng on video.

97
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,197
She's seen it.

98
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,839
We never had a natter tonight.
- Because you're stupid.

99
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,398
Anyway, cheers, mate. Good one.

100
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:14,913
Push off home!
- Bye.

101
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,439
I'll just get some water.

102
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:31,111
Are you drunk?
- You just forgot to lower the seat.

103
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:36,952
Caroline
had too much wine ...

104
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,955
Cheers.

105
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,400
And thanks for the cake.

106
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:51,157
The fact that I forgot to take the
wrapping off only made it better.

107
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:54,275
Never mind.
- Right. It's only paper.

108
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:58,633
Jacob, I'm so happy
you two are getting married.

109
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:05,396
We're going to be sisters-in-law.
- Go on, you're not boring me.

110
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,036
You're so sweet.
- Well, so are you.

111
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,315
Paparazzi!

112
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:49,397
Go and taste
the go-home-made soup.

113
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,562
Yes, I could do with
being souped up a bit.

114
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,561
Let's go in and have a drink.

115
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:05,642
Thanks.

116
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:11,392
Let's go back to my place.

117
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:16,233
No, I've got an early start.
I'm off to a bowling match ...

118
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:55,714
Tom called.
- What did he do that for?

119
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,676
He's flipped his lid.
- Why?

120
00:13:59,643 --> 00:14:03,113
Well, there's something rotten
in our family ...

121
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,439
He just called to say thanks.

122
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:09,079
Courtesy. You know what he's like.
- Yeah, I know.

123
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,238
Ifyou don't want a big do, -

124
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,003
- there's always
the registry office.

125
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:19,639
Then off to Seville,
Granada, Barcelona ...

126
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:22,357
But your mum would never agree.
- What?

127
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:27,079
Your mum would never agree.
- Pardon? What?

128
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,393
To the registry office.
- Right.

129
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:32,479
Mum?
- No thanks.

130
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,395
Dad.
- Cheers.

131
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,032
What about Christmas, then?

132
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:42,953
You know we spend every
second Christmas with you, mum.

133
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,994
Last year
we spent it with you.

134
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,636
We'll do the same next year.

135
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,357
This year
it's Jørgen's parents' turn.

136
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,121
I was just thinking ...

137
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,716
So I hearyou're getting married.

138
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,276
Got any plans?
We could have it in the country.

139
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,201
There's no rush.

140
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,963
Let's just get through
Christmas first.

141
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:07,034
Good heavens! ls that the time?

142
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:10,155
Will you see to it,
Hans-Henrik?

143
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,481
So good to see you.

144
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,521
A Skinny Latte ...

145
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:36,440
... and one Latte.

146
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:39,283
Is that with skimmed milk?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:43,320
I wasn't pissed. You were pissed.
- I don't remember that.

148
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,991
That's 'cos you were wasted.
You all were.

149
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,475
It was awicked party.

150
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,398
That Caroline ... Cor!

151
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:55,879
I wouldn't mind having a bit of play
while hubbie's away ...

152
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,641
Nicely stacked.
- Shut up.

153
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,640
One shouldn't waste quality snatch.
- Shut it!

154
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:02,516
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Been born again?

155
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,315
Yes.

156
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,958
Would you get us some coffee?
- Black?

157
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,516
Yeah, cheers.

158
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,317
Milk and sugar?
- Yeah, cheers.

159
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,883
I mean, of course it hurts.

160
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,917
But it's a different kind of pain.

161
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:29,800
A bit like having an orgasm.
A really long orgasm.

162
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:31,755
Aren't you going to have one soon?
- An orgasm?

163
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:36,081
A child. Your own child.
- I want to finish my thesis first.

164
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:41,152
And I want Oskar to enjoy being
an only child a little while longer.

165
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:45,038
There isn't really space.
- It's a three bedroom house!

166
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:50,317
You're far too good.
You're just stuck with that kid.

167
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:52,957
It's not like that at all.

168
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,481
Caroline speaking.

169
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,356
Oh, hi!
Yes?

170
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:04,956
Yes, I can just make it.
See you there.

171
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,279
... Who was that?

172
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,839
Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:21,432
It was a great night.
- Yeah.

174
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:24,601
That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

175
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:29,194
I mean, I was really pissed
and really over the moon.

176
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,593
I just wanted to apologise.
- No need.

177
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,758
Great.

178
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,121
Why did you want to meet here?

179
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:43,759
I was in the neighbourhood.
- Oh. OK.

180
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,279
All right, then. I mean,
I was really pissed as well.

181
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:56,597
Tom and I had a good laugh
about it on the way home.

182
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,994
You told Tom?

183
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,195
God, you're gullible!
- Oh, I get you ...

184
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,200
Well, see you.
- Bye.

185
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:30,999
I've got a couple of
brochures about Kibbutzim.

186
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:33,922
You can take them home
and read them.

187
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:42,797
Then again, I quite fancy being,
you know, a postman.

188
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:45,471
I just love the idea
of delivering mail.

189
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:48,720
You know,
helping people communicate.

190
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:53,314
Just like that film with
what's-his-name, Kevin Costner.

191
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,642
OK, I'll get hold of some
brochures from the post office.

192
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:04,232
Come for them ...
- Tomorrow?

193
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,041
Right.
... Simon?

194
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:21,002
Have a nice weekend ...
Nice ass.

195
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,996
Have you finished for today?
Great.

196
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:33,198
Shall we go and grab a bite?

197
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,995
Come here.

198
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,000
There ... we're home!
Hi!

199
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:45,474
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Oskar.

200
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:56,315
What's for dinner?
- Are you hungry?

201
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:00,520
Let's go out.
- Let's stay home.

202
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:04,523
I haven't done any shopping. Sorry.

203
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:09,515
And then my period came this morning.
A really heavy one.

204
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:13,716
It's just been a really rough day.
Shall I get us some pizzas?

205
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,596
I can do that.
I need some fresh air.

206
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:34,555
This is lbrahim Modi
from the lslamic council.

207
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:39,393
It's an umbrella organisation
for Muslims living in Denmark.

208
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:46,721
And that's Johannes Leisner,
our elected parish priest.

209
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:52,201
We architects are enormously
pleased that the political climate -

210
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:56,760
- is in favour of finally building
a mosque in the city of Copenhagen.

211
00:20:56,963 --> 00:21:01,400
And you have offered to take on the
task of setting up a local network.

212
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:06,757
The thing is,
this is avery sensitive issue ...

213
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:12,276
Hey! What's going on here?
- Won't you share your objections?

214
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,792
What's bloody Brussels done now?

215
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,119
We're going to build a mosque.
- All right.

216
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:22,397
Would you like to join
our mosque discussion group?

217
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:25,754
I won't say no.
- Should we go and have a look?

218
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,441
Tony from the Liberal Press is
due in 30 minutes to take pictures.

219
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:33,680
Good press relations
are as vital as hell ...

220
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:40,031
Remember the reception
at Ellen and Anne's tomorrow.

221
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm flying Frankfurt-Madrid
tomorrow.

222
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:51,679
So you only get home on Sunday?
- Yes. Are you coming to bed?

223
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:04,272
I might send Oskar over to mum's
for the weekend.

224
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,121
I need to work.

225
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,195
Won't you come to bed?

226
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,675
Tom ...

227
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:16,434
Listen, you're going
to have to talk to Anja.

228
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:21,833
Seriously, you have to ...
You have to talk to her.

229
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,551
For Oskar's sake.

230
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:30,681
What time's the reception?
- Just come when you like.

231
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,999
What about Caroline?

232
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,842
What about her?
- Is she coming?

233
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:39,559
I don't know.
How the fuck should I know?

234
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,916
Brilliant! Thanks!

235
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,512
You look fabulous, darling!
- Thanks. So do you.

236
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,199
Who else is coming?
- Everyone.

237
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:59,078
Dip-lnge showed up at half two.
- We were thrilled to bits.

238
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:01,513
You should really go up to the bar.
The whole gang's there.

239
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:07,753
It'd be so typical of Sailor to
give me a gift voucher for Chrissy.

240
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:12,036
Hi, gorgeous! You look fabulous!
- Congratulations.

241
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:13,961
Everyone's over there.

242
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:18,873
But he wants to take me skiing
in January. Skiing! Me!

243
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:23,157
There's what's-her-name.
- Hi ...

244
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,675
Wow! Hi!

245
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:29,642
Can I get anyone a drink?
- Yes, a G& ...

246
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,792
Hi, Jacob!
- A pint, please.

247
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:42,200
Where's my little brother the pilot?
- Out flying.

248
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:45,236
Is he working?
I must have the wrong number.

249
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,401
He says hello.
He won't be home till Sunday.

250
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:55,678
Oh, that's all right.
- Was I supposed to get you one?

251
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:59,319
Never mind.
I'm trying to cut down.

252
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,115
All right.

253
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,156
So you're home alone until Sunday?

254
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:08,595
How about I drop round
for tea and a bit of muff?

255
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:12,832
A bit of muff?
That sounds exciting! What's that?

256
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:16,681
Shall we dance?
- Yes!!!

257
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,835
It certainly is getting cold,
isn't it?

258
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,635
Anyway, we should be ...

259
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:39,520
Are you leaving?
- Some of us have to work.

260
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:42,157
W-O-R-K spells job ... ouch!

261
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,120
I have ajob too, you know!
- Yes, you do.

262
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,961
See you, boys.

263
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:01,235
Aren't you coming?
- In a sec.

264
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:01,395
Aren't you coming?
- In a sec.

265
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:07,392
Nice rack, that new girl.
I wouldn't mind doing her.

266
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,400
She's zero years old ...

267
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,640
How about finding
someone your own age?

268
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:15,881
Just to see what it's like?
- Great rack, eh?

269
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:19,439
Actually, I pulled the bartender
at that dyke do.

270
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,431
Went over to her place, and
it really smelled cookery-like.

271
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,759
She'd baked nut pie.
- So?

272
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:28,875
Turns out she's avegetarian.
Who wants to fuck avegetarian?

273
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,075
Theywon't suck cock.
I mean, they don't like meat.

274
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:36,242
Anyway, suddenlywe're in bed,
and she's on top.

275
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:41,756
And to show some initiative, I
politely shoved a finger up her bum.

276
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:43,601
That really got her off.

277
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:47,955
When I got home and brushed my
teeth, I caught awhiff of my finger.

278
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,882
It fucking smelled of nut pie.
Want one?

279
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,039
You're sick.
- I'm sick?

280
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,997
Your kind of sex was illegal
for most of the last century.

281
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:59,433
Are you coming, orwhat?
- In a sec.

282
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:03,113
Nice arse in those shoes.
- Cheers.

283
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:08,352
Listen Jacob,
I really respect you.

284
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:11,555
Great.
- Hey, seriously.

285
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:15,119
Honestly, you're a really great ...
- Architect.

286
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,520
And I really don't mind
that other business ...

287
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:20,520
Stop it. You're drunk.

288
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:25,394
Will you lay off, for fuck's sake?
I'm not the firm's token poof.

289
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:42,395
Hl, Carollne speaklng.

290
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,475
You moron!

291
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:57,639
Do you want to come in?
I've just had a shower.

292
00:26:57,843 --> 00:27:00,721
I mean, I'll put the kettle on.
- No, thanks.

293
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:04,802
I just wanted to ask about
an advent present for Oskar.

294
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:09,032
But it's already December8.

295
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,157
I meant Christmas present.

296
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:50,236
Ouch!
- Okay.

297
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,675
Jacob?

298
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,675
A huge do might be nice, though.

299
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,351
With Adrian and
Palle as bridesmaids.

300
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:07,201
Yeah, right.

301
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,633
Was it a good office party?

302
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,996
The usual.

303
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:19,713
Finn got drunk and all touchy-feely.
You know.

304
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:25,115
I think I'll go to bed.
I'm knackered.

305
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,994
Will you get that?

306
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:33,556
Where the fuck did you go?
You just disappeared.

307
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:38,755
Did you pull the new girl?

308
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:45,473
Listen, Mads, I'll call you later.
I have to go and puke.

309
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:52,555
What?

310
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,200
"Did you pull the new girl!"

311
00:28:57,123 --> 00:29:01,002
I'll just lie down.
- Want me to tuck you in?

312
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:04,151
So, you want more cock?
- Yes.

313
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:06,923
What do we say?
- Yes, please.

314
00:29:48,563 --> 00:29:50,235
Hey, Tom!

315
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,437
My dear brother.

316
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,835
Merry Christmas.

317
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:04,040
Are you working between
Christmas and New Year?

318
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:07,041
What? Abandon
Baby Oskar and the Virgin Caroline?

319
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,803
Air traffic doesn't
stop for Christmas.

320
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:12,437
I'm down for a triple
on 30 December.

321
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:16,113
What's a triple?
- Helsinki, London, Bergen.

322
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:19,360
So you won't be home
for New Year's Eve?

323
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:23,397
Promise you'll look after her.
We don't want any accidents.

324
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:37,755
Carollne speaklng.
- Hi, it's Jacob.

325
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:41,922
I was just wondering about
Oskar's Christmas present.

326
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:46,355
It's alreadyDecember22.
- Does he want anything?

327
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,440
Or do you?

328
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,396
What do you want?

329
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,801
You.

330
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,321
Yes.

331
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:05,481
Darling?

332
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:07,635
Darling?
- Yes?

333
00:31:07,963 --> 00:31:11,000
I can't make the trip
to your parents' tonight.

334
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,116
They phoned from work.
About the structural engineering.

335
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,518
I won't bore you with the details.

336
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:21,602
It's the entrance. They've
scheduled a meeting for tonight.

337
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:26,433
No, tomorrow, but I'll have to
prepare it tonight. I'm really sorry.

338
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:28,201
Great.

339
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:40,992
Couldn't they have left the mosque
in Christmas peace?

340
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:43,398
Nobody needs
mosques at Christmas.

341
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:45,161
Or maybe they do?

342
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:56,953
I'll see you on Christmas Eve.

343
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,955
'Bye, sweetheart.

344
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,762
All right, girls?

345
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,915
Yes.

346
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,595
Darling?

347
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:25,881
I forgot. It's my study group's
Christmas get-together tonight.

348
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:30,520
We all have to take a little prezzie.
- But I'm on stand-by!

349
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:36,161
The airline could phone any time.
I can't leave Oskar at home alone.

350
00:32:36,363 --> 00:32:38,797
Well, give lnge a ring,
or my mother.

351
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:40,800
I won't be gone long.

352
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:44,395
Why the heck
won't you take some initiative?

353
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:47,117
He's your son!

354
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:49,676
Sorry.

355
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,956
'Bye.

356
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,001
'Bye.

357
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:26,437
I know, I know, I know!

358
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:30,363
Hi. Come in.

359
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,638
Bust.

360
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:00,196
Right.

361
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:02,361
Clubs.

362
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:07,717
Clubs ...
I thought you preferred chains.

363
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:14,836
Chains!
- Honestly ... Chains!

364
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,441
1-0.

365
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,235
Did you come?

366
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,115
Almost.
- Right.

367
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,882
Well, we'll just have to do it again.

368
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,957
But sir! We really can't have that.

369
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:15,675
Hi, love, I was just going to call
you.

370
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,475
Allsetfortomorrow?
- They cancelled.

371
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,277
Typical! So I'll be
over in the morning.

372
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:25,034
You can getallft from Tom
andCarollneln the afternoon.

373
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:29,721
I'm reallysorryl was sogrumpy.

374
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:33,673
Darllng?Jacob?

375
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:19,275
Have you been a good boy?
- Sure.

376
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,516
Wanna see
what Santa put in your stocking?

377
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,874
You're so bloody childish!
- Childish?

378
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:31,680
Come on.
- Cut it out!

379
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:36,713
Come on, you fucking faggot.
- What did you call me?

380
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:18,157
Cheers.

381
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:35,152
God, what a boring jumper.

382
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:40,321
If only it had been really ugly.
Or at least home-made.

383
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:42,913
But it isn't.
It's just green.

384
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:48,402
If it just had a neat little touch,
a stripe, or a stain ...

385
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,241
Or a price tag.

386
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,841
Are you in love with her?

387
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:08,521
I don't know.

388
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,716
Jørgen ...

389
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,001
Listen ...

390
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:33,279
That's one of the reasons
you've been transferred here.

391
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:37,874
We have the necessary
in-house capacity and expertise.

392
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:43,519
And we're doing
our absolute best ...

393
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,715
... Jørgen.

394
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:52,555
But I'm afraid there's a risk -

395
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:56,312
- of severe visual impairment
to your right eye.

396
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:59,754
Left.
- Well, your left.

397
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,476
And ...

398
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:06,234
Excuse me.
If our tests show that the damage -

399
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:11,437
- to the nervus opticus is
so extensive as to necessitate ...

400
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:18,551
... the surgical
excision of the eye, -

401
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:22,642
- you will of course
be supplied with a prosthesis.

402
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:26,321
'Bye-bye eye.

403
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,315
Goody, goody.

404
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,201
Right ...

405
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:53,722
You're not doing too well, are you?

406
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:58,001
It was my fault.
- Of course it wasn't!

407
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:03,115
He was drunk. It was pure luck
he didn't run over anyone ...

408
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:05,712
I slept with Caroline.
- What?

409
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:12,315
I told him ... Well, he asked.
- You slept with Caroline?

410
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:15,600
CarollneCaroline?

411
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:19,279
You slept with her?
When?

412
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,036
Once.

413
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,076
And then you went and told Jørgen?

414
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:35,681
That was bloody stupid, wasn't it?
What did you do that for?

415
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,518
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

416
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,640
Keep your pecker up, OK?
- I'm fine.

417
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:51,232
I'll never be a pilot, that's all.

418
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:53,195
Oskar says hello.

419
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:58,401
I have to go. I've got to be
at the airport in half an hour.

420
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,834
Do you need anything?
- No ... Yes, Toblerone.

421
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,874
And an eye.

422
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:18,235
'Bye, love.

423
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:24,953
What happened?

424
00:42:27,163 --> 00:42:30,155
Well, I'm going to lose an eye.

425
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:35,232
On the other hand I wasn't
really using it for anything.

426
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,401
Jørgen ...
- Caroline.

427
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:42,881
You should leave.

428
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,160
I need some shut-eye.

429
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:50,555
Right.

430
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,362
See you.

431
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:07,676
What happened?
- I don't know. It's a real fuck-up.

432
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:11,922
I mean Jørgen. Whywas he out
in the middle of the night?

433
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,761
PoorJørgen.

434
00:43:18,603 --> 00:43:21,163
You didn't tell him, did you?

435
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:23,601
Did you, Jacob?

436
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:28,835
That wasn't why he went off ...?
- I didn't tell him. He asked me.

437
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:31,876
You didn't tell him, did you?
- No, I didn't.

438
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,722
You didn't bloody tell him, did you?

439
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:36,715
He guessed, Caroline.

440
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:44,200
That's the first part of the trilogy.
You needn't botherwith the others.

441
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:46,280
Do I need to read this one?

442
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:49,839
Are you covered for painkillers?

443
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:54,360
I've brought you a funny hat
for New Year's Eve.

444
00:43:56,483 --> 00:44:02,479
Right, I'll be off. I have to go
entertain up in the children's ward.

445
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:09,441
Tell me if there's anything I can do.
- We will.

446
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:12,632
There's more stuff in the bag.

447
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,040
Happy New Year.

448
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,801
Bombarec.

449
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:19,836
If it's going to be a happy one.
- Champagne?

450
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:22,398
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.

451
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:34,512
How's the mosque coming along?
- Fuck the mosque.

452
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:45,920
Jørgen, I'm sorry ...
- There, there.

453
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:55,760
Please say something.

454
00:44:57,043 --> 00:45:01,161
I guess I'll lose my driving license.
But I wasn't really using it.

455
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:02,921
Please.

456
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:06,513
Go home and get some rest, Jacob.
You look knackered.

457
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:10,079
I want to stay.
- I'm knackered. Go home.

458
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,595
Happy New Year.

459
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,037
See you.

460
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:39,961
Mummy!

461
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:42,761
Oskar!

462
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:47,238
Did dad come home last night?

463
00:46:48,563 --> 00:46:50,758
No.
It must have been a dream.

464
00:46:50,963 --> 00:46:53,636
Maybe it was Santa.

465
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:04,442
Don't be sad.
Are you sad?

466
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:14,638
You're being noisy.
- What?

467
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:18,199
You're being noisy.
- Oh.

468
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:26,479
Shouldn't you try and get away?
- I can't. Jørgen's due home.

469
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:28,913
You wouldn't have to go far.

470
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,795
Don't worry.

471
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:04,436
Tom's in Madrid.
- I know.

472
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,917
Thanks.

473
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,678
Why do they put
shrimp salad on hot dogs?

474
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:32,111
Thanks.

475
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:49,596
What are you thinking?

476
00:49:57,803 --> 00:49:59,634
That's pretty.

477
00:50:01,523 --> 00:50:03,115
Thanks.

478
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:10,918
Could you hold on to this for a sec?
- Sure.

479
00:50:11,123 --> 00:50:14,559
I need to pee.
In the Ladies'.

480
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,355
Jacob!

481
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,794
Doing a bit of Swedish
bargain hunting?

482
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:51,238
No! I know! You've come over
to buyJørgen that Armani suit!

483
00:50:51,443 --> 00:50:53,035
I told you, Palle!

484
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:56,997
It's wonderful the wayyou're trying
to cheerJørgen up.

485
00:50:57,203 --> 00:51:00,912
I still rememberwhen Adrian had
his tonsils out. That was tough.

486
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,557
You were fantastic.
Yes, you were.

487
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:07,642
You were a rock ...
- Oh, such flattery!

488
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:13,361
You know, a tin like that
would normally cost you ...

489
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:19,913
What are you doing here?
Coming back from Lund?

490
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:24,321
Yes, they have some courses
I can't do in Copenhagen ...

491
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:28,960
I was here the whole time,
and I didn't even see you.

492
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:32,075
I didn't even see her
come out of the Ladies'.

493
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:34,797
And Palle and Adrian
are in Sweden too!

494
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:37,437
What time did you say
the shops close?

495
00:51:37,643 --> 00:51:39,793
Amazing!
See you back home!

496
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:49,238
Right, we'd better ...
- Yeah.

497
00:51:55,803 --> 00:51:59,512
The BridesheadCafé,
Frederik speaking.

498
00:52:14,443 --> 00:52:17,879
You just walked off.
You left me standing there.

499
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:19,881
Oh, not really.

500
00:52:27,323 --> 00:52:31,953
Where's my hot dog?
- I had to eat it, didn't l?

501
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:37,915
Sorry, but where were you
I'm sure they don't suspect anything.

502
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:47,156
I'm telling you, ifyou did that!
With your sister-in-law!

503
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:47,436
I'm telling you, ifyou did that!
With your sister-in-law!

504
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:51,158
A glrl!
I would kick you out on the spot.

505
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:07,559
It's no good.
Is it?

506
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:11,120
Shouldn't I just go home?

507
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:14,401
Yes.

508
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:18,395
I have to pick up
Jørgen tomorrow afternoon.

509
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:23,321
Then I suppose
I had better go now.

510
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:26,121
Goodbye.

511
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,434
Perhaps you'd better stay?

512
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:51,641
Jacob and Caroline.
Adrian told me.

513
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:55,074
He said he ran into them in Malmø,
and they looked really guilty.

514
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:56,955
Fuck him, fucking poof!

515
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:01,801
Have you heard?

516
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:06,235
Theywere such a great couple.
The only happy couple on the scene.

517
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,640
Oh, please!
- Why did she have to barge in?

518
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:11,401
You're no better.

519
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:15,357
Sailor and I haven't
been cottaging foryonks.

520
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:19,833
Do you think he screws her?
Do you think he licks her ...

521
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:21,721
I should think so.

522
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:25,552
What's the difference between
drinking warm lager and eating pussy?

523
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,878
Don't ask me!

524
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,438
Lager always tastes of piss.

525
00:54:31,283 --> 00:54:33,922
I'm really in a tither.

526
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:38,156
What about Jørgen?

527
00:54:38,563 --> 00:54:43,683
He must be completely ...
Gosh, this looks like Sailor's ...

528
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:49,922
Do you want a beer?
- I'd rather have a tequila slammer.

529
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:12,718
Who is it?

530
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:18,122
You needn't come down, I've a big
strong ambulance driver to help me.

531
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:21,395
I'll open the door.

532
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:06,555
I'm homo!

533
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:16,352
This is Frank. He's our
national pentathlon champion.

534
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:21,116
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Could I have some juice?

535
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:22,961
Get well soon.

536
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:31,519
Wasn't I supposed to
pick you up at four?

537
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:34,362
I made a speedy recovery.

538
00:56:35,443 --> 00:56:37,638
The place looks really nice.

539
00:56:57,483 --> 00:56:59,360
Oh, God ...

540
00:57:00,563 --> 00:57:02,838
How many times did you meet?

541
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:05,871
Not that many.
- Pardon?

542
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,641
Not that many.

543
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:11,552
Not that many?
That's more than once, right?

544
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,155
How many times?

545
00:57:15,483 --> 00:57:18,919
How many times?
- It's not like that. Not like us.

546
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:21,035
Not like us?

547
00:57:23,803 --> 00:57:26,033
Has she been sleeping here?

548
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,596
Just once.

549
00:57:33,723 --> 00:57:35,839
Jørgen please!

550
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:37,761
Calm down!

551
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:41,842
I won't see her again!
I won't see her again, all right?

552
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:44,201
I won't see her again.

553
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:47,241
I won't see her again.

554
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:55,955
"Dear Dorothy,
I'm a man in his thirties, -

555
00:57:56,163 --> 00:57:59,951
- who has spent the past months
chained to a hospital bed.

556
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:02,518
When I'm discharged
I discover-

557
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:07,399
- that my partner has been sleeping
with ... pardon my French, a woman.

558
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:10,834
Have I been living a lie?

559
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:15,396
Should I get a sex change?
And can I get one on the NHS?

560
00:58:15,603 --> 00:58:20,393
Whywon't you be serious for once?
I'm sorry.

561
00:58:22,883 --> 00:58:24,396
What can I say?

562
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:28,075
I love you.

563
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:35,036
I do.
I love you.

564
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:38,919
I've really been missing you.

565
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:50,522
Aren't they gorgeous?

566
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:50,922
Aren't they gorgeous?

567
00:58:57,323 --> 00:59:00,793
Near miss.
- I can't judge distances anymore.

568
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:02,834
I can't wait
for my glass eye.

569
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,682
I can't see a thing
through this patch.

570
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:14,802
Oh, Frederik.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:25,954
Hi, love.

572
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:29,473
Did you have to work late again?
- Yes.

573
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:31,196
I'll bet.

574
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:40,398
Aren't you staying for dinner?
- No.

575
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:44,357
Sailor is taking me to
a Kiri Te Kanawa concert.

576
00:59:46,803 --> 00:59:51,399
Take care.
- You take care of him, or else!

577
00:59:51,603 --> 00:59:53,195
'Bye.

578
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:58,237
Listen, shouldn't we get some help?

579
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,680
A psychologist or a therapissed ...
- You mean a therapist?

580
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:05,841
Well, let's start
with a therapissed.

581
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:14,121
What do you say?

582
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:21,198
A marriage counsellor? Fine.
But I refuse to play Ophelia.

583
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:24,918
Try and find the core
ofyour relationship.

584
01:00:25,123 --> 01:00:27,842
Do things together.

585
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:31,638
Like washing up together.
- We have a dishwasher.

586
01:00:31,843 --> 01:00:36,394
Fine. But really dirty dishes ...
Do you know what I mean?

587
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:38,161
Yes.
- No.

588
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:43,756
Or folding laundry.
A tablecloth or a sheet.

589
01:00:47,283 --> 01:00:49,319
A sheet.
- It's a metaphor.

590
01:00:49,523 --> 01:00:51,115
Get up.

591
01:00:54,243 --> 01:00:55,995
Here's a sheet.

592
01:00:57,443 --> 01:00:59,001
Fold it.

593
01:01:17,723 --> 01:01:21,511
You see, you really have to be
sensitive to the other person.

594
01:01:25,483 --> 01:01:28,043
Good.
We'll work on that next time.

595
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:37,441
How did that feel?
Try and put it into words.

596
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:41,673
Well, at first
I thought it was really hard.

597
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:46,156
Perhaps we should go out to dinner.
- Ask Jørgen.

598
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,192
Do you want to go out to dinner?

599
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,596
I'm not hungry.

600
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:58,242
Right, that's it for today.
Remember: it's all right to cuddle.

601
01:01:58,443 --> 01:02:00,911
But no sex.
- I hope that's OK byyou.

602
01:02:01,123 --> 01:02:02,681
Absolutely.

603
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,561
No thanks.

604
01:02:13,923 --> 01:02:16,039
Delicious, eh?
- Cruelty to animals ...

605
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:17,153
No way.

606
01:02:19,043 --> 01:02:23,594
Actually I read that when
the peasant rings his little bell, -

607
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:26,522
- all the geese come
running to be fed.

608
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:29,283
Theywouldn't if it hurt,
would they?

609
01:02:29,483 --> 01:02:31,394
I know the feeling.
- What?

610
01:02:31,843 --> 01:02:33,435
Nothing.

611
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:40,513
Shall we go to the cinema?
- I have to get up early.

612
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:43,795
Shall we go for awalk? Walk home?
- In the rain?

613
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,241
Yes.

614
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:11,114
I could take a couple of days off.
We could go to Paris.

615
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:16,036
Ifyou like.
And we don't have to eat foie gras.

616
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:23,880
We really must be going.
- Hi, darling ...

617
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:33,799
You're late. How was the meeting?
- All right.

618
01:03:35,043 --> 01:03:38,194
Where have you been?
- Nowhere. Just ...

619
01:03:38,403 --> 01:03:40,837
On his building site.
They're so busy.

620
01:03:41,123 --> 01:03:44,320
It's wonderful to see you.
- Hi, Mum.

621
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:47,799
Dad and I just stopped by
on ourway to the theatre.

622
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,880
We brought you a little something.

623
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:53,758
Nothing fancy, we just thought ...

624
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,796
Thanks.

625
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:59,563
We'll be off, then.

626
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:04,075
Off to the gas station.
- The Gas Plant Theatre.

627
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:09,152
To see that blonde
who's in The Celebratlon.

628
01:04:09,363 --> 01:04:12,673
Right, we'll be off, then.
So good to see you, darling.

629
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,794
'Bye.
- 'Bye, Dad.

630
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:18,321
'Bye-bye.

631
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:25,556
Christ, what a day.

632
01:04:26,683 --> 01:04:29,800
Thank God we're going away
tomorrow.

633
01:04:31,643 --> 01:04:34,715
You smell of metal.

634
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:07,114
God, you're gorgeous.
Isn't she gorgeous?

635
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:09,996
Definitely.
- Thanks.

636
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:17,234
I'm just going to take a pee.

637
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:36,161
Jørgen?

638
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:49,275
Won't you come out?

639
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,676
No.

640
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:55,043
We have to go in a minute.

641
01:05:56,403 --> 01:05:58,553
I don't want to.

642
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:02,111
What don't you want?

643
01:06:03,763 --> 01:06:05,754
I don't want anything.

644
01:06:33,443 --> 01:06:36,515
At some point you're going to
have to do things byyourself.

645
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:37,475
At some point you're going to
have to do things byyourself.

646
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:40,001
I'm sorry.

647
01:06:43,123 --> 01:06:47,753
Are you ... you know, gay?

648
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:52,637
Yes, I am.

649
01:06:53,803 --> 01:06:57,796
It's just because l, you know, like,
I think I might be too.

650
01:06:58,163 --> 01:06:59,437
I see.
- I was wondering ...

651
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:03,079
Maybe you could get me some,
you know, like, brochures?

652
01:07:03,283 --> 01:07:05,558
Yes, of course.

653
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:08,240
Cheers.

654
01:07:12,683 --> 01:07:15,641
How about a stint on a school ship?
- A school ship? Yes ...

655
01:07:17,323 --> 01:07:20,520
How about suicide?

656
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:27,356
It's just not on, is it?

657
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:32,353
I don't think I can do this ...
- No, I know.

658
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,719
I'm pregnant.

659
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:41,271
I haven't told Tom yet.

660
01:07:42,483 --> 01:07:44,155
I could get an ...

661
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,272
I mean, ifyou don't want to.
I don't even know what I want.

662
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,997
I don't know what to do.
I'm sorry.

663
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:55,558
Are you pregnant?

664
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:57,515
But that's wonderful.

665
01:07:57,843 --> 01:08:00,403
Of course you're going
to have that baby. We are.

666
01:08:08,243 --> 01:08:09,756
Hi.

667
01:08:10,283 --> 01:08:12,239
Hi, love.
- Jørgen ...

668
01:08:12,443 --> 01:08:15,674
No, wait.
There's something I want to say.

669
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:18,238
I've been practising all day.

670
01:08:22,883 --> 01:08:26,432
I'm sorry it's taken me so long.

671
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:30,033
I'm just a country lad.

672
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:34,555
And there's something else too.
Shouldn't we drop counselling?

673
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:37,402
We can handle this,
we have done before.

674
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:44,081
There you go.

675
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:48,881
Hi, darling.

676
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:56,196
Where's Oskar?
- At Andreas' house.

677
01:09:07,963 --> 01:09:09,476
Listen.

678
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:13,596
I'm really sorry
I've been so weird lately.

679
01:09:13,803 --> 01:09:15,873
The thing is, I'm pregnant.

680
01:09:16,963 --> 01:09:18,521
Are you pregnant?

681
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:22,760
Are we having a baby?
Oh, darling ...

682
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:27,878
I want to have that baby.
- You want and want and want!

683
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:31,678
You know I want to have children.
I always have. You know that.

684
01:09:31,883 --> 01:09:35,114
Are you trying to stop me?
'Cos I would never try and stop you.

685
01:09:35,323 --> 01:09:38,440
I love you.
I would never do that to you.

686
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,113
I think you should leave now.

687
01:09:43,803 --> 01:09:46,795
God, we're really good at this,
aren't we?

688
01:09:57,963 --> 01:09:59,874
Anybody home?

689
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:03,554
Good partyyesterday?

690
01:10:03,763 --> 01:10:07,517
Caroline is ...
She's got a bun in the oven.

691
01:10:07,723 --> 01:10:10,317
Caroline is pregnant.

692
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,514
You're going to be an uncle.

693
01:10:12,723 --> 01:10:14,361
Congratulations.

694
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,761
Shouldn't they be put in avase?

695
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:22,431
Actually, I brought you something.

696
01:10:23,643 --> 01:10:25,281
There you go.

697
01:10:25,843 --> 01:10:29,597
Smells better than
your usual eau-de-poof.

698
01:10:31,763 --> 01:10:35,073
Well, I'd better be
getting home to mumsy.

699
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,073
Don't bother getting up. 'Bye.

700
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,516
What's wrong?
Was it the aftershave?

701
01:10:50,723 --> 01:10:53,521
Haven't you got it yet,
you stupid twat?

702
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,438
What?

703
01:10:55,643 --> 01:11:00,398
Why can't you do anything right?
You never could!

704
01:11:01,163 --> 01:11:04,155
What have I done?
- Haven't you got it yet?

705
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:07,352
They're fucking!

706
01:11:08,923 --> 01:11:12,632
Yourwife is fucking my husband.
Are you blind?

707
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:25,681
You just have
to twist it like this ...

708
01:11:23,003 --> 01:11:25,801
You just have
to twist it like this ...

709
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:46,641
Have you been kicked out?
Where are you going to stay?

710
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:49,957
You can't move in with your parents.

711
01:11:50,163 --> 01:11:53,394
Welcome, Caroline.
How wonderful that you two ...

712
01:11:53,603 --> 01:11:56,071
Would you pass the gravy?
- Of course.

713
01:11:56,283 --> 01:12:00,037
I'm so glad to be of help.
And we have loads of space.

714
01:12:00,243 --> 01:12:03,280
The prodigal son returns.
- Isn't it wonderful?

715
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:05,235
Yes. Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

716
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:07,115
Sorry!

717
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:15,718
Happy Birthday to Jørgen ...

718
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:23,434
I've always dreamt of having
a birthday like this.

719
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:27,081
I'm sorry.

720
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:34,598
Happy Birthday.
- Forget it.

721
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:43,871
Yeah, take the bloody thing.
After all, your mother made it.

722
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,119
I suppose she's well pleased?

723
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:52,793
I'm just going to make us
a nice cup of tea and sandwiches.

724
01:12:57,283 --> 01:12:58,955
Happy Birthday.

725
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:03,281
Happy Birthday.

726
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:07,522
We couldn't abandon you,
today of all days.

727
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:09,236
Cheer up, eh?

728
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:14,392
Well, well, I thought
he found himself a nuclear family.

729
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:18,437
Jørgen, no! Don't let him!

730
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:23,319
They've been impossible to lay
hands on since theywere banned.

731
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:25,400
This one's
worth a fortune!

732
01:13:25,603 --> 01:13:28,356
It was my grandfather's.
- Don't let him take everythlng!

733
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:30,872
It was his grandfather's.
- Still!

734
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:38,081
There's been a fuck-up
with the moving van.

735
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:42,242
I've been calling all morning
but he's not answering.

736
01:13:42,643 --> 01:13:45,077
This is Nynne.
- Synne!

737
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:47,114
Sorry.
- That's all right.

738
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,883
Synne by name, sin by nature.

739
01:13:50,203 --> 01:13:53,275
Sandwiches!

740
01:13:53,483 --> 01:13:55,280
Thank God you called.

741
01:13:55,483 --> 01:13:59,556
I was lying on the sofa considering
whether to slit mywrists.

742
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:02,755
Sailor'd said he'd come over
though it isn't Tuesday or ...

743
01:14:02,963 --> 01:14:03,918
What do you do?

744
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:06,159
I've got my A-levels
this summer-

745
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:12,279
- and then I'd like to to something
with design or media ... multimedia.

746
01:14:12,483 --> 01:14:14,951
Any good-looking girls
in your class?

747
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:18,200
Well, there's these two girls
called Christine ...

748
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:19,916
And he stood me up!

749
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,639
Oh well, fuck him! Or rather
no more fucking him, I'm fed up.

750
01:14:25,843 --> 01:14:28,835
Of course you are.

751
01:14:29,043 --> 01:14:31,841
Aren't you going to
tell Jørgen about ...

752
01:14:32,043 --> 01:14:35,160
We've fenced the whole
cottage garden.

753
01:14:35,363 --> 01:14:37,319
It cost 22,000!

754
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:39,479
Why on earth ...

755
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,833
So the cats
won't get run over.

756
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:45,115
22,000?
You could have them shot for 1500.

757
01:14:45,323 --> 01:14:47,393
No. That'd cost
a grand apiece.

758
01:14:47,603 --> 01:14:50,481
Why do you keep cats anyway?
- You wouldn't understand.

759
01:14:50,683 --> 01:14:55,677
Why don't you have them put down?
What with Adrian's allergy and all?

760
01:14:55,883 --> 01:15:01,162
You never told me about your allergy.
- You never asked.

761
01:15:08,043 --> 01:15:11,080
Will you shut the fuck up!

762
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:19,432
I bear a deep sorrow.
Don't you understand?

763
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:24,801
My beloved ...

764
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:30,712
My beloved has left me.
Do you understand?

765
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:36,994
I'm in the middle of a crisis.

766
01:15:38,883 --> 01:15:40,874
Wow, are you gay?

767
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,472
All right, out!
- What?

768
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:47,596
That's enough.
Offyou go. This way.

769
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:50,556
'Bye.
Out you go.

770
01:15:57,003 --> 01:15:59,836
"Gay!"
- Please leave.

771
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,675
You too. Please leave. All ofyou.
- Come on.

772
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:12,120
We were only trying to help.
- Come along, Palle.

773
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:14,555
See you.

774
01:16:15,843 --> 01:16:17,435
You too, Frederik.

775
01:17:28,363 --> 01:17:31,241
Please go now.

776
01:18:18,363 --> 01:18:20,831
What do you want?
- The doorwas open ...

777
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:22,715
What do you want?

778
01:18:22,923 --> 01:18:25,118
Well, my parents
kicked me out ...

779
01:18:25,323 --> 01:18:27,075
Why?

780
01:18:27,443 --> 01:18:30,241
I said I wanted
to sail on that school ship.

781
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:32,240
That's no reason to kick you out.

782
01:18:32,443 --> 01:18:35,241
Well, I also told them I was,
you know, like, gay.

783
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,240
Right.
Come in.

784
01:18:38,883 --> 01:18:40,635
You can sleep on the sofa.

785
01:18:41,043 --> 01:18:44,319
Wow, you have, like,
really good taste!

786
01:18:45,963 --> 01:18:47,635
This whole area ...

787
01:18:47,843 --> 01:18:49,834
Wait!

788
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:53,592
First we need to work out who's
bringing cake to the next meeting.

789
01:18:53,803 --> 01:18:56,715
I could whip up one
of those pound cakes.

790
01:18:56,923 --> 01:19:01,041
Pound of flour, pound of sugar.
- Excellent! Go on.

791
01:19:32,123 --> 01:19:35,638
That's ...
- I just wanted to drop off the keys.

792
01:19:35,843 --> 01:19:37,356
The green one.

793
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:45,238
I don't need them, so just ...

794
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:49,442
Have a nice weekend.
- 'Bye.

795
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:57,878
Ifyou're going to walk around
half naked, do it in your own room.

796
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:11,876
Do you want feta cheese in ...
- That'll do fine.

797
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:15,439
And don't worry about the sausage,
it's organic.

798
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:19,279
Stop drawing, Hans-Henrik.
We're going to eat now.

799
01:20:19,483 --> 01:20:21,758
Would you like to start?
- Thanks.

800
01:20:23,763 --> 01:20:25,321
No, thanks!

801
01:20:26,563 --> 01:20:28,235
There he is.

802
01:20:28,483 --> 01:20:29,916
Good evening, son.

803
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:33,957
Svendsen says hello.
You know, from the riding school.

804
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:36,672
Isn't this nice?
- Caroline?

805
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:42,237
What the hell are you at?
You're coming home with me.

806
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:44,081
Oskar misses you.
- You'd better go.

807
01:20:44,283 --> 01:20:47,161
Shut up, you fucking faggot.
Fucking poof!

808
01:20:47,363 --> 01:20:49,513
This isn't the time.

809
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:54,478
You'd better have an abortion
so you don't give birth to a poof.

810
01:20:56,803 --> 01:20:59,681
Come with me.

811
01:21:05,723 --> 01:21:08,442
Should I ...?
- No, Dad.

812
01:21:15,723 --> 01:21:19,432
Did he hit you?
- No, of course not!

813
01:21:19,643 --> 01:21:22,203
I'm sorry.
- Isn't there anything we can do?

814
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:26,316
Look, I'm really, really sorry.

815
01:21:29,883 --> 01:21:31,475
Is it true?
- What?

816
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:35,278
Is Caroline ...?
- Yes.

817
01:21:35,483 --> 01:21:38,759
Am I going to be a grandmother?
- Yes, Mum.

818
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:43,158
I think I need something stronger.
How about awhisky?

819
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:44,079
Yes ...

820
01:21:44,283 --> 01:21:48,435
No! I just passed the half-year mark.
I'll have some water.

821
01:21:54,483 --> 01:21:57,156
What are you doing?
- I have to go.

822
01:21:58,603 --> 01:22:02,039
I mean, what about Oskar?
I can't just leave him.

823
01:22:03,203 --> 01:22:04,477
He can move in with us.

824
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:07,151
Look, I'm needed.
- I need you.

825
01:22:07,363 --> 01:22:10,241
No, actuallyyou don't.
- Please don't go. Won't you ...

826
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:12,320
No.
- I'll work something out.

827
01:22:12,523 --> 01:22:16,072
We're going to have a baby.
- Exactly ...

828
01:22:16,283 --> 01:22:20,196
Oskar can come any time.
I'll find us another place to live.

829
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,041
We could get married.

830
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:37,152
Will you marry me?

831
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:43,394
This is so exciting!
You're getting married!

832
01:22:44,323 --> 01:22:46,120
But I thought he was ...

833
01:22:46,323 --> 01:22:49,633
It's just because ...
Not that that's important, -

834
01:22:49,843 --> 01:22:53,631
- but there's all that business
about custody.

835
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:57,153
We would be sending a signal ...

836
01:22:59,363 --> 01:23:02,082
I haven't got a clue what to do.
- Hold this.

837
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:05,912
There's nothing disgusting about it
as long as he's being breastfed.

838
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:36,361
Is Oskar home?
- No.

839
01:23:37,923 --> 01:23:39,515
May I come in?
- No.

840
01:23:40,203 --> 01:23:43,320
If there's anything I can do ...
- Go away, Anja.

841
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:45,753
I brought you cakes.
- Just go, Anja.

842
01:23:45,963 --> 01:23:48,921
Custard pies.
You used to love custard pies.

843
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:53,113
Right, I'll be off.

844
01:23:54,603 --> 01:23:56,833
I'm sorry, but I have to get to work.

845
01:23:57,043 --> 01:23:59,113
You know ...
- Air traffic.

846
01:24:00,563 --> 01:24:05,717
Perhaps air traffic isn't the most
important thing in the world.

847
01:24:05,923 --> 01:24:09,199
Offyou go.
- Give us a kiss.

848
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:11,871
Look, we've been through this
a hundred times.

849
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,517
You're banned for two weeks.
- Can I call you?

850
01:24:14,723 --> 01:24:18,875
Three weeks. That means
until the ... You work it out.

851
01:24:22,363 --> 01:24:27,039
And Our Lord Jesus Christ says:

852
01:24:27,243 --> 01:24:32,397
"A man must leave
his father and mother-

853
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:37,882
- and be bound to his wife
... no, not like that ...

854
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,517
... and the two will
become one flesh."

855
01:24:40,723 --> 01:24:43,556
Thank God, you got to keep the flat.
Can you afford it?

856
01:24:43,763 --> 01:24:47,312
I'm renting it out.
- At least they didn't get it.

857
01:24:47,523 --> 01:24:49,753
You're better offwithout him.

858
01:24:51,123 --> 01:24:54,559
Just trying to help.

859
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:58,761
What about that cab?
- I can't get through.

860
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:02,399
You'll really get to know the city.

861
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:05,993
Paris is just magnlfique
in the spring.

862
01:25:06,203 --> 01:25:09,752
Fuck, yes! All the chestnut trees
will be in blossom.

863
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:13,797
I'd love to come and visit.
How about the first week in July?

864
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:18,201
All the cab companies are on strike
because of some take-over.

865
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:20,519
I have to go,
or I'll miss my plane.

866
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:24,682
I could give Per from bowling a ring.
He drives a Mazda.

867
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:27,317
Offyou go, Dip-lnge!

868
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,392
Let the wake begin!

869
01:25:32,603 --> 01:25:35,675
And so I ask you, Jacob Stolze, -

870
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:41,480
- do you take Caroline Baumgarten
to be your lawful wedded wife?

871
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:51,592
And so I ask you, Jacob Stolze, -

872
01:25:51,803 --> 01:25:55,591
- do you take
Caroline Baumgarten ...

873
01:25:55,803 --> 01:25:59,239
... for better or forworse ...

874
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:04,283
Will you marry me?

875
01:26:07,523 --> 01:26:10,833
Yes, I will marryyou.

876
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:14,353
I'll be with you
for better or forworse.

877
01:26:23,163 --> 01:26:24,835
I love you.

878
01:26:26,523 --> 01:26:28,957
I love you too.

879
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:32,599
We'll work it out.
- Yes.

880
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:49,199
Jacob!

881
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:52,361
Hurry!

882
01:26:54,323 --> 01:26:57,201
You did it!

883
01:26:57,403 --> 01:27:00,281
You're amazing! I love you!
Not in that way.

884
01:27:03,003 --> 01:27:05,517
It's just been MOT'ed.

885
01:27:08,883 --> 01:27:10,362
And you know what?

886
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:14,272
They make
the most delicious crême brulée.

887
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:19,920
I'm so glad you called, lnge.

888
01:27:20,603 --> 01:27:22,082
Per.
- Palle.

889
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:24,035
Adrian.
- Hi.

890
01:27:30,843 --> 01:27:32,674
'Bye.

891
01:27:36,323 --> 01:27:39,713
You can't do more than 250,000
on one of those electric motors.

892
01:27:39,923 --> 01:27:43,472
But a new one costs a fortune,
so I just kept the old one.

893
01:27:44,963 --> 01:27:48,512
Jørgen? Jørgen!

894
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:52,281
Gross!

895
01:27:52,483 --> 01:27:55,475
Where is he?
- Oh, he's like ...

896
01:27:55,683 --> 01:27:58,243
He had to, like, you know ...

897
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:04,272
Speak or I'll fucking kill you!
- He went to Paris.

898
01:28:04,483 --> 01:28:06,838
He's off to Paris
on the plane.

899
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:09,762
What?
- At three o'clock.

900
01:28:13,323 --> 01:28:16,121
Keep your mouth shut
and get some braces.

901
01:28:19,883 --> 01:28:21,999
The airport! Now!

902
01:28:22,203 --> 01:28:23,841
See you.

903
01:28:34,683 --> 01:28:37,151
The airport.
- Strike.

904
01:28:37,363 --> 01:28:39,923
Pardon?
- Cabs're on strike.

905
01:28:40,123 --> 01:28:43,832
I'll give you five hundred.
- Do you think I'm a scab?

906
01:28:44,043 --> 01:28:45,635
Get out.

907
01:28:48,403 --> 01:28:51,475
If it's your horse,
it'll come back to you.

908
01:28:52,283 --> 01:28:54,478
What?
- Ifyou love each other ...

909
01:28:54,683 --> 01:28:57,277
No! Horse! Miss!

910
01:28:57,883 --> 01:29:00,397
Would you help me out?

911
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:02,833
The cabs are ...

912
01:29:03,043 --> 01:29:07,514
It's a long story, but the point is
I really need a horse.

913
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,953
Pardon?
- May I borrow your horse?

914
01:29:10,163 --> 01:29:13,041
Out of the question.

915
01:29:13,243 --> 01:29:14,835
I really need to.

916
01:29:24,323 --> 01:29:27,235
Naughty!
Handcuffs turn you on, eh?

917
01:30:37,843 --> 01:30:41,279
Can you stop that plane?
Would you call the pilot?

918
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:43,678
I'm afraid the plane just took off.

919
01:30:43,883 --> 01:30:48,195
Then you have to ... How do you ...
What's that button? Sorry.

920
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,316
I'm begging you.

921
01:30:51,523 --> 01:30:55,835
This is a matter
of life and death. Of love.

922
01:30:56,403 --> 01:30:59,554
Great love that's been
neglected for far too long.

923
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:01,321
We can't have that.

924
01:31:02,203 --> 01:31:07,675
I've avery insistant young man
in a tux with a bride's bouquet ...

925
01:31:07,883 --> 01:31:11,000
I'm sorry to botheryou,
really sorry, -

926
01:31:11,203 --> 01:31:14,673
- but you'll have to
turn your plane around.

927
01:31:14,883 --> 01:31:17,716
You see,
there's a man ...

928
01:31:17,923 --> 01:31:22,075
The man I love is on your plane,
and he doesn't know I love him.

929
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:25,195
There've been
all these misunderstandings, -

930
01:31:25,403 --> 01:31:28,281
- and I thought I had to do
something, but I don't.

931
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,077
Oh, yes,
my name is Jacob Stolze.

932
01:31:33,283 --> 01:31:35,433
He hung up.
Perhaps he had to go.

933
01:31:35,643 --> 01:31:38,237
Or perhaps the phone broke.

934
01:32:12,203 --> 01:32:14,319
This is your captain speaking.

935
01:32:14,523 --> 01:32:18,232
A minor problem has arisen.
We have to land right away.

936
01:32:18,443 --> 01:32:19,956
Don't panic ...

937
01:32:20,163 --> 01:32:24,361
It's just a communication problem.
We will keep you informed.

938
01:33:16,243 --> 01:33:19,633
Hi.
- Hi.

939
01:33:22,683 --> 01:33:24,321
Come on.

940
01:33:49,883 --> 01:33:52,955
Bloody queers!

941
01:34:29,283 --> 01:34:31,353
Could you give me a lift, sir?

942
01:34:34,723 --> 01:34:37,112
So you're not working today?
- No.

943
01:34:37,763 --> 01:34:41,836
There are more important things
in life than air traffic.
