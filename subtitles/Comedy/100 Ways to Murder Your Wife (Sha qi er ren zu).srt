THE CHRONICLES
OF WUSHU MASTERS

2
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,676
TRUE LEGEND
SU CAN (A.K.A. BEGGAR SU)

3
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,932
A YUEN WOO-PING FILM

4
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:02,646
China. 1861.
It is a turbulent time.

5
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:07,485
While foreign powers threaten
invasion...

6
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,995
As the nation descends into disorder...

7
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:26,796
the Qing Dynasty is
on the verge of collapse.

8
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:30,508
The people remain defiant.

9
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,680
The practice of Wushu flourishes.

10
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:39,517
And from the ashes of chaos...

11
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,478
a new warrior arises.

12
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,864
THE DECISIVE BATTLE

13
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:05,000
Su Can, the court's bravest soldier
and his men...

14
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:08,587
rescue an Imperial Prince
who's been kidnapped.

15
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,455
Quick. Follow me!

16
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,915
Kill him!

17
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,834
Kill him! Kill him!

18
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,153
Archers. Cover us!
The rest, follow me.

19
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,488
Kill!

20
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,050
I'll kill you!

21
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,843
Son of a bitch!

22
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,138
I'll kill you!

23
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,312
Son of a bitch!

24
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,816
Your Highness.
Are you alright?

25
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,651
Su, let's get out of here!

26
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,528
Ma, stay behind.
Yuan, come with me.

27
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,029
Yes, sir!

28
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,406
You bastard!

29
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,791
Son of a bitch!

30
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,902
Bastard!

31
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,571
Son of a bitch!

32
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,066
Ma!

33
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,157
Yuan, take the Prince to safety.

34
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,994
Su!

35
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,831
Go!

36
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:50,262
Your Highness. I'm afraid Su is dead.

37
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:54,433
Dead? Are you sure?

38
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,896
Take an elite team to find General Su.

39
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:02,191
Dead or alive, I want him here!

40
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,734
Yes, sir.

41
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,155
Su is back!

42
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,241
- Soldiers. Take him to the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

43
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,787
My dear brother.

44
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,669
Your Highness.
Colonel Ma and I are back.

45
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,964
Su, you are a great soldier.

46
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,510
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

47
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,934
Su, you saved my life.

48
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:40,229
I'll ask the Emperor...

49
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,315
to make you Governor of Hubei.

50
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:48,445
I am grateful for your consideration.
But I cannot claim all the credit.

51
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,240
Yuan was also there.

52
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:56,745
I know Yuan is your foster brother...

53
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,456
and the blood brother of your wife.

54
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,125
But he is too reckless...

55
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,419
you need to control Yuan.

56
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,550
If you're afraid
of hurting his feelings...

57
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,218
I will send Yuan to Sichuan.

58
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,637
I hope you'll accept.

59
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,557
Comrades!

60
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:19,935
General Su led us
to countless victories.

61
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,980
Enemies have fallen under his sword.

62
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,941
Let's toast our triumphs!

63
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,442
Cheers!

64
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,243
Ma, this is for you.

65
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,578
I can't accept!

66
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,830
A great sword
deserves a great warrior!

67
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:43,000
- You don't like it?
- No. Of course, I do.

68
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:45,711
- Then it's yours!
- Thank you!

69
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,797
- Put it to good use.
- Yes! I promise.

70
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,595
Why aren't you drinking?

71
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:00,183
A warrior should watch his drinking.

72
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,021
Yuan, a sip to our victory is okay.
I'll ask them to come drink with you.

73
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:07,065
With you here, I am not needed.

74
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:12,362
You're my brother.
They'll respect you.

75
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:17,826
You must take care of the troops
when I'm gone.

76
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,620
Why?

77
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,831
You're taking the promotion?
Nonsense!

78
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,583
I've decided to go home.

79
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,628
What? You just won a big battle.

80
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:33,759
This is your time. Don't walk away.

81
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,678
My mind's made up.
I leave tomorrow.

82
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,475
Honestly,
you're more suited for battles.

83
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:46,647
I've asked the Prince
to make you Governor.

84
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,691
The Prince despises me.

85
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,276
I know.

86
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,237
But if I'm not here...

87
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,906
he will look at you differently.

88
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:59,785
Since we were little I always
got what you didn't want.

89
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,161
I do not feel like a man.

90
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:06,291
We grew up together.
I share everything with you.

91
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,563
You really don't want to be Governor?

92
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:13,423
I seek the highest ideal in Wushu
so I can teach others.

93
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,259
And I want to start my own school.

94
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:21,556
When my Wushu practice flourishes
I'll realise the true meaning of life.

95
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:25,435
My other wish
is to have a family with Ying...

96
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,355
and live in peace together.

97
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,774
You and my little sister... a family?

98
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,318
Su, I wish the two of you
all the best!

99
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,161
You've been so kind.

100
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,872
One day...

101
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:50,001
I'll repay you.

102
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,005
Wonderful!

103
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:25,912
FIVE YEARS LATER

104
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,269
Guests come to see my parents

105
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:54,524
My parents are not in

106
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,780
I ask the guests to take a seat

107
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:03,533
Then pour them tea

108
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,332
One more time.

109
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,215
Snake!

110
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,467
A snake! At your feet!

111
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,639
You lied!

112
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,767
Look at you.
A mother and still so rambunctious.

113
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,145
You don't pay any attention to us.
You just practice Wushu all day.

114
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,980
Who doesn't pay attention to you?

115
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,650
Mother! Father! What about me?

116
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:38,860
Help! Save me!

117
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,028
What's going on?

118
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,696
I want to play.

119
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,366
You two are parents...

120
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,951
but act like crazy children.

121
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,744
- Father.
- Father.

122
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,496
Grandfather.

123
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,458
Little Feng.

124
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,338
Give me a hug.

125
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,300
Grandfather.

126
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,010
Have you been good?

127
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,471
I have some news.

128
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,267
Yuan is coming back for a visit.

129
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,143
My brother is coming home?

130
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,730
After all these years...

131
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,234
I knew he'd return one day.

132
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,822
Ying, let's get out the best wine.
We must celebrate.

133
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,242
My son...

134
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,621
Yuan is now a Governor.

135
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,291
I suspect this is more
than a homecoming.

136
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,918
You must be cautious.

137
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,753
Father, you worry too much.

138
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,923
Are you still thinking
of his real father?

139
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,800
Yuan never uttered a word about him.

140
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,053
He knows why you killed his father.

141
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,723
"Not mentioned" does not mean
"forgotten."

142
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,975
You raised him and Ying as your own.

143
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,810
Ying is my wife. We are one family.

144
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:57,397
There should be no hard feelings,
stop worrying.

145
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,567
I hope you're right.

146
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,925
Thank you!

147
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,262
Thank you! This way please!

148
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,056
Thanks.

149
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,474
Thank you.

150
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,976
Hurry, hurry!
Father's school opens today.

151
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,228
I want to watch the Lion Dance!

152
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,152
Lower the carriage...

153
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:47,072
Raise the carriage.

154
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,918
Do you still remember me?

155
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,089
Of course. You're my only brother.

156
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,802
Little Feng, this is Uncle Yuan.

157
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,679
Little Feng.

158
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:14,683
You're Su's son.
You should be brave.

159
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,143
Father really misses you.

160
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,525
Really? Then
let's celebrate his birthday.

161
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,111
- I have to tell you something.
- Come! Tell me tomorrow.

162
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,198
The three of us we look like a family!

163
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,800
My dear Father...

164
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:52,429
happy birthday.

165
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,305
Your timing is perfect.

166
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,016
Everyone missed you.

167
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,935
We're so happy you're home.

168
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:06,026
Father, I have not re-paid you
for raising me and Ying.

169
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:10,071
My health has deteriorated.
Age has taken its toll.

170
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,366
I don't have many good days.

171
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:17,912
But I pray everyday
for your safe return.

172
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,460
Come.

173
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:28,048
We have much to catch up on.

174
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,843
Come!

175
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,224
Grandfather!

176
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,816
It was I who killed your father.

177
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,404
Su loves you as his brother.

178
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:57,035
Please spare his family.

179
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:02,624
Father, you think so little of Su,
your own son?

180
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:09,130
Your father went too far
with the Five Venom Fists.

181
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,050
He killed many innocent people.

182
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,510
You...

183
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,849
I had to stop him.

184
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,686
I have perfected the Five Venom Fists.

185
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:29,692
Did you think I will ever forget
that you murdered my father?

186
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,624
After you killed him...

187
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,836
you forced me to be your son.

188
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:52,966
You told the world
my father deserved to die.

189
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,592
Right?

190
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:59,222
I am the only one you should hate.

191
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,308
Your son stole my only sister.

192
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,624
Governor. We've got her.

193
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,545
Mother!

194
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,674
Don't ever touch my sister!

195
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,261
I never blamed you.

196
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,015
Ying, we are finally together.

197
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:43,808
What will you do to Su?

198
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,977
Uncle, what's in your hand?

199
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,521
It's a pig's head.

200
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,357
Let's go pay respect
to your real grandfather.

201
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,109
Let us go!

202
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,112
Su treated you as his blood brother.

203
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,703
Mother...

204
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,086
Thank you.

205
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,547
Excuse me! This way please!

206
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,217
Young Master!
Something terrible has happened...

207
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:18,676
What's going on?

208
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:23,765
Yuan killed your father.
He came for revenge.

209
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:24,933
Young Master!

210
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,852
Father!

211
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,020
It's been 18 years.

212
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,857
Today, I've finally avenged your death.

213
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,610
Forgive me for taking so long.

214
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,077
Come, Little Feng.

215
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,453
Brother.

216
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,915
Little Feng, come here.

217
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,632
Pay respects to your real grandfather.

218
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:48,428
Governor. Su's here!

219
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,973
Yuan, how could you?

220
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,572
Stop!

221
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,115
Iron Twins, stand down.

222
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,160
I must welcome my brother-in-law.

223
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,872
Yuan! Father always
treated you as his own.

224
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,790
How could you?

225
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,336
Be careful, Su. Run!

226
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,255
We will be OK.

227
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,634
Your blood will be an offering
to my father.

228
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,338
It's dark gold armour.

229
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:11,344
Sewn onto my flesh inch by inch.

230
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,888
I am invincible.

231
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,656
Your fist is harder than a blade.

232
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,507
Five Venom Fists?

233
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,613
Su!

234
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:43,454
You know what your father
said before he died?

235
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,581
He begged me to spare your life.

236
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,793
You are a monster.

237
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,463
I've hated your family for a long time.

238
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,298
- Father!
- Little Feng!

239
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,925
Uncle!

240
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,969
- Please don't hurt my father.
- Little Feng!

241
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,473
- Run!
- Stop! Stop!

242
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,227
- Run, Little Feng!
- Uncle! Please stop!

243
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,771
Come here, Little Feng. I'll stop.

244
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:13,901
For the sake of your son,
I'll let you go.

245
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,078
- Su!
- Father!

246
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,747
You're Little Feng's Uncle.

247
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,582
Ying! Don't!

248
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,043
Mother!

249
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,753
Ying!

250
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,881
Someone save her! Ying!

251
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,052
Governor. The water's too fast.

252
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,394
Su.

253
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:34,727
Dr. Yu, he woke up!

254
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,186
Su! Good.

255
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,523
Now you needn't worry. He's okay.

256
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,025
You're...

257
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,818
This is Dr. Yu.

258
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,237
She saved our life
and treated your wounds.

259
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,489
Ying told me everything.

260
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,116
You are safe now.

261
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,869
I am the only one
here on Beidou Mountain.

262
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,288
You can stay as long as you like.

263
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,081
Thank you.

264
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:59,043
Keep still. There are still
traces of toxin in your blood.

265
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,921
Luckily, you're strong.

266
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,673
I was able to expel most of it out.

267
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,800
Someone not as tough
would be dead by now.

268
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,735
Be careful. My blood is toxic.

269
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,406
Don't worry. Dr. Yu
has researched every herb.

270
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,408
She is now immune to all poisons.

271
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,662
I am eternally grateful!

272
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,624
I must thank Ying.
She tends to the wine-making...

273
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,960
so I can focus on my research.

274
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,920
She's a wine-maker?

275
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,590
She sells her wine in the city and
distributes the money to the poor.

276
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,843
She also provides medicine to the sick.

277
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,429
A true angel of mercy.

278
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:55,224
You are making too much of what I do.

279
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,519
These needles will aid my research.

280
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,063
I'll walk you out.

281
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:06,151
Most people harbour hatred
without realising the value of life.

282
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,154
One life is connected to many hearts.

283
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,162
Ying!

284
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,125
What's wrong with my arm?

285
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,960
The tendons are torn.

286
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,046
Dr. Yu said you'll be okay.

287
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,756
But it will heal slowly.

288
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,519
Eat something.

289
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,901
You should've stayed with Little Feng.

290
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,738
Why suffer here?

291
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,074
Yuan will not harm Little Feng.

292
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,370
If I didn't follow you,
you would've died.

293
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,963
Look at me.

294
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,509
I can't even hold a bowl of rice.
How can I save our son?

295
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,471
You never accept defeat.

296
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,347
I'm useless.

297
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,016
No, you're not.

298
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:22,061
You were looking for a worthy opponent.

299
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,228
Now you've found two:

300
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:27,232
Yuan and yourself.

301
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,905
Su!

302
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,202
Su, it's OK.

303
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,139
Here. Hold this.

304
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,184
Use your right hand.

305
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,234
Come on. Hold it.

306
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,578
So what if I can hold it?

307
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,124
I'm still useless!

308
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,179
Are you all right?

309
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,266
Are you afraid?

310
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,394
Yes, I am.

311
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,649
But I'm more afraid you'll give up.

312
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,860
You're the only hope for our family.

313
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,822
I'm waiting for you
to come to your senses.

314
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,120
You were looking for a worthy opponent:

315
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:10,872
Yuan and yourself.

316
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,002
You're not useless.

317
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,421
You never accept defeat.

318
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,032
Try some.

319
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:26,133
Now I understand
why your wine is so special.

320
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,384
Why?

321
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,886
Because it contains your essence.

322
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:31,972
Stop it!

323
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,810
Soon my strength will return,
and I will rescue our son.

324
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,865
Great levitating skill!

325
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:56,765
I've never met
a skilled master like you.

326
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:58,725
Please take me as your disciple.

327
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,026
For revenge?

328
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,028
How did you know?

329
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,364
Your eyes revealed everything!

330
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,575
To be our disciple you must first
defeat the God of Wushu.

331
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,495
The God of Wushu?

332
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:19,746
How can I defeat him?

333
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,832
Your right arm was injured...

334
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,751
Now it's healed.

335
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,045
But you've lost your confidence, right?

336
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:28,713
No!

337
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,466
I have not lost my confidence.
My arm is fine!

338
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,595
You might die fighting the God of Wushu.

339
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,937
If my skills are weak
what's the point of living?

340
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,538
Are you afraid yet?
Go home if you're scared.

341
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:03,456
Never!

342
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:11,756
Too slow.

343
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,425
Faster! Faster!

344
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:59,220
To challenge someone like you...

345
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,682
...is a dream come true.

346
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,810
What did they do to you?

347
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,562
Nothing.

348
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:11,691
Only the weak die at home.

349
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,904
- A warrior dies on the battlefield.
- Su!

350
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:19,866
Finally you've come to your senses.

351
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,327
Yes, like you said...

352
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:25,288
I'm the hope of our family.

353
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:35,882
God of Wushu!

354
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,428
I'm here. Still alive!

355
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:42,889
You've recovered?

356
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,521
Your right arm is worthless.

357
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:52,565
Let's chop it off.

358
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:48,955
Scared?

359
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,331
Again!

360
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,032
Ying said your arm has strengthened.

361
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,159
Take a look.

362
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:17,538
Let me check how you're doing.

363
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:18,915
Alright!

364
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:30,718
The toxins are gone.

365
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:32,929
Thank you so much.

366
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:35,098
My body has healed.

367
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:37,558
And I'm getting stronger each day.

368
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,187
I must go practice. Please enjoy dinner.

369
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:48,861
Ying...

370
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,990
Su has gone mad with his training.

371
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,745
That's not possible.

372
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:01,374
Please listen. His pulse is erratic.

373
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,420
His heart is racing
and his eyes are blood-shot.

374
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:08,339
He's going mad.

375
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:11,217
This can't continue.
His training must stop.

376
00:50:19,143 --> 00:50:22,395
Dr. Yu, he's with me everyday.

377
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:27,108
He goes off to the Old Sage daily
and returns home with wounds.

378
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:29,652
I see it with my own eyes.

379
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:33,698
On Beidou Mountain,
we're the only ones here.

380
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,242
I know it's hard to believe.

381
00:50:36,368 --> 00:50:39,078
Old Sage and the God of Wushu
are supreme beings.

382
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:42,081
Just like you, they come and go.

383
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,003
- Have you ever met the Old Sage?
- No.

384
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:51,340
But I believe in my husband.

385
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,397
How many times have I told you?
Do not enter my practice chamber!

386
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:52,485
You don't listen!
If you die, I'll be alone forever!

387
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:55,696
Uncle, my feet hurt.
Please don't lock me up.

388
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,783
If you try to run away
I'll chop off your feet.

389
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,786
Uncle, I won't!

390
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,876
Little Feng,

391
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:12,463
you're my only family now.

392
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,423
I will not lose you.

393
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,718
I will protect you.

394
00:52:17,845 --> 00:52:19,804
So no one can harm you.

395
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:32,650
It's been another year,
I wonder how Little Feng has grown.

396
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,820
I've been thinking.

397
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:40,074
After I save Little Feng
we'll move to the country.

398
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,577
We'll hold hands like this every day.

399
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,583
I haven't seen
your smile in a long time.

400
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:08,936
Su...

401
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:15,359
After you save our son
will you spare my brother's life?

402
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,863
He's part of our family.

403
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:24,827
If he lives,
I'll make sure he cannot fight again.

404
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,381
Heavenly God.
Please bless our family.

405
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,301
I pray that we shall never be apart.

406
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,388
We shall never be apart.

407
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,809
I must find a way to defeat you!

408
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:15,086
Have you ever met the Old Sage?

409
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,299
Su has gone mad with his training.

410
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:23,803
God of Wushu.

411
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:27,473
Let's go again!

412
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,767
You may be strong. But I'm stronger.

413
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:31,894
I will defeat you!

414
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,555
Ying. I'm home.

415
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:10,683
I almost beat the God of Wushu today.

416
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:15,229
He's really powerful,
but I'll defeat him one day.

417
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:16,480
That's enough.

418
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,858
I now realise the way
to defeat an enemy.

419
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,443
That's enough!

420
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:23,529
What God of Wushu?

421
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:25,489
Are you alright?

422
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:27,742
Su...

423
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:32,204
Do you know you're going mad?

424
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:33,748
What?

425
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,543
I said, you're going mad.

426
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:40,171
I'm getting stronger.

427
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:42,506
And I'm more powerful than before.

428
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:46,093
I know you miss Little Feng.

429
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:49,055
I went to the cliff
to watch you practice.

430
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:55,811
I didn't see the God of Wushu,
or an Old Sage.

431
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,981
You were alone.

432
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:02,860
It's all in your head.
Don't you realise?

433
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,695
You went to the cliff?

434
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,947
I promised the Masters
I wouldn't bring my wife.

435
00:56:07,074 --> 00:56:08,741
Wake up!

436
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:12,828
You were practising by yourself.
Don't you understand?

437
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:16,707
That's impossible.
Look at my wounds.

438
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,334
They're real.

439
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,420
You did it to yourself.

440
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:32,348
I know you suffer so much.

441
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,810
Are you not feeling well?

442
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:39,021
If you love me, you have to believe me.

443
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:43,734
It was you
who made me want to be strong.

444
00:56:44,236 --> 00:56:46,195
I need you to believe in me.

445
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:01,043
Guests come to see my parents

446
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:04,171
My parents are not in

447
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:09,301
I ask the guests to take a seat

448
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:17,935
Then pour them tea

449
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:02,104
Little Feng.

450
00:58:08,028 --> 00:58:09,445
Let's go home.

451
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:12,740
Let's go, alright?

452
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,952
If Little Feng hears me sing...

453
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:21,081
he will stop crying.

454
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:29,131
Su,

455
00:58:30,759 --> 00:58:32,885
we are husband and wife.

456
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:37,598
We share good and bad times...

457
00:58:39,518 --> 00:58:41,519
and this wine together.

458
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,918
Su, you show great improvement.

459
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:32,004
Yes! I've become much stronger.

460
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,381
Even your confidence has returned.

461
01:00:57,197 --> 01:01:00,574
Ying says I'm going insane.

462
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,118
She says you're an illusion.

463
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:07,081
- What do you think?
- Who are you?

464
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:09,625
Who are you? Who am I?
It's not important.

465
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:13,087
What's important is
you're ready to save your son.

466
01:01:35,402 --> 01:01:38,821
Ying is right.
You are just in my head.

467
01:01:38,947 --> 01:01:41,323
Leave me alone!
I never want to see you again!

468
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:45,703
Ying!

469
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,551
Dear Su,

470
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:05,222
Watching you live
in your own fantasy scares me.

471
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:10,185
I fear I'll lose you and our son
forever.

472
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:14,231
It is now clear to me
that I must go save Little Feng.

473
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:18,235
We made a promise.
Our family shall never be apart.

474
01:02:18,737 --> 01:02:21,363
Wait for my return.
- Ying

475
01:02:28,747 --> 01:02:29,830
Please.

476
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:38,797
How long has he been in here?

477
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:02,196
Little Feng!

478
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:06,950
Mother!

479
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:09,119
Little Feng!

480
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:14,958
I thought I'd never see you again.

481
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:20,380
I missed you so much!

482
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:30,599
- Why are you in chains?
- Hush!

483
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:33,393
- Uncle may hear us.
- Ying?

484
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:39,650
You're alive!

485
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:44,571
This is great!

486
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:47,241
Finally,
we can live happily as a family.

487
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,749
It's been so long.
Do you know the pain I've endured?

488
01:03:56,376 --> 01:03:58,168
I think of you every day.

489
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,757
You've had your revenge.
Now let my son go.

490
01:04:06,803 --> 01:04:08,178
Is Su dead?

491
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:10,514
You destroyed his arm.

492
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:14,476
He can never fight again.
Please let us go.

493
01:04:16,855 --> 01:04:21,316
Now that you're here
I'll never lose you again.

494
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:27,823
He's here! He's here!

495
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:29,408
Close the gate. Quick!

496
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:36,498
Governor! Su is fast approaching!

497
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:37,791
Su!

498
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,678
Ying. I am so happy.

499
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:52,848
We can finish what we started!
It all ends here!

500
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,433
Then you must deal with me first!

501
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:59,813
- Mother!
- You're scaring your son.

502
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:04,192
Does this make you happy?

503
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,362
Happy?

504
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:12,200
I've known only sorrow since you left.

505
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:16,038
I can only fight for what I want.

506
01:05:16,623 --> 01:05:18,373
You understand?

507
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:20,500
Good!

508
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:38,185
That's more like it, Su!

509
01:06:19,894 --> 01:06:22,562
Su, I should have trusted you!

510
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:23,939
I was wrong!

511
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,065
Ying!

512
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:44,876
Guards!

513
01:06:46,671 --> 01:06:47,921
Tie her up.

514
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:50,215
- Little Feng!
- Mother!

515
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:55,846
- Uncle! Don't kill her!
- Little Feng!

516
01:06:56,305 --> 01:06:57,639
Let go!

517
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:02,769
- Mother!
- I won't kill your mother.

518
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,565
But if your father kills me...

519
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:08,942
she has to die with me.

520
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,153
Because we're one family.

521
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:14,281
But I will not lose.

522
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:17,284
Bury her in the forest!

523
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:23,373
No matter what happens...
You must stay with your father.

524
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:25,751
Remember our family
shall never be apart!

525
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:29,588
Promise me, Little Feng!
Promise me!

526
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:16,468
Governor, it's been done.

527
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:20,180
- Does anyone else know where she is?
- No.

528
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:22,974
Good! Get up!

529
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:24,226
Yes, sir!

530
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:45,580
Kill him, brother! Quick!

531
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:58,468
Father!

532
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:02,514
Little Feng!

533
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:05,517
- Where's your mother?
- You'll never know.

534
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:46,149
Father!

535
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:48,943
Father, stop! We need to find Mother!

536
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,616
Father, don't kill him!

537
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:57,076
Father, you're killing him!

538
01:14:57,203 --> 01:14:58,203
Stop! Father!

539
01:14:58,329 --> 01:14:59,913
Don't kill him!

540
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:10,089
Uncle, you can't die,
Uncle, please live!

541
01:15:11,217 --> 01:15:12,967
Little Feng, he is our enemy!

542
01:15:13,427 --> 01:15:15,136
He buried Mother alive.

543
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:17,972
Only he knows where she is!

544
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:21,226
If he dies...

545
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:25,355
we can't save Mother.

546
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:27,148
Let's go find her!

547
01:15:27,942 --> 01:15:29,359
Forest.

548
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:32,820
In the forest.

549
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,286
- Ying!
- Mother!

550
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:44,958
- Mother!
- Ying! Where are you?

551
01:16:09,066 --> 01:16:10,483
Here!

552
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:27,185
A DRUNKEN FIST

553
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:40,573
HEILONGJIANG, ALONG
THE CHINESE-RUSSIAN BORDER

554
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:26,577
Careful! It's hot! Here it is, go!

555
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:30,957
Roasted potatoes!
Sweet roasted potatoes!

556
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:37,088
Mister, how much is one potato?

557
01:18:37,214 --> 01:18:39,006
Two copper coins.

558
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:43,970
I only have one. Can I get one?

559
01:18:45,431 --> 01:18:48,224
Okay. Consider it charity.

560
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,600
Here. One for you.

561
01:18:49,727 --> 01:18:51,060
Thank you.

562
01:19:18,714 --> 01:19:20,923
Teacher! Teacher!

563
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:22,884
Wake up!

564
01:19:25,763 --> 01:19:27,263
Get out!

565
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:32,059
Our Teacher's dead!
Money won't bring him back.

566
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:37,190
Your Teacher was weak.
Our fighters are better.

567
01:19:38,192 --> 01:19:39,567
Stop!

568
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:41,110
Master Ma!

569
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:43,070
Head of the Wushu Federation?

570
01:19:43,197 --> 01:19:45,823
- Master Ma. You need to help us.
- What happened?

571
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:48,701
They lured our teacher
to a match for 30 silver coins.

572
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:50,870
Said he'd get 5 coins
if he surrendered...

573
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:53,039
But it wasn't a match.
It was murder!

574
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:55,333
Accidents happen.
People die.

575
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:58,461
He did surrender.
Your men still beat him to death.

576
01:19:58,587 --> 01:20:00,254
That's outrageous!

577
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:02,465
How can you call that a match?

578
01:20:03,258 --> 01:20:05,927
If you have any grievances,
settle it in the arena.

579
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:07,470
All right!

580
01:20:08,347 --> 01:20:09,764
Tell your people...

581
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,768
if I win, they'll have to close the arena
and go back to where they came from!

582
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:16,312
Deal! We'll be waiting.

583
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:25,738
Here. Take this. Buy something to eat.

584
01:20:39,545 --> 01:20:41,045
Wine.

585
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:45,550
Wine...

586
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:51,931
Excuse me! Who is this guy?

587
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:53,474
Oh my god!

588
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,434
How did a stinky beggar get in here?

589
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,562
This is not Ying's wine.

590
01:20:57,688 --> 01:21:02,108
This is my wine. Give it back!

591
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:04,485
Don't push me.

592
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:06,153
Get out!

593
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:15,162
You stink!

594
01:21:15,289 --> 01:21:16,455
Don't touch me.

595
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:18,666
Just wait!

596
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,793
I'll get someone to kick you out.

597
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,883
Hey, come here if you want to drink!

598
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:30,177
Wine...

599
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,474
Is this Ying's wine?

600
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,314
Drink it, and you'll know.

601
01:21:48,864 --> 01:21:50,448
Wine...

602
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:57,413
Give me the wine!

603
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:22,146
Clear head. Drunken form.

604
01:22:22,272 --> 01:22:24,982
Mind meets fist.

605
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:27,735
Stop obsessing about form.

606
01:22:28,737 --> 01:22:31,739
Heart and fist are one.

607
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:46,879
To lose is not to lose.

608
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:49,799
To win is not to win.

609
01:22:55,055 --> 01:22:57,390
Offer wine to the gods.

610
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,021
Hug the barrel in farewell.

611
01:23:09,403 --> 01:23:12,697
Raise the jug with tons of strength.

612
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:20,204
Being drunk is fake. The fist is real!

613
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:23,499
A good fist is an unstoppable fist.

614
01:24:22,184 --> 01:24:24,310
Take it and drink up!

615
01:24:28,857 --> 01:24:30,941
Father!

616
01:24:31,902 --> 01:24:34,361
A broken heart needs mending.

617
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:37,990
What are you doing here?

618
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:42,328
From now on, let me take you
to wherever you want to go.

619
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:43,537
What a stench.

620
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:48,000
Master Ma, this is the lunatic
I told you about!

621
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,337
Su Can?

622
01:24:52,964 --> 01:24:54,131
General Su?

623
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:56,509
He is a General?

624
01:25:08,814 --> 01:25:10,397
Su, it is Ma.

625
01:25:11,358 --> 01:25:13,109
We fought many battles together.

626
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,156
What happened to you?

627
01:25:19,658 --> 01:25:21,158
You don't remember me?

628
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:26,163
You gave me this sword.
Don't you remember?

629
01:25:30,544 --> 01:25:33,170
Su, wake up!

630
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:45,141
Foreigners are killing Chinese fighters
for amusement.

631
01:25:47,686 --> 01:25:51,313
I have to fight them tomorrow.

632
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,068
Win or lose, I have no regrets.

633
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:59,738
I've always looked up to you.

634
01:26:00,866 --> 01:26:02,908
A warrior once told me:

635
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:06,245
"To give is better than to receive."

636
01:26:07,164 --> 01:26:11,125
What happened to that great warrior?

637
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:19,008
He died with Ying.

638
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:22,052
Mother.

639
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,388
Su!

640
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:30,519
For the sake of your son
pick yourself up.

641
01:26:33,064 --> 01:26:34,481
Su!

642
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:36,775
I return this sword to you.

643
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:40,905
Ma!

644
01:26:41,573 --> 01:26:43,741
I've never asked you for anything.

645
01:26:44,534 --> 01:26:47,119
Now I am asking you to take care of my
son.

646
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,747
Father!
What are you saying?

647
01:26:49,873 --> 01:26:52,708
Su!
He is your son!

648
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:56,837
Look at me.
Do I look like a father?

649
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:01,550
He has no future with me.

650
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:04,011
Only suffering.

651
01:27:04,554 --> 01:27:07,598
I beg you.
Please take him away!

652
01:27:10,435 --> 01:27:11,936
I see.

653
01:27:12,062 --> 01:27:13,687
Don't worry.

654
01:27:14,189 --> 01:27:16,023
I'll take good care of him.

655
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:17,399
I won't go with you!

656
01:27:17,943 --> 01:27:19,360
Father!

657
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:25,574
Don't send me away,
we must stay together.

658
01:27:26,368 --> 01:27:28,702
Who will take care of you
if I'm not here?

659
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:33,082
Father! I won't go,
I want to stay...

660
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,417
Father, I won't go!

661
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:38,045
You don't need to take care of me.
Now go!

662
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:40,589
Father! No!

663
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:42,925
- Go!
- No!

664
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,552
Listen!

665
01:27:46,554 --> 01:27:50,307
I only need wine, not you!
Understand?

666
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,643
I don't want to go.

667
01:27:54,813 --> 01:27:56,230
Go!

668
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,656
Father! Open the door!

669
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:08,325
Open the door!

670
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:11,245
I don't want to go!

671
01:28:11,371 --> 01:28:13,539
Open the door! Father!

672
01:28:42,736 --> 01:28:43,986
Uncle Ma...

673
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:47,239
I'm sorry, but I can't leave him.

674
01:28:48,116 --> 01:28:51,285
He might be crazy, but he's my father...

675
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:54,955
And we cannot be apart.

676
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:57,916
I understand, Little Feng.

677
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:02,254
Come to me if you need anything.

678
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:07,468
Think of me as your family.

679
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:10,763
Take good care of your father.

680
01:29:40,668 --> 01:29:44,088
Dear Father: I promised Mother...

681
01:29:44,214 --> 01:29:45,839
that I'd always stay with you.

682
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:47,549
Our family shall never be apart.

683
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:05,127
Uncle Ma!

684
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:08,839
We've come to support you.

685
01:31:11,176 --> 01:31:12,301
Ma!

686
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:13,677
Su!

687
01:31:17,891 --> 01:31:19,766
Can you get us in?

688
01:31:21,436 --> 01:31:22,644
Of course.

689
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:30,611
Get out of here!

690
01:31:32,405 --> 01:31:33,572
Su!

691
01:31:34,949 --> 01:31:35,949
Are you all right?

692
01:31:37,702 --> 01:31:40,329
What are you doing here?
We have a dress code.

693
01:31:49,214 --> 01:31:52,216
He's with me. How dare you!

694
01:31:52,926 --> 01:31:54,510
After you.

695
01:32:40,557 --> 01:32:42,516
Have a seat.

696
01:32:43,309 --> 01:32:45,185
I need to check something.

697
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:49,940
We know you'll win, Uncle Ma!

698
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:07,040
Now, the most important match
of the day!

699
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,210
The challenger is Master Ma...

700
01:33:13,381 --> 01:33:18,260
Head of the Wushu Federation.

701
01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:20,679
Versus...

702
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:24,683
Killer Anton's Invincible Wrestlers.

703
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:32,190
This is a free-style match.

704
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:35,569
No time limits.
No holds barred.

705
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:37,988
No set number of fighters.

706
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:40,699
No weapons allowed.

707
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:44,453
The last man standing wins.

708
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:47,623
The prize is 100 silver coins!

709
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:52,210
The odds right now are fifteen to one.

710
01:33:52,337 --> 01:33:54,212
Final bets now.

711
01:34:09,312 --> 01:34:11,438
The Challenger...

712
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:14,816
Master Ma!

713
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:23,283
The defending champion: Malotoff.

714
01:34:27,372 --> 01:34:30,582
Are both fighters ready?

715
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,460
Ready!

716
01:34:34,212 --> 01:34:36,213
Go!

717
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:26,763
Stop! Uncle Ma!

718
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,276
Don't hurt Uncle Ma!

719
01:35:44,741 --> 01:35:46,241
Let me go!

720
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,160
Father!

721
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:54,124
Father! Help! Father!

722
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,667
Let me go!

723
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:57,002
Father!

724
01:36:30,578 --> 01:36:33,038
Uncle Ma! Are you okay?

725
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:05,273
Father! Be careful!

726
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,604
Father, don't fight anymore!
Run away!

727
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:47,983
Little Feng, I never back down.

728
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:11,891
Father, please stop!

729
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:04,679
He just violated the rules.

730
01:43:14,273 --> 01:43:15,648
Ladies and gentlemen...

731
01:43:16,901 --> 01:43:18,318
Stay back!

732
01:43:18,444 --> 01:43:22,113
The last player
of Killer Anton's is off.

733
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:26,576
The Chinaman is the only one left.

734
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,037
Get up!

735
01:43:29,163 --> 01:43:30,622
In accordance with the rules...

736
01:43:31,832 --> 01:43:34,083
if he can get up...

737
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,418
Get up!

738
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:38,421
He is the winner.

739
01:43:39,882 --> 01:43:43,259
- Get up, Father!
- Su.

740
01:43:46,013 --> 01:43:49,474
Father, I beg you. Get up!

741
01:43:54,355 --> 01:43:58,441
Please don't die.

742
01:43:58,567 --> 01:44:02,070
Father, I beg you. Get up.

743
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:17,919
Su!

744
01:44:22,925 --> 01:44:24,634
Get up!

745
01:44:36,438 --> 01:44:38,064
Ying!

746
01:44:42,236 --> 01:44:44,070
Did you see that?

747
01:44:44,822 --> 01:44:48,241
I knew it.
You've perfected your skills.

748
01:44:51,245 --> 01:44:52,954
Don't leave me again.

749
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:56,291
I've never left you.

750
01:44:57,293 --> 01:44:59,627
I was always by your side.

751
01:45:11,515 --> 01:45:14,726
Father, wake up, get up quickly.

752
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:17,312
Father, get up.

753
01:45:17,438 --> 01:45:23,401
Father, wake up!

754
01:45:23,527 --> 01:45:27,030
Get up, Father! Don't leave me.

755
01:45:33,037 --> 01:45:35,788
You're awake!

756
01:45:35,914 --> 01:45:38,708
Get up! Quick!

757
01:45:42,588 --> 01:45:46,632
He's up.
The Chinaman is up!

758
01:45:46,759 --> 01:45:49,510
He wins!

759
01:45:54,016 --> 01:45:58,478
The loser will be banned
from this arena.

760
01:45:59,229 --> 01:46:01,522
Ladies and gentlemen...

761
01:46:01,648 --> 01:46:05,360
according to our rules...

762
01:46:05,486 --> 01:46:08,071
the last man standing wins.

763
01:46:08,197 --> 01:46:10,031
And today's winner is...

764
01:46:10,157 --> 01:46:13,826
the Chinese Man on this stage.

765
01:46:19,124 --> 01:46:20,750
That is my father!

766
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:20,184
Beggar Su wandered the land
with his son...

767
01:47:22,146 --> 01:47:27,400
searching for truth through
the "Drunken Fist" philosophy.

768
01:47:29,778 --> 01:47:36,117
Today, it is practiced
by millions around the world...

769
01:47:37,202 --> 01:47:43,332
and its creator, Su Can
is indeed a "True Legend" of Wushu.

770
01:48:09,526 --> 01:48:12,778
Kid, let me teach you a trick.

771
01:48:15,073 --> 01:48:16,949
Look at me.

772
01:48:18,744 --> 01:48:21,454
I saw the hole in the first place.

773
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,997
You are a fake.
