Bye. you guys.

156
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,204
Those shorties so fine,
I want to lick them like a lollipop.

157
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,082
Mm, Schwarz-negro
got some tight-ass glutes.

158
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,500
What's wrong with you, Michelle?

159
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,085
- What?
- That's nasty.

160
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,920
- That's my dad.
- I'll call him Daddy.

161
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,004
Oh, my God, I can't take it.

162
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,215
Doesn't Cheyenne's dad
look like a stripper cop?

163
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,134
Girl, he can turn me over
and have a choice.

164
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,470
[sighs] Okay, let's change the subject,
'cause it's really gross.

165
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,223
Reality is, you're short,
you've got acne,

166
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,891
- and you're fat.
- QUE: Hey, fuck you.

167
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,726
All right, look, we're all 5s,
and they're 10s.

168
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
<i>HENDRIX, Narrating:
Cheyenne is a vegan goddess.</i>

169
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,148
<i>I mean, perfection.</i>

170
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,609
<i>Her eyes, her scent,
even her voice.</i>

171
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,445
<i>I mean, the lady can sing.</i>

172
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,114
<i>Oh, and oh yeah, that's me.</i>

173
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>Checking her out, as usual.</i>

174
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,410
We're juniors,
they're seniors, bro.

175
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,412
Like, with high self-esteem.

176
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,747
QUICKTIME: Michelle's for sure
going to the prom with Reggie

177
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,333
and Cheyenne, well,
she's a straight-A student

178
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,294
and her uber-cop dad
won't let her mess with anybody

179
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,795
that's below a B+ average.

180
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,007
That's a 3.5 GPA, son.

181
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,594
The last guy that asked Cheyenne out
had some old traffic tickets.

182
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,139
Supercop ran an APB on his ass
and arrested him personally.

183
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,724
- No way.
- Damn.

184
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,642
<i>HENDRIX, Narrating:
That's when it hit me.</i>

185
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,480
<i>In just a few months, she would fly East
to some fancy-ass college.</i>

186
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,818
<i>Probably meet some Ivy League douchebag
and I'd never get to see her again.</i>

187
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,907
[cell phone vibrating]

188
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,916
What are you texting me for?

189
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,751
Just letting you know
I'm having a party tonight

190
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,669
at Chowder's crib.

191
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,922
I put you on the guest list,
so you don't have to pay.

192
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,345
And I was wondering if Cheyenne
had a date to the prom.

193
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,429
How old are you?

194
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,266
I'll be 17 in, like, four months.

195
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,272
<i>HENDRIX, Narrating:
Calvin will test you with his gay shit.</i>

196
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,858
She'll be in heels.

197
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,527
<i>HENDRIX, Narrating: That's why
I peeled him away from the crowd.</i>

198
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,658
Well, I suppose you're kinda
cute in a boyish way.

199
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,577
After class, she'll walk to her locker
to get her gym clothes.

200
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,954
Michelle won't be there.

201
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,121
You'll have about five minutes alone.

202
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,123
And?

203
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,043
And good luck.

204
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,839
You're late, Mr. Sutton.

205
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,841
Sorry, sir.

206
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,344
Sorry won't make you on time.
Please see me after class.

207
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,097
Mr. Anderson?

208
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,809
C.C.

209
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,936
<i>HENDRIX, Narrating:
C.C.'s straight-up scary.</i>

210
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,229
<i>I ain't even gonna lie.</i>

211
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,190
<i>A wannabe rapper,
'cept no one ever hears him rap.</i>

212
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,817
<i>Calls himself the Conscious Criminal.</i>

213
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,403
<i>At least he got the criminal part right.</i>

214
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,989
<i>His big brother,
he's doing time in the joint</i>

215
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,575
<i>while C.C. does time in high school.</i>

216
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,702
<i>Rumor is, he stayed back twice already.</i>

217
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,581
No headphones in during class.

218
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,835
You want to graduate this time,
you've got to participate, young brother.

219
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,296
Okay, go to the principal's office.

220
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,601
So, class, back in the day,

221
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,352
how did you show your tribe

222
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,354
that you were ready,
that you're worthy now,

223
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,773
that you're an adult,
and you're successful?

224
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,859
Yes, Jackie?

225
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,488
Didn't one tribe have you go out
and get an eagle feather?

226
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,617
They did. So, what's
your eagle's feather today?

227
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,453
How do you show your peers,
your homies, that you're making it?

228
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,663
Huh? How do you get recognition?

229
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,457
Yes, Paco?

230
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,709
Having lots of money, like,
being a billionaire, ese.

231
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,628
- [laughing]
- Being a billionaire. That'll do it.

232
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,963
Being a sexy-chick movie star celebrity

233
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,259
so you can be sexy enough
to drive folks crazy.

234
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,055
Or you could have a big fly house
in a nice rich neighborhood like me.

235
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,434
How about having a fly car,

236
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,937
like a Bentley
with some bad-ass rims?

237
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,858
- Being the hottest M.C.
- Or being famous, like the president.

238
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,151
That'll also get you recognized.

239
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,152
You on this president hitch, man.

240
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,029
Owning Facebook.

241
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,740
You know what else?
Being fitted with the right gear,

242
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,408
having major swag.

243
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,243
DR. SUTTON:
All right, okay. Check this out.

244
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,536
So back in the days

245
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,664
when people lived
in harmony with nature,

246
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,668
the tribe elders made sure that whatever
you needed to be a success,

247
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,171
to be recognized,
90% of the young people could do it.

248
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,132
But today, most of you
will never be billionaires

249
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,551
or drive a Bentley
or be a big, sexy movie star

250
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,636
or be president.

251
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,346
Now, some of you will,
and more power to you.

252
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,684
But the majority of you will never,
ever feel recognized by your tribe.

253
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,769
You'll never get your eagle's feather.

254
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,978
That's messed up, man.

255
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,271
Yeah, well, check this out:

256
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,273
It is also a big part of what?

257
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,109
Can anyone guess?

258
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,986
The economy.

259
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,488
Why?

260
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,825
If 90% of you feel
insecure and inadequate,

261
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,202
you're going to buy our products.

262
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,330
We make you feel
that you'll be recognized more

263
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,290
if you buy this big fly house
in Beverly Hills,

264
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,459
or Baldwin Hills or View Park.

265
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,379
If that doesn't work, I'll sell you a car
you can't really afford,

266
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,548
a nice one with beautiful rims.

267
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:58,135
But will that new fly car really,
really really satisfy you?

268
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,554
- Yep.
- Yeah?

269
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,930
For how long?

270
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,598
Five years? Ten years?

271
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,766
'Cause then I'll flip it up a little bit.

272
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,435
You know what I'll do?
I'll change the style,

273
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,311
or put some new rims on it,

274
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,188
and before you know it,
in 10 years you car looks old.

275
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,274
And then you've got to come back to me
for some new swag.

276
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,402
You're hooked,
because I supply your status.

277
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,903
Because you know what we did?

278
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,657
We elders put the emphasis
not on who you are

279
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,034
but on what you drive.

280
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,581
In fact, I'll have you young people
singing my ads for my products

281
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,999
- for free.
- What?

282
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,792
Singing your ads for free how?

283
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,087
Easy. You turn on the radio.
You all do it all the time.

284
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,131
Gucci man,
Beemer, Benz and Bentley.

285
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,426
Got my Vans on.
Look at all the gold I got.

286
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,762
Insecure people buy a lot of stuff
they don't need

287
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,054
'cause we want
to impress our friends.

288
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,265
So what about secure people?

289
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,851
Could you get someone like
Mahatma Gandhi

290
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,852
to buy a new Cadillac?

291
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,395
CLASS: No.

292
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,105
- Why not?
- Because he wouldn't want it.

293
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,356
He wouldn't want it.

294
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,441
But we still respected him.
Why?

295
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,359
Yes, Michelle.

296
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,153
Because he freed India
from British colonialism.

297
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,782
Correct. Could you have gotten Mother Teresa
to buy some breast implants?

298
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,492
CLASS: No.

299
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:07,788
We liked her,
because she helped people and whatnot.

300
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,248
That's why we liked her, because
she helped people and whatnot.

301
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,833
Not because she looked sexy.

302
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,127
What about Dr. King or Brother Malcolm?

303
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,588
Did they have lots of money
and run up credit card debt?

304
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,631
CLASS: No.

305
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,715
Okay, let's take it to the top.

306
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,801
Let's go to Jesus Christ.

307
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,221
Would Jesus Christ
buy a pair of Gucci shoes?

308
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,305

What am I saying?

313
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,814
You're saying that true success
isn't about what you buy or drive

DR. SUTTON:
Right. What I'm saying is

316
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,029
if you want to go out in the world
and do something big--

317
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,990
teach a child to read,

318
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,117
invent a clean energy source,

319
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,577
sacrifice for others.

320
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,412
You might not be able
to buy your success,

321
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,289
or your recognition, or drive it.

322
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,291
You might have to do something,
you understand?

323
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,920
How about getting all of us elders
to stop killing each other

324
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,839

that you're going to inherit?

you'll have your senior project.

Yes, I thought we would do
successes and failures.

337
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,949
We would interview people
and see if they felt

338
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,285
like they had done what they
wanted with their lives.

This year's prom theme
is Green Glamour.

And as you know,
green is all about recycling

He's never been good at testing.
