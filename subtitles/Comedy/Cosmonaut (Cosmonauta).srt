1
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:42,908
THE COSMONAUT

2
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,356
1957.

3
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:44,448
We had installed an antenna
on our roof in Turin

4
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,285
Our house

5
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:52,121
was located on a strategic path

6
00:03:54,671 --> 00:04:00,006
that enabled us to listen
to radio messages from the USSR

7
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,496
My brother and I used to listen
to the launching of each rocket.

8
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,183
Yes, Sputnik 1...

9
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,003
with its...

10
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,266
The heartbeat of Laika,
the little dog...

11
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,968
Gagarin's first words...

12
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,321
"I don't see any God up here..."

13
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,603
John Glenn...

14
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,828
We spent whole nights awake
in front of our receivers.

15
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,458
One day...

16
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,213
German astronomy radio observatories

17
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,296
locked on some strange noises

18
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,075
in frequencies
normally used by the Soviets.

19
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,426
We hurried to listen.

20
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,998
It was a Morse code signal.

21
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,086
But the signal,
rather than orbiting the Earth

22
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,188
was at a fixed point,

23
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,510
sounding lower every time.

24
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,053
It was a spaceship

25
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,556
moving away from Earth.

26
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,058
We fine-tuned the signal

27
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:13,743
and the beeps became...

28
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,706
a sound.

29
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,693
Thanks to my father,
who was a doctor,

30
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,170
we discovered it was a heartbeat.

31
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,031
A human one.

32
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,971
Soon after that, the USSR announced
that a spaceship had vanished

33
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,793
in the edge of our atmosphere.

34
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,143
An unmanned craft.

35
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,505
Obviously.

36
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,885
They concealed everything.

37
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,803
From then on

38
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,195
it was all crazy.

39
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,183
In a disused German bunker

40
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:55,313
we built the world's most famous

41
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,190
amateur radio station.

42
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,235
Torre Bert.

43
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,658
They were amazing times.

44
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,620
Packed with emotion.

45
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,791
The world's two superpowers

46
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,083
that could have destroyed everything

47
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,921
overnight,

48
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,381
were, at the same time

49
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,968
competing

50
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,263
to conquer space,
to be the first out there.

51
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,885
To go further.

52
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,535
Back then, there was
a true love for space...

53
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:43,360
At the beginning,
the Russians won everything.

54
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,031
The first satellite,

55
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,741
the first animal in space,

56
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,451
the first man,
the first woman,

57
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,370
the first space walk...

58
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,708
While the Americans suffered
one explosion after another,

59
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,751
amassed one failure after another.

60
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,273
However,
when the Americans reached the Moon...

61
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,970
It was all over.

62
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,266
There was nothing left to explore.

63
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,311
Nothing to win.

64
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,815
Interest in space faded.

65
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,695
And the USSR...

66
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,405
lost.

67
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,741
Despite winning everything else...

68
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:37,581
they lost because they never managed
to reach the Moon.

69
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:42,936
The Moon was a long awaited dream,
it was everything.

70
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,173
And they let it slip away...

71
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:59,533
APRIL 18th, 1975

72
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,465
So here I am,
I hope this is working right,

73
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,095
if it isn't it must be broken,
which is your fault, Andrei, thank you.

74
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,520
I've decided to record as much
as I possibly can for a post-flight analysis.

75
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:29,688
As you know, something must have damaged
the Kolibri’s communications antenna.

76
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:33,650
as all attempts to contact you guys
have proven futile.

77
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:38,321
I'm currently
on my third orbit of the Moon.

78
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,993
There she is, out there.

79
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,080
Isn't she beautiful?

80
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:50,876
It's hard to sum up how staggering it is
without sounding clichéd or corny.

81
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,300
So, here I am...

82
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,638
Quarter of a million kilometers
away from home, all alone,

83
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:04,685
and the sense of isolation is...

84
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,686
Well, it's pretty overwhelming.

85
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,933
The good news is
I made this piece of shit work.

86
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:19,938
It wasn’t poetry in motion or textbook,
but it did take off from the Moon.

87
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,816
So here I am...

88
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,905
In deep space...

89
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,583
Solar panels are history...

90
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,788
and unless I can find a gas station
on the way back

91
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,833
I'm pretty fucked.

92
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:07,241
7 MONTHS LATER

93
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,318
¿Nikolai?

94
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:32,903
The Kolibri module is coming back.

95
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,488
Yes... Yes...

96
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,323
Ok.

97
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,398
The Kolibri is reentering
the atmosphere.

98
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,110
He's coming back.

99
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:19,571
I know it's been a long time
and I know it's impossible.

100
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:24,238
Do you think it's a coincidence
that he's coming to Earth?

101
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,038
Come on.

102
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,665
It's gonna land in less than an hour.

103
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,556
<i>AGS seems burnt and out of function.</i>

104
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,013
<i>I see 3.0 in register 1.</i>

105
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,726
<i>Previous reading: 2.9.</i>

106
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:00,656
Spacecraft entered a ballistic orbit
during reentry, sir.

107
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:05,245
<i>Accelerations up to 21Gs are expected.</i>

108
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,953
Rescue team's ready.
- Ready.

109
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,496
Recalculate the route. Do we have a range?
- 20 km sir.

110
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,791
Tracking stations.
- Notified and waiting.

111
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,830
Re-route the rescue teams
to the Orsk area.

112
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,133
Nothing!

113
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,238
Anything?
- Nothing!

114
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,123
Nothing over here!

115
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,695
I've found it!
Come over here!

116
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,873
The spacecraft is empty!
There’s no one inside!

117
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,396
<i>Chaika, do you read me? Over.</i>

118
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,735
<i>Chaika, do you read me?</i>

119
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,110
<i>Where the fuck am I?</i>

120
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,748
Right, teams of two!
Let's go on and find him!

121
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,710
That way. You, with me. Come on!

122
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:28,963
<i>Do you hear me? I’ll give you
my coordinates. They are 40342004.</i>

123
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:32,220
<i>Chaika, a storm is coming,
it's very close.</i>

124
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:35,058
<i>Tell the rescue mission to find me
as soon as possible.</i>

125
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,305
<i>Over!</i>

126
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:17,513
<i>My muscles are weak from all the time
I’ve spent </i>in zero gravity.

127
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:30,231
<i>That was a dirty stunt, Stas.</i>

128
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,235
<i>You either come back or you don’t.</i>

129
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:36,575
<i>But I don’t like to be fooled.</i>

130
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,648
Did you sleep at all?

131
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,898
I don’t like what I see when I sleep.

132
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,820
Yulia, you have to get some sleep.

133
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,280
This is ridiculous. Can you just?...

134
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,161
Just please take the pills
the doctor gave you.

135
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,830
I’ve already started.

136
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,921
Ok...

137
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,591
I’ll make some coffee.

138
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,260
Don’t worry, I’ll do it.

139
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,188
<i>Today is june 15th...</i>

140
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,146
<i>1976.</i>

141
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,901
<i>My name is Stas Arsenievich.</i>

142
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,571
<i>I’m a soviet cosmonaut.</i>

143
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:43,450
<i>I write this diary</i>

144
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>to leave a record of my arrival.</i>

145
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:47,870
<i>There’s no one here.</i>

146
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,668
<i>It’s like the whole human race
has been killed in a nuclear explosion</i>

147
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,920
<i>or melted or...</i>

148
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,216
<i>Everything else is still here.</i>

149
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,218
<i>Every leaf</i>

150
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>waterfall</i>

151
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,888
<i>bird,...</i>

152
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,473
<i>Everything looks exactly like Earth...</i>

153
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,936
<i>Except it isn’t.</i>

154
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:57,328
They had this massive antenna,
they were receiving the signal.

155
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,668
I don’t care!

156
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,545
I just hope that someday,
if somebody talks about us

157
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,298
it’s because we did something
worth talking about.

158
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,801
Cheers to that.

159
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,500
Andrei Sergeevich Vasiliev...

160
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:40,541
you should rest.

161
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:44,798
I can’t.

162
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,348
<i>A memory is similar to a virus.</i>

163
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:57,183
<i>It’s unique,
it can remain asleep for years</i>

164
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:02,225
<i>and when it comes to life it spreads,
it divides, it multiplies</i>

165
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>and it can eat you alive.</i>

166
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,316
This is my beer to spare.

167
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,901
Excuse me young lady,
is this man bothering you?

168
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:11,240
Cause I can get rid of him for you if you like.
- Really?

169
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:16,578
Thank you boys.
- There you go.

170
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,625
Gentlemen, on the house.

171
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:21,873
You got...

172
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,671
She is salty.

173
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,388
This isn’t gonna work.

174
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,558
What’s your solution then?

175
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,810
I don’t know.

176
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:40,688
Wait.

177
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,408
Wow! Sorry, ok!
- Sorry...

178
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:58,120
Lo siento, solo queríamos hielo.
- I’m sorry...

179
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,040
Ok, so...

180
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,206
Show me your hand.

181
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:06,631
First one out, loses.

182
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,841
Loses what?
- The girl, balland.

183
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,080
Ok...

184
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,125
Pact of silence.

185
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:48,921
We never talk to each other about her.
Ever.

186
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:53,595
Deal?
- Deal.

187
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,550
Ok...

188
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,178
T minus ten.

189
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,723
Nine...

190
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,060
eight...

191
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,020
seven...

192
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,396
six...

193
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,153
three, two, one.

194
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,450
<i>Today I drank water from a stream.</i>

195
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:02,873
<i>I also ate the meat leftovers
by the bonfire</i>

196
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,543
<i>but they tasted of ash
and I had to spit them out.</i>

197
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:12,048
<i>I heard a scream in the distance
and I ran towards it.</i>

198
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,970
<i>Beats bouncing
inside my chest very fast.</i>

199
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,263
<i>I screamed with all my heart.</i>

200
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,018
<i>I laugh, my eyes filled with tears.</i>

201
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:26,606
<i>But there was no one there.</i>

202
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,598
Do you know why I started to work here?

203
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,766
You never told me.

204
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:11,523
When I was seventeen I spent the summer
with my parents in the country

205
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,275
and I met this boy.

206
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:16,446
He was a pilot.

207
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,203
It was...

208
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,041
It was the best summer.

209
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,336
It was perfect.

210
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:36,258
And then at the end of it,
he just vanished.

211
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:40,928
I keep thinking...

212
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,476
that he'll be
on the next busfull of new recruits.

213
00:28:48,146 --> 00:28:49,813
Or the next one.

214
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,738
So you're not here
because you love your job?

215
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:04,995
I hate space.

216
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,080
It's such a...

217
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,715
such a bizarre place...

218
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,845
There's so much to see down here.

219
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,351
If you were a time traveler,
but you could only travel in one direction,

220
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,020
which one would you chose?

221
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,271
Forward or back?

222
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,820
A few years ago,
I would have said back, for sure.

223
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,698
Now I'm not so certain.

224
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,543
I'm scared to death, you know?

225
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>I don't recall having dreams before.</i>

226
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:13,898
<i>Theres was a small crystalline pond</i>

227
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:21,696
<i>Theres was a small crystalline pond</i>

228
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,948
<i>blue, red,</i>

229
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:27,366
<i>and silver colors.</i>

230
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:31,623
<i>And all was bathed by the sun
in such an intense way</i>

231
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,333
<i>Everything was normal</i>

232
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,715
<i>except there was a lack of atmosphere.</i>

233
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:43,136
<i>The tree, the pool...</i>

234
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:47,096
<i>everything floated adrift in space.</i>

235
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,313
<i>I was impressed
to see the stars so clearly.</i>

236
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:04,990
Let's show the cards.

237
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:08,118
Don't be shy boy.

238
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:10,955
Friends of friends are always welcomed.

239
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,956
Let's see what you got.

240
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,718
Tell them the story
you told me and Vladimir the other day.

241
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,311
Ok...

242
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:35,851
So my parents run a collective farm

243
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,063
producing wheat and potatoes,

244
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,275
I was very young, to look after the labourers.

245
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:45,238
We had this one worker who...

246
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:49,326
He is the laziest human
being you've ever seen in your life.

247
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,370
From Moldovia!
- From Moldovia!

248
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,591
And the guy answered, "Yes, I would".

249
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,266
But here comes the best part,
tell them what you answered.

250
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:15,351
So I said "Ok, you're fired".

251
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:25,488
Well I know somebody,
who definitely should be fired.

252
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,503
Come on, don't be shy.

253
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,991
Alexander Illich, say the name: Mishin.

254
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,825
Yeah...

255
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:35,036
Fucking bureaus are gonna be shit.

256
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,085
Not that Glushko's
is looking any better.

257
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,546
Ever since these little bastards
beat us in the moon

258
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:49,930
When is the Almaz gonna be launch?

259
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:52,640
That would give the americans
something to talk about.

260
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:54,683
Two to three years...

261
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,893
at least.

262
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,980
So Chelomei is not working on
his lunar project anymore?

263
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,898
You keep your boy
well informed, don't you?

264
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,488
That project is dead, kid!

265
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,533
Being second is a disgrace.
- King of spades.

266
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:15,120
I disagree.

267
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:20,960
Are we playing cards or are we talking?
Let's play and drink.

268
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:23,630
Come on, no more politics. Ah, play.

269
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,015
I wonder what it's like not to see.

270
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:40,311
Blind people. You know they can hear things
we can even imagine

271
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,198
Of you go!

272
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,790
Andrei, you're spoiling them again.

273
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,001
Come. I have something to tell you.

274
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:05,588
Andrei...

275
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:08,798
I'm going to retire.
- Really? Why?

276
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:13,305
I don't want to bother you with the reasons.
I don't want to talk about it

277
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,600
But I do want you to finally meet Chelomei.

278
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,185
He's put together an impressive team.

279
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:25,311
His designs are light years ahead
of the ones that Koroliov was working on

280
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,983
and the ones that Mishin is working on now.

281
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,231
N1 is a dead project,

282
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:33,781
but you know, my friend,
everything is politics, hum?

283
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:37,826
Maybe one day you can change that.

284
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,206
I've told him, that he can trust you.

285
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,498
He can depend on you.

286
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:46,255
That you're his man in Star City,
am I right?

287
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,340
am I right?

288
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:50,713
Of course.

289
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,218
Thank you.

290
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,190
<i>I remember you telling me
something about atoms...</i>

291
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,030
<i>Twin quantum particles
that resonated together,</i>

292
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,946
<i>no matter where they were in the universe.</i>

293
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,743
<i>Paradise number four were your lips...</i>

294
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:27,835
<i>exhaling a breath that steamed
into the air in successive repetitions.</i>

295
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,340
<i>And the sun was setting...</i>

296
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,051
<i>I remember that well.</i>

297
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,343
Come on, come on, it's open!

298
00:36:58,055 --> 00:37:02,055
Ahh, something smells good in here.
Put some music on. Have you got my milk?

299
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,806
It's amazing.

300
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:06,645
Oh, yes please.
- No, no, no, no, no.

301
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,396
Can I have a little bit?

302
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:11,273
You've been promoted again.
- Aren't you going to congratulate me?

303
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:14,150
I'm too bored!
- Come on, at least a kiss!

304
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,321
At least a kiss for a star.

305
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:18,281
This looks yummy!

306
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,323
Can I help?
- No, no, you can...

307
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,451
You know, you never put enough salt.
- Here.

308
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,290
Off!

309
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:54,563
Yeah...
- No, no, not this one.

310
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,363
Sit down, sit down.
- Ok, I'm going, I'm going.

311
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,376
Ah, let's take some of this.
- That piece right there has my name on it.

312
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,336
Please sir...

313
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,053
Well let's pour for everyone first.

314
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,570
I've got reports to finish,
and I have to go.

315
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,613
No Stas, the reports can wait.

316
00:38:41,906 --> 00:38:44,653
No rest for the wicked.
- Oh, come on.

317
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,703
I'd love staying but thank you.

318
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:01,548
So...

319
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,266
I've got you something
to celebrate my promotion.

320
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:11,181
Andrei, I...
- Look, ok, just...

321
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,563
just take it. Alright?

322
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:18,191
For me.

323
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:23,168
I'm so glad you're alive.

324
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:28,673
They told me today I'm gonna see again.

325
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:31,676
Hey, that's great news! What did I tell you?

326
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:35,471
You know, we were doing freefall today.

327
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,600
it's incredible feeling
having your body suspended on the air.

328
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,685
You're gonna love it.

329
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,728
No, I'm not going to love it.

330
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:45,275
I'm not going to love it
because I'm not gonna do it.

331
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:48,525
They're not gonna let me fly anymore Stas.

332
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:52,405
I'm not gonna be a cosmonaut
and I'm not going to space ever.

333
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,248
You don't know that.

334
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:06,128
I'm sorry but... look at it this way...

335
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,675
sometimes you know, maybe you have to lose your wings
to fly a little bit higher.

336
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:18,348
Fuck... You really think
you can say that to me right now

337
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:22,643
I'm not going to space ever, alright?
It's not gonna fucking happen.

338
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,313
There is gonna be everything
I spent my fucking life planning for

339
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:29,358
fucked.

340
00:43:30,703 --> 00:43:36,076
Gagarin, Titov, Leonov,
not fucking Vasiliev.

341
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:39,578
They're not gonna know my name!
- Is that what this is about, righ?

342
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:44,081
Is this what this is about for you?
- About being someone?

343
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,378
I could have been somebody Stas,
but I am a fucking failure.

344
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:50,130
Hey, hey, listen to me...

345
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:55,631
this life is about living,
not about posterity, not about history books.

346
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:57,595
It's about doing the best thing you can.

347
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,556
Fuck off.
- Right now, you're being pathetic.

348
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,836
<i>Mihailov Alexander Ivanovich,</i>

349
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:34,635
<i>Volkov Alexei Pablovich,</i>

350
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,843
<i>Limchuck Piotr Ilich,</i>

351
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:39,261
<i>Vasutich Vladimir Vladimirovich,</i>

352
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
<i>Mihailov Stas Arsenievich,</i>

353
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
<i>Arseni Alexander Artemyev.</i>

354
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,438
<i>Congratulations and welcome
to the cosmonaut fraternity.</i>

355
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:11,585
<i>As I fell off I thought of a welcome.</i>

356
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:18,010
<i>Secretly, I also imagined national dances
and beautiful women.</i>

357
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:22,096
<i>I thought about the hurrays
and the solemn celebrations.</i>

358
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:25,351
<i>But they weren't there.</i>

359
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,368
I remember
a naked fists fight with a boy.

360
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:14,793
He liked a girl.

361
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,295
I liked her too.

362
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:21,340
We never mentioned the subject again.

363
00:47:22,218 --> 00:47:24,468
Even though we continued being friends.

364
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:27,763
Private?

365
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:31,936
Ah, it's good to see you. Feels like it's been ages.
- It's been two weeks.

366
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:34,311
With the launch preparations
I haven't got a spare minute.

367
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,980
I forgot you're so important these days.
How is it working at the OKB- 52?

368
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:41,611
It's amazing. I can't believe
I'm working with Chelomei. You?

369
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:45,281
I'm ok, can't complain.
How's your cousin?

370
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,951
I can always write you
some leave if you wanna go visit her.

371
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:49,745
No that's ok. It's too far.

372
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,873
You can tell her from me
that she still owes me that date.

373
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,916
You are like a dog on heat.

374
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:57,253
What's it with you and women?
Isn't one enough?

375
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,005
I just have a thirst
that can't be quenched, comrade.

376
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:01,965
How's the move going?

377
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:05,550
Be ended by the end of next week.
It's almost finished. What about you?

378
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:08,388
You gonna spend the rest of your life
in this poky little dorm room?

379
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,181
You're joking right?

380
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:14,101
It's the most comfortable place on Earth.
And soon, thanks to you,

381
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:17,106
I'll be heading for the stars.
- Now he's a poet!

382
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,475
<i>When I woke up, in the dream,</i>

383
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:01,230
<i>the only thing that remained
from this planet was a faint light</i>

384
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:04,443
<i>a light prior to the instants,</i>

385
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:10,201
<i>something primeval... very... basic.</i>

386
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,538
<i>I remembered some words:</i>

387
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:22,338
<i>"I had been able to glimpse the brain's autumn,</i>

388
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,173
<i>"the last scene of reason,</i>

389
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:29,011
<i>"and then a light that froze my blood."</i>

390
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,178
<i>Paradise one were two seagulls
that flew over the water.</i>

391
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:04,270
<i>Paradise two were a cluster of clouds
in the northern east skies.</i>

392
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:09,613
<i>Yesterday I sensed a strange presence.</i>

393
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:12,448
<i>There was no one there but I still felt it.</i>

394
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:14,868
<i>You know I don't believe in ghosts</i>

395
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,990
<i>but stil...</i>

396
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,123
<i>For a few seconds, I ceased to hear.</i>

397
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,835
<i>An absolute silence.</i>

398
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,548
<i>I screamed petrified and hit with my fist the ash
that covered it all.</i>

399
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,805
<i>I have forgotten your name.</i>

400
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:09,213
You scared me.

401
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,841
You been there long?

402
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:13,510
No.

403
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:15,636
You could've knocked.

404
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:17,555
I've brought you some berries.

405
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:11,235
Hi, it's, it's me.
Do you know where Stas is?

406
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:15,776
Look, are you sitting down?

407
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,783
You're not going to believe
what I'm going to tell you.

408
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:21,156
The americans are coming to Star City
to train with us.

409
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:24,163
There's going to be a joint mission
between Apollo and Soyuz.

410
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:25,873
Yes.

411
00:53:27,586 --> 00:53:30,461
It's gonna be the first docking
of two countries in space.

412
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:34,591
And they've asked me to take charge
of our end of the mission.

413
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,426
I didn't know what to say.

414
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:40,636
Ok.

415
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:42,598
Ok, I'll see you later.

416
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:52,108
<i>Andrei, Brehznev has asked me
to develop the UR- 700 programme.</i>

417
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,275
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

418
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:56,028
<i>The Moon Programme I designed.
The one they cancelled.</i>

419
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:57,613
<i>Yes, yes, of course. It's just that...</i>

420
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:02,156
<i>I know, the N1 is a big fat iron bird
that's never gonna fly.</i>

421
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:04,911
<i>We have a chance here
of doing things right for once.</i>

422
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:07,121
<i>An open mission?
- Don't be naïve.</i>

423
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,000
<i>It'll only be disclosed
if we step foot on the Moon.</i>

424
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:12,501
<i>Wow... I don't know what to say...</i>

425
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:15,085
<i>I want you to take charge of the mission.</i>

426
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,550
<i>Sir?
- I won't take a no for an answer.</i>

427
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:21,263
<i>We'll talk soon.
Bye my dear Andrei.</i>

428
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:32,020
A technician from over there at NASA
was telling me a joke the other day.

429
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:35,110
Made me promise I wouldn't get angry.

430
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,486
If only he knew the half of it...

431
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,325
So Brezhnev is in the Kremlin

432
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,285
and he's showing his mom around the place, as you do.

433
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:49,290
He shows her rooms
with beautiful ornaments,

434
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,583
luxurious banqueting halls...

435
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:57,456
Oh, and the garage,
which of course is crammed full of limousines.

436
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:00,426
And he says to her:

437
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:05,265
"Don't you think your son has done
pretty well by himself mama? Are you proud?".

438
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:07,808
And his mother replies:

439
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:11,351
"Not so much proud,
darling, as worried.

440
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,606
"What if the bolsheviks return?".

441
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,528
I want you to be serious Andrei.

442
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:22,943
Personal feelings aside for a moment,
no preferences, no judgements.

443
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:26,076
Who do you think should go?

444
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:03,490
I would say the situation is almost comical...

445
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:08,370
except it isn't.

446
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,540
You wanna know the truth?

447
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:18,130
I bet if you find these tapes
you won't like to hear this, but...

448
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:23,593
I wish I had stayed on the moon.

449
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:30,350
At least I was happy there.

450
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:39,943
I dreamt we landed on the moon

451
00:56:40,656 --> 00:56:42,655
and won the space race.

452
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,863
The space race
is just american propaganda.

453
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,828
It's a name they gave to something
that we started and that we're gonna finish.

454
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:52,706
You're starting to sound like one of them.

455
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,306
All right, you're having this, you're having this.

456
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:13,351
Eat, open, open up, open up. Oh yes, yum.

457
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,565
Happy new year. Happy new...

458
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:32,073
The salami...

459
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:38,876
I'm sending Stas to the moon.

460
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:01,233
Do you know what you're doing?

461
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:04,570
They asked me who was the best man.

462
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:08,363
So you said it was Stas?

463
00:58:12,241 --> 00:58:14,245
I'm giving him what he wants, Yulia.

464
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:35,783
<i>Where are you cosmonaut?</i>

465
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:38,201
<i>I need your body.</i>

466
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:46,040
<i>Paradise number four were your lips,</i>

467
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,505
<i>exhaling a breath that steamed
into the air in successive repetitions.</i>

468
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:17,451
I've seen you wearing this sometimes.

469
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:19,371
Who gave it to you?

470
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:21,290
No one.

471
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:26,833
I've used it as the mission's logo.

472
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,548
You don't mind, do you?

473
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:33,343
No.

474
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:36,721
No, of course you can use it.

475
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:12,208
A bow and arrow?
- It's a bow and arrow for mister important over there.

476
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,088
See if he goes to get some lunch
cause I am getting hungry.

477
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:17,338
Say?

478
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,175
My shoe!

479
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,258
Oh no! Oh no look!
- Your shoe!

480
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,640
Look the shoe is lost!

481
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,721
Oh, it's being torpedoed!
- No, no, no, no.

482
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:32,351
Look at that!
That's not going to be nice to wear now.

483
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:34,275
You want it?
- Yes.

484
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,275
Oh, the color, is like...

485
01:03:36,363 --> 01:03:39,436
Give the lady your shoe. There you go, that's for you.
- It's like... cosmonaut training.

486
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:41,111
Oh, I feel like Cinderella.

487
01:03:41,368 --> 01:03:42,698
Lovely.

488
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,743
And now we can leave him by himelsef.

489
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:22,260
It is 39827.

490
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:25,425
Pitch trimm is 003.

491
01:05:26,765 --> 01:05:30,973
Roll trimm is 987.

492
01:07:03,863 --> 01:07:06,026
Time... zero, SRB. Ignition.

493
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,153
Lift off.

494
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:18,663
Control, what did you say? Repeat.

495
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,915
We didn't say anything, Stas.

496
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:46,208
THREE DAYS LATER

497
01:09:02,101 --> 01:09:03,228
So...

498
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:08,645
I've made Earth's orbit.

499
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:30,213
It's gonna be mighty tricky
to get down there though.

500
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:40,306
I don't...

501
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:43,060
I don't have enough...

502
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:47,021
energy to force the re-entry.

503
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:19,221
<i>Andrei...</i>

504
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,521
I love you pal.

505
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:30,601
<i>I remember your eyes clearly...</i>

506
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:32,485
<i>your nose...</i>

507
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:34,903
<i>your hair...</i>

508
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:36,821
<i>And stupid things like...</i>

509
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,616
<i>the number of freckles you have.</i>

510
01:10:39,776 --> 01:10:41,368
Yulia for goodness sake...

511
01:10:41,618 --> 01:10:44,330
Would you just... put some music on,
the static is giving me a headache.

512
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,585
I...

513
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:00,678
I am really...

514
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:08,853
really...

515
01:11:11,398 --> 01:11:12,816
sorry.

516
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:16,195
I'm sorry.

517
01:11:26,288 --> 01:11:27,998
I'm gonna miss you both.

518
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,375
I'm gonna miss you.

519
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,545
I'm gonna miss you.

520
01:11:37,508 --> 01:11:38,841
I can see...

521
01:11:39,843 --> 01:11:41,261
I can see...

522
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:56,901
<i>I can see...</i>

523
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:59,195
<i>the three of us...</i>

524
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,495
<i>together again.</i>

525
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,875
<i>Walking...</i>

526
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,508
<i>walking along the beach.</i>

527
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,533
<i>I've arrived to a place I can recognize.</i>

528
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:51,623
<i>There was a sign I couldn't read</i>

529
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:53,703
<i>but I remember it's name:</i>

530
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,958
<i>Starry townlet.</i>

531
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:14,646
<i>I remember where you used to live but...</i>

532
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,566
<i>I'm not sure I want to go.</i>

533
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:25,448
<i>As I walked closer
I started to hear drums.</i>

534
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:30,120
<i>The closer I am,</i>

535
01:13:31,663 --> 01:13:33,706
<i>the more deafening the sound becomes.</i>

536
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:41,381
<i>The relics of a lost future?</i>

537
01:13:41,673 --> 01:13:42,966
<i>Our future?</i>

538
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:45,800
<i>I can't allow myself to think like that.</i>

539
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,388
<i>You understand, right?</i>

540
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,741
<i>Plus, I feel you closer everyday.</i>

541
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:55,645
<i>This... civilization, this country...</i>

542
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:59,231
<i>They might be all
a bunch of collapsed ruins.</i>

543
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,401
<i>I don't care.</i>

544
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,240
<i>It's you and me
I care about, cosmonaut.</i>

545
01:14:07,115 --> 01:14:08,325
<i>I want you back.</i>

546
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:07,026
Since...

547
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:09,238
Since he died she's just...

548
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:12,115
She's different.

549
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,248
It's like she's...

550
01:16:20,331 --> 01:16:21,708
thin.

551
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:25,085
And I don't mean her body or...

552
01:16:27,046 --> 01:16:28,631
She's not quite there.

553
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:32,300
She just...

554
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:36,598
She doesn't even drink water.

555
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,183
Oh, god...

556
01:16:40,518 --> 01:16:42,771
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep,
she doesn't...

557
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,361
No.

558
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,780
No.

559
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:55,283
I don't wanna work.
I don't wanna...

560
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:59,538
I can't focus, and I don't wanna...

561
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:03,916
Don't want to go to that place.

562
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:09,256
I had this...

563
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:14,301
<i>I had this crazy...</i>

564
01:17:15,846 --> 01:17:17,428
<i>crazy dream.</i>

565
01:17:18,393 --> 01:17:20,323
<i>I was talking to Stas and...</i>

566
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:23,436
<i>I asked him:</i>

567
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:28,108
<i>"Was it worth it Stas?</i>

568
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:36,116
<i>"Was it worth losing her
to leave a footprint on the moon?".</i>

569
01:17:38,415 --> 01:17:39,660
<i>He said:</i>

570
01:17:39,786 --> 01:17:41,241
<i>"No."</i>

571
01:17:43,456 --> 01:17:45,000
<i>"No, it wasn't."</i>

572
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:47,545
<i>"But for just one...</i>

573
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:50,746
<i>"fraction of second...</i>

574
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:54,801
<i>"I felt alive."</i>

575
01:17:59,598 --> 01:18:00,848
No.

576
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:02,353
Of course.

577
01:18:02,521 --> 01:18:03,768
Yeah, of course.

578
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:09,956
Yulia!

579
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,470
Oh, God! Oh, God!

580
01:20:03,055 --> 01:20:04,515
Help!
