1
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,467
- Police chief
has authorized his officers

2
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,095
to use force if necessary.

3
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,847
It has been eight days
since Perez first witnessed

4
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,351
the appearance of the
Virgin Mary on his windshield.

5
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,478
Apparently,
Perez has the AIDS virus

6
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,313
and believes this is a miracle.

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,315
He has refused
to get out of his car.

8
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,109
And as you can see,
the faithful have arrived

9
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,736
from all across the state,
each and every one-

10
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,956
- Hi. Hey.

11
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,668
- Hey, how's it feel
to be my husband?

12
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,671
- Today I'm must say that I'm
the happiest man in the world.

13
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,185
- Someone shut that dog up!

14
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,538
- Shit.

15
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,500
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

16
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,419
Can I use your cell phone?
It's an emergency.

17
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,587
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you so much.

18
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,755
Just-you're so kind.

19
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,882
Just one minute, one minute.

20
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,682
Oh, thank God
you're still there.

21
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,685
How's he doing?

22
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,730
Can I speak with him, please?

23
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,441
Hi.

24
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,777
Hi, honey, it's Mommy.

25
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,111
How you doing, sweet pea?

26
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,196
How you doing?
I miss you.

27
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,031
I miss you so much.

28
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,950
I'm on this date,
and it's going so well.

29
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,910
It's going really, really well.

30
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,205
His name is David,
and he really likes me.

31
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,456
I think he really likes me,

32
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,708
and he even wants
to take me to Paris.

33
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,877
I think I got it right.

34
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,088
I think I got it right
this time.

35
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,681
David.

36
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,808
- Yes?

37
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,018
- I really didn't mean to knock
that table over back there.

38
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,561
I- I just-
I don't know what happened.

39
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,940
I just-I'm so-
I'm so nervous,

40
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,484
because I really like you,

41
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,070
and I know this is
our first date and everything,

42
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,613
and I know that it's probably
not the way

43
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,575
that you wanted it to turn out,
but I can be better.

44
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,327
I really, really
want to see you again,

45
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,663
and I really want to prove
to you that I can be-

46
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,790
I can be better than this.

47
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,089
Do you remember Annie Hall,
the movie?

48
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,175
I was just thinking about
the first date thing when,

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,510
you know, Alvy and Annie,

50
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,387
they talk about the first kiss
during their date,

51
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,808
and they just sort of
get it out of the way.

52
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,811
It just feels like that moment.

53
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,438
- Listen, Johnny.

54
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,775
- Hey, do you want to come in
for a minute?

55
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,861
- Good night, Johnny.

56
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,493
- Rudy?

57
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,037
Where are you?

58
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,249
Rudy?

59
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,417
Rudy?

60
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,754
- ♪ I found a new place
to dwell ♪

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,423
♪ Well, it's down at the end
of the lonely street ♪

62
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,885
♪ to Heartbreak Hotel ♪

63
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,262
♪ I've been so lonely, baby ♪

64
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,390
♪ You make me so lonely ♪

65
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,060
♪ I get so lonely,
I could die ♪

66
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,940
- Hey, where's my dog?

67
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,233
- Can you not see
that I'm busy?

68
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,485
- Come on, man,
just have you seen him?

69
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,529
- No dogs allowed.
Read sign.

70
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,114
- Look, where the hell
is my dog?

71
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,657
- He took off, ran away.

72
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,618
He was barking, barking,
barking like crazy,

73
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,246
and I go to the door,
he took off, ran away.

74
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,414
Not my fault.

75
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,623
- Your-

76
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,625
- I already told you
too many times.

77
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,293
No dogs allowed!

78
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,088
- It just holds no value to me.

79
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,131
- Christ.

80
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,715
- What does that mean,
an act of faith?

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,678
What?

82
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,472
Oh, Christ.

83
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,182
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,229
What were you doing
in the street, huh?

86
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,649
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,825
Come on.

88
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,455
Come on.

89
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,185
- Do you feel a deep sense
of loneliness?

90
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,728
Wish that you had
someone special

91
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,396
to share your dreams with?

92
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,857
Do you ever wonder
if there is that special person

93
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,650
waiting out there just for you?

94
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,279
- You, sir,
are a lucky dog.

95
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,615
You hear me?

96
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,994
You're a lucky, lucky dog.

97
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,208
That's what I'll call you.

98
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:26,046
I'll call you Lucky.

99
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,423
Welcome to your new home, Lucky.

100
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,363
- Welcome back.

101
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,491
- I'm just passing through.

102
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,079
I don't have a lot of time
to waste.

103
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,539
- I had no choice.

104
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,708
After you went down,

105
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,836
the feds were watching me
like a hawk.

106
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,172
I couldn't go down like that.

107
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,091
Had a family to take care of.
- What about me?

108
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,926
I didn't have a family?

109
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,929
25 years I did,
25 years.

110
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,138
You don't call.
You don't write.

111
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,349
You don't do shit.
We're friends?

112
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,309
I swear, I would kill you
if given a chance.

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,149
- Remember that job in Carson?

114
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,068
You were young and stupid.

115
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,908
Now you've repaid that debt
with your silence.

116
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,162
This is who we are.

117
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,373
This is the path we chose.

118
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,042
I've come to accept it.

119
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,755
- How was she?

120
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,217
My Mary?

121
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,510
Did you see much of her?

122
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,096
- Beginning, yes.

123
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,224
Not much again till the end.

124
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,476
- My name ever come up?

125
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,729
- No.

126
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,567
But I don't think
she ever stopped loving you.

127
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,907
It's what's owed to you...

128
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,576
and everything you need to know.

129
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,167
I hope the next time
we find each other

130
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,461
is in heaven.

131
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,451
- Girl, what you doing?

132
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,161
- Whatever.

133
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,330
Get off my corner, whore.

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,087
- Bitch, get to work.

135
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,718
- Look, honey, this is probably
your first time,

136
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,471
so I'm going to spell out
the menu for you, okay?

137
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,890
$20, I jerk you off.

138
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,059
$100, you can fuck me
in the ass.

139
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,061
A few dollars more,
you can come on my face.

140
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,938
I don't care about
my mascara running,

141
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,065
just don't get it
in my hair, okay?

142
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,943
- That's all you charge?

143
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,197
Seriously, I think you're worth
much more than that.

144
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,991
You look like a beautiful woman.

145
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,538
- That's very sweet of you,
honey,

146
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,456
but for now I've got tits

147
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,750
and eight inches
fully functional.

148
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,253
But one day,
I dream to be flawless.

149
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,296
- What does that mean?

150
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,842
- To be tucked, operated on,
you know?

151
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,427
- Why haven't you done that?

152
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,929
- It's mucho dinero, señor.
- Oh.

153
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,265
- I'm saving up.

154
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,642
- How much do you make a night?

155
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,394
- What's it to you?

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,396
- Nothing, I just-
what is it, like, $400, $500-

157
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,690
- Stop the fucking car.
You're wasting my time.

158
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,275
Stop the car.

159
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,116
Gracias.

160
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,245
- Hold on, stay, stay.

161
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,124
I need you to help me
save someone.

162
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,876
Okay?

163
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,920
I'll pay you.

164
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,425
And I assure you
that if you do this, you-

165
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,053
you'll probably never have to do
what you do ever again.

166
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,104
- I don't do anything
I don't want to do, okay?

167
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,273
So what do you want from me?

168
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,818
- In the back of my car,
there's a backpack.

169
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,780
I want you to open it.

170
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,864
I want you to look inside.

171
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,786
Inside, there's $50,000 cash.

172
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,623
It's all the savings
I have left in the world,

173
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,375
and I want you to have it

174
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,628
if you just do me
this one service.

175
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,842
There's a gun
in my glove compartment.

176
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,428
And it's got two bullets
in the chamber.

177
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,269
I want you to pick up that gun.

178
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:39,025
I want you to hold it
really tight,

179
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:45,323
and I want you to shoot me
right here in my heart.

180
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,912
- This is a fucking joke, right?

181
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,164
Am I on TV or something?

182
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,374
I've seen this shit on TV.

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,959
There's little spy cameras
everywhere.

184
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,210
I know this.

185
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,962
I know, I know, Slim.

186
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,296
He put you up to this,
didn't he?

187
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,924
- It's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

188
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,260
There can't be any accidents.

189
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,226
There's a suicide note
with my signature.

190
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,061
So when they find me,

191
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,565
you don't have to worry
about the authorities, okay?

192
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,112
- Why did you do that?

193
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,907
- Do what?

194
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,158
- Your goddamn prayer.

195
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,744
Are you religious?

196
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,829
- Get out of my car.

197
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,955
- Do you not want
to burn in hell?

198
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,081
Is that what it is?

199
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,165
- Get out.

200
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,417
- You fucking coward.

201
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,335
So you search the streets
for people like me

202
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,587
because we seem desperate?

203
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,505
- I said get out.
- You fucking coward.

204
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,590
- Get out of my car!

205
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,550
- So who cares, right?
- Get out!

206
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,969
You go!
- Lay off of it!

207
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,220
Everyone's got problems!

208
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,305
Deal with it!
- Go!

209
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,057

00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,691
- Jack, you have gastric cancer.

259
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,485
- How much time do I have?

260
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,280
- It depends
on your will to live.

261
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,033
- Yo, excuse me.

262
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,409
Calm down, man.

263
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,411
This is my last stop.

264
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,122
And your nose is bleeding.

265
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,715
- Okay, well,

266
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,302
after carefully reviewing
your application, Mr. Doolittle,

267
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,637
I regret to inform you

268
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,391
that we have denied your
request for a loan at this time.

269
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,227
- But I filled everything out
just like you requested.

270
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,895
- Yes.

271
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,982
When your father passed away,
he left a lot of debt.

272
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,859
I'm afraid, without
a substantial payment,

273
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,821
we have no choice but to begin
foreclosure proceedings

274
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,322
at the end of the month.

275
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,493
- Hello, Mrs. Wilson?

276
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,620
Hey, this-this is Qwerty
from the mortuary.

277
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,913
- Why are you calling?

278
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,164
- No, I-I was wondering-

279
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,333
I know I promised no payments
till after New Year,

280
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,418
but I was just wondering if-

281
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,545
if there was anything you can
offer in the next few days,

282
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,463
that would-that would be
hugely appreciated.

283
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,424
- Richard got laid off.

284
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,717
It's Christmas,

285
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,510
and I haven't gotten
the children anything yet.

286
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,636
I don't think-

287
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,221
- All right, no, you know what?

288
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,681
Forget the call.
Forget the call.

289
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,765
You keep the money,

290
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,850
and you buy your kids
some gifts.

291
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,184
You make it a good Christmas
for 'em.

292
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,311
- Thank you, Qwerty.

293
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,603
Your father would be proud.

294
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,688
- All right, no.

295
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,856
- You're a fine young man.

296
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,483
- Yep, you have a good night,
Mrs. Wilson.

297
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,651
All right.

298
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,540
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,917
You-you scared me.

300
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,586
- I was driving by,
I saw the lights in here,

301
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,213
so I thought it was open.

302
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,715
- No, we're actually closed.

303
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,968
We open at 10:00
in the morning.

304
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,720
- Okay.

305
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,684
I need a coffin.

306
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,230
I need it tonight.

307
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,816
And I'll pay you cash for it.

308
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,245
- It's kind of-
it's peaceful in there, huh?

309
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,708
What do you think?

310
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,964
Sorry.

311
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,591
- I'll take it.

312
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,717
- All right, sir.

313
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,928
It's a-it's a great choice.
You won't be disappointed.

314
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,930
- I have another request.

315
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,349
- Oh, we can customize it
with anything you want.

316
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,309
In the past, we even put
a complete sound system

317
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,685
with speakers in.

318
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,979
- No, no, this-this is-

319
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,776
No, no, I like the coffin.

320
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,486
It's just that it needs a body.

321
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,656
- Oh, we're a full service
mortuary, sir.

322
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,491
Has-has the deceased
been embalmed yet?

323
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,326
- No, he's-he's not dead yet.

324
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,038
- I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

325
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,000
Sir, please-

326
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:47,508
Please, I don't want
any trouble.

327
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,386
- I know this is
an unusual request,

328
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:55,307
but I need you to take this gun

329
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,227
and put a bullet
inside my heart.

330
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,979
- No, perhaps
you've been drinking.

331
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,773
Please, everything is-

332
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,358
everything's gonna be all right.

333
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,651
- I can pay you.
- No.

334
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,113
- I got $50,000 cash.

335
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,449
What, you don't believe me?

336
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,533
I'll show you.

337
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,826
I'll show you;
it's in my car.

338
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,665
- This can't be happening.

339
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,916
- It could all be yours.

340
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,669
I know you have problems.

341
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,255
I heard you on the phone.

342
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,050
We all have problems.

343
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,387
You help-you help me with mine,
I help you with yours.

344
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,693
No, keep it.

345
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,737
- Please, please.
Please, sir.

346
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,865
Sir, in my-in my profession,
I see death every day,

347
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,825
some by accident,
some by sickness,

348
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,703
but some through despair.

349
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,206
These are the ones
I wish I could have helped.

350
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,041
- Help me.

351
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,127
Help me by pulling this trigger.

352
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,670
Please.

353
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,255
Come on, please.

354
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,424
Please, I need your help.

355
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,884
- No.
- Please.

356
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,886
Go ahead.
- I won't do it.

357
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,722
I won't kill you.
No.

358
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,225
- Why?

359
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,393
It's easy!

360
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,827
I and my father are one?

361
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,247
But can you feel my pain?

362
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,209
Can you feel my pain?

363
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,463
Hi. Hey.

364
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,881
- Hey.

365
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,259
How's it feel to be my husband?

366
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,387
- Today, I must say that I'm
the happiest man in the world.

367
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,523
Let me show you.

368
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,151
Let me show the kids.

369
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,738
Hey.

370
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,490
- I love you.

371
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,576
- I love you too.

372
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,087
- Charlie?

373
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,591
Sorry to wake you, but we're-
we're closing down soon.

374
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,057
Here.

375
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,268
It's on the house.

376
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,562
Just hope it might
cheer you up.

377
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,147
You have a few minutes, so...

378
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,150
or I could pack it up
to go for you.

379
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,234
- You want to share it?

380
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,153
Share it with me?

381
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,531
- Oh.

382
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:03,329
It's tempting, but I have this
new dress for the holiday

383
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,372
that I'm determined to fit in.

384
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,500
Want to know my secret?

385
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,754
I hang it over the dining table
to help motivate me a bit.

386
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,760
It's good, huh?

387
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,844
Isn't it?

388
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,930
We bake 'em fresh here
every morning.

389
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,974
I think they're good.

390
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,229
I don't mean to be nosy
or anything,

391
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:33,400
but what's a man like you
doing at this hour

392
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,529
passed out in a diner?

393
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,616
- I had a really hard day.

394
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,244
- Big smile like yours,
you expect me to believe that?

395
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,839
Yeah, just right here.

396
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,300
- Okay.

397
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,511
- Yeah, just right up there.

398
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,691
- I like the lights.

399
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,526
- I did it myself.

400
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,695
- Yeah?

401
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,115
I like the different colors.

402
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,033
- Yeah.

403
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,327
Yeah, I've always
loved Christmas.

404
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,792
- You live there a long time?

405
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,795
- About a year,
since my divorce.

406
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,006
- You don't really
have to talk about that

407
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,091
if you don't feel like it.

408
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,217
I don't-

409
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,262
- Well, we-
you know, we grew apart.

410
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,597
You know, you wake up
one morning after 13 years,

411
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,474
and the feeling's gone,

412
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,017
and, you know,
you try to hang in there,

413
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,271
but there's really nothing
you can do.

414
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,356
But we both agreed that,
you know,

415
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:58,777
we didn't want to grow old
taking up each other's space.

416
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,155
- You guys still talk, then?

417
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,823
- Not for a couple months.

418
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,954
Do you-

419
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,373
do you want to come up,
'cause I'm just-

420
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,460
I live there alone,
and I don't have any cats,

421
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,045
in case your allergic.

422
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,299
- I, um...

423
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,718
I don't-I don't think
I should do that.

424
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,720
- No, you're probably right.

425
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,138
It's late.

426
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,516
- I mean, you're probably
really tired anyway.

427
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,143
- Can I ask you something?

428
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,022
How come you picked me up,
gave me a ride?

429
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,732
- I don't know.

430
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,817
I don't-I don't know why.

431
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,360
I don't know.

432
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,204
- Okay, I hope you don't mind.

433
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,580
I just haven't-

434
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:56,543
I just, you know, haven't kissed
a man in a long time.

435
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,756
I just forgot how good it feels.

436
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,508
Okay, thank you for the ride.

437
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,343
Maybe I'll see you around.

438
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,594
Okay.

439
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,990
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

440
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,335
- Hey, you're late again.

441
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,503
Get down there and get dressed

442
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,255
and get on
the fucking stage now.

443
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,394
- We need to talk now.

444
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,730
Well, lookie, lookie, Cookie.

445
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,982
No, don't stop.

446
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,985
It just got
a lot more interesting.

447
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,153
So come on
and join the party, sweetcakes.

448
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,700
We are on lesson number three,
the day you were absent.

449
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,203
Oh, no, you did not
touch the 'do.

450
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,288
- Oh, yeah.

451
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,956
Fuck your 'do,
and fuck your whores.

452
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,416
- Who you calling a whore,
you little bitch?

453
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,500
- I don't see what else-

454
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,129
- No, no, no,
Cookie, Cookie, Cookie.

455
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,338
Go upstairs.

456
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,215
We'll finish up later.

457
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,890
All right.

458
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,893
So...

459
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,604
What are we talking about here,
Johnny?

460
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,771
I don't understand.
Tell me-

461
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,856
- We're talking about my son.

462
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,149
We're talking about my son.

463
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,859
I cannot work on Christmas Eve.

464
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,110
I have to be with him.

465
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,737
Your son needs you to work,

466
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,280
and he needs you to work
very hard.

467
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,657
- Don't you fucking tell me
what's best for my kid.

468
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,825
I swear to God.

469
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,036
- The kid would not
know the difference

470
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,538
whether you're there or not.

471
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,998
Goddamn it.

472
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:02,336
Johnny, I have been easy on you,

473
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,129
because when I watch you dance,

474
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,800
I get a raging boner,
and so do a lot of other people.

475
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,469
But on Christmas Eve,

476
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,807
I'm gonna have a lot of very
lonely people out in my club,

477
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,645
some even thinking
about killing themselves,

478
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,439
and they come here
looking for companionship.

479
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,317
They're looking
for a little bit of love.

480
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,152
They are looking
for a little bit of hope.

481
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,321
- What about-what about
one of the girls who's Jewish?

482
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,781
What about them?
Why can't they work?

483
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,741
- That is not the point.

484
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,826
All the dancing that goes on
on that stage

485
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,204
is nothing but an expensive
advertisement

486

See, he likes to travel
the world,

he'll take me with him

632
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,352

and he has strong hands

633
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,229
and a very gentle heart.

634
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,773

00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,952
- Hi.
- Hey.

652
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,829
- I'm Nicole.

653
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,205
- Hey.

654
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,040
I'm-my name's Qwerty.

655
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,125
- I know.

656
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,502
It's on your name tag.

657
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,880
Is this your first time?

658
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,507
- Yeah.

659
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,883
Is it that obvious?

660
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,218
- It's also my first time.

661
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,430
You know, at first,
I didn't really want to come.

662
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,265
I didn't want
to seem desperate,

663
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,642
like I need help
in meeting someone.

664
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:35,189
But then I realized I haven't
been on a date in-in two years.

665
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,067
So, here I am.

666
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,945
Are-are you coming inside?

667
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:45,825
- Yeah, of course,
of course.

668
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,951
- Is everything all right?

669
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,787
- I'm sorry; I think
I'm losing circulation.

670
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,164
- Where?

671
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,749
- Just here in my right leg.

672
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,208
- Can I get you some water
or something?

673
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,918
Are you-

674
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,008
Help!

675
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,789
- Hi.

676
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,459
- Hey.

677
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,545
- I haven't seen you around
in a few days.

678
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,928
I was such an idiot
the other night.

679
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,347
I don't know
what came over me,

680
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,809
but I apologize
if I was being too forward.

681
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,813
- It's been a very long time
for me too.

682
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,157
You finished?
You're off?

683
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,285
- Yeah, it's been slow.

684
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,873
- If-if you want some company,
I could-

685
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,460
If you-if you'd like,
I could take you home.

686
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,628
I mean, if you want,
I could-

687
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,088
- Yeah, no, I-
yeah, I would like that.

688
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,214
I would.

689
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,883
- Great.

690
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,596
- But not tonight.

691
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,390
I can't.

692
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,766
That's him.

693
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,812
He called, you know, right-
shortly after I got home.

694
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,566
And he wants to talk,
and so here he is.

695
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,737
All right, well, bye.

696
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,948
- Mm, bye.

She-she has
really big blonde hair.

She slit both her wrists.

The crazy girl want to make

And I prescribe her medication,
make her feel good.

Listen, man,
if she ain't on the streets,

I can't tell you.

or at the Geisha Dungeon.

- Geisha Dungeon, what's that?

724
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,602
- The devil's lair.

725
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,916
Hey.

726
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,543
Hello.
- Hi.

727
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,004
- I was hoping
you would come in.

728
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,881
I saw you in my dreams
last night.

729
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,468
- Yeah, I wasn't sure
you were gonna be here.

730
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,345
- Can you come closer?

731
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,972
I'd like to get a good look
at your face.

732
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,265
- Okay.

733
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,897
- It was strange.

734
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,774
You were running.

735
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,819
You were running from something.

736
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,987
- Maybe I was trying to run
to something

737
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,156
or someone.

738
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,658
- No.

739
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,329
You had fear in your eyes
like you do now.

740
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,498
- I, um...

741
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,334
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday,

742
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,044
you know, that stuff
with your father

743
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,298
taking you to places
that you've never been.

744
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,008
Well, guess what?

745
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,010
- What?

746
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:27,143
- I got you two tickets
to anyplace in the world.

747
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,943
- I don't know what to say.

748
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,195
- Say, "I accept. "

749
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,325
- No, I can't.

750
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,535
We barely even know each other.

751
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,955
- Listen.

752
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,665
I don't have
a lot of time left.

753
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,333
- I don't watch the clock
in here, Jack.

754
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,793
You can have me
for as long as you want.

755
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,838
- What I'm saying is,
I'm going away soon,

756
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,049
and I'm not gonna be
coming back.

757
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,719
I want you
to have these tickets.

758
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,345
It would mean a lot to me.

759
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,392
- Who are you?

760
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,352
Why are you so good to me?

761
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,985
- My name's Jack Doheny.

762
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,279
I've been locked away
for 25 years,

763
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,739
which is a hell of a lot of time

764
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,949
for a man to reflect
on his life,

765
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,618
the choices he made

766
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,704
and what he wants to do
if given a second chance.

767
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,919
For 25 years,

768
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:40,216
I waited for my love
to come visit me.

769
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,386
But that day never came.

770
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,309
And then I got the news
that she passed away.

771
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,733
I never got the chance to-
to tell her I was sorry.

772
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,989
I loved her more than anything.

773
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:09,662
I'll never forget the day
that I first laid eyes upon her.

774
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,122
Her smile was beautiful.

775
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,542
She was so graceful.

776
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:20,965
When I saw her the next day...

777
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:26,595
I dumped a truckload of roses
at her feet...

778
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,640
and I told her
that if it wasn't enough,

779
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,475
I'd come back the next day

780
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,353
with roses
from all over the world.

781
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,984
We had dinner that night,

782
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,820
and by morning...

783
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,197
she became my wife.

784
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,034
- No.

785
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,871

to tell me

00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,700
- What is wrong with you people?

814
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,119
This is my son.

815
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,747
He's dying,
don't you understand?

816
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:21,210
This is my son,
and he's dying.

817
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,336
- All right.

818
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,048
Just please keep it down.

819
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,431
How you doing, sweet pea?

820
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,393
Oh, you scared me tonight.

821
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,019
Mommy called,
and nobody answered,

822
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,815
and I thought
something happened to you.

823
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,733
I thought you had left me.

824
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,241
I got something for you.

825
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,665
I know you're gonna like it.

826
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,167
It's a special edition.

827
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,753
Why don't you open your eyes
so you can see it?

828
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,178
You are gonna be all right.

829
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,640
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

830
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,476
I promise you.

831
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,312
I promise you, sweet pea.

832
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,690
I just miss you so much.

833
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,237
Baby?

834
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,989
Baby?

835
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,033
Baby, are you awake?

836
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,827
Nurse!

837
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,913
Nurse!
Doctor!

838
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,669
- Sit down for a minute,
Johnny.

839
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,837
- I don't want to sit.

840
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,338
I don't want to sit.

841
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,803
- Please put it out
and have a seat.

842
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,229
Have some coffee.

843
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,317
Johnny, your boy
is in what's known-

844
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,110
- Billy.

845
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,862
His name is Billy.

846
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,490
- Yes, Billy.

847
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,783
I need to remind you that
for the last three months,

848
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,661
he's in what's known as
a persistent vegetative state.

849
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,288
- He blinked.

850
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,749
I saw it with my own eyes.

851
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,043
While I was talking to him,
he blinked.

852
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,003
- That's misleading, and it's a-

853
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:32,549
it's a common involuntary reflex
response to motion and sound.

854
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,801
- Do you believe in miracles?

855
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,886
- In my profession,

856
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,388
sometimes I have no choice
but to.

857
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,683
- Well, maybe this is
one of those times.

858
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,769
I saw him blink.

859
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,397
I saw it with my own eyes.

860
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,442
- There's not much else
I can do.

861
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,196
I'm sorry, Johnny.

862
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,162
- Well, fuck you.

863
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,247
You're a doctor...

864
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,373
- Calm down.

865
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,791
- And all you can say is,
"I'm sorry"?

866
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,917
- Calm down, Johnny.

867
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,460
- You're a trained professional.

868
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,088
You are supposed to help people,
and my son needs help.

869
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,422
He needs your help.

870
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,841
You're all he's got.
Don't you understand that?

871
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,760
Is it the money?

872
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,053
You don't think
I have the money?

873
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,430
Well, I will work
every day of my life.

874
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,182
- It's not the money.

875
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,396
- Then what is it?

876
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:37,322
- It's okay.

877
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,158
I won't tell anyone.

878
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,082
Is this what you want?

879
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,501
Is this what you want?

880
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,421
- I'm sorry, Johnny.

881
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,631
- Where are you going?

882
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,757
Please don't leave.

883
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,469
I'll do whatever you want.

884
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,721
Come back here!

885
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,140
Doctors help people!

886
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,225
You are not a doctor!

887
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,810
You can't help anybody!

888
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,729
You're a fucking shit!

889
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:50,020
- Dr. Alexander
call extension 2860.

890
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,191
Dr. Alexander, 2860.

891
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,922
- What am I gonna do, Lucky?

892
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,048
Hmm?

893
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,426
What am I gonna do with you?

894
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,053
I don't think I can
take care of you much longer.

895
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,856
I got to get you back home.

896
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,316
Don't look at me like that.

897
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,110
Don't look at me like that.

898
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,278
You don't even belong to me.

899
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,822
Someone out there
is missing you right now.

900
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,031
- Wild Velvet.

901
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,826
- Hey, hey, is there
a Rose-Johnny there?

902
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,119
- Johnny who?

903
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,287
- A Rose-Johnny.

904
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,371
- You mean Scarlet.

905
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,497
Hold on.

906
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,263
- Rudy!

907
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,639
Hi.

908
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,475
Oh, God.

909
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,977
I missed you so much.

910
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,979
Thank you so much
for finding him.

911
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,522
I don't know
how I'll ever repay you.

912
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,648
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

913
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,733
It was-it was my fault.

914
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,027
I accidentally hit him
with my car.

915
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,154
But he's all right now.

916
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,781
- Okay.

917
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,743
- Would you like to come in?

918
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,661
- Can I ask you something?

919
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,998
- Yeah, please, anything.

920
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,167
- I don't know how to put this.

921
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,251
You know, just forget it.

922
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,336
- No, no, don't stop.

923
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,880
You can-you can ask me
anything you want.

924
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,341
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

925
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,886
- Can I use your bathroom?

926
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,013
- Yeah, of course.
It's across the hall.

927
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,905
Oh, shit.

928
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,524
- Um, about the reward money...

929
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,608
- Oh, no, I don't-

930
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,235
- I can pay you next week,
I promise.

931
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,778
- No, it's okay.

932
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,119
If you have any concerns,
I fed him three times a day.

933
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,912
I walked him three times a day.

934
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,080
I got him a toy in the back.

935
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,542
- You think I could just hold
your hands for a second?

936
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:44,838
- Yeah, sure.

937
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,933
- You're cold.

938
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,185
- That's you.

939
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,438
- And sweaty.

940
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,065
- Well, it's-it's hot in here.

941
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,071
- And they're soft.

942
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,908
- Yours too.

943
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,036
- You want to try something?

944
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,996
I'm gonna count to three,

945
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,457
and we're both gonna stand up,

946
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,375
and we're gonna hug each other.

947
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,793
Can you do that?
Do you mind?

948
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,920
Can we do that?

949
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,966
It was a stupid idea.

950
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,718
- Okay, I want to try it.

951
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,640
- I was hoping you'd say that.

952
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,558
Are you ready?

953
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,143
- Yeah.

954
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,978
- Okay.

955
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:45,231
One, two, three.

956
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,079
That was nice, wasn't it?

957
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,497
- Yeah.

958
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,332
It was nice.

959
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:06,544
It was real nice.

960
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,712
Can we do-
can we do it again?

961
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,131
- Okay.

962
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,796
- Well.

963
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:50,964
- I know what you're gonna say,

964
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,173
that it's time for you to leave.

965
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,550
But I don't-
I don't want you to go.

966
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,427
I want you to stay.

967
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,970
- You sure?

968
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,179
- Yeah.

969
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,264
You can stay here.

970
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,598
I got-I got plenty of blankets.

971
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,725
You can stay the night.

972
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,273
- I don't even know your name.

973
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,985
- Oh, it's Qwerty.

974
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,738
Qwerty Doolittle.

975
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,073
- My name's Rose-Johnny.

976
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,367
But everybody
just calls me Johnny.

977
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,788
- Well, it's nice
to meet you, Rose.

978
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,376
- Nice to meet you, Qwerty.

979
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,020
- You have to have a heart
that's open to God.

980
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,481
- Big change in our local
weather over the next few days.

981
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,858
A low-pressure cold front
will be moving in

982
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,568
during the next 24 hours

983
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,571
as the jet stream heads south
into the gulf.

984
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,407
These temperatures
will be highly unusual.

985
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,494
Hello? Rose?

986
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,330
Lucky?

987
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,499
I got something for you, Rose.

988
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,339
Rose?

989
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:50,375
- And now let's give a banging
welcome to our very sweet

990
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:56,005
but very naughty Scarlet.

991
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,049
- Merry Christmas, Scarlet.

992
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,468

- Come back.

1029
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:12,952
Where you going?

1030
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:16,039
- Well, let's hear it
for Scarlet.

1031
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:21,252
She is just waiting
for that big bad wolf.

1032
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,713
And it might as well be you.

1033
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,839
- Dancers only.

1034
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:26,382
- I need to talk to Rose.

1035
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,967
To Scarlet, I need to talk-

1036
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,011
- Which part
did you not understand?

1037
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,562
- I need to talk to Rose.

1038
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,774
I need to talk to Rose,
come on!

1039
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,301
- Why'd you leave?

1040
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,638
You didn't even leave a note.

1041
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:56,973
- Men usually leave me first.

1042
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,810
I was just trying
to save you the trouble.

1043
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,897
- Well, you're wrong about me.

1044
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:08,443
- Why did you come today?

1045
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:12,071
- I came for you.

1046
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:16,159
- I'm a single mother
with a kid in a coma,

1047
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,327
and I make my living
by taking my clothes off.

1048
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,496
I'm a klutz,
and I spill everything.

1049
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,498
- I work with the dead.

1050
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,624
I play with puppets.

1051
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,334
I've never had a real girlfriend
in my life,

1052
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,129
and I get nervous around people,
which triggers my asthma.

1053
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,887
- Don't do this to me.

1054
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:41,767
- I'm trying not to.

1055
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:51,027
- Just promise me one thing.

1056
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:55,114
When tomorrow comes,
everything's gonna be okay.

1057
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,117
- Everything's gonna be okay.

1058
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:25,394
♪ ♪

1059
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,369
- I'm not playing games
with you.

1060
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,623
Fine, I'll get it myself.

1061
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:39,028
Give me my money.

1062
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:42,531
- Tell me how I look.

1063
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,410
Because I am feeling
so glamorous tonight.

1064
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:47,745
- Give me my money.

1065
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,830
Give me my money!

1066
01:17:57,047 --> 01:18:00,174
You're no fun.

1067
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,366
- Go and sit down.

1068
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,992
Sit down.

1069
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,798
I want you to...

1070
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,007
take your wig off.

1071
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:50,266
Just do it.

1072
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:55,020
Now...

1073
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,899
I want you to wipe off
your makeup.

1074
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:00,317
Just wipe it off.

1075
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,365
- I like where this is going.

1076
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,791
Don't I look beautiful?

1077
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,252
Tell me I look beautiful.

1078
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:21,172
- You said you wanted
to be flawless.

1079
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,426
With this-

1080
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:30,097
this money,
you can make that life-

1081
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:32,433
that part of your life-
perfect.

1082
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,111
- Give me the gun.

1083
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,821
- What?

1084
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:46,947
- Give me the gun.

1085
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:48,824
You want to die, right?

1086
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,701
I can help you.

1087
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,162
I understand what you want.

1088
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,039
Please.

1089
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,959
Give me the gun.

1090
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,961
I want to help you.

1091
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:09,678
That night when you asked me
to take your life,

1092
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,681
I didn't understand why.

1093
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:16,477
Now I do.

1094
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,563
I understand everything now.

1095
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,923
I found that picture
in your car.

1096
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:48,634
And I couldn't help
but think about you,

1097
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:53,639
how lonely you must feel inside
without love.

1098
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:08,404
- Do you want love in your life?

1099
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,823
- Yeah.

1100
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,908
- Then open your heart.

1101
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,600
- Hey.

1102
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,018
What are you doing?

1103
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,116
- You know...

1104
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,827
I used to love a man once.

1105
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:59,496
And I gave him my heart.

1106
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,166
I gave him my soul.

1107
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,127
I gave him my love.

1108
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,964
But that wasn't
good enough for him.

1109
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,718
That piece of shit
wanted a real woman.

1110
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,679
He wanted me
to give him something

1111
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:19,642
that I could never give him.

1112
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,768
So he left me.

1113
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,454
Who's gonna love me,
big daddy-o?

1114
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,293
- God!

1115
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,457
- At your service, ma'am.

1116
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,420
Does it fly?

1117
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:15,007
- Faster than
the speed of sound.

1118
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,842
- Wonderful.

1119
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:20,429
I will take a one-way ticket
to Paris, please.

1120
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,139
- All right.

1121
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:23,515
Here we go.
- Okay.

1122
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:27,269
- Come on.

1123
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,353
Whoo!

1124
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,568
- Whoo!

1125
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,582
- Did you get all
your Christmas shopping done?

1126
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,544
- Oh, no, I'm gonna be shopping
at the gift shop tonight.

1127
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,964
- Well, then, there's that.

1128
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:42,511
But the holidays
kind of get you down

1129
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,721
when you
see something like this.

1130
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,348
- Yes, they do.

1131
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,433
- Poor kid.

1132
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,727
Doctor's don't hold
much hope for him.

1133
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,729
- I don't even know how
she's gonna pay for all this.

1134
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,439
I mean, come on.
She's a stripper, you know?

1135
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:55,649
- They call it exotic dancer.

1136
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,154
Get the doctor now.

1137
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:03,949
We moved him to the code room.

1138
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,409
Heart rate was climbing fast.

1139
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:08,245
Oxygen saturation
well below 90%.

1140
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,038
- This sounds like
pulmonary hemorrhage.

1141
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,874
Call pulmonary
and see if they can do a scope.

1142
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
What do we have?

1143
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,084
- Looks like massive PE,

1144
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,669
and his right ventricle
is starting to give out.

1145
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,713
- Tell blood bank we need
three units now.

1146
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,797
- Sir, you can't be in here.

1147
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:19,965
- Wait, wait, what's going on?

1148
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:21,967
- Sir, are you a relative?
- Yeah, he's my grandson.

1149
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:23,552
- You need to go down
to the waiting room.

1150
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,012
It's down the hall to the left,
please.

1151
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:26,305
- Wait, wait,
is he gonna be okay?

1152
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,472
- We're trying everything
we can.

1153
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,016
Trust us.
- Did you contact his mother?

1154
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,559
- We are trying
to locate her right now.

1155
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,727
Please.
A doctor will be right with you.

1156
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,520
Nurse, will you take him
to the waiting room?

1157
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,814
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

1158
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:42,863
- Why are you doing this to me?

1159
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,910
Why?

1160
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:51,955
My only sin is love.

1161
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,715
- We do not quit until his
condition stabilizes.

1162
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:02,966
Am I clear?
- Yes, doctor.

1163
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,593
- Increase dopamine to 15.

1164
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:07,095
Someone pick up the damn phone.

1165
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,263
- ICU.

1166
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,933
- He's in V-tach.

1167
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,434
- They can't find his mother.

1168
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,810
- Taxi, taxi, wait!

1169
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,438
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1170
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:17,689
Hey, stop!

1171
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,691
Please, I need a ride.
It's an emergency.

1172
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:21,610
I got to find my daughter.
Please wait.

1173
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:22,694
Stop, stop!

1174
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,571
Stop, please,
I got to find my daughter.

1175
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:25,656
I got to find my daughter.

1176
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,199
Please, please,
it's an emergency.

1177
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,283
I need to help her.

1178
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,455
- Three, two, one, clear.

1179
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,919
Go to 120.

1180
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:42,506
Okay, three, two, one, clear.

1181
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:49,554
- For I believe.

1182
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:54,017
Helped by unbelievers.

1183
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,611
- Three, two, one, clear.

1184
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,199
Go to 240.

1185
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,042
- Rose!

1186
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,460
Rose, where are you?

1187
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,178
Rose.

1188
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,305
Rose!

1189
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,395
- Clear.

1190
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:40,230
Again.

1191
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:41,732
Clear.

1192
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:26,568
- I guess it's not coming
after all, the rain.

1193
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:29,071
- I was looking forward to it.

1194
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:33,742
- Mind if I join you?

1195
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,411
- If you wish.

1196
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:43,752
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1197
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,213
Were you expecting someone?

1198
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:52,052
- No, I just-
I just like sitting alone.

1199
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:55,263
Most of us have forgotten
how pleasurable it can be.

1200
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:04,439
- What is your name?

1201
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:07,776
- Diana.

1202
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,737
- Charlie.

1203
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:14,324
- Nice to meet you, father.

1204
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:16,451
- No, please.

1205
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:18,412
Could you just call me Charlie?

1206
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,335
Is that how we first met?

1207
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,461
- Exactly.

1208
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:31,716
I was even wearing
this red coat, remember?

1209
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:32,884
- How could I forget that?

1210
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,428
You looked beautiful.

1211
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,145
- Charlie.

1212
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,521
- Yeah?

1213
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:52,821
- It's not your time yet.

1214
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,490
I'm not going anywhere.

1215
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:59,744
I'll be right here
waiting for you.

1216
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,831
- My God, I love you.

1217
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:06,001
- I never stopped loving you.

1218
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,044
- Father?

1219
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,380
Father Bishop?

1220
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:18,388
Father Bishop,
what are you doing here?

1221
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,974
Are you returning to us?

1222
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:31,234

1223
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,528

and paid all the hospital bills.

you look really good
this morning.

1248

we tried to talk,

Hey, I called in last week,

01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:32,929
and I was looking for the girl
with the dog.

I was-I was just wondering,

- No, she's gone.

01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:42,021
No, I don't know,
but she's gone, man.

1269
01:37:42,147 --> 01:37:44,816
No, her and dog leave.
Not my fault.

No, I'm-
No, I am sorry.
