Announcer:
<i>Nevada prison officials</i>

2
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,213
<i>Are scratching their heads</i>
<i>this morning</i>

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,182
<i>Over the disappearance</i>
<i>of bank robber julian goddard,</i>

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,151
Who escaped during last night's
<i>electrical storm.</i>

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,321
<i>Goddard was serving time</i>
<i>for his part</i>

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,250
<i>In the daring</i>
<i>silverado bank robbery</i>

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,256
<i>Three years ago in las vegas.</i>

8
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,128
<i>Goddard's unidentified</i>
<i>accomplice</i>

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,057
<i>Was never apprehended</i>

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,802
<i>Nor was the money</i>
<i>ever recovered.</i>

11
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,167
<i>Sounds like it's going</i>
<i>to be a busy day</i>

12
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,667
<i>For cops and robbers alike.</i>

13
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,663
Ah-choo!

14
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,530
( horn beeps like
the road runner )

15
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,246
( beep beep )

16
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,923
Need a lift?

17
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,355
Matter of fact, I do.

18
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,862
I'm going to las vegas.

19
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,495
Where else?

20
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,300
( car doors close )

21
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,603
( engine starts )

22
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,705
( ned albright's "the seventh
son" playing )

23
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,878
Man 1:
What are you, a gambler?

24
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,937
Man 2:
Who isn't?

25
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,806
Name's destiny. Johnny destiny.

26
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,552
Man 1:
Well, I appreciate the ride.

27
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,523
'68 road runner, right?

28
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,392
This baby's a '69.

29
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,661
446 barrel.

30
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,630
Air-grabber hood
with a coyote duster.

31
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,825
Sweet lines.

32
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,574
Friend of mine had one
just like this,

33
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,840
Only his was a '68.

34
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,909
Same color too.

35
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,838
He used to call it
"monkey-bottom blue."

36
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,805
Yeah, well, nothing
beats detroit iron.

37
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,881
Johnny:
Vegas.

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
That's a town.

39
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,889
Anything can happen there.

40
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,632
You know what I mean.
I don't have to tell you.

41
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,030
It's an explosive situation,
that's what it is.

42
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,333
You got men looking for women.

43
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,565
Women looking for men.

44
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,400
And they're all
looking for money.

45
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,265
Quick money.

46
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,584
The whole town's a tinderbox.

47
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,754
"lucille."

48
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,352
She why you goin' to vegas?

49
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,922
Hey, you don't have
to say anything.

50
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,986
I know what's goin' on.

51
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,297
Johnny destiny has seen
that look before.

52
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,514
She's beautiful, isn't she?

53
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,039
Heh heh heh heh.

Oh, yeah?

121
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:56,348
Yeah. The news fellas was
comparing you to harry houdini.

I kinda figured I'd see ya
headed this way.

123

Yeah. You're probably
not the only one.

think of the place?

You didn't buy it, did you?

127
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,673
Well, let's just say
I acquired it.

128
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,173
Well, I gotta hand it
to you, thoreau.

129
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,705
I mean--I mean, it really--
it really looks like shit.

130
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,453
The universe
is expanding, julian.

131
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,948
It's beyond one man's power
to stem the tide of chaos.

132
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,181
You can make an attempt.

133
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,946
At least put some water
in the pool.

134
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,294
That ain't no pool.

135
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,930
That's the devil's
watering hole.

So...

137
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,867
Have you seen lucille yet?

138
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,969
Nah. I came straight here.

139
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,812
So what's the shot?

140
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,254
Well...

141
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,387

142
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,488
Then what?

143
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,460
And then I'll get lucille.
Mm-hmm.

144
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,960
And then after that,
I figure I just...

145
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,762
I head for the border
and just...

146
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,766
Just keep on goin'.
Just me and lucille.

147
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,098
That sounds like
a hell of a plan.

148
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,843
I'm glad you like it.
I do.

149
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,339
Couple of problems, though.

150
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,408
First off, lucille hasn't
exactly waited for you.

151
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,283
Well, she didn't
leave town, did she?

152
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,081
No. She's still here,

153
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,053
But she's tuerto's girl now.

154
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,090
He's a big shot now.
He runs the stardust.

155
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,459
Ohh. Ohh.

156
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,958
Well, this is...

157
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,161
This is truly...

158
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,103
Truly offensive.

159
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,298
Aah.

160
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,869

164
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,788
Oh, lucille.

165
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,357
Now...

166
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,296
You said...

167
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,131
That, uh...

168
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,896
There were a couple problems.

169
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,395
Yes, I did.

170
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,336
Well, let me have it.

171
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,542

I mean...Gone.

180

181

182
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,382
No. I wanna hit you again.

00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,915
I--I didn't lose it.
I didn't squander it.

184
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,522
I was robbed!

185
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,194
It wasn't my fault.

186
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,562
Ooh.

187
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,130
You went back for lucille.
Oh.

188
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,030
That's what screwed things up.

189
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,573
Can you hear me, julian?

190
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,568
All right, for the sake of the
rest of this conversation,

191
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,884
I'm just gonna assume
you can hear me.

192
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,908
Now, you left me here

193
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,113
In this god forsaken place...

194
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,045
With all that damn money.

195
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,294
I was a sitting duck.

196
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,917
Oh. You know, I figured--

197
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,993
I figured you could
take care of yourself.

198
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,093
You know, I just don't
get it, thoreau.

199
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,995
I just don't get it.

200
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,267
I mean, you had a gun, a car.

201
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,467
You had your wits about you
when I left ya.

202
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,369
You are seriously
underestimating

203
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,672
The power of the forces

204
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,543
Which were aligned
against us, julian.

205
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,141
What are you talking about?

206
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,913
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about

207
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,982
The inescapable forces of fate.

208
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm talking about
fire and water!

209
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,947
Oh, no.

210
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,522
No, no, no.

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,690
Don't tell me you gone
and got god on me now.

212
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,320
Please don't tell me.

213
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,126
I'm not putting
any names on him,

214
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,599
But he was here,
and he stole our money!

215
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
He?

216
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,371
Tell me there was more than one.

217
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,101
One was enough.

218
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,082
Thoreau:
<i>If you recall, we had an</i>
<i>appointment at silverado bank,</i>

219
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,980
But, of course, you and lucille

220
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,953
<i>Had to choose this</i>
<i>particular moment in time</i>

221
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,992
<i>To have a relationship talk.</i>

222
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,617
You promised me that
we would leave tonight.

223
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,293
You promised me.

224
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,391
We need some traveling money,
don't we? Huh?

225
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:05,004
After tonight, we're gonna
be on top of the world.

226
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,228
Then what?

227
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,032
And then--and then we'll leave

228
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,465
This god forsaken town.

229
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,470
With the cops chasing us?

230
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,712
There ain't gonna be no cops.

231
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,137
Julian!

232
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,535
Thoreau and I got it
figured out, baby.

233
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,405
It's gonna go like clockwork.

234
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,017
What if something goes wrong?

235
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,477
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

236
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,445
Julian, let's leave now.

237
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,685
Forget about the bank.
We don't need the money.

238
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,660
Let's get out of here
before it's too late.

239
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,589
Don't--don't worry, baby.

240
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,664
You wait here, and I'll be back

241
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,634
Before you can say acapulco.

242
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,696
You have this power over me.

243
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,066
It is ripping me in half.

244
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,375
Part of me wants to stay,
but the other part of me

245
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,209
Wants to clear out of here
right now.

246
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,454
Which part wants to stay?

247
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,724
Thoreau:
<i>Now, we'd done more than our</i>
<i>fair share of thievin',</i>

248
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,734
<i>But we never managed</i>
<i>to get ahead.</i>

249
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,687
<i>The cash in that bank vault</i>

250
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,356
<i>Would make idleness</i>
<i>a way of life.</i>

251
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,564
( tumblers open )

252
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,225
( yelling instructions )

253
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,309
Thoreau:
<i>The wheel of fortune</i>

254
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,781
<i>Was most certainly</i>
<i>spinning in our favor.</i>

255
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,351
<i>That is until we got back</i>
<i>to the marilyn</i>

256
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,650
<i>To pick up lucille.</i>

257
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,216
Sweetheart.

258
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,791
I'm back.

259
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,529
Lucille:
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

260
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,573
<i>Just know that</i>
<i>a piece of my heart</i>

261
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,698
<i>Remains yours forever.</i>
<i>Lucille.</i>

262
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,208
Smell that. Ha ha ha.

263
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,752
I'm not picking that up.
That goes out of your share.

264
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,578
She's gone.

265
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,183
Let's get the hell out of here.

266
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,816
I gotta find her.
What about the cops?

267
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:12,121
Fuck the cops! I gotta find her.

268
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,085
Wait here.

269
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,734
I do not support this decision!

270
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,396
Thoreau:
<i>Well, I waited,</i>
<i>just like you said.</i>

271
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,542
<i>The hours passed.</i>

272
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,667
<i>I knew something was wrong,</i>

273
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,713
<i>But I just kept on waiting.</i>

274
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,383
( thunder )

275
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,772
( indistinct whispering )

276
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,995
( thunder )

277
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,796
When I woke up...

278
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,642
Car was gone,

279
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,842
Money was gone,

280
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,814
This pool was empty.

281
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,484
What's up with you, thoreau?

282
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,553
What the hell you still doing
here after three years?

283
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,722
I'm waiting.

284
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,891
People left, this place
fell to ruin,

285
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,959
But I'm still here,
and I'm waiting.

286
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,559
For what?
He's coming back.

287
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,562
That pool means
something to him.

288
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,465
I hate to disappoint you,
thoreau,

289
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,937
But there ain't no way in hell
this guy's coming back.

290
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,437
Whoever he is.

291
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,038
Well, you never know.

292
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,011
It's a town
of limitless possibilities.

293
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,982
Why did you say that?

294
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,015
I don't know. It just
popped into my head.

295
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,821
Why do you say anything?

296
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,522
Aw, it's...It's nothing.

297
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,525
Guy that dropped me off was
driving a car just like yours.

298
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,859
Only his was '69.

299
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,825
Julian, mine was a '69.

300
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,304
Thoreau, yours was a '68.

301
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,814
It was mine. I owned it and I'm
telling you it was a '69.

302
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,076
Aw, it's just a coincidence.

303
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,449
Like hell it is.

304
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:59,918
Plymouth only made 615
446 barrel coupes in 1969.

305
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,349
And 388 of those
were four speeds.

306
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,416
Now you figure the odds on that.

307
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,425
What the hell do you
think you're doin'?

308
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,887
He played me for a sucker once.

309
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,856
It ain't gonna happen twice.

310
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,834
This time, I'm ready for him.

311
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,834
Thoreau...

312
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,966
What about all the lightning?

313
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,380
Non-conducting rubber soles,
my friend.

314
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,490
I'm always thinking.

315
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,788
( car honking )

316
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,461
Ralph:
All right, bring up the reds.

317
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,991
Yeah, okay.

318
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,925
Yeah, well--
give me a hint of blue.

319
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,932
A hint.

320
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,634
Okay, yeah, all right,
now turn slowly, baby.

321
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,566
All right. Turn around.

322
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,002
That's it.

323
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,036
That's it. Beautiful.

324
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,082
Beautiful. Ok, mark it.

325
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,777
All right, come on down,
sweetheart.

326
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,649
How come the band's
not up there?

327
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,107
Because the band's
not auditioning

328
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,946
For a record contract, ok?
You are, ok?

329
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,681
And don't be afraid
to show some tit,

330
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,046
You know, open up a little bit.
I mean, honestly, you know,

331
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,815
Nothing makes a song
sound sweeter than a little tit.

332
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,164
Ralph, you're a dirty bastard,
you know that?

333
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,091
Yeah, well, ok.

334
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,626
You only get one shot with this
guy, so don't fuck it up, ok?

335
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,432
All right, now pay
attention to me, ok?

336
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,534
Now, uh, all right.
I got it fixed, ok,

337
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,136
So he's gonna be
sitting right here, ok?

338
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,938
Here he is, ok?
Ok, now, he's here,

339
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,639
"oh, boy, I can't
wait for the show.

340
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,671
"I heard this girl's
really good.

341
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,776
"I don't know. Maybe she's not.
I don't know. Let's see."

342
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,479
What you do is just
play it cool.

343
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,450
Work the crowd.
"hey, how you doin'?

344
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,749
Good to see ya here."
da-da-da-bing. Badda-boo.

345
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,951
But this is the guy you got
to play to, all right?

346
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,853
Give this guy what he wants.

347
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,515
This is where you
lean right into him

348
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,624
And, "hooray! Wonderful.

349
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,126
She's the best in the world.

350
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,887
Sign her up. Give her a car."

351
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,826
But you're gonna be
terrific, baby, ok?

352
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,772
You're gonna be great.
He's gonna love you.

353
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,437
I love you, ok?
Now get out of here.

354
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,637
Go home and get some rest
and have a snotch.

355
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,870
Snotch--it's like a nosh
and a snack, I guess.

356
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,051
Hey. Boss wants
to see you. Pronto.

357
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,852
Thanks, francine.

358
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,954
So who's the geek
with the shiny head?

359
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,086
Who?
The nervous guy in the lounge.

360
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,931
Oh. His name's ralph.
Ralph dellaposa.

361
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,629
He's an agent.

362
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,830
A real smooth operator
from l.A.

363
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,073
He thinks I might
sound good on records.

364
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,998
Really? Does tuerto
know about this?

365
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,044
No, he doesn't.

366
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,043
And he's not gonna
find out, either.

367
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,705
Mm-hmm.

368
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,713
Mm-hmm. Not until I get
my ticket out of this town.

369
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,176
Well, my lips are sealed.

370
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,085
Thanks.

371
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,788
( door closes )

372
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,816
Oh, you really ought
to get out more.

373
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:22,289
I mean, spend some time
with people.

374
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,948
Goin' to see lucille?

375
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,586
Ah, well, you know...

376
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,561
Sure thinkin' about it.

377
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,190
My great-great-grandfather
once said,

378
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,196
"beware of all enterprises,

379
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,898
That require the use
of new clothes."

380
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,571
Now, tell me something.

381
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,639
Where did you get these
mod threads, man?

382
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,308
Well, the kind of people
that stay here

383
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,538
Tend to disappear in
the middle of the night.

384
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,084
Or they kill each other.

385
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,149
Either way, I wind up
with their stuff.

386
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,716
You seen my father lately?

387
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,786
I heard he was
camped out up north.

388
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,626
Hey, you better hide
that face, desperado.

389
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,245
Hey, thoreau.

390
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,782
I knew you'd wait for me.

391
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,286
I knew you'd be back.

392
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,651
<i>¡hola, mi amigos!</i>

393
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:32,378

you boys back to town?

Business. Business.

I like the way you sing.

430
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,289
I can tell.

431
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,591
You shouldn't
look at me like that.

432
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,525
Like what?

433
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,600
Like you're thinking about
falling in love with me.

434
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm not sticking around
long enough to fall in love.

435
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,572
Then you should've
left yesterday.

436
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,345
( horn honks )

437
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,419
All right. So what's
the bottom line?

438
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,492
Atlantic city? Come on, herb.

439
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,191
Come on, cut the crap.

440
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,563
What? Hey, fuck the numbers!

441
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,602
That's bullshit. Bullshit!
You're talking bullshit.

442
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,198
Shut the fuck up, herb.

443
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:45,941
Look, I believe in vegas
because vegas is vegas.

444
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,368
It's not some has-been
grimy shithole.

445
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,644
It's a town of limitless
possibilities.

446
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:53,643
Herb, have you been
to atlantic city, huh?

447
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,510
Well, it's depressing.

448
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,616
I spent three days there.
You know what happened?

449
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,288
I lost my tan.

450
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,287
Yeah, and then I lost
my self-respect.

451
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,659
No! Absolutely not.

452
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,928
No money goes to the east coast.
None. Zero.

453
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,957
Call me when you got
a better idea.

454
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,432
Jerk.

455
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,260
Accountants are all
the same. No style.

456
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,165
Hey, baby.

457
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,704
Mm.

458
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,666
Tuerto:
Beautiful, ain't it?

459
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:26,035
Life doesn't get more
beautiful than that, baby.

460
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,645
Look at that. Somebody just won.

461
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,677
Lucky bastard, huh?

462
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,123
You wouldn't have won that
big in atlantic city, pal.

463
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,318
Ahem. Francine said
you wanted to see me.

464
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,126
I do.
What about?

465
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,227
I just want to see you.

466
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,699
Well, take a good look
because I'm going home.

467
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,599
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on, honey.

468
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,170
Sit down. Have a drink
or something, will ya?

469
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,600
Did you get anything to eat?
Let me order you something up.

470
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,465
What do you want,
a fruit plate or something?

471
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,974
Tuerto, I don't have time.

472
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,376
Time? What is time, lucille?

473
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,278
It's the middle of the morning.

474
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,150
I never see you anymore.
You know that?

475
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,678
Get off my back, tuerto, ok?

476
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,723
I just--I need some rest.

477
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,619
Ok. I just thought maybe we'd
have a conversation

478
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,191
Or something. That's all.

479
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm not in the mood
for conversation.

480
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,428
Ok. Ok.

481
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,157
But when you are,
let me know what you think

482
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,334
Of these numbers
I picked for you.

483
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,144
What, are you crazy?

484
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,308
This isn't my style.

485
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:32,277
Cher sang this lineup
at bally's last week.

486
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,777
Why argue with success?

487
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,309
What is it with you?

488
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,645
Your underwear
too tight, or what?

489
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,319
Excuse me?
You keep touching your thing.

490
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,419
You're always touching
your thing.

491
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,221
So?

492
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,694
Why, I just wanna know.

493
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,732
Are you checking to see
if it's still there?

494
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,257
Hey, back off.

495
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,362
It's there! Stop worrying.

496
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,264
Hey, tuerto don't worry
about his thing.

497
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,626
Keeps me company, that's all.

498
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,235
Which is more than you've been
giving me lately.

499
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:02,168
What's with you all
of a sudden, huh?

500
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,174
What's up your ass lately?

501
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,176
When's the last time
we made love, you and I?

502
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:09,608
Every time I touch you,
you give me the big freeze.

503
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,175
I don't have to take this.

504
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,523
It's so cold between us,

505
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,678
I have to wear
snow shoes to bed.

506
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,416
When you climb into bed,

507
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,462
The automatic thermostat
kicks in.

508
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,587
And what's the matter
me grabbin' my thing?

509
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,292
I can grab my thing anytime
I want to grab my thing!

510
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,595
It's my thing, it's there
for me, it's arm's reach,

511
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,097
Who gives a shit?

512
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,643
You know, a woman in your
condition shouldn't smoke.

513
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,424
Wise choice.

514
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,219
Lucille!
Aah!

515
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,251
Ah! What?
Ralph, you scared me.

516
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,316
Sorry. Listen, you
have to nix that nap.

517
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,755
But I got great news for you.

518
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,690
Vinnie vidivici wants
to have lunch with you.

519
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,195
I thought you said he wasn't
getting into town 'till tonight.

520
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,858
He checked in early.
He calls me from his suite,

521
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,666
Says he wants to meet you
before the show.

522
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,238
I say lunch, he says chinese.
I say noon, he says 12:30.

523
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,097
Some dumb luck. Now, be on time.

524
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,266
Vinnie vidivici does not do
lunch unless he means it.

525
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,735
What should I wear?

526
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,543
I don't know.
Just the way you are is fine.

527
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,105
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

528
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,614
I know. Show some...
Right. Ha ha.

529
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,816
( car honking )

530
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,747
Julian:
Lucille!

531
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,622
( honking car )

532
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,790
( whispering ):
Ahem. Okay, I'm just gonna
walk straight.

533
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,855
Need a lift?

534
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,534
Hmm.

535
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,372
I thought you were in prison.

536
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,267
Well, they let me out
on good behavior.

537
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,139
When did you get into town?

538
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,469
This morning.
When are you leavin'?

539
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,614
Well, that all depends...

540
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,440
On what?

541
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,175
How long it takes you to pack.

542
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,651
It has been three years,

543
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,349
Couldn't you just
leave it alone?

544
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:56,321
Oh, no, baby,
it's been left alone too long.

545
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,661
Come on, sweetheart.

546
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,787
Let's vamoose
out of these parts.

547
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,502
Come with me.

548
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,368
Anywhere you want to go.

549
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,837
I'm talkin' about zihuatanejo,
tierra del fuego...

550
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,697
Julian, you know what--
you name it...

551
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:16,235
I don't need this today.
I really don't need this.

552
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:20,711
I got plans--I got big plans.
And they don't include you.

553
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,612
Oh, you got big plans?

554
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,384
Big--big plans.

555
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:28,523
Ah, well do these big plans--
they include tuerto, I suppose.

556
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,390
They include me, all right?

557
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,619
So, just leave me alone,
you're nothing but trouble.

558
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,434
Hey, what's the matter?
Move your car, eh!

559
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,857
Come on, move the car!

560
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,732
Can't you see I'm talkin'
to my girl here?

561
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,930
Like I give a shit!

562
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,702
Man:
He don't give a shit!

563
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,830
Move your car or I'll move it
for you, you son of a bitch.

564
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,395
Man:
Son of a bitch!

565
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,874
Oh, you're gonna move the car
for me, huh?

566
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,612
You're gonna move
the car for me?

567
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,610
Let go!

568
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,880
Thoreau:
Marilyn monroe, you drove men
crazy with desire.

569
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,629
Where's goddard?

570
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,401
Detective dravec. Gage.

571
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,236
Julian goddard. Where is he?

572
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,841
Oh, last I heard,

573
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:27,012
He was learning the trade of
license plate manufacturing.

574
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,852
Don't mess with us, thoreau.

575
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,507
He broke out yesterday.

576
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,015
We know this is the
first place he'd come.

577
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,859
Well, you know the routine.
Look around. Take a look.

578
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,512
Sign giving you trouble,
thoreau?

579
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,708
Ah, neon is so temperamental,
these signs.

580
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,432
You looking for this?

581
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,358
Who are you, mister?

582
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,663
What do you want from me?

583
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,425
Actually, we met...

584
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,374
But we weren't introduced.

585
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,839
You can call me johnny.

586
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,737
I was hoping to have
a word with you

587
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,809
About the sorry state
of this establishment.

588
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,808
I'm particularly concerned
about your pool.

589
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,449
My pool?

590
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,818
Your pool.

591
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,877
( thoreau groans )

592
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,864
You want me to fix the pool,
I'll fix the pool.

593
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,831
Make sure it doesn't leak,
I'll make sure it doesn't leak.

594
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,002
Then maybe you'll
get off my back!

595
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,671
Eat that.

596
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,110
( sniffles )

597
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:42,412
Hey, you're johnny's friend.

598
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,514
From this morning.

599
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,616
You cry a lot, don't you?

600
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,788
( sniffles )

601
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,947
It's that louse!

602
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,486
I thought things
would be different,

603
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,392
But I should've known better.

604
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:58,404
You can't tie down a guy
like johnny.

605
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,867
Yeah, well, you know what they
say about love...

606
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,427
What?

607
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,137
I can't remember.

608
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,111
But it was right on the money.

609
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,009
Oh.
Listen, about johnny,

610
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,641
You know where I can find him?

611
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:18,946
Nobody finds johnny,
he finds you.

612
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,523
Hey!

613
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,131
( tires screech )

614
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,758
I mean, some schmucks might blow
a lot of hot air at you

615
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,904
About taking the public's pulse,

616
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,840
Like the public has
a heart or something.

617
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,197
Well, vinnie vidivici
is here to tell you

618
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,766
That the public
has no heart. Huh?

619
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,475
Take it from me,

620
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:48,077
This business is nothing
but a craps shoot.

621
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,579
That's pretty funny coming
from such a successful guy

622
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,782
Like yourself, vinnie.

623
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,153
Hey.

624
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,681
Ain't that right, lucille?

625
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,186
Ain't that right,
what I just said?

626
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,059
That is definitely so, ralph.

627
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:00,757
You know, honey,

628
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,729
I'm doing ralph here a favor.

629
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,557
Nobody, but nobody,

630
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,763
Comes to vegas looking
for fresh, new talent.

631
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,866
This is where careers go to die.

632
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,899
Jeez.

633
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:16,044
The whole place, if you ask me,

634
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,611
It just stinks of formaldehyde.

635
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,107
I hope you're not wasting
my time here, ralph.

636
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,554
What? Are you serious, vinnie?

637
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,220
I would never waste
your time, you know.

638
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,789
'cause I know
how important time

639
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,688
Is to a gentleman
of your stature. So I--

640
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,890
Vinnie:
Good.

641
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:37,891
Ok. Now, if you'll excuse me,

642
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,856
I gotta go to the can.

643
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,902
Oh, ok. We'll wait
for you outside, vinnie.

644
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,643
Ok. Do that, please.

645
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,108
What the hell is wrong with you?

646
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,937
We're sitting here
eating lunch with a guy

647
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,613
Who can make or break
your career,

648
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,212
And you're staring at the fish

649
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,113
Like what's going on in
there's more important.

650
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,815
Sorry.
Well, you know, forget about it

651
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,247
Because I tell you, you know,

652
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:02,292
Despite your efforts
to screw up, you know,

653
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:03,987
I think he likes you.
Come on.

654
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,559
No, he does.

655
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,757
That's just his way of saying,

656
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,588
"hey, cutie,
what you know? Hey."

657
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,893
Oh, please.
No, it is.

658
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,125
I mean, what's not
to like, huh?

659
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,829
You feeling ok? I mean,

660
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,831
You haven't even touched
your mu shu at all.

661
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,303
Let me grab some
of this before--

662
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,701
I'm not hungry. I need some air.

663
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,204
I'll meet you outside.

664
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,236
( mumbles )

665
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,661
Boy, I'll tell you,
those chinese kill me.

666
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,834
With that mu shu this
and the sub gum,

667
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,702
But they're cute.
And I'll tell you what.

668
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,941
Now, listen, listen. Here's what
I want you to do, all right?

669
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:54,267
Go home and take a bath and tuck
your yourself in, get some rest.

670
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,342
Ok? I want you looking
fresh as a daisy

671
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,071
When those lights
come up tonight, ok?

672
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,236
All right? I'm serious.
You need to relax.

673
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,205
And you know, you--
what, you know him?

674
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:07,354
Lucille:
Uh, he's just some guy
I haven't seen in a while.

675
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:10,352
Ralph:
Yeah? Why do I get the feeling
he ain't just some guy, huh?

676
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,715
Oh, he's coming over here. Ok.
No, this isn't any good.

677
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,225
No. See, I smell trouble here.
No. Lucille, look, look.

678
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,057
Listen to me. Look at me.
All right?

679
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,033
Clarity of the mind.
No, no, no. Look at me.

680
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,001
Clarity of the mind, ok?

681
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,770
Be here. No complications today.

682
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,938
Clarity-ness is next
to godliness.

683
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,737
Oh, hey, vinnie, hey.

684
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,369
Uh, I was, uh...

685
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,211
Oh.
"you will inherit the earth."

686
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,312
What else is new, huh?

687
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,184
Ralph:
All right.

688
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,983
Vinnie:
So, where we at? I have to get
back to the hotel.

689
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,646
Ralph:
Oh, come on.
I'll give you a ride.

690
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,254
All right?
We'll take my car.

691
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,315
Make sure you
knock me out tonight.

692
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:51,855
I will give it my best
shot, mr. Vidivici.

693
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,403
( mumbles )

694
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,798
We just broke bread.
You call me vinnie.

695
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,200
Vinnie.

696
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,942
All right.
Where's your car?

697
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,867
It's over here.
It's next to the jaguar.

698
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,772
Vinnie:
Next to the jaguar?

699
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,650
Julian:
Lucille, come here.

700
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,377
I just want to tell you
one thing. Ok?

701
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,252
Just wait up.

702
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,351
Not a day went by--ok, ok.

703
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:20,915
Not a day went by that
I didn't think of you.

704
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,825
Look, I never meant for
you to get busted, ok?

705
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,928
I figured if I left,
you'd go on without me.

706
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,430
Well, you figured wrong.

707
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,732
Well, I'm not sorry.
I'm not asking you to be.

708
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,834
You could've just gone,
you know.

709
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,996
Everybody makes
their own choices.

710
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,365
I will choose you every time.

711
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,214
Julian, you can't--

712
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,109
You can't just walk back
into somebody's life

713
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,741
And expect things
to be the same.

714
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,146
Things are different.
I'm different.

715
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:44,848
I am trying to be more
serious with my life.

716
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,719
And that's why we can't
see each other anymore?

717
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:48,148
That's right.
No, that's wrong.

718
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:52,323
What's important is you and me.

719
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,423
Don't you tell me
what's important

720
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:55,986
And what's not important.

721
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,394
I got a lot of stuff on my mind,

722
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,795
And you--you're starting
to confuse me.

723
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,772
Hey, look at me.
Look at me, baby.

724
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,367
I love you.

725
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,283
Is that confusing?
You don't understand.

726
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,977
I do understand, baby.
I understand so much.

727
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
You know that too, don't you?

728
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,335
Oh...I was afraid
this would happen.

729
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,039
Julian.

730
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,442
Yes, my love.

731
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,443
There's something
I gotta tell you.

732
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,275
You tell me anything
you wanna tell me.

733
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
Kiss me again.

734
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,761
Isn't that your car?

735
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,059
Julian:
Uh, yeah. Well, not exactly.

736
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:05,462
Um...

737
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,833
You son of a bitch!
Oh.

738
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:12,072
Honey, I didn't steal it.
I just borrowed it.

739
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,770
Oh, yeah! Like you were
about to borrow my heart.

740
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,243
For a joy ride.

741
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,471
Don't do that, lucille.

742
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,036
Don't walk away from me.

743
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,254
What do you expect me
to do, julian,

744
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,977
Go for a ride
in your stolen car?

745
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,953
Some things never change.

746
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,952
Oh, that's right, lucille.
Some things, they never change!

747
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:35,786
Like the way I feel every time
that you leave me!

748
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:40,864
You are breaking
my heart, julian.

749
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,225
No. I'm just borrowing it,
remember?

750
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,021
Thoreau.

751
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,060
Pappy!

752
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,586
You ol' desert rat!

753
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,596
Where's that errant son of mine?

754
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:16,098
He went downtown to see lucille.

755
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,500
I knew he was here.
I knew he was here.

756
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21,873
My old scar started
itching last night,

757
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:24,473
And I knew trouble was brewing.

758
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,906
This scar hasn't lied
to me in 32 years.

759
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:31,414
And last night,

760
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,916
I was scratching
something fierce.

761
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,418
So, at first light,

762
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,860
I packed into the truck
and set forth.

763
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,426
You are expecting him
back, aren't ya?

764
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,400
Well, pappy, I never expect
anything from julian.

765
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,444
Oh, it sure is good to see you.

766
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,468
This calls for a toast!

767
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,473
Why don't you put your stuff
up on the porch,

768
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:00,175
And I'll go get us a bottle.

769
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:03,148
A toast to welcome me back.

770
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,916
( coyote howls )

771
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,280
Sign says "no vacancy" but, uh,

772
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,581
It looks like you might
be able to squeeze me in.

773
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,453
So happens we had
a cancellation.

774
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,121
Here, fill this out.

775
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,329
"smith." mr. John smith.

776
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,234
What an unusual name.

777
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:01,236
How long will you be staying
with us, mr. Smith?

778
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,709
Just leave it open-ended
if you don't mind.

779
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,946
All right. You're in the
"some like it hot" suite.

780
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,947
Need help with that luggage?

781
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,979
Yeah. Uh, no. I can manage.

782
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,037
Pappy:
Something strange
about that fellow.

783
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,371
Thoreau:
He's a cop.

784
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,511
Piece of shit bike.

785
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,108
There's a cop in the
"some like it hot" suite.

786
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,253
Bingo!

787
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,620
( static )

788
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,556
Aah! Mr. Smith to dispatch.

789
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,361
( static )

790
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,033
Come in, dispatch.

791
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,532
Come in, dispatch.

792
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,673
Request backup
at the marilyn motel.

793
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,398
( static )
( knock on door )

794
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,604
Thoreau:
Room service.

795
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,576
I, uh, I didn't order
any room service.

796
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,308
It's complimentary.
Delicious cookies and lemonade

797
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,315
To make your stay here
more enjoyable.

798
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,187
All right. That's far enough.
Where's your buddy?

799
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,817
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

800
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,463
Don't play coy with me.

801
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,088
You don't know julian goddard?

802
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,093
Oh, him. He's standing
right behind you.

803
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:06,595
Yeah. And my shoelaces
are untied.

804
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,797
As a matter of fact, they are.

805
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,609
God, son. You look old.

806
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,105
Joint rough on you?

807
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,782
Wasn't no place for a man.

808
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,293
I wanted to get up there
and visit you,

809
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,287
But one thing led to another.

810
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,789
You know how it is.

811
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,331
Besides, prisons
make me nervous.

812
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,667
How's that girl
you were seeing?

813
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,167
The singer?

814
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:20,269
She won't see me anymore.

815
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:23,811
Ah, hell, that never
made no sense.

816
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,708
A gal like that going out

817
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,410
With a rattlesnake like you.

818
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,182
I reckon it's my fault.

819
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:34,223
This ain't got nothing
to do with you, pappy.

820
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:36,218
Don't deny me
my parental rights, boy!

821
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,350
I passed on
a twisted chromosome!

822
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:40,386
A doctor up in bixby,

823
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,761
He explained to me
the whole process.

824
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,901
He said I got an
overproductive pineal gland.

825
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:49,428
And I reckon you got one too.

826
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,273
Pineal gland?

827
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,799
Overproductive!

828
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:55,443
Overproductive pineal gland.

829
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:58,269
It's right here...

830
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:00,736
In the back of the brain.

831
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:04,805
All swollen and angry.

832
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,945
Hardly leaving any room at all

833
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:10,451
For all what else
that's back there.

834
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,394
Doctor said not
to worry, though,

835
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,190
On account of nobody ever died

836
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:19,403
From an overproductive
pineal gland.

837
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,698
But I know something he can't
tell from all them x-rays.

838
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,242
I know what it does to a man,

839
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,705
How it sets him off
to the desert

840
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:35,338
Just to protect
the ones that he loves.

841
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,651
That's the curse
of our affliction, son.

842
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:46,524
It renders us incapable

843
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,864
Of living with civilized folks.

844
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,304
Oh, maybe you, but not me.

845
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,997
Hey, what are you doing
with that hose?

846
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,473
Giving yourself an enema?

847
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,440
He sure as hell needs it.

848
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,413
Heh heh heh heh.

849
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,252
I fixed the pool.
Now I'm gonna fill it.

850
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah, that's all you need,
thoreau,

851
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,548
A little project to focus on

852
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,853
And take your mind
off of things.

853
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:23,359
It's for johnny.
He came by earlier.

854
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:24,931
That guy was here?

855
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,299
Yeah.
I just saw him downtown.

856
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:28,758
Why didn't you kick his ass?

857
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,296
Because his butt
is unkickable, julian.

858
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,572
He ain't like us.

859
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,541
Near as I can figure,
he's an animistic spirit.

860
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,440
You mean like the manitou?
Exactly.

861
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,743
What's a manitou?

862
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:46,315
Sort of like a god,
with a small "g."

863
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:47,777
Thoreau:
Think of it this way, julian.

864
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,915
Millions of people come
to las vegas to gamble.

865
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,590
They pin their hopes and dreams

866
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,659
On one spin of the wheel
or roll of the dice.

867
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,818
It's a ritual,
like a rain dance.

868
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,826
Or a circumcision.

869
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:03,028
And this repeated act of
gambling has conjured a deity.

870
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:04,974
Uh-huh. And that's
this guy johnny?

871
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,369
Exactly. It's his job
to dole out the luck.

872
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:11,742
And the beautiful part of it
is it's all random.

873
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,810
Wait a second. Let's just go
back to the beginning.

874
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,883
Why are you putting water
in the pool?

875
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:22,722
He said if I help him,
he'll give us our money back.

876
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,850
This pool's his path
back to the spirit world.

877
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,555
Well, you see? You see?

878
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,628
Now everything
makes perfect sense.

879
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:31,957
Really?
Yeah.

880
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:34,102
I'm glad to hear you
say that, julian.

881
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,958
To tell you the truth, I was--

882
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:39,096
I was kind of afraid you were
gonna think I was off my nut.

883
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,372
That's exactly what
I think, you freak!

884
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,510
Did something happen to you
while I was locked up?

885
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,413
Dropped on your head
or something?

886
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,915
Somebody's making
a fool out of you

887
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,647
And doing a damn good job of it.

888
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,692
You used to be harry thoreau,

889
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,418
The scourge of the west.

890
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,624
And now you're
a freaking pool man.

891
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,456
Fuck you, julian.

892
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,033
Yeah, well, fuck you too.

893
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,671
If he came around here while
I was here, I would've--

894
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,927
I would've thrashed him
within an inch of his life

895
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:13,866
And demanded some kind
of restitution.

896
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,971
You wanna kick his ass
so bad, tough guy,

897
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,673
He's staying right down
at the stardust.

898
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:19,575
What are you guys,
pals or something?

899
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,377
Thoreau:
We have an understanding.

900
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,849
Well, maybe I'll go
pay him a visit

901
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,447
And reach an understanding
of my own

902
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,048
With his teeth and my knuckles!

903
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,823
( both talking heatedly )

904
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,125
I call you for backup.

905
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:37,987
( continues to argue )

906
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,100
Guaranteed to bring you luck.

907
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,003
All right. Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

908
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,948
Hey, little joe from kokomo.
How're you doing today?

909
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,752
Where's my taste, huh?

910
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,654
I'll have the money
for you next week, boss.

911
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,656
I'm tired of you being late
on these payments.

912
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,858
Tell you what. You take
these flowers to lucille,

913
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,430
We'll call it even.

914
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,895
Yo, boss.
Detective dravec was here.

915
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,670
Good work, kid.

916
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,607
I get to deliver the flowers.

917
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,881
Maybe if you throw
in the shades.

918
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,694
Oh, you drive one hell
of a hard bargain.

919
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,788
Come here.

920
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,932
Hey, boys. How ya doing?

921
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,866
Good to see you here. Welcome.

922
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,009
Hey, robert,

923
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,978
Why don't you give the boys
a casino discount card?

924
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,577
You know what?
You go down to baird's,

925
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,179
Get yourself
a nice suit, all right?

926
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,850
Comfy?

927
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,980
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys.

928
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,546
What can I do for you?

929
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:11,954
We're looking
for julian goddard.

930
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:14,586
Goddard. Goddard's in the can.

931
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:15,922
What rock do you live under?

932
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,556
He's out.
He was spotted in vegas.

933
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,761
What's that got to do with me?

934
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,002
You used to know goddard, right?

935
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,997
Sure, I did. Everybody did.

936
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,029
That don't mean anything.
He's a nut. He's a wild man.

937
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,774
He's completely unpredictable.

938
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,799
It's come to our attention that
he used to put the moves

939
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:28,995
On your girl...Lucille.

940
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,537
That was before she met me.

941
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:35,043
She's done with him,
finished, <i>finito.</i>

942
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,005
She dumped him,
hasn't seen him since.

943
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,654
What about today?

944
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,279
You are giving me
a fucking headache, dravec!

945
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:43,154
Hey, don't get your bowels
in an uproar there, huh?

946
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:45,153
We're gonna just take
a quick look around

947
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,815
And talk to a few
of your employees.

948
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:49,264
You don't mind, do you? Thanks.

949
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,634
Dravec...

950
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,631
You do what you got to,
only do it quiet.

951
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,125
Cop noise disturbs
the customers.

952
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:01,096
Get it?

953
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,795
( sniff )

954
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,708
Bring the car around back quick.

955
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,147
( rock music blares )

956
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,294
Julian:
Oh, hello there, mr. Policeman.

957
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,225
What do you think I am, stupid?

958
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,238
Good behavior, my ass.

959
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,775
( glass breaks )

960
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,318
Dravec:
You seen this scumbag?

961
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,989
Seen a lot of scumbags.

962
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:53,858
What makes this one so special?

963
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,661
( slap )

964
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,600
Ow.

965
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:02,357
He was here this morning,
looking for lucille.

966
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,196
Did he find her?

967
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,271
I don't know,

968
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,170
But he didn't strike me
as the kind of guy

969
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:09,772
Who would stop looking.

970
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,710
Satisfied?

971
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,840
Dravec:
Hey, let's go
and talk to lucille.

972
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,984
Rarr.

973
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,654
( romantic music plays )

974
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,922
What are you
still doing here, huh?

975
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,751
I'm glad you stayed, but...

976
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,123
I thought you hated las vegas.

977
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,661
It's a tough town to leave.

978
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,830
Why did you come back?

979
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,769
Uh...

980
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,972
The road only
went one way, baby.

981
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,641
The road...Can go two ways.

982
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,746
Oh, not for me.

983
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,408
And not for you either.

984
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:55,176
That's why you're still here.
You waited for me,

985
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,045
Just like I told you.

986
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,659
( moaning )

987
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,390
( rock music blares )

988
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,102
He loves me not.

989
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,729
I love him.

990
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:44,934
Tuerto:
Hello, doll.

991
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,435
Guess you got the roses.

992
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:47,837
Tuerto.

993
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,968
Why so surprised?

994
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,213
( toilet flushes )

995
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,879
Company?

996
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,449
Tuerto loves a party.

997
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,848
How ya doing, tuerto?

998
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,955
Mr. Goddard.

999
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,317
Long time, no see.

1000
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:09,825
Mm-hmm.

1001
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,757
You were always
a snappy dresser.

1002
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:15,433
Hey, would you like me
to put a hem in that?

1003
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,872
No.

1004
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,905
Ok, boys and girls,
we're gonna get dressed now,

1005
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,783
And we're gonna go
for a little drive,

1006
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,822
Just the three of us.

1007
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,050
Come on.

1008
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,021
What are you gonna do, tuerto?

1009
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:44,856
I haven't decided whether

1010
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:46,062
I'm gonna kill him myself

1011
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,433
Or feed him to the cops.

1012
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,828
Now get dressed.

1013
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,906
Come on.

1014
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,154
Oh.

1015
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:11,494
Oh!

1016
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,879
Mmm!

1017
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,308
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

1018
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,513
( muffled talking )

1019
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,019
God, son of a bitch
took lucille!

1020
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,249
He never comes during the day.
What was he doing here?

1021
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,224
I'll tell you, this shoe
really comes in handy.

1022
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:49,393
Ok, there's a cop out front.
I'm gonna duck down,

1023
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:51,093
And all I want you to do
is just fly right by.

1024
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:52,294
Ok.

1025
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,396
Julian...I have to talk to you
about something.

1026
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,100
Honey, this is not the time.
Please, let's go.

1027
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,540
Julian, it's very important.

1028
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,039
Honey, let's go!

1029
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,343
Ok, stay down.

1030
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,308
You got three goons out here.

1031
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,175
Hi. How's it going?
Cop: How you doin'?

1032
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,246
Hi, fellas.
Tuerto'll be right out.

1033
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:19,445
Nice suits.

1034
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,077
Looks like my old buddy dravec.

1035
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,015
Punch it, baby. Let's go!

1036
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,318
I'm punching! I'm punching!

1037
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,393
That's it. That's it.

1038
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,566
I want you to blow right through
the stop sign, baby.

1039
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,069
Lucille:
Ok.

1040
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,340
Hang a left.
Don't hit the brakes.

1041
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:09,538
Just take it real fast.

1042
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,069
Hard left. Come on.
Go! Go! Go!

1043
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,044
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1044
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,387
Julian, honey, I really need
to talk to you about something.

1045
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,061
Honey, please, please.
Hit the horn.

1046
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,659
Hit the horn!

1047
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:33,161
Lucille: Aah!
( blares horn )

1048
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,531
Look out. Look out.

1049
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,433
Aah! Aah!

1050
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,065
Ok, let's have some fun.

1051
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,371
I pull the brake,
you cut the wheel.

1052
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,112
Go, baby, go!
What are you doin'?

1053
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,007
Cut the wheel!
I'm cutting!

1054
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:47,309
Whoo-hoo!

1055
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:49,381
Aah!

1056
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,979
That is an illegal u-turn.

1057
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,611
Yeah. We add that to the list.
Come on. Come on!

1058
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,716
Hang a left. Hang a left.

1059
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:03,325
Lefting, lefting.

1060
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,127
We got you now, loverboy.
We got you now!

1061
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,328
What the fuck is that?!

1062
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:14,095
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1063
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,739
God, I hate that.

1064
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,581
I think we lost them.

1065
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,307
Beautiful job, sweetheart.

1066
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,482
Thanks. I love you, baby.
I love you too.

1067
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,139
Look at that sky.

1068
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:56,635
On a night like this...
Julian.

1069
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,546
Anything can happen.
I mean anything.

1070
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,178
Anything, anything.
Come on.

1071
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,545
Honey...

1072
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,294
Marry me, lucille.

1073
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,686
Marry me, baby.

1074
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,392
I'm all yours.

1075
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,734
Julian, I'm pregnant.

1076
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,338
Oh, no, no, no.

1077
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:23,368
It's not what you think, baby.
It's not tuerto's baby.

1078
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,043
No, it's yours.

1079
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,442
Mine?!
Yeah.

1080
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,113
You better watch
yourself, sweetie,

1081
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,641
'cause I'm startin' to get...

1082
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,206
I'm startin' to get real mad!

1083
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,454
Julian...

1084
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,583
I haven't slept with
tuerto in a long time,

1085
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,215
And there hasn't
been anybody else.

1086
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,420
It's the truth.

1087
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,692
The truth?!

1088
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:41,259
The truth?!

1089
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:42,618
The truth is that
I've been in prison

1090
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:44,226
For three years!

1091
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,787
And, according
to everything I know,

1092
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:47,396
Two people have to be together

1093
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:50,267
Basically in the same place
to make a baby!

1094
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,772
Julian...

1095
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,435
What if we were together?

1096
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,140
I think that I would
remember, lucille.

1097
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,676
I didn't remember it myself
until this morning.

1098
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,522
When I saw you
down on the casino floor,

1099
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:08,717
It all came back to me.

1100
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,648
What all came back to you?

1101
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:12,754
One night about a month ago,

1102
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,316
I just couldn't sleep.

1103
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,424
I don't know why,
but I got in my car,

1104
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,126
And I drove to that old motel.

1105
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,824
Lucille:
<i>I got real sad</i>
<i>lookin' at that room,</i>

1106
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,148
<i>All messed up,</i>
<i>just the way we left it.</i>

1107
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,417
<i>I guess I was hoping</i>
<i>you'd be there somehow.</i>

1108
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,870
( howling )

1109
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,449
<i>Maybe it was just a dream.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

1110
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,820
But that's when it happened,
julian.

1111
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,550
That's when you and me
made this baby

1112
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:26,985
I have inside of me.

1113
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,532
I don't blame you
for not believin' me.

1114
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,794
I had the same dream.

1115
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,703
It's holding water.

1116
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,406
I wish julian was here.

1117
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,976
I got a funny feeling
about all this.

1118
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,621
I'm gonna go look for him.

1119
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,277
Keep an eye on things.

1120
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,726
( people chatting happily )

1121
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,706
Whoa. Excuse me.

1122
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,038
Sorry.

1123
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:55,713
Woman:
Good luck. Congratulations.

1124
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,919
Where you taking me
on our honeymoon?

1125
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:05,749
Oh, baby, I just
figured we'd just...

1126
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,055
We'd just keep driving...

1127
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:08,487
Mmm.

1128
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,431
Until we run out of road.

1129
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,427
I love the sound of that.

1130
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,333
I'm gonna call thoreau.

1131
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,633
Mmm?

1132
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:19,704
I'm gonna tell him good-bye.
Ok. Hurry up.

1133
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:22,503
Be right back.
Hurry, hurry.

1134
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:27,675
Hey.

1135
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,577
Look at that.

1136
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,582
( telephone rings )

1137
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,086
Ooh. Feels good.

1138
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,519
Come on, thoreau. Come on.

1139
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:43,591
( honk honk )

1140
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,693
One second, baby.
Be right there.

1141
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,903
( telephone rings )

1142
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,099
Surprise.

1143
01:12:56,106 --> 01:12:57,736
Lucille:
Aah! Aah!

1144
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,084
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1145
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:38,876
Oh, boy.

1146
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,161
Get outta here.

1147
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,513
( takes deep breath )

1148
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,532
Boys told me
you were in your car,

1149
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,198
Waiting outside some
chintzy wedding chapel.

1150
01:14:27,197 --> 01:14:28,697
What's that about?

1151
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,573
And, on top of that,

1152
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,040
I hear you and dellaposa

1153
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:37,668
Are marking cards
behind my back.

1154
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:39,244
I give you a house,
a car, a job.

1155
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:41,542
Everything you have,

1156
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,854
You have because
of tuerto's generosity.

1157
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,224
Oh, lucille.

1158
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:55,993
Party's over, lucille.

1159
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,492
I'm cashing in your chips.

1160
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,099
( sighs )

1161
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,499
Now get outta here.

1162
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,745
Tuerto...

1163
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,652
I played you for a sap.

1164
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:28,156
I'm sorry.

1165
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,092
It's just that there are...

1166
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:33,625
Things going on with me

1167
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,530
That I can't explain, and...

1168
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,069
I don't even understand.

1169
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,806
Where you going, missy?!

1170
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,008
Hey, what are you doing?!
Get your mitts off of me!

1171
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,581
What do you want, dravec?

1172
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:51,009
Where's your boyfriend?
I don't know.

1173
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:52,684
I'm tired of being
jerked around here.

1174
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,552
Hey, you take three baby steps
back, copper,

1175
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,051
And pop a breath mint
while you're at it.

1176
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,892
Can't you see the lady's
had a rough time of it?

1177
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,547
Well, maybe she likes it rough.

1178
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,786
Does aiding and abetting
a fugitive mean anything to you?

1179
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,121
Come on. Tell us where he is.

1180
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,826
I told you, I don't know.

1181
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,987
That song is getting old.
Where you go, he goes.

1182
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,556
What time is your show tonight?

1183
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,195
There ain't no show tonight.
I just fired her.

1184
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,669
She's going on the schedule.

1185
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:13,128
Yeah? Says who?
Says me, hot shot.

1186
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,096
Look, you play ball,
or I'll shut down

1187
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:17,174
This tarnished
xanadu toot suite.

1188
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,143
Powder your nose, sweetheart.

1189
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:20,912
I want you to sing
it like you mean it,

1190
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,240
'cause I'm goin' fishin',

1191
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,045
And you are the bait.

1192
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,178
( whispering ):
Oh, julian.

1193
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,163
You're not gonna kiss me,
are you, thoreau?

1194
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,668
Not unless you ask me real nice.

1195
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:48,137
( groaning )

1196
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,807
Ow.

1197
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,367
Somebody jacked you up,
but good.

1198
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,005
Yeah.

1199
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,240
Tuerto's stooges.

1200
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,045
And they got lucille.

1201
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,351
( telephone rings )

1202
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,120
Marilyn motel. May I help you?

1203
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,023
It's him.

1204
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,955
Yeah, it seems
to be holding water.

1205
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,229
Well, what--what time
should I expect you?

1206
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:19,332
Midnight? Ok, sure. Midnight.

1207
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:21,895
Gimme that damn phone!

1208
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:25,014
Now, you listen to me,
you cowardly son of a bitch!

1209
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:26,708
I want my--

1210
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,676
Now, do you believe me now?

1211
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:34,982
Do you see what
I'm telling you?

1212
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,754
It's all coming full circle!

1213
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,893
And in a little more than...

1214
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,658
Oh, hell, in no time at all,

1215
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:43,058
We're gonna get our money back.

1216
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:46,189
And all we have to do is wait!

1217
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,655
Well, that's what you do best,
isn't it, thoreau?

1218
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:50,355
You sit around, and you wait!

1219
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,296
Well, not me!

1220
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,374
Always sitting!

1221
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,877
Where you going?

1222
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,449
To get lucille.
Give me the keys.

1223
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,107
You're in no
condition to drive.

1224
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:08,045
You're in no condition to stop
me. Give me the keys.

1225
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:10,181
You can't leave. We gotta stick
together this time.

1226
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,062
( choking )

1227
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:19,731
Thoreau!

1228
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:22,129
You're my partner
and the best friend I got,

1229
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:23,931
And I love you like a brother,

1230
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:26,133
But that don't mean I won't kill
you if I have to.

1231
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,710
Now, give me the keys.

1232
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,138
Ok.

1233
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,947
( coughing )

1234
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,089
( small splash )

1235
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,891
Ha ha!

1236
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,243
There's water in that pool.
You know I can't swim.

1237
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,480
Looks like you're
gonna have to learn.

1238
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:09,437
Goddamn.

1239
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:11,945
I can't even
see 'em down there.

1240
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,292
I wouldn't go in
that pool if I were you.

1241
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,163
He threw the keys in the pool.

1242
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,032
Then they're gone.

1243
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:31,001
What do you mean "gone"?

1244
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,900
I mean gone...

1245
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,402
As in "away."

1246
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,135
You went in that pool, pappy?

1247
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:41,081
I seen some
mighty strange things

1248
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,477
In the desert--

1249
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:45,378
Hallucinations,
visitations, mirages--

1250
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,281
Call them what you will.

1251
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,224
But what I seen down there...

1252
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:56,792
I wouldn't go in
that pool if I were you.

1253
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,228
You guys are givin' me
the heebie-jeebies.

1254
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,477
I promise to bring her back
without a scratch.

1255
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,528
( snapping fingers )

1256
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,234
Johnny, where have you been?

1257
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:39,834
I've been saving a seat for you.

1258
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,366
Katrina, I'm sorry.
I didn't get the time.

1259
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,600
Look, I'm telling you,
I'm not the guy for you,

1260
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:45,936
And I told you that
before, ok? I'm sorry.

1261
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:48,982
( snaps fingers )

1262
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,576
Buck up, big fella.

1263
01:20:56,586 --> 01:21:00,016
For every ending,
there's a new beginning.

1264
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,592
What are you,
a goddamn fortune cookie?

1265
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,958
( katrina crying )

1266
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,336
Give her something, jerry.

1267
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,388
( snapping fingers )

1268
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,431
Seat taken?

1269
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,143
Knock yourself out.
Thank you.

1270
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:59,452
What if he doesn't show?

1271
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,278
You get a look
at that dame lucille?

1272
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:02,954
Yeah.
He'll show.

1273
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:04,922
Hey, how do you feel?

1274
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,351
Ah, all right, I guess.

1275
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,915
All right, you look fantastic.

1276
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:09,494
What a package.
They're gonna eat you up.

1277
01:22:09,492 --> 01:22:11,592
I'm gonna ride shotgun
on the lighting board,

1278
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,434
Make sure that bozo
doesn't fuck up, ok?

1279
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,299
And remember, smile at vinnie.

1280
01:22:15,298 --> 01:22:17,498
All right, good,
you'll be great.

1281
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,070
You know your mark?

1282
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,468
All right, 15 seconds
to blackout.

1283
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:22,039
Ok.

1284
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:24,138

1285
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,210

Psst.

1288
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:32,606
I thought I'd never
see you again.

1289
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,975
You've gotta get out of here.

1290
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:36,284
It's a trap.

1291
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,715
Come with me.

1292
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,450
I can't. They're watching me.

1293
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,055
They want you.

1294
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:43,417
Nobody's gonna get me.

01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:02,872
The record contract.
Did you get it?

1399
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:04,641
Oh, yeah. I sure did.

1400
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:15,848
So, um, I guess
this all your now.

1401
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,081
Julian:
Come on, baby, let's go!

1402
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:45,007
You are lookin' good. My, my.

1403
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:46,813
Go, go, go, go!

1404
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:48,115
Mmm.

1405
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:54,892
So, any sign of him?
Nope.

1406
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,990
She still in there?
Yep.

1407
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:02,896
Hey, you.

1408
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,871
Rowrr.

1409
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,018
They had no idea
what they were doin'

1410
01:30:23,018 --> 01:30:25,988
When they built this place.

1411
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:28,488
Tapped straight into the cosmos.

1412
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:33,134
( harry and thoreau laughing )

1413
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:34,588
Hey, harry.

1414
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,896
Whoo! Good to see you.

1415
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:40,529
Honey, this here is my father.

1416
01:30:40,536 --> 01:30:43,936
Pappy, this is lucille...

1417
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,909
My wife.

1418
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,212
We got a certificate
and everything.

1419
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:52,712
Nice to meet you, sir.

1420
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,054
Whoa.

1421
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:58,848
This calls for a toast.

1422
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,885
Perhaps I ought to kiss
the bride myself.

1423
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:06,091
I notice it's coming up
on the witching hour, thoreau.

1424
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:07,764
So where's the bogeyman?

1425
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:08,963
He'll be here.

1426
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,564
Well, he better make it snappy,

1427
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:12,196
Or else I'm liable
to turn into a pumpkin.

1428
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:14,841
Lucille:
Hey, everybody, look at this!

1429
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,100
It's glowing.

1430
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:19,766
Why does it do that?

1431
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:21,835
Yeah, thoreau,
why does it do that?

1432
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,844
Wish I could tell you.

1433
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:27,106
Honey, scooch away
from the side there.

1434
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:29,945
Listen. No, it's not
a good idea, baby.

1435
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:33,092
Uh, this--this
pool is busted, ok?

1436
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:34,888
( thunder )

1437
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:45,173
( thunder )

1438
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,902
It's all there.

1439
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:52,565
Mister, I don't know
what your game is,

1440
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:54,814
But at this point
in the evening,

1441
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:57,810
I say let bygones be bygones.

1442
01:31:57,813 --> 01:32:00,513
Come on, thoreau.
Let's split it up.

1443
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,717
( thunder )

1444
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:09,593
( water crackles )

1445
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:15,558
Surf's up.

1446
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:16,804
( crackles )

1447
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,004
What's down there?

1448
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,743
Well, lucille,

1449
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:28,070
That's all the roads
you didn't take,

1450
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:30,606
And that's all the
choices you didn't make,

1451
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,912
And that's all the numbers
you didn't bet on.

1452
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,975
That's everything
that could have happened

1453
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,183
Had things been different.

1454
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:41,020
Looks like we travel in style.

1455
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:42,723
Come on, lucille.
Let's hit the road.

1456
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,124
( siren approaching )

1457
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:45,726
With cops chasing us, julian?

1458
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,127
This ain't no time
to play games, baby.

1459
01:32:47,129 --> 01:32:48,599
We gotta get out of here.

1460
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:50,757
Let's go!

1461
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,266
Lucille, come on.

1462
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:54,067
Lucille!

1463
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:55,799
No.

1464
01:32:55,804 --> 01:32:58,204
You gotta go, julian.

1465
01:32:58,206 --> 01:33:00,206
I'm not goin' with you.

1466
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:04,954
You love me, don't you?

1467
01:33:04,947 --> 01:33:07,047
With all my heart.

1468
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:08,719
Love...

1469
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:09,917
Love is all that matters, baby.

1470
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,248
Listen, baby.

1471
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,793
We can never be together
in this crazy world.

1472
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:15,019
What are you talking about?

1473
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:16,223
You've just gotta go.

1474
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:17,794
Go now, before it's too late.

1475
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:19,333
I ain't goin' nowhere
without you.

1476
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:20,988
No. Goddamn it, julian! Just go!

1477
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:22,856
I ain't goin' without you!

1478
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:24,204
Damn it, julian!

1479
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:26,129
Get the hell out of here! Go!

1480
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,634
What are you talking--

1481
01:33:27,636 --> 01:33:28,896
Johnny:
Julian!

1482
01:33:28,904 --> 01:33:30,944
You could come with me.

1483
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,239
I--I ain't goin' nowhere.

1484
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,740
I ain't goin'
nowhere without her.

1485
01:33:33,742 --> 01:33:35,682
You're a cute couple.

1486
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:39,047
Well, don't think
it hasn't been fun.

1487
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:46,117
Freeze, goddard! Drop the bag!

1488
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:47,991
Drop it! Easy!

1489
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:50,620
Hands in the air!
Keep 'em up! Move it!

1490
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,356
Julian:
Ok, fellas. You got me.

1491
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:54,391
I'm clean.

1492
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:56,196
Real slow. Slow and easy!

1493
01:33:56,198 --> 01:33:58,398
I got nothin' on me.
Got nothin' on me! I'm clean.

1494
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,130
Come on! Come on!

1495
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:02,095
I'm just takin' it off.
Back away from the girl!

1496
01:34:02,104 --> 01:34:04,074
Real clean.

1497
01:34:04,072 --> 01:34:05,642
Move it!

1498
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:07,411
I gotta hand it to you guys.

1499
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:09,679
You're really good.
All right! On the ground!

1500
01:34:09,678 --> 01:34:13,078
I guess you were right, lucille.

1501
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:17,146
We'll never be together
in this world.

1502
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:20,793
Get down! Get down!
Hit the ground.

1503
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:22,089
So long, fellas.

1504
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:39,238
( water crackling )

1505
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:41,141
Where'd they go?
Did we get 'em?

1506
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:43,043
I don't know.
Where the hell are they?

1507
01:34:43,045 --> 01:34:44,435
Dravec:
I saw them get in this pool.

1508
01:34:44,446 --> 01:34:46,306
I did too, ed.

1509
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:47,754
All right!

1510
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:49,219
Nobody move!

1511
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:51,147
Now, I don't know where
the hell your buddy got to,

1512
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:52,453
But you ain't goin' nowhere,

1513
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:54,194
Except maybe
the federal penitentiary

1514
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:57,089
If you got in that bag what
I think you got in that bag.

1515
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:58,362
What bag?

1516
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,960
<i>That</i> bag.

1517
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,331
Oh, <i>this</i> bag.

1518
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:02,929
<i>That</i> bag.

1519
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:11,474
G-go get it.

1520
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:13,713
I-I'm not goin' in that pool.

1521
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:15,779
What? Go in the pool
and retrieve the evidence.

1522
01:35:15,777 --> 01:35:17,737
Gage:
You go in the pool
and get the evidence!

1523
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,206
Are you saying that you're
not gonna go--

1524
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,284
That's exactly what I'm sayin'.

1525
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,890
( sucking )

1526
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,133
( pop )

1527
01:35:33,128 --> 01:35:34,928
( gurgling )

1528
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,257
( smith screaming )

1529
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:44,035
( thud )

1530
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:50,142
Now, who the hell are you?

1531
01:35:50,145 --> 01:35:51,505
Ahh.

1532
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:53,113
Sergeant kaminsky, sir.

1533
01:35:53,115 --> 01:35:54,775
Code name: Smith.

1534
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:59,123
Arrest that man for aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

1535
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:03,215
Get out of the pool, moron.

1536
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:07,485
Eddie, what are we
gonna tell 'em downtown?

1537
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,935
Nothin'.

1538
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:18,337
Absolutely...

1539
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,210
Nothin'.

1540
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:25,410
( moaning )

1541
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:29,215
Where do you think they got to?

1542
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:31,787
Don't suppose we'll ever know.

1543
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:35,391
At least they're together.

1544
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:39,558
Damn shame
about that money, though.

1545
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:41,931
What are you talking about?

1546
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,300
I'm talking about how you could
throw your take of the loot

1547
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:46,369
Into the--into that abyss.

1548
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:48,838
( whines )

1549
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:57,106
That there's my cut.

1550
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,123
So what went down there?

1551
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:09,993
A bag of your dirty laundry.

1552
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:11,491
Switched 'em.

1553
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,963
Hope you don't mind.

1554
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:14,491
Are you kiddin'?

1555
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,156
I hate to do laundry.

1556
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,970
Let's have ourselves a drink.

1557
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:29,908
You'll stick around a while?

1558
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:31,341
No.

1559
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,246
I had enough excitement
for a spell.

1560
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,616
First light, I'm gonna head on
back to the desert.

1561
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,960
Well, you always have
a room here if you want it.

1562
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,294
I appreciate that, thoreau.

1563
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,999
Wouldn't think
of stayin' anywhere else.

1564
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:56,344
( coyote howls )

1565
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,406
Lucille:
<i>Julian.</i>

1566
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:02,238
Julian:
<i>Yes, my love?</i>

1567
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:04,014
( giggles )

1568
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:05,952
<i>Kiss me again.</i>

1569
01:38:05,947 --> 01:38:08,647
Man:
<i>♪ old black magic</i>
<i>has me in its spell ♪</i>

1570
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:13,150
Woman:
<i>♪ old black magic</i>
<i>that you weave so well ♪</i>

1571
01:38:13,154 --> 01:38:16,164
<i>♪ those icy fingers</i>
<i>up and down my spine ♪</i>

1572
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:20,487
<i>♪ the same old witchcraft</i>
