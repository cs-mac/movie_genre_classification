1
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:04,183
...4 runs batted in. And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

2
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,685
Reggie!

3
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,475
Just listen to that crowd.
- Reggie!

4
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:17,905
Come on, Reggie! Hit another homerun!
- Coop, he's already hit two.

5
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:22,193
It's a high fly ball to right...

6
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,195
That's way back

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,362
and it's... gone.

8
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,736
Reggie Jackson hits
his 3rd home run of the game.

9
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:47,128
Good catch, Coop!
- I can't believe it!

10
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,121
I totally had it,
but my glasses slipped.

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,970
Remer, someday I'm gonna become
a big sports star. - Whatever you say.

12
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:59,470
You just watch me, dude.

13
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:05,309
There was a time in America
when contests of athletic prowess

14
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,476
were a metaphor for the nobility of man.

15
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,645
Historic moments,
forged by the love of the game,

16
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:14,186
celebrated the human potential

17
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:19,765
to achieve excellence. But as time passed
and the country neared the millennium,

18
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,853
something went awry.

19
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:27,233
Manning rolls right. He's got Plough
at the ten... Touchdown,

20
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:28,936
Dallas.

21
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:31,073
The ideal of sportsmanship

22
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:36,151
began to take a back seat
to excessive celebration.

23
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:48,454
The athletes caring less about playing
than planning the vulgar grandstanding

24
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:54,497
that inevitably followed even the most
pedestrian of accomplishments.

25
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:58,503
The games became
subordinate to the quest for money.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,207
Stadiums and arenas became no more

27
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,177
than giant billboards

28
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,002
to promote commercial products.

29
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,848
Players sold their services
to the highest bidder,

30
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,349
much like the hired guns
of the Old West.

31
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:21,558
After playing for New England, San Diego,
Houston, St. Louis,

32
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,928
a year for the Toronto Argonauts,
plus one season at the Desert Inn,

33
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:30,519
I'm happy to finally play here
in the fine city of Miami.

34
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:32,895
Minnesota.

35
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,609
Whatever. Shit.

36
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:40,903
Soon it was commonplace for entire teams
to change in search of greater profits.

37
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:44,572
The Minneapolis Lakers moved to
Los Angeles, where there are no lakes.

38
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,447
The Oilers moved to Tennessee,
where there's no oil.

39
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,739
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City
where they don't allow music.

40
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:54,696
The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A.
And then back to Oakland.

41
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:57,163
No one in L.A. Seemed to notice.

42
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:02,824
The search for greener pastures went on.
Continued expansion diluted

43
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:05,578
the talent pool, forcing owners

44
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,756
to recruit heavily from prisons,
mental institutions and Texas.

45
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:12,209
Fistfighting and brawling

46
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:17,793
overshadowed every athletic competition.
As the problems mounted,

47
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:22,680
the fans became less and less interested.
To reverse the trend,

48
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:29,300
major sports started interleague play.
Then they tried intersports play.

49
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,928
But no matter how far major sports went,
it wasn't enough

50
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,814
to bring the fans back.

51
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:42,774
The spirit of athletic competition, though,
indeed was not dead.

52
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:47,521
Its seed merely lay dormant
in the dreams of the young.

53
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:51,859
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna be a big sports star.

54
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,613
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna own a big sports bar.

55
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:05,372
Hurry up, Coop.
- I just gotta water the plants.

56
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,117
I don't wanna be with high school losers.

57
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,709
This is Brittany Kaiser's house,
and I really wanna fuck her.

58
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,207
Dr. Kaiser!

59
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,042
Coop and Remer.

60
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,126
We graduated with Brittany.
- You graduated?

61
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,500
Of course we did, cock. Beer?

62
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,926
This place looks like
a "Dockers" commercial. Hey, Stef!

63
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,259
Coop! Remer!

64
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,800
Want a beer?

65
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:44,093
Oh, my God! You haven't changed at all.

66
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:45,601
Cool!

67
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,185
No, it isn't.

68
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,602
Cock!

69
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,193
Hey, Skid Mark Steve!
You still hanging out

70
00:05:56,612 --> 00:06:00,229
and playing Nintendo?
- I'm in my 2nd year of med school

71
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:03,526
and training for the Summer Games.
What're you two up to?

72
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:08,443
Hanging out, playing Nintendo. Cock.

73
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,575
Hi, Brittany!

74
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,248
Didn't think you guys would show up.

75
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:25,209
We wouldn't miss it. - I don't remember
putting you on the guest list.

76
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:28,710
Ted told us about it.

77
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,132
Excuse me!

78
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,917
Why did you tell those losers? - Me...

79
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:39,292
Let's bail. - No, let's go to Brittany's room!

80
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,508
Come in here! Check it out.

81
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,892
Brittany's underwear. - Aw, dude!

82
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,188
Dude!

83
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,599
I am so jealous of you.

84
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,856
Excuse me! - Brittany!

85
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:10,072
What're you doing in my mom's room?

86
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,065
Get outta here!

87
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:21,609
Oh, Jesus!

88
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:29,781
We'll never get her. - Or any chick.

89
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:34,454
We have no jobs, the rent's overdue

90
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,000
and our gas is about to get shut off.

91
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,420
What do girls want anyway?

92
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:46,084
Apparently, not total losers.
- We're pretty good at basketball.

93
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:51,471
As long as we don't have to run
or jump or dribble.

94
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,007
That shit's overrated anyway.

95
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,842
You guys up for a little game?
- Sure.

96
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,683
Let's make it interesting.

97
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:05,561
20 bucks? - How about 50? - You're on.

98
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:13,814
Haven't got 50 bucks. - They're no good.

99
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,565
Oh, shit!

100
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,528
We playing or not?

101
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:31,112
But not that pussy ass two-on-two
you guys play in the suburbs.

102
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:37,701
You guys got something better?
- This new game we picked up in the hood.

103
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:38,989
What is it?

104
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,209
Okay.
I shoot from wherever I want, right?

105
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,545
Then you have to make the same shot,
or else you get a letter.

106
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:52,710
You mean like "horse"?
- It's not like "horse".

107
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,877
Duh. It's uh...
baseball rules.

108
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:03,925
A single's
from the freethrow line.

109
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:08,426
A double's from the top of the key.
- You have to shoot from a different place.

110
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,550
A triple's from back here, and a home run's
from behind the meatballs.

111
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,894
You miss, you get an out.
Ready? Break. - What?

112
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:20,022
We can explain it more slowly,
big sports guys!

113
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:25,104
No, we get it.

114
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:31,273
Losers up first.
- This is a single, right?

115
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,859
And a homerun's behind the meatballs.
- Take your shot, guy!

116
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:43,825
You can't spit beer at me! - I can do
what I want to make you miss your shot!

117
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:49,619
He's right. That's one out.
- One out? Give me the damn ball!

118
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,037
I fucked your sister.

119
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,412
Coop lines up for a double.
Okay, guys, 2nd and 3rd.

120
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,707
Runner on 3rd. This could bring him home.

121
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah, two outs!

122
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,585
Come on!

123
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:24,101
Tip-in! Double play, three outs!
- What? - We're up.

124
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:28,052
That's nice!
- This could almost seal it.

125
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,428
Made that look easy!

126
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,405
One of Brittany's mom's pubic hairs!

127
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,193
Oh, God!

128
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:49,190
Man! - Dude, we win the game! A sweet
psyche-out. - Here's another one!

129
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,740
We win and they get

130
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:57,905
the chicks. That sucks, dude.
- We gotta get jobs.

131
00:10:58,332 --> 00:11:00,869
Then we get the khakis.
Then the chicks.

132
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,912
Starting tomorrow
we gotta stop playing games!

133
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,916
Miss it. Steve Perry...

134
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:15,921
Yes! Three outs. I'm up.
- Bottom of the 5th. - Joseph R. Cooper?

135
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,003
Single! Man on 1st.
- Are you Joe Cooper?

136
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,921
Cut the crap, Squeak. You know me.

137
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:25,630
This authorizes me to enter
your property and terminate services

138
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:28,510
until all delinquent payments
have been generated. - What?

139
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,846
He's here to shut off the gas.
- You work for the gas company?

140
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,099
Gentlemen...
- Double! Guy on 2nd and 3rd.

141
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,765
Is your canine locked up
or secured within your domicile?

142
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:46,649
He's getting his claws removed.
- If you'll excuse me.

143
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:50,732
Does it just suck being you?
- I'll show those guys

144
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:53,111
what sucks.

145
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,690
Oh yeah, he misses...
- Damn it!

146
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,238
...I'm running outta ideas.
- That's why we have this short shot.

147
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:15,449
Kind of like a bunt. - Exactly!
Doesn't put any runners on base. - Sweet!

148
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:18,118
You lied to me! Again!

149
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:23,205
Right. The dog's appointment is tomorrow.
- Honest mistake, Squeak.

150
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,707
My name's not Squeak. It's Kenny!

151
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,133
Alright, you little bitch.
Take a shot!

152
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:35,677
No, I wanna turn off your gas.
And don't call me bitch!

153
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,971
Okay, Squeak, let's just shoot for it.

154
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,636
What? Are you insane?
This is my job, you assholes!

155
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,013
All you gotta do
is make a single from here,

156
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:49,851
and you can shut off our gas, and
we'll never call you Squeak again.

157
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:51,517
Or bitch.

158
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:53,305
Or bitch.

159
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,235
From here?

160
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,817
Alright. Check this shit out!

161
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,945
Tough break, Squeak.
Now you gotta fetch the ball, bitch.

162
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,654
Three months later

163
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,957
We can win the game with this one.
Bring me home.

164
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,954
We win the game!

165
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,378
We got 5 runs that inning.

166
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,456
This game's pretty badass.

167
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,872
You're up.

168
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,800
Tyler, I hear your sister's going out
with Squeak.

169
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,878
Another psych-out.
- I'm not going out with his sister.

170
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:48,881
That's the defense. - We gotta say
fucked-up shit to make 'em miss.

171
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:51,051
Oh, right.

172
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:54,391
Wait a minute! Why is me going out
with his sister fucked up?

173
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:57,348
Pierce, I hear
your mom's going out with Squeak.

174
00:13:58,855 --> 00:13:59,934
Two outs!

175
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:04,355
You're gonna own 1/12 of the rent,
the water bill, the power bill,

176
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:07,479
the cable bill...
- Check it out! - What's that?

177
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,146
A baseketball!

178
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:11,893
You made a ball? Out of what?

179
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:21,278
I can't believe you were fired for
not shutting off our gas for 6 weeks!

180
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,989
Losing the truck pissed 'em off the most.

181
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:28,454
You can camp out here for a while.
- This is pretty sweet!

182
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,874
Does it fold out? - Yeah, a great bed!
But that's Jenkins' bed.

183
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,331
Your bed's over there.

184
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:40,874
Dude, that is so fucking weak. How am I
supposed to get a chick in that?

185
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:45,126
You couldn't get a chick if you had
$100 hanging outta your zipper.

186
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:47,920
Yeah, I could!
- No, you're a little bitch.

187
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:51,378
I am not!
Why am I hanging out with you guys?

188
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,802
'Cause you're a piece of shit.
- I am not.

189
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,845
But you're a little bitch.

190
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:02,470
Goddam it! You rip on me 13 or
14 more times and I'm outta here.

191
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:06,141
Whatever! I gotta show you
the scoreboard I made!

192
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:10,053
Your place is a shit-hole anyway.

193
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,023
At least I'm on the team.

194
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,982
Yeah, they want me...

195
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,480
Six months later

196
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:30,359
An new driveway game has captured
the imagination of a neighborhood.

197
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:32,822
...enjoying themselves
at the final game.

198
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:37,536
An entire league has sprung up.
- Starting with 12 teams in June.

199
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:42,947
Now down to just two,
including the inventors of the game.

200
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:48,460
It's off the rim.
Could be a double play, Maxwell tips...

201
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,451
Newman's try...

202
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,370
No!

203
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,175
Shirts have a shot at the conversion.

204
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,383
Remer...

205
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:08,382
Keeps it alive.
Last chance! Coop...

206
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:13,889
They make the conversion!
The home run counts!

207
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,811
What a game! The Shirts win
the World Championship

208
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:29,190
of Baseketball.

209
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:33,392
Gentlemen!

210
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,903
Gentlemen, I'm Ted Denslow.

211
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,404
The billionaire?
- Yes.

212
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,862
Anyway, I like your little game.
How'd you like to go pro?

213
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:49,530
Baseketball? - I got 3 words for you:
National Baseketball League.

214
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:53,195
We're not interested.
- Wait a minute! Hear me out.

215
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,577
You kids with your loud music
and your Dan Fogelberg,

216
00:16:57,002 --> 00:17:00,166
your Zima, hula hoops
and Pac-Man video games.

217
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,961
Don't you see?

218
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:07,620
People's attention spans today can
only be measured in nanoseconds.

219
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,169
I hear you.
- Just look at these people!

220
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:20,428
They feel a certain connection with you
as players.

221
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,265
With baseketball
we can start fresh,

222
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,221
not allow teams
to change cities,

223
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,974
or players to be traded.
And everybody will get paid the same,

224
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,480
like when I was a kid
and players were treated like...

225
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:37,891
Indentured servants?
- Yes!

226
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:42,942
The real beauty of this game is
anyone can play.

227
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:48,567
Any normal Joe can be a sports hero.
Never wanted to be a sports hero?

228
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:53,649
Sure, once.
But that was long time ago.

229
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:58,287
If I know anything about this country,
it will go nuts for baseketball.

230
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:01,990
America will go crazy.

231
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,618
Listen to that crowd!

232
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,470
Five years later

233
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:55,602
9th inning. The Beers still behind by
3 runs and down to their last out.

234
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,983
The pressure on these players
has to be enormous.

235
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:01,695
Alright, guys, we've got one out left.

236
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:06,658
We can still win this thing.
Can we do it? - Yes!

237
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:11,114
What a game these fans are seeing!

238
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,413
That gentleman is Ted Denslow,
the father of professional baseketball,

239
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,621
along with his lovely new wife
Yvette.

240
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:26,998
Now shooting, number 44,
Coop "Airman" Cooper!

241
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,999
Coop is heading for the triple square.

242
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:37,340
Bob Costas, this has to be one
of the most exciting baseketball games.

243
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:41,509
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago
this game was played only on driveways.

244
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,173
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago

245
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
those girls were
only in grade school.

246
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:53,560
Coop at the triple line, and Jansen
sets up for the psych-out.

247
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:55,728
Be right with you!

248
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:02,190
It's good!
- Coop triples again.

249
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:05,183
He's hit for the cycle
already 7 times tonight.

250
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:18,114
Listen to those foam heads
doing the Beers' chug!

251
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:24,611
Coop's on third, with two down.
That brings up Squeak Scolari.

252
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,452
I knew it was gonna come down to me.
- It's not just you. We're a team.

253
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,952
It all comes down to just one man.

254
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:35,828
Oh, God! - If I could have
one guy out there, it'd be you.

255
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:38,793
Unfortunately,
that one man is Squeak Scolari.

256
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,671
Shit!
- Pretend this is just another game.

257
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,499
The Denslow Cup is
the biggest game of the season

258
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,504
Christ! - Will you turn that shit off?
- I'm scared! - Listen to me.

259
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:54,222
You make that shot, or I'm gonna shove
your head so far up your fucking ass...

260
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:59,183
Doug Remer giving his teammate
some last minute encouragement.

261
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,768
Go out there and make that shot!

262
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:16,939
The talented Felon girls
appearing in their 3rd Denslow Cup game.

263
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:23,314
Now shooting, number 23,
Squeak "Little Bitch" Scolari!

264
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,493
Squeak Scolari walks out
to take the last remaining single.

265
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:34,285
Come on, bitch!

266
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:37,371
Hey, Squeak! Miss it!

267
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,751
It's good!
The Beers stay alive in the 9th.

268
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:49,831
Dallas Felons' owner, Baxter Cain
hoping for another Denslow Cup victory.

269
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:54,668
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

270
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:59,881
Remer heads for the double line.

271
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:03,176
Remer, you better make sure
your toe's not over the line.

272
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:08,010
Hey, Jansen, nice psych-out,
dingleberry. Yes!

273
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:12,309
It's now a 2-run game.
Dirk Jansen apparently missed

274
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,388
another psych-out.

275
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:17,683
Everyone at Beers Garden
is on their feet!

276
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,769
At a time like this

277
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:24,315
you can't help thinking about guys
like John Elway,

278
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:27,772
guys who kept coming close
and then finally got there.

279
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,481
If Coop can make this one,
the Beers' long wait will be over.

280
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,151
Hey, Coop, looks like
your boy Denslow's gonna buy the farm.

281
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:43,825
He missed.

282
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:47,498
The Felons win their
2nd consecutive Denslow Cup

283
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,157
on the strength
of a Dirk Jansen psych-out.

284
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,493
I got you, dude. I got you!

285
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,875
Relax. Do the Happy Dance!

286
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:59,249
We just lost the game!
- Do the Happy Dance!

287
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:03,631
Where's the singing?
- I don't wanna sing! - Come on, sing!

288
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,463
Shit, Denslow! - These Beers fans
have to be disappointed.

289
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:17,344
What an unfortunate thing
to happen on "Dozen Egg Night".

290
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:24,729
It's my husband!
Somebody help him! Oh, God!

291
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:29,392
If there's anything you need.
- Oh, Teddy! He just fell over!

292
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:37,109
I wish there was something I could do.

293
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,071
They stopped serving them after the 7th.
Get this man a hot dog!

294
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,482
You're absolutely right, Jim.
Ted Denslow was a hero,

295
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:54,244
because his vision brought baseketball
from local driveways into big arenas,

296
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:57,830
but more importantly,
into the hearts and TVs of America.

297
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:02,162
His untimely death casts a pall
over an otherwise sweet victory!

298
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:03,960
And all of our hearts...

299
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:09,379
Dirk Jansen, winner of

300
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:12,584
the "Winter's Warm Douche" M.V.P. Trophy.
What's your take?

301
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:17,549
The key to the game
was when I psyched out Coop.

302
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:22,971
He didn't psyche me out! If anyone got
the psych-out, it should be Denslow.

303
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,630
Dude, weak.

304
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:30,552
I know this is a dark time for you, but I'd like
your thoughts on what happened tonight.

305
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:35,304
I lost the big game
and a dear friend.

306
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,731
I'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now.
I don't think I should be alone...

307
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:45,849
It does seem to be raining shit
on Joe Cooper right now.

308
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,107
On paper,
the Beers had the far superior team.

309
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,446
But the outside shooting of Coop
and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer.

310
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,533
What happened out there?
- Well, you know...

311
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,816
It was a team effort. It took every player
working together to lose this one.

312
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:04,075
Thanks, Doug. And so...
- You wanna do an interview with me?

313
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:08,280
No! So another baseketball championship
is in the books.

314
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,458
Yet another opportunity lost
for the Beers.

315
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,915
I gotta go.

316
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:21,999
What's going on? Coop?
- This was Tim McCarver

317
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:26,919
from Beers Garden, where the Felons
have defeated the Milwaukee Beers.

318
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:29,501
In Denslow Cup IV...

319
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,723
Everybody in.
One at a time.

320
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:41,507
There he is!

321
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:45,801
Coop! - Oh, man!
- Can we talk to him?

322
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,312
Excuse me.

323
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:55,223
Would you mind
signing autographs for the kids?

324
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:59,779
The Dallas locker room's over there.
- I know, but it was so crowded.

325
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:03,894
They'd really rather have
your autograph.

326
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:07,774
Really?
- Would you mind signing these?

327
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:09,816
Sure.

328
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,456
It's nice to meet you, Miss...?
- Reed. Jenna Reed.

329
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:20,790
Joe Cooper, Coop.
- I know.

330
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,036
Are all these kids with you?

331
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,077
I've been the director of the "Dream
Come True Foundation" since October.

332
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,792
The one that grants wishes
to sick and dying kids, right?

333
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,546
We prefer to think of them as
health- and survival-impaired.

334
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,338
You're a big fan of baseketball?
- No.

335
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:43,045
I mean, the kids are! I try to keep
them interested in permanent things.

336
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:45,215
Permanent?

337
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,465
Professional athletes come and go.
- Not in baseketball. There's rules against it.

338
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:52,137
Hello!

339
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:56,353
Miss Reed, this is Remer.
- Like a fresh pretzel?

340
00:26:58,189 --> 00:26:59,433
I baked it myself.

341
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:03,313
Oh, thank you.
- Goes great with mustard.

342
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,977
Miss Reed?

343
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:08,477
You didn't make that, did you?
- No!

344
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:12,686
But chicks like guys who can cook.
- What?

345
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:17,655
See! She was checking out my ass.
- She wasn't!

346
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,826
I'd better get these kids back.
Little Travis is getting impatient.

347
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:25,536
I love kids. Which one is Travis?
Heads up, big guy.

348
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,495
Needs a little work on the hands.

349
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,121
He's blind, Doug.

350
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:38,582
Felons' fans

351
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:43,332
rejoiced in their Denslow Cup victory
in downtown Dallas.

352
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:47,042
Final tally: 14 injured, 3 dead.

353
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:52,794
The sports world was devastated
by the passing of Ted Denslow.

354
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:57,798
The late Beers owner seemed to be
the only one surprised by his death.

355
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:02,552
Time just finally ran out
for the old cocksucker.

356
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:08,680
Theodore Denslow dead at 85.
His hairpiece was 24.

357
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,220
These chaps

358
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,728
I wore in "Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm"
I bequeath to my nephew Herman.

359
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:20,105
Hope he looks
as snappy in them as I did.

360
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:23,778
And this poncho
that kept me dry...

361
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:28,480
Mrs. Denslow? Baxter Cain. May I?
- Of course.

362
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,905
My deepest sympathy!
- Thank you, Mr. Cain.

363
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,818
This hand-painted plate commemorating

364
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:37,870
the Pope's visit to Dodger Stadium

365
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:43,448
I leave to my niece Susan.
Limited edition, signed

366
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:48,287
with a photocopied certificate
of authenticity... - Jenna!

367
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:52,631
What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

368
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,455
I got this letter...
- Me, too.

369
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,459
And the toothbrush...

370
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:05,757
Where's the body?
- They buried him 2 days ago.

371
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:09,466
This is the will reading.
- Well, in that case...

372
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,389
These are for you, Jenna.

373
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:15,970
I bequeath these season tickets

374
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:20,309
to the "Dream Come True Foundation".

375
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,430
I had nothing but respect
for your late husband.

376
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:30,147
Unfortunately, he stood in the way
of making changes in baseketball

377
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,819
that might increase the owners' profits.

378
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,358
I can't imagine
what he had against making money?

379
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:42,819
I trust that quality
isn't sexually transmitted.

380
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,276
Pretty sweet, huh?

381
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:51,289
Yeah, the kids will be excited.
Especially little Joey.

382
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,041
Joey?
- He's such a big fan of yours.

383
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,081
He's going into the hospital next week,

384
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:01,836
and begged me to ask you to visit him,
but it's not a good idea.

385
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:05,789
I'd love to come by.
- I'll come by. I like hospitals.

386
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:07,758
You like Taco Bell.

387
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:10,666
I went to this hospital in France
and got together with this chick.

388
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,375
Dude, that was a hostel!

389
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,680
Finally, my beloved Beers,
I bequeath

390
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,592
controlling interest

391
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:22,132
to Joseph R. Cooper.

392
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:26,178
We own the team!

393
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:30,221
I gave him
the best 3 months of my life.

394
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,228
Way to go, dude!

395
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,563
And, Coop?

396
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:38,142
Yes, Mr. Denslow?

397
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:42,893
I know you have it in you to lead the Beers
to victory this season.

398
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:46,903
Because if you don't
the team reverts to Yvette.

399
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:54,030
Don't feel badly about losing the team.
I believe this is merely temporary.

400
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,613
Thank you, Mr. Cain.

401
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,077
It's nice to have a strong, handsome man
like you on my side.

402
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,081
Well, I'd love to discuss this
further with you.

403
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:11,245
Why don't you visit sometime?
Maybe we could

404
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:16,340
lay some carpet,
if you know what I mean.

405
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:19,711
At this time, I'd like to ask
everyone to leave the room,

406
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,254
so I can have
a private moment with Coop.

407
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,847
Now that we're alone, Coop,
there's something I wanna tell you.

408
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,136
Remember
when you had the crabs

409
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,769
and this lotion made you feel better?
I've found another use for it.

410
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:43,139
It's so good, it makes me wanna sing.
Just like the night

411
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:46,565
we spent in the tattoo parlor in Chicago.
Come on, baby!

412
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:04,153
You getting this?

413
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:20,373
That's two rooms done.
Those corners are tricky! - A fine job!

414
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:28,834
I've come up with a plan to make sure
Coop never wins the Denslow Cup.

415
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:35,011
So the team will be mine?
- Yes. - Wonderful, Baxter.

416
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:38,299
Do you want me to move on
to the conference room? - Not yet.

417
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:43,514
But I think my lobby
could use a good buffing.

418
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:49,140
If you know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

419
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,726
I can't do this shit!

420
00:32:57,025 --> 00:33:01,353
The Beers coming up to bat
in this season opener against Miami,

421
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,896
a game
they have dedicated to Ted Denslow,

422
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:09,817
the team wearing black in memory
of the late Beers owner.

423
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:13,573
The Beers cheerleaders
also mourning the loss.

424
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:38,707
Dude, it's a whole different ball game
now that you own the team.

425
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:43,509
Denslow was right.
This season could be different.

426
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:47,627
We just gotta kick some ass
and play to keep this team. You ready?

427
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:50,177
I'm in, all or nothing.

428
00:33:56,935 --> 00:34:01,596
Joining us this evening, big fan
of baseketball, Tony Nocciolino,

429
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:06,397
who plays Latino cutup Scooter
on the comedy series "What's the Difference?",

430
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:09,935
airing between "Recycled Junk",
starring Lisa Campbell,

431
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,396
and "Same Old Crap",
featuring teen heartthrob Mark Swenson.

432
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:17,770
All part of the great fall line-up
on "Who Gives a Rat's Ass" Thursdays.

433
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:21,981
Great to have you with us.
- So Miami takes the field.

434
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,116
We're underway.

435
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:27,158
Coop steps into
the single square.

436
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:36,582
It's good! - The Beers are off
to a promising start tonight!

437
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:40,369
This game is made all the more special

438
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:44,494
by the fact
it's "Free Range Chicken Night".

439
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:47,294
The Beers up by two,
but the Dealers are only one out.

440
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:50,419
That brings up Enrique Hernandez.

441
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,300
Hernandez, look!

442
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,717
Fat from Marlon Brando's ass.

443
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,298
Uh, no! What am I doing here?

444
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:11,636
It's all salty and warm.
Why would I do this?

445
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:13,723
This guy ate a lot of pork!

446
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,979
Damn it!

447
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:25,525
It was a killer psych-out. - Really?
- Shake it off. I got this guy.

448
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:30,774
Got milk?

449
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,986
Coop tips, and it's good!
Double play. Beers win.

450
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,285
Remer still nailing down that psych-out.

451
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:55,460
We totally kicked ass.
- And this is just the start.

452
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:59,747
Could you sign my chicken?
- Joe Cooper? Baxter Cain.

453
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:04,835
Denslow told me about you.
- Welcome to our community of owners.

454
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:08,961
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask. - Thanks, dude.

455
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:13,219
We're going to be voting next week
on some changes in baseketball's rules.

456
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:17,305
I want to tell everyone you're with us.
- Why it's fine the way it is.

457
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:22,387
Until we allow teams to move cities
and players to change teams

458
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,220
and take advantage
of lucrative corporate tie-ins,

459
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:29,810
you and your colleagues are going
to have to continue working for...

460
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:34,142
Chicken poo?

461
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,655
Feed. Chicken feed.

462
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:43,397
Coop, the ball is in your court.
For those rules to change,

463
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,572
every owner has to vote yes.
Denslow was already filthy rich.

464
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,538
He didn't need the changes.
But you do.

465
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:55,780
You're asking me to go against
every reason we created this game.

466
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,164
Before you make
any hasty decisions,

467
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:02,996
discuss it with your teammate.
- I don't have to. We think alike.

468
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:07,626
Sorry, but if you want unanimous consent,
get it from one of the other owners.

469
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:19,304
Are we gonna kick their ass?

470
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:24,802
We're gonna take these mooks out or what?
- Let me handle this one!

471
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:28,391
In the river, baby!
- Come on! - No doubt about it!

472
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:33,263
Your mother's
a terrible cook!

473
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,647
I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Easy.

474
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,357
Can't gross me out.
- Well, check out Coop!

475
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,425
I wanna feel you.

476
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,332
Deep inside me.

477
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:30,670
That's not fair!

478
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:34,256
Come on, Zane. That was...

479
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,259
That was fair. Let's play ball.

480
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:40,519
Hey, Watson,
have you seen those beer commercials?

481
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,843
How to speak San Franciscan.

482
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,136
"Vajoina"!

483
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,978
That wasn't a gay joke.
That was an Australian joke.

484
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:58,653
"Beers Still Winning
More and More Games"

485
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:11,233
Come on, let's do it!
- What do we always say?

486
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,663
One, two, three,
fuck the Mexicans!

487
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:24,039
I'll take my shot! Sure hope I make it,
so I can get home quick

488
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,497
and smack my wife in the eye.
- Shut up, Remer.

489
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,998
Shut your mouth!

490
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,958
Take that!

491
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:36,541
Aw shit!

492
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,147
My eye!

493
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,898
"If a woman wants a mate to respond,

494
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:15,909
she will reveal to him the secret
of a woman's duality.

495
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:19,196
She will tell him
about the interior woman,

496
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,405
that one who added to herself
makes two. "

497
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:26,493
I didn't expect you'd come.

498
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,203
I thought I'd say hi to little friend Joey.

499
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,542
He's sleeping, and
I really wanted to finish this book.

500
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:35,451
Well, maybe
it'll make him feel better. Joey!

501
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:43,382
Look who's here.
- My biological father?

502
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,003
No, Joe Cooper.

503
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,007
Is it really you?
- Yeah, it's me.

504
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,967
Your psych-outs
were the best.

505
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,848
Thanks, dude.

506
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:56,675
What's a "vajoina"?

507
00:40:58,017 --> 00:41:00,472
What seems to be the problem, guy?

508
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:03,553
I'm going to die.

509
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:07,181
We're all gonna die.
- Yeah, but not this week.

510
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,729
What about staying positive?
Your donor liver's arriving today.

511
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,526
Look what I brought you.

512
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:20,111
Wow, A LA-Z-BOY!
- Yeah, I made it myself.

513
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:23,150
If I had a nickel for every time
this ball pulled me out,

514
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,233
I'd have a shitload of nickels.

515
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,488
I wanna be just like you
when I grow up.

516
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:32,945
Here's your decaf mocha, Jenna.

517
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:37,617
Just like you take it: Non-fat milk, low-whipped
cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

518
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,910
Thank you, Doug.
- I baked you fresh poppyseed muffins, too.

519
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,875
Poppyseed muffins! I thought you had
your electrolysis appointment today.

520
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:52,005
I did. Here.

521
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:57,176
Listen, partner.

522
00:41:58,095 --> 00:42:03,431
I talked to the foundation.
They want to make your last wish...

523
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:07,720
They want to make your dream come true
as long as it doesn't

524
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,217
involve a miracle cure or something.

525
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:13,643
The guys on death row
only get a meal, right?

526
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:16,889
So, what's your dream?

527
00:42:17,314 --> 00:42:20,314
I've always dreamed
of big-game hunting,

528
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,686
killing an endangered species,
like a bald eagle

529
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,236
or a giant panda. - That's not
in the spirit of the foundation.

530
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,527
How about poisoning the reservoir?

531
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:34,943
Or throwing flesh-eating fish
into a public swimming pool?

532
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,524
I don't think you're getting the point.

533
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,326
Come on, Joey.

534
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:44,653
Search your heart. What's the one thing
you want more than anything else?

535
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,706
Chelsea Clinton?

536
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,951
That's a pretty tall order.
- You'd have a better shot at Bill.

537
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:56,541
Any backup dreams?

538
00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:58,290
There is one other thing.

539
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:01,835
Could I just once
hang out with the team?

540
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:05,257
Just spend a day with the Beers?
Could I, Coop?

541
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:09,712
I don't know...
- And Miss Reed, too.

542
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:33,267
This has been so fun. I feel like
I'm gonna puke all over the bar.

543
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:36,593
Look, Jerry Springer!

544
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:42,314
Here is your daughter-in-law...
- She's my son's wife.

545
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,765
Nicole! Let's say hi to Nicole.

546
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:50,733
We'll drink every time
a fight breaks out.

547
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:56,646
Fight!

548
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,536
Fight!

549
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:17,081
You see, Joey,
dreams really do come true.

550
00:45:32,138 --> 00:45:34,461
You're the best, Coop!

551
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,098
Man, it's late. We've got a game tonight
and you've got that big liver operation.

552
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,214
Yeah, but...

553
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:44,931
What, dude?
You're gonna be fine.

554
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:47,808
I know I could pull through, if...

555
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,052
If what, dude?
- Just say it and Coop will do it.

556
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:56,810
Do you think you could hit
a home run for me tonight? - Well...

557
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,151
It's not like he's asking you
to hit 2 home runs!

558
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,068
Can you hit 2 homeruns?
- Of course.

559
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:09,279
This is Coop Cooper. He could hit
3 home runs if you wanted. Huh, Coop?

560
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:15,282
3? Alright. - Remer, can I talk to you
over there real quick?

561
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:20,697
You know, Joey, I've hit my fair share
of homeruns, too.

562
00:46:21,124 --> 00:46:26,034
Nice, but Coop's gonna hit 3 home runs
for me. - Great, Joey.

563
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,544
Coop's the greatest guy
in the whole world!

564
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:31,338
Yeah, he's a major dude.

565
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,499
I feel much better now.

566
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:38,338
Mr. Squeak? - What?
- What grade are you in?

567
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:41,844
Anybody call a taxi?

568
00:46:42,262 --> 00:46:45,878
I called a taxi! - We gotta get going
if I'm gonna hit those 3 home runs.

569
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,843
Don't worry.
From now, everything's gonna be A-OK.

570
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:52,634
This is the best day
of my entire life.

571
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,728
What a story this is!

572
00:46:57,146 --> 00:47:01,889
Little Joey Thomas undergoing
a lifesaving operation tonight.

573
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:08,734
The fans here all wearing yellow ribbons
in support of this brave little boy.

574
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:13,776
And his hero, Joe Cooper,
promising to hit 3 home runs,

575
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:20,149
a promise that could decide between
life and death for this brave boy.

576
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:23,908
Hey, Pete!
What's the matter with Coop tonight?

577
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:27,115
I don't know,
but he smells like Christian Slater.

578
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:29,993
Coop getting ready
to take his shot.

579
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:35,166
It's good! Coop sinks his 2nd home run.

580
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:47,794
His blood sugar's way up since yesterday.
Has his fluid intake been changed?

581
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,209
His sodium level's through the roof!

582
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:55,462
It's strange. He's 8 years old
and smells like Robert Downey, Jr.

583
00:47:55,888 --> 00:47:57,168
9th inning.

584
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:02,009
Everyone's stomach in knots here,
as Coop steps up. One more chance

585
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:03,714
for that 3rd home run.

586
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:11,846
She's here, that girl from the bar.
- That's a guy.

587
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:15,686
A guy?
- A dude.

588
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,813
You're just saying that,
'cause you want her yourself.

589
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:24,109
I'm saying that, because she's a guy.
- It's impossible! Just look at her!

590
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,606
The cutest little upturned nose,

591
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:31,407
the softest lips,
the sweetest Adam's apple...

592
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,241
I can smell her perfume from here.

593
00:48:57,092 --> 00:48:58,750
Coop calls for quiet.

594
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:01,748
One more chance for that 3rd home run.

595
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,215
He's in deep focus.
This obviously means a lot to him.

596
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:13,591
He shoots! It's going, going...

597
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,384
Coop has made a dream
come true for that brave little...

598
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:28,732
Wow! The Lord must really have it in
for that little boy.

599
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:35,357
Why?

600
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:38,107
Come on, Coop. It's over.

601
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:39,611
Poor Joey!

602
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:43,282
Why? - Sorry, dude.
- If you're looking for Joey Thomas,

603
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:46,192
he's been moved next door.

604
00:49:50,373 --> 00:49:52,281
Oh, my God!

605
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:57,000
Why? Why?
- Gentlemen,

606
00:49:57,419 --> 00:49:58,414
in this room!

607
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:05,080
Joey! I'm here for you, dude!

608
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:10,250
The operation went fine. Just after
the game, he seemed to be suffocating.

609
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:15,633
He kept screaming, "Choke!" and lost
consciousness. He'll be fine tomorrow.

610
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,011
Don't stay too long.

611
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:22,680
Sorry
I missed that 3rd homerun.

612
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:27,469
Remember I said dreams come true.
Well, they don't.

613
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,595
He's trying to tell you something!

614
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:34,098
What is it, Joey?

615
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,850
He's turning blue!
- He's freezing. He needs a blanket.

616
00:50:39,276 --> 00:50:42,442
Sir, can I borrow your blanket?
- I'm here for you, Joey.

617
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:48,029
This should keep you warm.

618
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:51,778
He's flatlining!
You killed him!

619
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:56,410
I didn't kill him! - You missed
the 3rd home run, and you killed him.

620
00:50:56,995 --> 00:51:00,410
No! I'm not gonna give up on this kid!
- Calm down, man!

621
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:01,993
Come on!

622
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:04,242
Get a hold of yourself!
- Leave me alone!

623
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,992
Live, damn it!

624
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:11,960
What are you doing? - Where are those
paddle things George Clooney uses?

625
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:16,082
Give me those things!
- You're gonna kill him! - Clear!

626
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:21,504
No pulse!
- More power! - 10,000 volts!

627
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:30,012
15,000!

628
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:40,597
You know what you're doing?
- What's it look like? - An execution?

629
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:43,761
I'm trying to save a life.

630
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:46,266
I'm giving it all I've got, Captain!

631
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,223
I love ya, always have.

632
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:52,933
Clear!

633
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,687
We gotta try
open heart massage.

634
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,447
Scalpel! Where do I cut?

635
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:06,824
Code blue, nurse! 70 cc's
of sodium pentothal, stat!

636
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:10,035
I didn't kill him.
- Get outta here!

637
00:52:10,664 --> 00:52:12,703
Cardiac syringe coming through!

638
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:32,337
Jackson having an incredible night.

639
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,136
And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

640
00:52:37,638 --> 00:52:43,009
You have to wonder what
Charlie Hough is thinking, as Reggie...

641
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:49,592
...when man and beast
collide.

642
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:52,225
Death on the back roads
and byways of America!

643
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:09,728
I can't believe those assholes
taped over the game.

644
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,284
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

645
00:53:23,707 --> 00:53:26,908
I was just
fixing clam chowder.

646
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,410
Come in. - When you weren't
at the hospital, I came right over.

647
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:37,793
There was some terrorist attack
on the post-op ward. - Terrorists?

648
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:44,167
Yeah, they were disguised as baseketball
players. I was so worried...

649
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:47,878
about Joey.
- Was he...? Is he...?

650
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:51,673
Oh, he's fine. He came through
the operation with flying colors.

651
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:55,881
With that new liver he should be peeing
like a champ in no time.

652
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:57,767
That's kidneys, Coop.

653
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:01,675
Have a seat.

654
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:07,686
Thank you for all you've done for Joey.
- Oh, it's nothing.

655
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:11,938
He's going to remember this day
for the rest of his life.

656
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:14,229
I don't doubt that.

657
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:18,854
What a great picture!

658
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:23,822
Look at you guys. You seem so happy.
- I guess we were.

659
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:26,151
Best friends playing ball on the driveway.

660
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:30,655
Next thing I know,
I'm on ESPN and Wheaties boxes.

661
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,954
It's all pretty sweet,
but since Denslow's been gone,

662
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,872
I'm in charge of the team,
and the whole league now.

663
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:42,202
Sometimes I forget
why I play the game.

664
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:46,416
Why do you play it, Coop?
- Mr. October.

665
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:50,710
The guy in the Chippendales calendar?
- No, that was Dwayne Zackemore.

666
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:54,636
I mean,
whoever it was that month.

667
00:54:56,678 --> 00:55:01,884
I'm talking about Reggie Jackson.
He hit 3 home runs in one game.

668
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:04,630
I caught the 3rd one
in the stands.

669
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:08,390
It meant so much to me.
All I ever dreamed of was

670
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,846
to be that guy,
have that one shining moment.

671
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,146
Be a hero.
- You already are a hero, Coop.

672
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,148
You've won
these kids' hearts, but...

673
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,765
What?

674
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:27,486
I'm just worried about getting attached.
I mean, the kids getting attached.

675
00:55:27,905 --> 00:55:31,604
I don't want them to be hurt.
- Jenna,

676
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,988
I would never do anything to hurt...
these kids.

677
00:55:37,244 --> 00:55:42,484
What Joey really needs to know is:
Where will you be next year?

678
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,997
Right here.

679
00:55:45,415 --> 00:55:48,250
And the next year,
and the year after that.

680
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:52,709
Until Joey grows up,

681
00:55:54,337 --> 00:55:59,127
and gets his driver's license
and starts going out with girls

682
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:04,924
and meets the right one and
forgets about baseketball altogether...

683
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,634
...goes home,
does some push-ups,

684
00:56:12,056 --> 00:56:15,802
fucks the sleeve
of his favorite jacket. - What?

685
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,883
I'm just saying, we'll be here
for Joey. I promise.

686
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:23,430
Oh, Coop,
I want to believe you...

687
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:27,891
Coop, check out
this cool shit we got at the hospital...

688
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,189
Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Doug.

689
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:33,561
You're a little flushed. You have a temperature?
- No, I'm fine.

690
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:36,522
Open your blouse
and say "Ahh".

691
00:56:36,945 --> 00:56:40,360
I gotta go. - No...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

692
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:48,406
Thanks a lot, Dr. Dickhead. You totally
fucked me there. - It was a joke.

693
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:51,827
Give it up! She doesn't like you.
- She has the hots for you?

694
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,953
Squeak has a better chance.

695
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:57,491
You think?
- That's low. - Why is that low?

696
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:02,576
Right now you're jealous, but don't
blame me for my sweet ass.

697
00:57:05,546 --> 00:57:08,712
I'm doing the Happy Dance...

698
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,454
Does this thing work?

699
00:57:12,883 --> 00:57:14,792
Can you hear me on this?
- Yeah, check it out.

700
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:16,677
Asshole!

701
00:57:18,303 --> 00:57:21,469
Wanna get a sandwich?
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.

702
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:23,430
Goddam!

703
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:29,349
Mr. Cain, Doug Remer is here to see you.
- Remer? I asked him to come tomorrow.

704
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:34,096
Yes, sir, but he's here now
in the trophy room. - The trophy room?

705
00:57:38,148 --> 00:57:39,974
Sweet.

706
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,910
I see you've been admiring
my museum. - Is that really...?

707
00:58:06,332 --> 00:58:08,738
Yes. When I see something I want,
I get it.

708
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:12,415
Remind me to show you
the prize in the collection:

709
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:15,586
My autographed Ty Cobb bat.

710
00:58:17,255 --> 00:58:19,163
I'm planning to expand the museum.

711
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:23,711
Killer set-up, Mr. Cain. What do you pay
in rent? - Nothing. I own it.

712
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,759
Can you break a 20?
- What? Dollars? - I didn't think so!

713
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:33,009
Let me get straight to the point, Don.
May I call you Don? - Yeah.

714
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:36,965
When I see one of baseketball's stars
with less than $20 in his pocket,

715
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:41,055
driving an American car,
sharing a house with 2 other guys,

716
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:44,762
you know what that says to me?
- Homos?

717
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:49,349
No! It says you're underappreciated
and underpaid!

718
00:58:50,399 --> 00:58:54,312
Yeah, I guess we are underpaid.
- I want to change all that.

719
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:58,683
Players of your caliber should be making
the big bucks. Don't you agree?

720
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:05,986
Try to stay with me, alright?

721
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:11,069
I tried to get Coop to agree to changes
that would make you millions.

722
00:59:11,495 --> 00:59:13,286
Me? Millions?
- Now listen carefully.

723
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:16,953
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

724
00:59:17,373 --> 00:59:21,500
Hardly. He did it by moving to L.A.
Know how much he makes now?

725
00:59:22,252 --> 00:59:27,374
As much as at college?
- What? A lot more! Big money.

726
00:59:27,796 --> 00:59:30,334
And you can, too.
- Would I have quit baseketball?

727
00:59:30,757 --> 00:59:33,709
What? No! I need you
to get Coop to go along.

728
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:35,876
He'd have to quit baseketball, too?

729
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:42,136
Did I just fart?

730
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:54,930
Top of the 7th.
Those cheers you're hearing

731
00:59:55,354 --> 01:00:00,559
are from the nearly 15,000 on hand
for "Anal Probe Night".

732
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:06,018
2 outs. Remer heading for the
triple square. He's 0 for 12 tonight.

733
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:11,353
With the exception of Coop,
the Beers are ice-cold.

734
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,195
Oh, man! That doesn't even
qualify as an air ball!

735
01:00:15,617 --> 01:00:18,284
The Beers are gone
in the 7th.

736
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:23,326
The Aliens coming up with the top
of their order, the same 3 guys

737
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:25,618
who came up last inning.

738
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:29,453
What the hell's going on?
You guys are lying down out there!

739
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,329
I get it. You guys are pissed off.

740
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:34,335
Why?

741
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:39,588
You turned down Cain's offer
without talking to us.

742
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:46,797
What do you want, dude?
- What do you think?

743
01:00:47,218 --> 01:00:50,467
We invented this game together,
but you get to control everything.

744
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:53,637
Denslow gave me the team.
I already told Cain no.

745
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:57,755
Denslow's happy in his worm farm...
- Dude, I'm not gonna do it.

746
01:00:58,183 --> 01:01:01,265
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

747
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:05,384
No, in college. Everybody knows that.
It's not about the money.

748
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,551
It's about tradition.

749
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:10,933
Think about the greats
who have played this game.

750
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,599
It's because of them and us that I can't
bow down to a guy like Cain.

751
01:01:17,028 --> 01:01:21,568
It's easy for you. You got the team.
We got jack shit! Even Squeak's pissed!

752
01:01:21,988 --> 01:01:23,447
I never really minded...
- Shut up, bitch!

753
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:27,861
Dude, quit thinking about yourself!
- Dude, I'm not gonna cave in!

754
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:29,528
Dude?

755
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:41,416
I guess you've got a point there.
Alright, maybe I was wrong.

756
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,999
From now on, we're full partners.
- Really?

757
01:01:46,044 --> 01:01:50,586
You all own part of the team, too.
- Really? You do that for us?

758
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:53,626
And that's not all:
Prime equity stock options,

759
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,539
comprehensive health care,
full dental, traveling H.M.O.

760
01:01:56,967 --> 01:02:01,213
And 20 weeks of psychiatric care
free of charge. Like it should be.

761
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:30,315
Hey, Smits!
Wanna see a scary face?

762
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:37,400
What?
- Dude...

763
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:49,366
"There were four of them in the corral:
The once-proud beast, the broken girl,

764
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,780
her mother, and, finally, the man
they called The Whisperer.

765
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:56,570
The woman stared hopefully

766
01:03:56,997 --> 01:04:01,822
into the ancient cowboy's weathered face.
'Can you help her? '

767
01:04:02,249 --> 01:04:05,166
'I repair cows, not people. '

768
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:08,502
His disjointed voice seemed... "

769
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:14,245
The Beers win
their 10th consecutive game...

770
01:04:14,674 --> 01:04:16,582
Who's this bimbo
Coop's got the hots for?

771
01:04:17,009 --> 01:04:20,589
Jenna Reed, the director
of some kids' charity,

772
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:23,252
"Dream Come True Foundation. "

773
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,710
I know 6 men on their board.

774
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:31,218
Baxter Cain is not going quietly
into the good night. - Baxter?

775
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:33,017
Who is Ty Cobb?

776
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:36,304
Oh, my God!
- Did I just fart?

777
01:04:58,116 --> 01:05:01,235
9th inning, the Beers are just one out away
from making the play-offs.

778
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:06,071
They'll have to get by Big Ed Tuttle
and the L.A. Riots.

779
01:05:06,996 --> 01:05:11,159
That's him, Squeak. That's Tuttle.
- He's been talking shit about you.

780
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:15,199
He told everyone he caught you
jacking off before the game.

781
01:05:15,626 --> 01:05:17,784
He saw that?

782
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,245
You oughta get this guy.

783
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,916
Look at him, man... he's huge!
You want me to psych him out?

784
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:29,206
He'll never expect it.
- Here, say this...

785
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,715
I'm not gonna remember all that!
- This is for the play-offs.

786
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:37,798
If you get this guy, we're in.

787
01:05:38,222 --> 01:05:40,096
We've got your back.

788
01:06:00,945 --> 01:06:04,892
You mother's deaf. - My mother
is dead, you little twerp!

789
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,409
So that's why
she didn't move around a lot.

790
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:15,618
Unbelievable! The Beers win!

791
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:19,111
The Beers have done it.

792
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:34,789
The Beers win a spot in the play-offs
on a psych-out by Squeak Scolari.

793
01:06:39,092 --> 01:06:40,337
He is pissed.

794
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:46,304
I didn't go over the line, did I?
- Not at all. - Don't worry!

795
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,677
Hey, you missed it! We won!
- We kicked ass! We're in the play-offs!

796
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:59,639
Yeah, let the tears come.
You're gonna make me start crying.

797
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:03,647
This is really emotional.
- Should we just cry?

798
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:08,013
We should. We won the game,
got friends, we've got everything!

799
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:12,391
Stop that! I'm not crying,
because I'm happy.

800
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,610
Our funding's been cut.
They're gonna close the foundation.

801
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,731
Can they do that?

802
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:26,282
Poor kids! We can't let this happen.
- We gotta do something.

803
01:07:26,703 --> 01:07:31,660
Sorry. I didn't mean to come here
and ruin your big night...

804
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,113
Sorry.

805
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,034
Jenna, wait!

806
01:07:38,252 --> 01:07:41,418
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation with Miss Reed.

807
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:44,707
What are you doing here?
- I jet here, I jet there.

808
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:47,004
There's no reason

809
01:07:47,424 --> 01:07:51,468
for your girlfriend's foundation
to go into Chapter 11...

810
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:55,383
I think I may have a solution
to her problem. There!

811
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:59,295
A time-tested moneymaker.
Every athlete does it.

812
01:07:59,723 --> 01:08:02,010
You want me to have bigger titties?
- What?

813
01:08:02,433 --> 01:08:03,713
No!

814
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:06,595
It's a clothing line.

815
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:08,429
A Beers clothing line.

816
01:08:08,854 --> 01:08:11,557
That's against the baseketball bylaws.

817
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:15,348
Not if the proceeds go to charity.
Think about it.

818
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:18,443
Miss Reed's foundation
will never worry about funding again.

819
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:21,775
Awesome! We should do it!

820
01:08:22,194 --> 01:08:23,736
Excuse us.

821
01:08:24,154 --> 01:08:28,066
Let me do the talking. No way I'm doing
a deal with this piece of shit.

822
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,276
I thought it was "we".
It's not just up to you anymore.

823
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,827
Alright, we can come up
with a better way. - Like how?

824
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:39,989
Thought so.

825
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:44,078
Mr. Cain? As part owner of the Beers,
I'd like to say: Where do I sign?

826
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,119
Congratulations, Don,
this is gonna change your life.

827
01:08:47,543 --> 01:08:51,207
I look out for my "wimmins".
- Before we discuss fabric or color,

828
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:53,787
we decide where to make this stuff cheap.

829
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:57,415
We'll do a big media blitz.
Don't worry. Coop will come around.

830
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:29,022
Hi there. I'm Dan Patrick.
- And I'm Kenny Mayne.

831
01:09:29,443 --> 01:09:34,945
With the first 7 months out of the way,
the play-off picture is now emerging:

832
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:37,521
With last night's victory over Boston

833
01:09:37,948 --> 01:09:43,153
the Beers must beat Indianapolis
to advance to Charlotte,

834
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:47,655
then to the National Eastern
Division North to play Tampa.

835
01:09:48,078 --> 01:09:50,070
If the Beers beat Detroit
and Denver beats Atlanta

836
01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:55,074
in the S.W. Division East Northern,
then Milwaukee goes to the Denslow Cup,

837
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,867
unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo
and Charlotte ties Toronto.

838
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:01,534
Then Oakland would play L.A.
And Pittsburgh.

839
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:06,289
If no clear winner emerges,
a two-man sack race will be held

840
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:08,540
till a champion is crowned.

841
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,889
After the gruelling
regular BASEketball season,

842
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:29,352
we're now in month 9
of the play-offs.

843
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:32,517
No, Daddy, don't touch me there!

844
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,644
The Beers, vying for a slot
in the Denslow Cup. 9th inning.

845
01:10:40,068 --> 01:10:41,975
Ferries up by one, Coop steps in.

846
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,107
Home run!
Coop ties it up.

847
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,199
That could mean extra innings.

848
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:18,462
Who's he? - My entertainment lawyer
for my movie contract.

849
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:22,499
Now you're a big shot you're gonna
act in a Hollywood movie?

850
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:28,796
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

851
01:11:50,859 --> 01:11:53,064
Beers win!

852
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:59,400
The Beers have done it.
They're on their way to the Denslow Cup.

853
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,830
Who is that?
- Who's it look like?

854
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,241
Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

855
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,999
Hello! Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

856
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:30,501
What's that?
- It's a commitment ring.

857
01:12:30,924 --> 01:12:32,086
For Jenna?

858
01:12:32,509 --> 01:12:36,457
Yeah, I'm ready to consider
thinking about dating her exclusively.

859
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,257
I'm giving Jenna
a pre-commitment ring,

860
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,763
to promise to pledge we'll get engaged
as soon as we make a commitment.

861
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:46,139
You don't care about Jenna!

862
01:12:46,558 --> 01:12:50,471
You were in a hot tub with a Playmate.
- You know what?

863
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,597
That hurts, man. My clothing line
is saving Jenna's foundation.

864
01:12:56,022 --> 01:13:00,683
Sorry, I forgot how much Doug Remer
cares about kids. - Gentlemen!

865
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:07,486
Hate to interrupt your celebration,
but this might interest you.

866
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:14,948
Go ahead, don't be shy. Open it.
I think you'll find it interesting.

867
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:19,695
What's that old saying? - "A penny saved
is a penny earned"? "Don't eat cheese... "

868
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,365
Shut up!

869
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:26,827
How about "One picture is worth
1,000 words"? - That's a good one!

870
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:30,000
What low life scum
would use children this way?

871
01:13:30,418 --> 01:13:31,532
You would!

872
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:33,955
Me? Never!

873
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:39,288
Gentlemen, those are pictures
of the Beers clothing line

874
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,501
in Calcutta.
- Oh, just great.

875
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:48,712
If they ever get out, the Beers and
the foundation will be ruined.

876
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:52,675
But rest assured. No reason to panic.

877
01:13:53,098 --> 01:13:57,889
Those pictures never have to see
the light of day, if...

878
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,135
If what?

879
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:08,097
If you two
miss the next Beers game.

880
01:14:08,523 --> 01:14:11,772
The next game is the Denslow Cup.
- You've been reading the papers.

881
01:14:12,193 --> 01:14:14,647
Do as I say. Play ball,

882
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:18,401
and you'll be just fine. - You said
you didn't want us to play ball.

883
01:14:19,322 --> 01:14:21,990
I want you to play ball with me.

884
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,115
You want us to play for Dallas?

885
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:33,997
You don't want us to show up at all!
- Of course. It's called blackmail!

886
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:35,826
Good evening!

887
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,367
I told you
this was going to happen!

888
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:47,878
If you'd have agreed to Cain's changes
it never would have.

889
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:53,669
Because of you the foundation's screwed.
- Me? - Oh, there you are!

890
01:14:54,634 --> 01:14:56,507
I saw the pictures.

891
01:14:57,553 --> 01:15:01,880
This is awful! It means the end
of the foundation. It's not endowed

892
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:06,171
like...
- Jenna, I can explain.

893
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,007
Yes, it was his fault.

894
01:15:09,434 --> 01:15:13,976
It's your mess, Remer. I should've kept
the team. - Dude... - Enough!

895
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:19,272
Look at yourselves! You're just typical
men with humongous egos!

896
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,267
The kids' lives

897
01:15:21,692 --> 01:15:25,439
are ruined, and all you can do is argue
about who has the bigger penis.

898
01:15:25,861 --> 01:15:27,484
I mean, child.

899
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:29,852
Long wanger...

900
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:31,484
Throbbing cock...

901
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:35,855
I don't know anymore. - Jenna, wait!
- You've gotta believe us!

902
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:38,441
It was all Coop's fault!

903
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:43,241
Can we talk over there?
Pig fucker? Can I call you that?

904
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:45,904
No, only my friends call me pig fucker.

905
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:56,336
Know what? You're not my best friend
anymore. How do you like that?

906
01:15:56,754 --> 01:16:00,003
I love it.
- Good. I'm glad.

907
01:16:00,882 --> 01:16:03,797
I'm sick of playing
second fiddle to you.

908
01:16:04,216 --> 01:16:06,707
I'm getting myself
a new best friend.

909
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:11,918
Wake up, bitch. You're my best friend.
- Really? What?

910
01:16:12,346 --> 01:16:13,721
Are we going to the zoo?

911
01:16:14,181 --> 01:16:18,806
Fine! I don't need you. I'll get myself
a new best friend, too.

912
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:23,471
Go ahead. Go back to your fancy cars,
big bank accounts

913
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:27,227
your celebrity friends,
and your beautiful women

914
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:30,812
and Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

915
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:33,473
Fuck!

916
01:16:33,818 --> 01:16:36,853
Your life
is spinning out of control.

917
01:16:37,278 --> 01:16:42,068
Seems the whole world
is out to get you.

918
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:44,695
Everything is wrong.

919
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:47,901
Nothing seems right.

920
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:52,492
There's a sinking feeling inside.

921
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:57,038
Even your best friend
has turned his back.

922
01:16:57,456 --> 01:17:00,409
But you can't let it
bring you down.

923
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:03,158
You gotta fight.

924
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:09,038
'Cause you try,
but you can't let go.

925
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:12,959
It's when you're down
that you gotta get up.

926
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:16,051
Don't let 'em walk all over your face!

927
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:18,127
Stand up for yourself

928
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:21,837
and make everything right again!

929
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:25,003
Even if some guy's trying
to blackmail you.

930
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:28,135
And your girlfriend thinks
you suck.

931
01:17:28,558 --> 01:17:33,716
It's up to you to let them know
it was some rich guy's evil plan.

932
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:36,892
Look out ahead,
there's a truck changing lanes.

933
01:17:37,313 --> 01:17:40,230
You've got crumbs on your upper lip.

934
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:45,688
Warts on your dick aren't going away,
less you start using cream every day.

935
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,229
Ladies and gentlemen,

936
01:17:50,654 --> 01:17:55,030
welcome to Calcutta. It is currently
95 degrees with a light drizzle.

937
01:17:55,449 --> 01:17:58,118
We hope you enjoy your stay
in lovely Calcutta.

938
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:08,163
I'm in a hurry!

939
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:11,996
Just take me to 7-1-1...

940
01:18:18,087 --> 01:18:19,664
Beerswear Factory.

941
01:18:20,088 --> 01:18:21,962
Hey, you!
- No entrance.

942
01:18:22,382 --> 01:18:24,539
Who the hell are you?
- I factory manager. Who you?

943
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:29,792
I Joe Cooper. I mean, I'm Joe Cooper.
- Wait, put on a hard hat!

944
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:36,090
This isn't good.
Do the authorities know?

945
01:18:43,644 --> 01:18:47,225
A young man. His whole life
in front of him disappears.

946
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:51,429
A familiar story,
but this is no ordinary Joe.

947
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:55,433
Joseph R. Cooper, the most loved
sports figure in the country...

948
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,890
vanished.

949
01:18:57,736 --> 01:19:01,778
Elsie Melcher, a neighbor
who asked not to be identified, says

950
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,651
Joe Cooper left his house
2 weeks ago.

951
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:08,276
According to Angelique Bones,
a nosy bitch who lives up the street,

952
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:11,486
he took only a toothbrush,
a wallet, a steamer trunk

953
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,949
and a plane ticket
to Calcutta.

954
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:17,407
Police have several possible scenarios
of what happened

955
01:19:17,831 --> 01:19:20,949
to the man affectionately known
to the world as "Coop".

956
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,495
I don't know where he is. He could be
hanging in his closet. - Scenario 1:

957
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,077
He's hanging in his closet.

958
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:37,879
The night before his disappearance,
Coop's girlfriend paid him a visit.

959
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:39,629
They quarreled.

960
01:19:40,052 --> 01:19:43,965
You'll find Joe Cooper, wherever
you'll find the most heinous

961
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:47,720
and vile exploitation of children.

962
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:52,053
Scenario 2:
Coop went to Disney World.

963
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:59,229
Here's a photograph taken just days
before his disappearance.

964
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:04,603
Here's a computer-enhanced simulation
of what he might look like today.

965
01:20:06,943 --> 01:20:11,022
From Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
it's the Denslow Cup,

966
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:13,817
where the defending champion,
the Dallas Felons,

967
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,239
meet their perennial challengers,
the Milwaukee Beers.

968
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:20,611
Hello, I'm Al Michaels
along with Bob Costas inviting you

969
01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:23,821
to join us here at Beers Garden
for Denslow Cup V.

970
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:26,486
We're in for a classic battle tonight.

971
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:32,367
You're right. We have over 100 million
people tuned in to see this game.

972
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:35,364
Many of them, of course,
with no understanding of the sport,

973
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:39,706
but fascinated by the flickering images
and the pretty colors.

974
01:20:40,129 --> 01:20:45,335
High up in the stands,
pyrotechnic expert Sergio "Lucky" Ferouch

975
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:49,291
is readying another spectacular
halftime fireworks display.

976
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:52,090
Alright, guys.
You ready to kick some ass?

977
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:59,929
What's wrong? Why the long faces?
- Can't win without Coop.

978
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,184
We don't need Coop.
I'll lead you to victory.

979
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:06,388
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.

980
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:10,855
Even if Coop was to walk in here now,
it wouldn't change things one iota.

981
01:21:11,273 --> 01:21:14,189
We can win this thing!
Are you with me?

982
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:16,896
That's the spirit! Are you with me?

983
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:19,689
Coop's here!

984
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:28,235
We're underway here
for the Denslow Cup V.

985
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:58,966
A stunned crowd of over 18,000
witnessing the Beers...

986
01:21:59,385 --> 01:22:01,175
Come on, Beers! Go, Coop!

987
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:04,629
Hey, guys. Thought I told you
we weren't going to watch this game.

988
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:07,093
Miss Reed, it's the Denslow Cup!

989
01:22:07,515 --> 01:22:10,964
These aren't the kind of people
to be emulated.

990
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:14,344
The severed head
was postmarked Denver.

991
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:16,808
The owner still
has not stepped forward.

992
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:20,678
Update: The disappearance of
the Milwaukee Beers baseketball star.

993
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:24,888
When Joe Cooper discovered that
Beerswear Factory workers were kids,

994
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:28,648
not old enough for prostitution,
he personally flew there.

995
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:32,071
His new, all-adult workforce
now makes a decent wage,

996
01:22:32,487 --> 01:22:37,064
enjoys full medical benefits
and in-house child care. We are glad

997
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:39,612
that such a terrific human being
like Joe Cooper has returned.

998
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:42,440
If I were a woman,
I'd like to be his girlfriend,

999
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:46,401
walking in the park,
hand in hand,

1000
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:49,533
wrapping my legs around him,
cuddling in the spoon position

1001
01:22:49,956 --> 01:22:54,034
and staring into his eyes
over our morning coffee.

1002
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:55,833
Yes, thank you.

1003
01:22:56,251 --> 01:23:00,912
In a minute, another unsolved mystery.
- Come on, kids!

1004
01:23:01,338 --> 01:23:03,495
We're going to the game!

1005
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:07,462
Ladies and gentlemen!
For the 7th-inning entertainment,

1006
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:11,334
the National Baseketball League
is proud to present

1007
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,250
a salute to our South Sea neighbors:
Viva Calypso!

1008
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,256
We're up 16 to nothing. Have the trucks
pull up to the locker room.

1009
01:23:22,683 --> 01:23:25,767
We'll sort out the stuff
when we get to Jacksonville.

1010
01:23:26,186 --> 01:23:30,347
Hey, Baxter?
I finally got all the chrome off this for you.

1011
01:23:30,771 --> 01:23:33,807
Nice.
- You want me to start on this one?

1012
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:36,398
Ladies and gentlemen,

1013
01:23:36,817 --> 01:23:39,816
please direct your attention to the
Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust,

1014
01:23:40,235 --> 01:23:44,860
symbol of brotherhood in many
Polynesian countries. In the role

1015
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:50,734
of the downtrodden but happy natives:
Your Milwaukee Beers!

1016
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:55,285
Thanks for flying back, Coop.
You really made a difference!

1017
01:23:55,703 --> 01:23:58,027
If not for your mess,
I wouldn't be jetlagged

1018
01:23:58,454 --> 01:24:00,530
and shitting curry.
- Guys, knock it off!

1019
01:24:01,165 --> 01:24:04,118
Representing their white
colonial oppressors:

1020
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:07,826
The Dallas Felons.
Now let's all join

1021
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:11,750
our Caribbean brothers
in the ceremonial handshake

1022
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:14,661
above the Lagoon of Peace.
- Let go!

1023
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:17,335
Stop it!

1024
01:24:17,758 --> 01:24:18,789
Guys!

1025
01:24:19,217 --> 01:24:21,790
Stop it!
- Money-grubber! - Powermonger!

1026
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:40,426
Die!
- Asshole!

1027
01:24:40,854 --> 01:24:42,811
Would you just stop it?

1028
01:24:44,357 --> 01:24:47,772
Look at you guys, fighting
on the Malaka-Laka board!

1029
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:50,689
You should be ashamed!

1030
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:54,104
Back in the driveway
we were nothing.

1031
01:24:54,696 --> 01:24:56,356
Now we've risen to the highest level,

1032
01:24:57,823 --> 01:25:00,313
but you're throwing it all away.

1033
01:25:00,741 --> 01:25:03,410
If you've forgotten
what baseketball means to America,

1034
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:06,317
you have only to look at this board,

1035
01:25:06,745 --> 01:25:09,282
the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust.

1036
01:25:09,705 --> 01:25:11,412
Don't you see
what we have here?

1037
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:13,870
A game
where guys with bad backs

1038
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:17,284
and bad knees
can get together and compete

1039
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:20,034
as guys who are goosed up on steroids.

1040
01:25:21,545 --> 01:25:23,253
But more than anything,

1041
01:25:23,672 --> 01:25:27,288
isn't this game about being with
your friends and having a good time?

1042
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,710
I remember...

1043
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:35,793
A long time ago,
I didn't have anybody.

1044
01:25:36,846 --> 01:25:39,004
You guys took me in.

1045
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:41,798
That's why it kills me
to see you like this.

1046
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:49,137
If we can't be friends, then the heart
and soul are out of this game.

1047
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,428
Certainly out of me.

1048
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:55,471
I know I'll never get that back again.

1049
01:25:57,525 --> 01:26:01,271
We have sullied the waters
of the Lagoon of Peace.

1050
01:26:01,694 --> 01:26:02,974
I'm begging you,

1051
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:08,939
for the love of our Caribbean brothers,
stop this madness!

1052
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:23,611
Hang on! - Oh, my God! - Remember
to hold your breath just before we hit.

1053
01:26:27,876 --> 01:26:31,919
It is the most spectacular extravaganza
I have ever seen.

1054
01:26:32,337 --> 01:26:35,420
You can cram 3 seats into the space
it takes for one wheelchair.

1055
01:26:35,839 --> 01:26:38,376
Not to mention the wasted space
for the oxygen bottle!

1056
01:26:38,799 --> 01:26:41,669
Those little shits never pay
full price anyway.

1057
01:26:42,093 --> 01:26:44,548
I just realized
I can't stand you!

1058
01:26:45,928 --> 01:26:47,801
You can kiss these puppies goodbye.

1059
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:58,096
Shit, Coop. I'm sorry. I guess
the money did go to my head.

1060
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:00,891
No, I'm sorry, Remer.

1061
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:04,265
I've got a lot to learn
about sharing.

1062
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:07,226
Look at me!
I've become everything I used to hate.

1063
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:10,519
Maybe we
just grew up too fast.

1064
01:27:10,943 --> 01:27:13,812
My worst enemy turned out to be me.

1065
01:27:15,237 --> 01:27:16,647
Dude!

1066
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:25,649
I've got two over.

1067
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,824
Alright!
Let's go win the championship!

1068
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:20,309
Hey, that's my wife.
- And this is me!

1069
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:51,327
What is it? - I hear
your sister's going out with Squeak.

1070
01:28:57,590 --> 01:29:00,209
Squeak Scolari
crosses the plate again

1071
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:03,123
as the Beers have come
roaring back since the break.

1072
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:06,124
This is more like the Beers team
we've seen all season.

1073
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,885
9th inning.
Beers still down by 2 runs.

1074
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:12,261
Felons on 1st and 3rd.

1075
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:15,884
The Beers have to stop Dallas
if they want to stay in this game.

1076
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,466
The always dangerous Grumsky coming up.

1077
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:23,684
Get this guy. - I don't know what to do.
Nothing works on him.

1078
01:29:25,523 --> 01:29:29,056
Tell him he's fat.
- That's not cool.

1079
01:29:29,483 --> 01:29:32,151
No, just do it really subtle.

1080
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:33,731
Subtle...

1081
01:29:35,112 --> 01:29:36,902
You losing weight?

1082
01:29:37,863 --> 01:29:40,697
You're goddam fucking fat...

1083
01:29:46,576 --> 01:29:49,327
The Beers hold them on the 9th
on a clutch psych-out

1084
01:29:49,745 --> 01:29:51,654
by Coop Cooper.

1085
01:29:57,249 --> 01:30:01,542
Bottom of the 9th.
Dallas 16, Milwaukee 14.

1086
01:30:01,961 --> 01:30:04,248
Remer on 2nd,
Scolari on 3rd.

1087
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,911
Coop's coming up.

1088
01:30:08,423 --> 01:30:12,833
It all comes down to this. One shot.
If Coop makes it,

1089
01:30:13,259 --> 01:30:16,543
the Beers win the Cup
and get to keep the team.

1090
01:30:17,387 --> 01:30:19,959
Or he misses.

1091
01:30:39,441 --> 01:30:43,140
Oh, my God!
LA-Z-BOY has popped!

1092
01:30:49,697 --> 01:30:54,274
The ball Coop has used every day.
A time-out has been called,

1093
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:58,910
as the Beers star
tries to regroup. - Excuse me,

1094
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:03,075
think you could go any faster?
- Can I go any faster?

1095
01:31:04,747 --> 01:31:06,205
Hang on!

1096
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:18,958
The loss of this ball is going to affect
the outcome of this game.

1097
01:31:26,886 --> 01:31:29,340
Come on, kids!

1098
01:31:29,763 --> 01:31:33,544
Just one shot! You can do it!
We can win this thing.

1099
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,807
Stop! Don't shoot!

1100
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:43,682
Here. I brought this for you.

1101
01:31:44,354 --> 01:31:49,098
I made it myself. Just like you.
- You made this?

1102
01:31:49,523 --> 01:31:51,729
Miss Reed helped me for most of it.

1103
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:53,774
But I finished it myself.

1104
01:31:54,193 --> 01:31:56,684
Joey, this is great.

1105
01:31:57,612 --> 01:32:01,229
Coop, you know what
Miss Reed told me tonight?

1106
01:32:02,823 --> 01:32:06,073
She said she wants me
to be a big sports star.

1107
01:32:07,326 --> 01:32:09,365
Just like Joe Cooper.

1108
01:32:22,919 --> 01:32:26,416
Thanks, dude!
- Go get 'em, Coop!

1109
01:32:32,258 --> 01:32:36,336
When's the last time you made a
homerun without LA-Z-BOY?

1110
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:51,476
Al, we've seen some classic
Denslow Cup battles in the past,

1111
01:32:51,894 --> 01:32:56,934
but I can't remember one that rivalled
the drama and excitement of this one.

1112
01:33:06,778 --> 01:33:08,355
It's off the rim...

1113
01:33:08,779 --> 01:33:11,648
Could be a double play.
Darcy tips.

1114
01:33:14,032 --> 01:33:15,609
Jansen's try...

1115
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:17,064
No!

1116
01:33:18,743 --> 01:33:21,992
Beers have a shot at the conversion!
Remer keeps it alive!

1117
01:33:24,622 --> 01:33:25,487
Last chance...

1118
01:33:32,668 --> 01:33:35,123
Coop up!

1119
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,591
It's...

1120
01:33:46,342 --> 01:33:47,920
...good!

1121
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:29,282
In all my years of calling games
I've never been this excited.

1122
01:34:29,702 --> 01:34:32,487
You're excited?
Feel these nipples!

1123
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,490
Update: We still have no fucking clue
where this guy is.

1124
01:35:39,785 --> 01:35:41,657
Alright.

1125
01:35:42,453 --> 01:35:43,697
What is it?

1126
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,037
What is it?
- It's Reggie.

1127
01:35:50,582 --> 01:35:52,124
Reggie Jackson.

1128
01:35:56,295 --> 01:35:58,832
Well, go! Go ahead!

1129
01:36:10,469 --> 01:36:12,295
Nice going out there.

1130
01:36:12,721 --> 01:36:16,254
Thanks. You know I gotta tell you,
it's 'cause of you that I'm here.

1131
01:36:16,682 --> 01:36:17,925
That's nice to know.

1132
01:36:18,932 --> 01:36:20,391
I brought this for you!

1133
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:24,141
I saw some kid in the ballpark with it.
You gotta hang on to that.

1134
01:36:25,437 --> 01:36:27,227
I got the two home run balls I hit
in the World Series.

1135
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:30,514
Some little shit got the 3rd one.

1136
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:37,225
That sucks. I gotta get my trophy.
Let's have a hot dog sometime.

1137
01:36:37,652 --> 01:36:39,810
Alright, sounds good.

1138
01:36:40,237 --> 01:36:41,980
I don't have your fucking ball.

1139
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:49,158
Good luck next year.
- Oh, thanks!

1140
01:36:53,453 --> 01:36:54,532
Got milk?

1141
01:36:55,746 --> 01:36:56,860
I'm sorry.

1142
01:37:00,124 --> 01:37:04,499
The National Baseketball League
would like to present to the Beers

1143
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:08,831
With this year's Denslow Cup.
Congratulations!

1144
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:12,628
Take your victory lap.
As they skate off,

1145
01:37:13,048 --> 01:37:16,914
one thinks about a team that conquered
adversity, overcame the odds,

1146
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:22,466
a team that defied the critics,
a team that...

1147
01:37:22,804 --> 01:37:26,088
And so, the ideal of sports
once again blossomed

1148
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:29,846
from a tiny seed,
nurtured, as always,

1149
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:32,554
by the dreams of the young.

1150
01:37:32,976 --> 01:37:35,348
I'm the King of the World!
