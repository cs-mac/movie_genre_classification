1
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:40,010
THE FOLLOWING IS BASED
ON A TRUE STORY

2
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,514
Excuse me, sir.
You've come in the wrong way.

3
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:14,891
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,476
This is the old entrance.

5
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:18,353
The visitor's center's
back out and left.

6
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,522
All right... I'll
wander over there.

7
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,984
Well worth it. Been through
some amazing times.

8
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,044
<i>This nation should</i>
<i>commit itself...</i>

9
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:48,297
<i>to achieving the goal,</i>
<i>before this decade is out...</i>.

10
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:52,551
<i>of landing a man on the moon</i>
<i>and returning him safely.</i>

11
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,099
<i>Liftoff. The clock is running.</i>

12
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,528
<i>Godspeed, John Glenn.</i>

13
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,118
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

14
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:23,831
<i>To go to the moon in this decade</i>
<i>and do the other things...</i>

15
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,377
<i>not because they are easy,</i>
<i>but because they are hard</i>.

16
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:35,259
<i>Liftoff. Go control</i>

17
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,518
<i>Tminus 1 minute,</i>
<i>35 seconds and counting.</i>

18
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,019
<i>Ignition sequence start</i>

19
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,777
<i>Tower clear.</i>

20
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,571
<i>Apollo 9, you're go all the way</i>.

21
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,115
<i>Apollo 10, your trajectory</i>
<i>and guidance are go.</i>

22
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>Man is about to launch himself</i>
<i>on a trip to the moon.</i>

23
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>Neil Armstrong.</i>

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,872
<i>Edwin "Buzz'</i>'<i>Aldrin.</i>

25
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>Michael Collins.</i>

26
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,542
<i>Next stop for them, the moon.</i>

27
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,628
<i>The lunar age is about to begin.</i>

28
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,763
When the guy counts down...

29
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,808
the 3 astronauts will take off
in Apollo 11 for America.

30
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,770
The rocket will fly to the moon...

31
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,522
Landing module.

32
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,024
Landing module comes off
and lands.

33
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:41,029
The astronauts come out and get
shot my Martians with lasers!

34
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,031
- Damien.
- And their heads explode!

35
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,366
They they'll fly to
Earth and kill us!

36
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:46,493
That won't happen.

37
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,036
It might.

38
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:49,704
Next? Graeme.

39
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:52,956
Just a minute, Graeme.

40
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,876
- Melanie?
- I haven't done the moon landing.

41
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,294
Thank God.

42
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,923
I've made a model of the
telescope and dish in Parkes.

43
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,717
When Neil Armstrong lands
on the moon...

44
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:07,095
the world will be watching
television pictures...

45
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,306
from the radio telescope in Parkes.

46
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,184
Mr. Callen, the prime minister
wants to see you.

47
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:15,144
- Can it wait?
- I don't think so.

48
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,479
What's it about?

49
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:19,023
He just got off the phone
to the White House.

50
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:25,863
- Do you know who just phoned?
- No, sir.

51
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,073
The President of the U.S.A., Nixon.

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,366
I wasn't aware...

53
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:32,160
Thanking me for allowing NASA
to use our facility.

54
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,037
And something about an upgrade?

55
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,747
What was he talking about?

56
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:39,125
- There was a briefing...
- I don't read those bloody things.

57
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,921
- Are we raising this in the House?
- We should.

58
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:47,758
- What's this all about?
- Nixon referred to our telescope.

59
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:51,178
NASA requested its use
in the Apollo program...

60
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,138
originally as a backup receiver.

61
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,766
- Originally?
- They upgraded its role.

62
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,478
When Apollo 11 gets to the moon,
Parkes is the receiving station.

63
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:02,106
- Meaning?
- We've got the moonwalk.

64
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:05,566
The people at this place
know what they're doing?

65
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,860
- I believe so.
- Bloody well hope so.

66
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,279
Why'd they pick us?

67
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:13,324
It's the largest in the
Southern Hemisphere.

68
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:16,536
What's it doing in the middle
of sheep paddock?

69
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:28,255
<i>The Parkes telescope, or as</i>
<i>we call it, the Dish...</i>.

70
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:31,049
<i>will track Apollo 11's journey...</i>.

71
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:34,678
<i>gathering astronauts'signals,</i>
<i>telemetry from the spaceship...</i>

72
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:39,598
<i>and most important, the TV</i>
<i>signals from the moon itself.</i>

73
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,643
<i>It</i>'<i>s 210 feet in diameter,</i>
<i>weighs 1,000 tons.</i>...

74
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,523
<i>and</i> c<i>an point in al directions.</i>
<i>The most powerful in the world.</i>

75
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,153
Can I have their full names
and specific roles?

76
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:56,239
This is Ross Mitchell, responsible
for maneuvering the Dish.

77
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,868
Glenn Latham, in charge
of the electronics.

78
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,746
Glenn's a Sagittarius.
He enjoys knitting...

79
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,956
Mitch, don't write that.

80
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,875
From NASA, Al Burnett.

81
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,670
Al's here to get all signals
to mission control.

82
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,921
Enjoying your stay
in Australia, Al?

83
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,964
Very much.
The people are warm...

84
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:15,466
Great.

85
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:18,260
You, Cliff, what's your
official title?

86
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:21,054
Cliff Buxton, director.

87
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:22,306
Or the Dishmaster.

88
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,559
Now I'll add a few
personal details.

89
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:26,894
- Married?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,354
- Glenn?
- Fiancé, Janice Kellerman.

91
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,939
She's not. I don't have one.

92
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,816
Married. Two boys in Houston.

93
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,485
And you, Cliff?

94
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,489
Married.

95
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,407
And just finally...

96
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,659
I mean, no offense, but...

97
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:47,830
the Americans spent 10 years,
billions of dollars...

98
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:51,791
to watch man walk on the moon,
and it falls to you blokes.

99
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,672
How do you feel about that?

100
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,341
Much better before you
opened your trap.

101
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:04,387
We feel confident that we have the
expertise to complete our role.

102
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,388
But, Cliff...

103
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:08,974
it's amazing, isn't it?

104
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,687
Yes, it is amazing.

105
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:17,816
And so Australia becomes a vital
cog in this grand endeavor.

106
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,945
Early this morning...

107
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:24,906
I conveyed to President Nixon
my long-term interest...

108
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,284
and commitment to this project.

109
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,371
It will be one of the
proudest moments...

110
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:34,415
in Australia's scientific history.

111
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:40,004
And I've accepted the invitation
of the mayor of Parkes...

112
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:44,132
to be there on Monday
and witness firsthand...

113
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,094
our vital contribution.

114
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,639
That is an R.S.V.P.

115
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,349
The prime minister
coming to Parkes.

116
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,518
- I'll frame that.
- It's icing on the cake.

117
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,980
- Know why this means so much?
- It helps your political career.

118
00:08:58,313 --> 00:08:59,647
- No, Len.
- Oh, it doesn't, yeah.

119
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,942
The PM with the candidate.
Brown-nosing.

120
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,236
- Licking arse.
- No.

121
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:06,862
It's a vindication.

122
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:09,991
Oh, a vindication.

123
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:13,703
Of my campaign to get that
dish here in the first place.

124
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,371
That was an episode.

125
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,999
You know what people said
when I proposed Parkes?

126
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,752
You were grandstanding, it was a
stunt to big-note yourself.

127
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,045
Who said that?

128
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,884
They said I was a dreamer.

129
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:31,136
A visionary.

130
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,013
Yeah, that's right.

131
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,473
"Bob Mclntyre, you'll
never pull it off."

132
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,850
And now...

133
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:41,729
which town is part of
the Apollo 11 mission?

134
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:44,398
<i>Honeysuckle network, Net Two.</i>

135
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:47,860
<i>Confirm Parkes is up</i>
<i>and configured.</i>

136
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,237
<i>As Apollo 11's readied</i>
<i>for launch...</i>

137
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:54,365
<i>NASA is completing fibal checks</i>
<i>on its deep spa</i>c<i>e network:</i>

138
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:58,453
<i>The vast array of telescopes</i>
<i>and cable links...</i>

139
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,747
<i>including a number</i>
<i>in Australia...</i>

140
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:04,584
<i>with Apollo 11 on its</i>
<i>historic journey.</i>

141
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,545
The repeaters will send
signals to Sydney.

142
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:09,547
They strip the TV and
send it to Moree.

143
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:10,964
Both receivers.

144
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:12,215
Sorry. Go on.

145
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:16,595
The rest will go to a demodulator
at Honeysuckle Creek.

146
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:20,182
Can the telemetry feeds be
sent on separate lines?

147
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,308
Mitch?

148
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:22,601
Yeah, no problem.

149
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:24,478
Separate lines.

150
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:26,104
That's a big book, Al.

151
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,940
- Hold on.
- What is it?

152
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,234
These coordinates have changed.

153
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:34,779
- You sure?
- This is unacceptable.

154
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,156
Glenn? Come here.

155
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:39,742
What?

156
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,495
Every coordinate has been changed.

157
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,788
Yeah.

158
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,080
I changed them.

159
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,874
- You what?
- I changed them.

160
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,042
Why?

161
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,293
They were wrong.

162
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:52,295
- Why were they wrong?
- Don't know.

163
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,422
What about them was wrong?

164
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:59,219
The figures NASA sent us were
for the Northern Hemisphere.

165
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,514
We're in the Southern Hemisphere.

166
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:05,891
I can change them, but
you're pointing the wrong...

167
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,936
It might be a good idea
to tell us these things.

168
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:11,021
I didn't want to worry you.

169
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,233
Cup of tea, Al?

170
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,236
- No, thank you.
- I'll have one!

171
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,487
Thank you, Glenn.

172
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,407
- We must double-check.
- All of NASA's work.

173
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,244
Everyone's work, unless you
have a problem with that.

174
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,079
I don't have a problem with that.

175
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,789
- I got a problem.
- Okay, Mitch.

176
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,582
Let's get on with it.

177
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,961
I'll unstow the Dish.

178
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:39,923
Hi, Bob!

179
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:41,716
Bill!

180
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:45,845
Keith.

181
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:48,765
Major Mclntyre.

182
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,059
I'm a long time out of uniform.

183
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,894
But you fought a war.

184
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,397
- You'll get your chance.
- I hope so, sir.

185
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:58,941
- Kid's a cadet.
- Keen.

186
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,985
- Hello, Bob.
- How's it going, Pearl?

187
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:03,988
Busy as a bee.
The whole town's abuzz.

188
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,365
They'll talk about something
else soon.

189
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:09,785
I can't say, but we might
be getting a visitor.

190
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:11,245
The prime minister.

191
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,789
May phoned.
And the American ambassador.

192
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,249
That woman. Can you
keep it under your hat?

193
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:19,043
- I don't think so.
- Not to worry.

194
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:21,296
- How are the boys at the Dish?
- Raring to go.

195
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:24,590
- The American settling in?
- I think so.

196
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:27,552
Came in yesterday,
wanting pretzels.

197
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,720
Pretzels?

198
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,098
Yep, it's a world event.

199
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:34,516
The prime minister.

200
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:36,143
Better get a jiggle-on.

201
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:37,686
- See you later.
- See ya.

202
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:42,482
<i>The countdown at the Cape</i>
<i>is proceeding to schedule</i>.

203
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,570
<i>Now back to Cape Kennedy and</i>
<i>correspondent Fred Turner.</i>

204
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:49,947
<i>What impresses me is we've</i>
<i>got excellent weather.</i>

205
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:52,992
<i>It was predicted we'd</i>
<i>have some overcast...</i>

206
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,995
<i>and now we'll see the launch.</i>

207
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,877
The launch is going ahead tonight.

208
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:07,213
The ball is Friday night.
Can we get back to...?

209
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,716
Yeah. It got another surge.

210
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,187
I could rumba right now.

211
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:25,939
- I hope we have slow numbers.
- Yes, Mrs. Spiers.

212
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,525
And a new song.

213
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:29,735
Who's it by?

214
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,904
James Hendrix.

215
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:34,615
Let's hear a couple of bars.

216
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,880
There's a slower version.

217
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,758
- That's not to go above three.
- Yes, Mrs. Spiers.

218
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,511
- You learned the American anthem?
- The what?

219
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:01,056
Are you saying you've not
prepared the American anthem?

220
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,933
How does it go?

221
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,101
You've got 48 hours.

222
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:10,190
I knew it when he came.
NASA's renting the Dish.

223
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,026
But, how about some respect?

224
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:17,030
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- We're a professional unit.

225
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,697
You right?

226
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,241
Sorry, mate.

227
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,874
Still not flat enough.

228
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,251
I'll give it a tweak.

229
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,420
Drop it a couple of clicks.
Probably on NASA settings.

230
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,968
We're of the radio physics
department, not mugs at this game.

231
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:44,180
He asked me if we have
a dress standard.

232
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,224
That's hard to believe.

233
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,395
Wish he'd gone home with the
others. What's his problem?

234
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,355
He's just feeling the pressure.

235
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:56,608
The pressure.
He's got to learn to relax.

236
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,236
I'll tell you a little secret.

237
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:01,947
He's not the only one.

238
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:06,410
We got word from Houston.
It's go for launch.

239
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,501
Now the party can start.
Come on in.

240
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,754
Pick up the phone, and I yell
"Yeah, what?"

241
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,590
- You know who it was?
- The science minister.

242
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:22,967
Another devil on horseback?

243
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,386
- They've got families.
- It's extraordinary.

244
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:28,639
- I wouldn't let Don go to the moon.
- I understand.

245
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,890
How do you reckon they
go to the...

246
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,142
up there?

247
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,978
- I suppose they hold on.
- Four days?

248
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,272
- They're expecting the dance.
- It's a ball.

249
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:39,983
They don't eat meals, just pills.

250
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,235
You can't hold on for 4 days.

251
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:45,238
One of these would block
them up for a week.

252
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,906
<i>All is still go as we</i>
<i>monitor our status board.</i>

253
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,825
How's it looking?

254
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,994
It's full of liquid hydrogen.

255
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,289
- Can they fix that?
- No, that's go for launch.

256
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,582
Oh, hydrogen.

257
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,335
- About the prime minister.
- He'll be here on Monday.

258
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,919
- Would they lunch?
- In Melbourne.

259
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,379
Man on the moon, eh?

260
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,881
Yep, and we're a part of it, Dad.

261
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,885
But we're slap bang
in the middle of it.

262
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,262
There could be an announcement.

263
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,806
It's not official yet...

264
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,309
Bob's got the nomination
for Parkes.

265
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,311
- We're not telling anyone.
- What?

266
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,646
Bob's got the nomination
for Parkes.

267
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,441
Congratulations on
the nomination.

268
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,988
Bob, the nomination, well done.

269
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,239
May!

270
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,700
Dad, they're talking about Parkes.

271
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,243

Bigwig from NASA.

277
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:54,845
Dad looked after him. He's
the scientific representative.

Visitor entering compound.
Awaiting identification.

You're being stupid, Rudi.

324
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:30,005
- Visitor offering resistance.
- You've got a gun.

Official NASA requirement.
Armed security.

Does Mum know?

327
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,721
No, and don't tell her.
She'll come and take it.

328
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,933
- This is getting cold.
- I've got to sign you in.

329

- Morning, Mr. Burnett.
- Thank you, Janine.

334
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,491
Morning, Mitch.

335
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,119
- Hello, Glenn.
- Hi, Janine.

336
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,037
I put extra cheese in yours.

337
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,205
- Thanks, Janine.
- You tiger.

338
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,667
- How's Mum?
- Getting ready for the ball.

339
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,169
The whole town's over the moon.

340
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,383
It's so exciting.
The ambassador arrives tomorrow.

341
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,218
Over the moon.

342
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:21,805
The prime minister on Monday.
On the news they showed Parkes.

343
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:24,432
- They saw the Dish?
- Everyone's proud.

PKS. Roger, Houston.

346
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,526
Was that Armstrong?

347
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:37,486
No, we're not on-line now.

348
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,738
Sorry?

349
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:42,157
There's two tracking stations,
us and Goldstone.

350
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,492
- Goldstone?
- California.

351
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:47,621
If the moon's on our side of
the world, Parkes is on-line.

352
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,457
If it's on the other,
it's Goldstone.

353
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:51,833
Right, but...

354
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,836
Explain it, Glenn.

355
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,222
Imagine the Earth
is a basketball.

356
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,892
- This'll be good.
- And on top is a...

357
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:12,936
What do you put the pump into?

358
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:15,688
- The hole.
- But it's got a name.

359
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,524
The valve.
Say the valve's Goldstone.

360
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:22,320
- On the other side, another valve.
- Only have one.

361
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,113
What has two valves?

362
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:25,615
- Tuba?
- It must be round.

363
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:27,283
- Tambourine.
- That has no valves.

364
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,451
Coconut.

365
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,037
Let's just say the
basketball's got two valves.

366
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:34,623
When the Goldstone can't see
Apollo 11, Parkes can.

367
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,958
- That's it.
- Good work, Glenn.

368
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,628
How do you know where
Apollo 11 is?

369
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,338
Computer.

370
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:44,966
In seconds, it does what used to
tame me hours with a slide rule.

371
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,009
And a basketball.

372
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:48,386
Does the computer move the Dish?

373
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,847
- Mitch does that...
- We have to get back to work.

374
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:54,433
Thanks for the refreshments.

375
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:56,477
It was a pleasure.

376
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,606
- Thanks, Janine.
- See you, love.

377
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,821
She's a lovely girl.

378
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:10,198
Yeah. Not much of a driver though.

379
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,327
You must ask her out.

380
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:17,705
Ask Janine out?
I don't know, Cliff.

381
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:21,167
At the cricket club everyone
wants to talk to her.

382
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:25,421
Gary Kenny's always calling.
They may be dating.

383
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:28,507
Do you reckon?

384
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:30,759
Yeah, I reckon.

385
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,719
What if she said no?

386
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,390
Sometimes you got to take a risk.

- You've never got due credit.

front of the ambassador.

yank sees I love my wife.

398
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,059
- The yellow.
- Lemon.

399
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,021
Maysie, give us a kiss.

400
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,732

- No idea.

If you get into Parliament,
will you abolish the draft?

402
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:35,779
Anything for you, sweetheart.

403

think I'm holding on too tight.

Now the teams have gone
back, I'm responsible.

Well, you know...

There's a lot at stake, Al.

411
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:10,020
There's no guarantees,
a lot of variables.

00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,554
I'd appreciate the same
in return.

473
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:33,560
- It's time to get along.
- Let me know if...

474
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,353
Don't worry.

475
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,397
Hi, Mr. Burnett.

476
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:41,942
Guys, I've been calling you.

477
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,862
It's been switched off again.

478
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:48,740
Testing, one, two...

479
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,702
What are we calling about?

480
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:53,745
What's that?

481
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:56,831
What are we calling about?

482
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:58,541
Oh, it's just the...

483
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,586
Routine call?

484
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:05,214
Yeah, Mr. Buxton,
it was the routine call.

485
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:07,800
I'd better get back to my post.

486
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,343
Are we all right here?

487
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,847
That's why I was calling.
Acamera crew's downstairs...

488
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,931
and entry's been authorized.

489
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,063
The ambassador's taking his time.

490
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:24,274
Must still be at the motel.

491
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,359
You organize that fruit platter?

492
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:27,611
Yep. Nice big one.

493
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:29,946
- Major Mclntyre.
- Keith.

494
00:30:30,113 --> 00:30:31,071
Is Marie here?

495
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:34,491
No. The ambassador's a
cultural imperialist.

496
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:35,993
She's gone in.

497
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,078
- Be careful, son.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,080
Boy's about to get a taste of war.

499
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:44,460
Soon we'll be watching TV
pictures from the moon.

500
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:48,380
Could you explain how these
pictures will be received?

501
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,131
Got a basketball?

502
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,217
When Armstrong emerges from
the lunar landing module...

503
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,345
he'll activate a small
camera here...

504
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,348
which will capture pictures of
him descending the ladder...

505
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,642
and walking on the moon.

506
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,646
- How will they return to Earth?
- Carrier pigeon.

507
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:08,982
A small transmitter will send
the images back to us.

508
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:12,778
It's amazing technology.

509
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:14,154
Will the entire...?

510
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,031
Carrier pigeon.

511
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,077
We'll have to go again.

512
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:21,953
The ambassador of the U.S.A.

513
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:26,916
- Got a lump in my throat.
- Stop eating those party pies.

514
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:33,381
You're right, Len. It's
a big day for Parkes.

515
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:35,466
It's a vindication.

516
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,176
They're here.

517
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,929
What do we call him,
Your Excellency?

518
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:41,721
He's not bloody royalty.

519
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:45,975
It's important. We're his
first impression of Parkes.

520
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:55,485
On behalf of the people of
Parkes, we welcome you.

521
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:58,238
Thank you, Bob.
I can call you Bob?

522
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,281
- Absolutely, Mr. Ambassador.
- Howard.

523
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,575
- And this is...?
- Len.

524
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,785
Good day.

525
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:07,329
My wife, May. She's the lemon.

526
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:10,916
<i>Apollo 11, Houston,</i>
<i>accept the minute 49.</i>

527
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,502
<i>Continue your sequence...</i>

528
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:16,755
<i>and we'll analyze</i>
<i>the data afterwards.</i>

529
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,188
Time for a cup of tea?

530
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:41,069
I haven't been treated like this
since I was striping harvesters.

531
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,574
He's a know-it-all who thinks
only Americans work properly.

532
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,243
Aren't you being unfair?

533
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,996
What's happened to you in
the last couple of years?

534
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,833
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

535
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:01,088
This was always your dish. You'd
never let anyone else run it.

536
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,923
We're part of a team.

537
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,550
We're part of NASA.

538
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:05,968
And what's NASA?

539
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,263
Money, equipment, and
everything you ever needed.

540
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,346
No, Mitch.

541
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,724
NASA'sjust a bigger bunch of us.

542
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:16,144
- You considered this attempt?
- Of course.

543
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:19,397
We're in the middle of the
greatest feat ever attempted.

544
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,609
This is science's chance
to be daring.

545
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:23,735
What are you doing?

546
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,322
Standing around, bitching.

547
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:30,949
Rudi.

548
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:32,659
Fellas.

549
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,828
Janine brought food
from the dance.

550
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,079
Lovely.

551
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:39,499
Then her and Glenn are
down there alone?

552
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:44,296
Yeah. If you guys have noticed,
Janine really likes Glenn.

553
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:45,671
Is that right?

554
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,925
Rudi, what's with the gun?

555
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:51,928
It's official NASA installation.

556
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:56,057
We may need it.
I've tasted it.

557
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:58,059
- What?
- The food.

558
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:01,520
Could've been tampered.
We can't take chances.

559
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,566
- You want a couple more?
- Thanks. I'm still starving.

560
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,903
Leaving Sector A.

561
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,822
I thought the foyer
was Sector A.

562
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:15,158
Yeah, it was.

563
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,121
I've decided to go
alphabetically from top down.

564
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,498
That's not locked in yet.

565
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:29,046
This whole thing...

566
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,757
I can't believe I'm a part of it.

567
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,303
I certainly can't believe
Rudi's a part of it.

568
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,056
Me too.

569
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:45,311
Helen would've been proud.

570
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:09,668
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished guests...

571
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,420
please remain upstanding...

572
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:15,297
for the national anthem
of the United States.

573
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:31,480
That's not the anthem.

574
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,116
PKS, Houston. Confirm
handover at 17:00 hours.

575
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:45,410
<i>Roger, PKS. Copy 17:00.</i>

576
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,745
PKS out.

577
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,710
Where'd you get the chocolate?

578
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,588
Janine.

579
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,637
I will, Cliff. I promise.

580
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,976
Everyone wanted to come
but can't find the car keys.

581
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:18,107
- About to call a cab and...
- The keys hanging on the door.

582
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,276
Why don't we all have a dance?

583
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:21,527
Why don't we.

584
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:24,696
Keys were hanging out
the door, Howard.

585
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,412
- Not too racy?
- Oh, no.

586
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:34,456
Marie.

587
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:38,251
- What?
- Would you like to dance?

588
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,378
Are you stupid?

589
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,671
No.

590
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,422
Would you?

591
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:52,139
I wouldn't be in the way?

592
00:36:52,348 --> 00:36:54,350
We'd be honored to have you visit.

593
00:36:55,392 --> 00:36:57,186
Sorry about the mix-up earlier.

594
00:36:57,353 --> 00:37:01,731
No harm done, Bob. Sometimes I
wish it was our national anthem.

595
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:05,526
Oh, beauty.
You'll love this bloke.

596
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:09,697
<i>Fly me to the moon, let me</i>
<i>swing among the stars.</i>

597
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,618
- He's from Brisbane.
- Really?

598
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,162
He's a little like Frank Sinatra.

599
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:17,829
If not better.

600
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:21,291
<i>In other words, take my hand.</i>

601
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:30,634
Who's playing funny buggers?

602
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:32,886
Shit.

603
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:40,101
- Sorting it out.
- Not the pie warmer again?

604
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,941
- What happened?
- A blackout.

605
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:48,567
Control panel's dead.

606
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:51,487
Have it fixed in a jiffy.

607
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,655
- Receivers?
- Negative.

608
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:55,573
- Demodulators?
- No.

609
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:57,867
Whole rack's dead.

610
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,828
Bloody hell.

611
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,830
How about the backup generator?

612
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:03,873
Shit.

613
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:14,591
Sorry about that Howard.

614
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,847
No trouble, as long as everything
is fine at the installation.

615
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:24,184
They have all that under control.
Backup generators, the works.

616
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:26,228
Still, I'll check with Al.

617
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:28,604
Where's Al?

618
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,033
Anything?

619
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,326
Nothing.

620
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:44,954
And we've lost lock.

621
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:51,543
What happened to the generator?

622
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:53,879
The fuel pump.

623
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:58,133
- What about it?
- When I drained it...

624
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:00,093
I forgot to prime the lines.

625
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:03,805
You forgot? Jesus!
How could you do that?

626
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:06,515
- This is what happens...
- Don't you dare!

627
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:10,311
All right.

628
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,105
We must find that ship.

629
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:15,900
Switch to manual drive.
Get a lock.

630
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,028
What's its position?

631
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:21,654
Come on.

632
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,823
I think the computer's wiped.

633
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,074
Shit.

634
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,370
- Are we stuffed?
- Kinda.

635
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,664
Yep, we're stuffed.

636
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,502
What's that noise?

637
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:38,546
- It's moving.
- How?

638
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:41,006
- M.E.'s chasing its own tail.
- Shut it down.

639
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,300
We'll have to override...

640
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,349
How far did it move?

641
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,351
Far enough.

642
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,102
Are we sending anything?

643
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,274
<i>Sydney, this is Flight Control.</i>

644
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,693
<i>Are you receiving a</i>
<i>signal from Parkes?</i>

645
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:04,987
<i>Negative, Houston.</i>

646
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,075
<i>PKS, Flight Control here</i>.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

647
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,747
Flight Control, this is Parkes.
We copy.

648
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,334
<i>Parkes, we'vee lost your</i>
<i>signal. Confirm status.</i>

649
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:25,715
Houston, Parkes here. We
still have a strong signal.

650
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,551
Must be a relay problem.

651
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,013
<i>Copy, Parkes. We</i>'<i>ll look</i>
<i>into it. Stand by</i>.

652
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,139
Parkes standing by.

653
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,980
That's bullshit.
You bullshitted NASA.

654
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,731
That's not good.

655
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,861
I bought us some time.

656
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,446
Let me get that straight.

657
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,698
You've lost Apollo 11.

658
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:52,824
Yeah.

659
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:55,326
Southern Hemisphere's prime
receiving station...

660
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:57,996
has no idea where Apollo 11 is?

661
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:00,331
On it's way to the moon.

662
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,208
Computer can't lock us back on?

663
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,085
No. If it loses power,
it loses data.

664
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:06,254
I thought we had an
uninterruptable power source.

665
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:10,716
It was, but you see, the
generator didn't kick back.

666
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:12,009
How come?

667
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:14,970
Ltjust didn't, that's all.

668
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:19,474
- Power's on. It's under control.
- Except we've lost Apollo 11.

669
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:20,600
Except for that.

670
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,645
We still have the data.
It must be programmed back in.

671
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:25,563
How long will that take?

672
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:29,567
Hours? A day? Months?
How long, Glenn?

673
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:30,776
Take a shot.

674
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:34,113
12... 24 hours?
It's a lot of calculations.

675
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:37,742
We're not relaying data.
Houston would've noticed.

676
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,910
Well, they did call.

677
00:41:40,286 --> 00:41:41,495
What'd you tell them.

678
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:42,872
I told them that...

679
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:45,707
the problem wasn't at our end.

680
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:48,710
- You lied?
- Bullshitted them.

681
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:51,629
- We have to tell them.
- That we stuffed it?

682
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,216
Like they stuffed the Southern
Hemisphere coordinates.

683
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:59,387
- Call for a current position.
- They say we're not required.

684
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:00,472
Excuse me?

685
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:03,265
We're dickheads who can't
maintain a signal.

686
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,601
- Cliff, NASAwill...
- Listen, Al.

687
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:07,561
We can reprogram the system.

688
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:10,731
Just keen NASA off our
backs for a while.

689
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:14,234
I am NASAand I say
we tell them now.

690
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,320
<i>PKS, Houston N.C.</i>

691
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,078
<i>Go ahead, Houston.</i>

692
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,540
<i>Spoken to INCO. No closer</i>
<i>to finding this breakdown.</i>

693
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:31,792
<i>Are you sure it's downstream?</i>

694
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:35,963
PKS...

695
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:43,178
it's still on-line. Confirming
loss of signal downstream.

696
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,723
<i>Roger. We'll maintain</i>
<i>alternative feed.</i>

697
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:48,642
What have I done?

698
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,728
- You bullshitted NASA.
- Good man, Al.

699
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,855
Let's get cracking.

700
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:01,237
I've never been more proud
of being mayor of Parkes.

701
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:05,783
Plus, I went home with the
prettiest girl at the dance.

702
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,829
- You look great in yellow.
- Lemon.

703
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:12,956
Lemon.

704
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,128
Who's that?

705
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:20,421
Crikey!

706
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,008
Press will come and
won't be mugs.

707
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,761
All right...

708
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:30,889
what if you come clean?
Just tell NASA.

709
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,225
- Tell them what?
- That...

710
00:43:33,517 --> 00:43:35,018
we lost Apollo 11.

711
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:37,771
- I wouldn't say that first.
- What would you say?

712
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:41,275
"You'll never guess
what happened."

713
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,026
Bob, it's Apollo 11.

714
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:48,781
What would they do?

715
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:51,826
- I'm not sure.
- Pull the pin?

716
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:56,414
Not officially, but
they'd downgrade our role.

717
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:58,624
We'd lose the moonwalk.

718
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:05,046
Keep a lid on that.
This will be a joke.

719
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:08,508
Who goes there?

720
00:44:09,092 --> 00:44:10,885
It's just us, Rudi.

721
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:12,679
Oh, okay.

722
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,474
Who?

723
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:18,643
Cliff and Bob!

724
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:20,562
Oh, hi, Bob.

725
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,521
Rudi!

726
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:23,230
How are you?

727
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,940
Good. Fine.

728
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:26,525
Nighty-night.

729
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:29,028
We know when they reappear,
but not where.

730
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:31,405
- Same place as yesterday.
- They were orbiting.

731
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:35,284
Now they're translunar. We'll
have to redo every angle.

732
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:36,827
That'll take forever.

733
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:40,747
You can get an approximate
fix, and then scan.

734
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:42,415
That should do it.

735
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:45,251
I'll give you a hand
with the figures.

736
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:49,464
- I know about the generator.
- What?

737
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,091
I forgot to prime the fuel lines.

738
00:44:54,802 --> 00:44:56,012
Well...

739
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:00,307
those things happen.
Let's get to work.

740
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:06,104
If we come on stream tomorrow,
it never happened.

741
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,773
You think you can do it?

742
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,442
I made a commitment to NASA...

743
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:12,486
and I intent to fulfill it.

744
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,863
No tone for a while.

745
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:20,451
Remember trying to sort out
that contract with NASA?

746
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,703
"What about this or that?"

747
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,955
2 hours, and you finally speak.

748
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,750
"Gentlemen, this should be
the contract:

749
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:30,795
We agree to support
the Apollo 11 mission."

750
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:34,631
Just one sentence.
It was wonderful, man.

751
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:36,674
But this isn't.

752
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:39,469
This is a shithouse moment.

753
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,264
Halt. Who goes there?

754
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:42,487
I'm not sure.

755
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:45,948
- You said you were confident.
- I am. I was.

756
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:50,369
It's got to be in this range.

757
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:54,373
If we sweep here, it may be
outside and we'll miss it.

758
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:57,543
If we sweep wider, we
still might miss it.

759
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,628
You confident about that?

760
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:03,965
They're in the service module.
The rockets aren't on.

761
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:07,176
- They just sit and wait.
- Is that right?

762
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:10,596
- The fastest man has traveled.
- Go on.

763
00:47:10,763 --> 00:47:13,975
It's the most chauvinistic
exercise ever.

764
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:16,728
That's why nobody asks you.

765
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:20,105
Here you go.

766
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,774
- I'll get my Saturn V rocket.
- Yeah, go get it.

767
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,151
Thanks, love.

768
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:27,821
Is everything all right
at the Dish?

769
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:31,616
- Can you keep a secret?
- No.

770
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:34,453
What's happened?

771
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,621
What if we split the difference?

772
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:38,789
Ship's moving too fast.

773
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:41,876
Let's call Houston,
ask for coordinates.

774
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:44,128
They'll know we bullshitted.

775
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:45,755
Let's say what happened.

776
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:47,923
That we lied?
That'll go down well.

777
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,467
I don't it will.

778
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:51,969
Morning, everyone.

779
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:54,430
How's it going?

780
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:58,391
- Good.
- You were on the new last night.

781
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,104
Is everything all right?

782
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,153
Yeah. It's fine.

783
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:13,572
Glenn was just checking...

784
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:16,033
- some stuff.
- Really?

785
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:20,162
I'd better let you get to it.

786
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:22,956
- Sorry for interrupting.
- Not at all.

787
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:26,084
- Thanks for the food.
- It was my pleasure.

788
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:31,088
What do you wanna do?

789
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:33,591
Let's give this some thought.

790
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:35,092
<i>Sector G, come in.</i>

791
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:37,345
Let me try something.

792
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,183
- Not now, Rudi.
<i>- You've got a visitor.</i>

793
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,101
<i>It's the ambassador.</i>

794
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,979
<i>From America.</i>

795
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:49,648
Oh, God!

796
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:52,317
<i>- Is this thing working?</i>
- Just a moment, Rudi.

797
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:56,112
<i>Roger, Sector G. Confirm</i>
<i>Sector A. Hold on.</i>

798
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:02,410
Didn't think he'd come so soon.

799
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:03,787
Well, he's here.

800
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:06,205
Space nut knows
all about Apollo 11.

801
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:07,665
He know where it is?

802
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,919
Let's make the brief.
Send him up, Rubi.

803
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:13,170
<i>Roger that</i>.

804
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,467
This is the main control panel.

805
00:49:19,051 --> 00:49:23,471
That moves the Dish up and
down, and that sideways.

806
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:25,473
It's incredible.

807
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:30,728
You can pinpoint a tiny spaceship
thousands of miles away...

808
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,106
and lock onto it.

809
00:49:35,024 --> 00:49:35,900
Pretty much.

810
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,239
The ambassador didn't sign in,
but I've let it go.

811
00:49:42,573 --> 00:49:44,908
I didn't want to pull rank.

812
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:50,831
The other facilities, North
West Cape and Honeysuckle Creek...

813
00:49:51,123 --> 00:49:53,542
also have voice and telemetry?

814
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,255
But in TV, yours is the
only dish large enough?

815
00:49:58,587 --> 00:49:59,547
Yeah.

816
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:02,341
How does that make you feel?

817
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:11,851
Where do you get them glasses?

818
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:15,396
I'm afraid that we're
entering overlap now.

819
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:18,940
So you'll be getting transmissions?

820
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:20,025
Yeah.

821
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:23,194
You'll be able to hear Armstrong?

822
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,448
Yep, just by hitting
a couple of buttons.

823
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:31,745
Oh, let's do that.

824
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:35,539
Sure.

825
00:50:36,206 --> 00:50:39,001
If I... I don't think...

826
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,003
You're right. I don't...

827
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,338
Just a brief listen, then I'll go.

828
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:46,842
Not a problem.

829
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:51,138
I'll have to reorient the...

830
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:55,558
Al?

831
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,645
If you could patch the audio
in for mezzanine three.

832
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:05,401
<i>Columbia, Houston, systems</i>
<i>O.K. You're go for audio.</i>

833
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:06,903
<i>Copy that.</i>

834
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:12,324
<i>Neil, telemetry reports O2</i>
<i>and CO2 are O.K. And steady.</i>

835
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,827
<i>Biomed telemetry reads...</i>

836
00:51:17,245 --> 00:51:21,041
<i>vital statistics as being</i>
<i>adequate, within the limits.</i>

837
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:23,752
Copy that.

838
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:26,962
Neil, we have you currently...

839
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,007
<i>at 124,000 nautical</i>
<i>miles from Earth and.</i>...

840
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:33,552
<i>at approa</i>c<i>hing velocity</i>
<i>of 32,000 feet per second.</i>

841
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:37,431
<i>Copy that.</i>

842
00:51:39,058 --> 00:51:41,560
<i>Columbia, Houston.</i>
<i>Get back to work.</i>

843
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:43,771
<i>Copy that.</i>

844
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,605
<i>Is that you, Neil?</i>

845
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:50,109
This is Sector A.
Is that you, Mr. Armstrong?

846
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:55,532
Must be crossed line from
Honeysuckle Creek.

847
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:59,452
We're really going to have
to get back to work.

848
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:02,496
- Understood.
- I'll see you out.

849
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,623
I'll just move the Dish.

850
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,632
That's incredible.

851
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,718
That was a true highlight.

852
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:18,929
I was going to say good luck...

853
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:23,266
but after what I've seen,
you don't need it.

854
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,142
Thank you very much, sir.

855
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,650
- You'll never guess what happened.
- Later, Rudi.

856
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,114
- Should he sign out?
- Just wave, Rudi.

857
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,159
That's got to be a felony.

858
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,037
Let's find the ship.

859
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,540
Impersonating a person in orbit.

860
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:50,208
It's a moving target.

861
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,878
Everything is moving. If we
had a point of reference...

862
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,006
Take a punt. Choose a sector.

863
00:52:57,256 --> 00:53:00,092
- Still a long shot.
- Thought you were confident.

864
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:02,011
I know where Apollo 11 is.

865
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,100
On its way to the moon.

866
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:12,896
Your point of reference.

867
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:18,026
They've gone 150,000 miles.
There're within 3 or 4 degrees.

868
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:22,864
That might be okay.

869
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:26,075
I think that might be okay.

870
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,913
We can rub this out?

871
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:44,509
5707.

872
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:47,137
5708.

873
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,600
There's your moon.

874
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:59,315
Have a fish around.

875
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:25,756
6730.

876
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:29,176
6731.

877
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,763
We've got a signal!

878
00:54:38,185 --> 00:54:39,603
It's Apollo 11!

879
00:54:40,646 --> 00:54:42,855
- Definite?
- 2.28.

880
00:54:43,022 --> 00:54:44,357
It's the tin can.

881
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:53,616
Yep! Signal lock!

882
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:55,952
<i>Houston, Apollo 11.</i>...

883

<i>Houston, PKS</i>.

885
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,458

886

<i>Copy, Parkes. We are</i>
<i>re</i>c<i>eiving your signal.</i>

887
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,506
Switching to master equatorial.

888
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:11,591
And with 15 minutes to spare.

889
00:55:11,883 --> 00:55:14,010
It's enough time to
check the generator.

890
00:55:18,305 --> 00:55:20,057
That's great news, Cliff.

891
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:23,602
I got to dash.

892
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,397
I appreciate the call.

893
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:27,648
What?

894
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,235
Yeah. Bye.

895
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,863
- Major Mclntyre!
- Keith.

896
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:37,907
What?

897
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:40,034
I wanted to ask Marie something.

898
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:44,914
Fire when ready.

899
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:49,210
Marie, it's Keith!

900
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:54,756
Want to watch the moon
landing with me on Monday?

901
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:57,551
Don't you get it?

902
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,304
Get what, sir?

903
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:02,723
I think that's a "no".

904
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,809
You're a brave lad.

905
00:56:11,355 --> 00:56:13,566
<i>Apollo 11, here Houston, over</i>.

906
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,901
<i>Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11</i>.

907
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:19,196

909
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,619
<i>Houston, can you give me</i>
<i>a time check?</i>

910
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:29,080
<i>I give you a mark at 13 minutes</i>

<i>All your systems look good</i>.

913
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:37,255
<i>- See you on the other side.</i>
<i>- Roger.</i>

914
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:41,718
<i>... on orbit of the moon,</i>
<i>preparing for lunar descent...</i>

915
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,304
<i>- on Monday afternoon.</i>
- That's all we need to know.

916
00:56:44,512 --> 00:56:46,972
- Vol-au-vent?
- Thank you.

917
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:48,891
The boys gave you a tour?

918
00:56:49,058 --> 00:56:51,352
Yes. Very impressive facility.

919
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:53,479
You actually heard Neal Armstrong?

920
00:56:53,687 --> 00:56:54,938
I had the privilege.

921
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:56,440
How did he sound?

922
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:58,817
Like he was next door.

923
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:19,170
That was a day and a half.

924
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:21,838
I'll be 52 on Monday.

925
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,381
Happy birthday.

926
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:27,427
And half of them in radio-
telescope mapping the stars.

927
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,263
Then this came along.

928
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:33,433
Your pipe?

929
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:38,521
No, the moon mission. Know what
I thought when I first came up?

930
00:57:38,979 --> 00:57:40,147
You beauty?

931
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:43,901
I thought:
"Imagine stuffing that up."

932
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,195
Isn't that odd?

933
00:57:46,612 --> 00:57:47,571
What?

934
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,242
That I was more scared
than excited.

935
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,495
That's not odd.
I feel like that all the time.

936
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:58,873
How come you changed?

937
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:02,335
My wife said something:

938
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:06,798
"Failure is never quite so
frightening as regret."

939
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:09,134
That's good advice.

940
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:10,635
Pretty good.

941
00:58:10,802 --> 00:58:12,971
I wish someone would tell me that.

942
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:16,181
God bless you, Glenn.

943
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:25,788
When I said I was sorry...

944
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,874
I was sorry for everything.

945
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,293
- Oh, Mitch, that's not...
- No, no, no.

946
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,503
When you first arrived I felt...

947
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,715
you're a hotshot from NASA and
I'm a dumb country kid...

948
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:38,051
with the arse fallout
out of me daks.

949
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,470
- Your...?
- Pants.

950
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,304
I was wrong.

951
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:46,350
I never thought of you with
your ass falling out of your...

952
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:47,726
Daks.

953
00:59:47,976 --> 00:59:50,103
Not everyone at NASA's
a college genius.

954
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:53,065
The guy I most admire is
from a one-horse town in Ohio.

955
00:59:53,815 --> 00:59:55,067
What's he do?

956
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,403
Tomorrow he'll walk on the moon.

957
00:59:58,612 --> 00:59:59,571
Who's the guy?

958
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:01,280
Armstrong.

959
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:04,992
It would have been okay
to tell Houston.

960
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,827
Things go wrong there
all the time.

961
01:00:07,453 --> 01:00:11,540
Mission control goes blue when
50 people hold their breath.

962
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:15,002
Do you know how many
rockets blew up?

963
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:17,380
- That's a while yet.
- 6 weeks ago.

964
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:21,257
Testing the lunar module.
10 simulations without a hitch.

965
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:24,010
On the 11th, the controls
jammed, it crashed.

966
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,553
Any idea why?

967
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,348
We still have no idea why.

968
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:30,767
Let's hope 11 isn't
an unlucky number.

969
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:35,938
We pray for those brave souls...

970
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:37,523
who, as we speak...

971
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:41,735
are taking the 1st steps in
exploring God's great universe...

972
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:45,072
and for the technicians and...

973
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,659
scientists who contribute
to this brave endeavor.

974
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:52,746
You think this Apollo 11
thing's big here?

975
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:56,040
- You can't imagine.
- Really?

976
01:00:56,249 --> 01:00:57,875
What were you saying last night?

977
01:00:58,126 --> 01:00:59,794
You shouldn't drink so much?

978
01:01:01,129 --> 01:01:02,797
If you'll excuse me.

979
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:04,674
He came for dinner.

980
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:09,303
Imagine 2 basketballs. One
there, one there and a valve.

981
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:13,223
- They won't televise always.
- Wouldn't think so.

982
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:18,353
Bounces off the basketball,
and then off Goldstone.

983
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:21,857
Could they hide behind a rock?

984
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:25,443
Depends on doing a number...

985
01:01:26,236 --> 01:01:27,863
or doing a number...

986
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:29,488
What was that, Ray?

987
01:01:29,655 --> 01:01:32,408
We're talking about
the TV coverage.

988
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,619
Where can I take a...?

989
01:01:50,592 --> 01:01:52,468
Thanks for the sandwiches.

990
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,388
- Thanks for fixing the bumper.
- That's okay.

991
01:01:55,555 --> 01:01:57,932
- Maybe...
- Janine, I was won...

992
01:01:59,225 --> 01:02:01,269
- You go first.
- No, you.

993
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:03,937
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

994
01:02:04,897 --> 01:02:06,023
What about you?

995
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,399
Nothing

996
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,277
Has he asked her out yet?

997
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,365
This is painful.

998
01:02:16,658 --> 01:02:18,869
I really like weekends too.

999
01:02:19,286 --> 01:02:22,955
And Fridays cause you're
looking forward to the weekend.

1000
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,169
What were you going to say?

1001
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:29,879
Nothing.

1002
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:33,966
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

1003
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:36,927
All right.

1004
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:40,180
- See ya.
- See ya.

1005
01:02:40,472 --> 01:02:42,015
Want to go out Friday night?

1006
01:02:42,474 --> 01:02:44,601
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1007
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:47,270
Did you say: "Want to
go out Friday night?"

1008
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:49,064
Maybe.

1009
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:51,816
I'd love to go out Friday night.

1010
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:54,402
With me?

1011
01:02:54,778 --> 01:02:55,945
Yes.

1012
01:02:57,446 --> 01:02:58,572
Right-o then.

1013
01:02:59,448 --> 01:03:00,866
Right-o then.

1014
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,815
He ask her out?

1015
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:36,775
I'm not sure.

1016
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:40,278
I had a chat with Al this morning.

1017
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:42,489
Really?

1018
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,408
He's not such a bad bloke.

1019
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,576
You should give him a chance.

1020
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:51,372
- You'll be right?
- Yeah.

1021
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:54,458
- Lf you got any problem...
- I'll call Rudi.

1022
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:57,169
- That's Parkes lamb.
- I've got enough.

1023
01:03:57,378 --> 01:03:58,462
Plenty more.

1024
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:01,090
- I'll have the vegetables.
- Yes, dear.

1025
01:04:02,216 --> 01:04:05,261
- This is wonderful.
- Glad you could get away.

1026
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:07,221
The boys have it under control.

1027
01:04:07,388 --> 01:04:08,930
- When are you up?
- At 4.

1028
01:04:09,097 --> 01:04:10,431
Tomorrow's the big day.

1029
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:11,891
All being well.

1030
01:04:12,267 --> 01:04:14,936
Man on the bloody moon. Gravy?

1031
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:19,941
Sending men off into the galaxies
as the world watches.

1032
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:22,986
Takes your mind off concerns.

1033
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:24,028
Elbows.

1034
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:26,363
The whole school will watch it.

1035
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,365
Every school will watch it.

1036
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:31,160
- What are you estimating?
- 600 million.

1037
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:32,786
600 million!

1038
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:34,830
600 million.

1039
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,123
- Peas?
- No.

1040
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,458
Can people in India watch it?

1041
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,211
Yeah, but all on the one telly.

1042
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,591
- I'm serious.
- Far too serious.

1043
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,094
- How they going to film it?
- Cliff?

1044
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,430
A boom outside the camera.

1045
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,516
When Armstrong's outside the
module, it'll swing out.

1046
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,561
- Is there an antenna on the roof?
- Transmitter, Dad.

1047
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,396
It's the size of that bowl.

1048
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:02,898
- Pumpkin?
- Yes, please.

1049
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:04,649
All this effort for TV.

1050
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,902
NASA hardly mentioned TV.

1051
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,236
Interesting change.

1052
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:12,616
Not sure what's more important,
astronauts or pictures.

1053
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:15,535
How lovely!

1054
01:05:15,785 --> 01:05:16,703
Elbows.

1055
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:18,746
Can I ask a question?

1056
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:19,830
Sure.

1057
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,124
Is this mission funded by the CIA?

1058
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,417
Not entirely.

1059
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:24,752
Really?

1060
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:25,836
No.

1061
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:30,758
How do they know they won't sink?

1062
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:32,718
- Good Lord!
- Crikey.

1063
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:35,346
We know a great deal
about the moon.

1064
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:40,099
Soil composition, density,
gravity. Not many mysteries.

1065
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:41,976
If we know so much, why go?

1066
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:44,646
There's one thing we don't know.

1067
01:05:45,313 --> 01:05:46,439
What, Cliff?

1068
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:47,982
Whether we can get there.

1069
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:50,902
Elbows.

1070
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:53,655
Well, let's start.

1071
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:56,740
Man on the moon or not,
we've still got to eat.

1072
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:58,283
You'll like that.

1073
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,579
Back to work, eh?

1074
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:04,539
It's all go.

1075
01:06:04,748 --> 01:06:07,501
That roast lamb was magnificent.

1076
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:10,295
- You don't get that in Houston.
- No.

1077
01:06:10,504 --> 01:06:13,005
- We can't have you wasting away.
- Thank you.

1078
01:06:13,464 --> 01:06:15,216
Thank you very much, May.

1079
01:06:15,549 --> 01:06:18,010
It's been quite a while since
I've had a good roast.

1080
01:06:22,556 --> 01:06:25,142
- Good luck for tomorrow.
- Thank you.

1081
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:28,020
Marie, it was an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

1082
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:29,437
Really?

1083
01:06:29,979 --> 01:06:31,064
Really.

1084
01:06:34,818 --> 01:06:36,152
How you feeling?

1085
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:37,445
Fine.

1086
01:06:38,113 --> 01:06:40,281
I heard the prime minister
on the news.

1087
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,409
Could he shut up about it?

1088
01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:48,080
Don't you wonder what we're
doing in the Apollo 11 mission?

1089
01:06:49,623 --> 01:06:52,042
They'll knight you for this.

1090
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,669
Or behead me.

1091
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,220
Dad!

1092
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,014
About face!

1093
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:10,643
Quick march!

1094
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:14,730
Boy's not a soldier,
he's a kamikaze.

1095
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,751
- What are you grinning about?
- Nothing.

1096
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:39,045
You've had a smile all day.

1097
01:07:39,462 --> 01:07:42,256
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

1098
01:07:43,007 --> 01:07:44,091
All right?

1099
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:45,634
How was lunch?

1100
01:07:45,885 --> 01:07:48,971
- Wonderful.
- We ate an entire sheep.

1101
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:51,390
All in order?

1102
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:55,144
- I was gonna check the receiver.
- I'll do it.

1103
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:57,770
- I'll stow the Dish.
- I'll take a hayride.

1104
01:07:57,937 --> 01:07:59,189
Hayride?

1105
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:01,232
What's a hayride?

1106
01:08:02,901 --> 01:08:06,029
When it's down, we can't
get up the core.

1107
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:09,407
- It's quicker to go for a ride.
- Interesting.

1108
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:10,783
Okay, Mitch.

1109
01:08:12,076 --> 01:08:15,871
Yet strangely, this
is not in the manual.

1110
01:08:16,663 --> 01:08:18,832
Curious oversight, right?

1111
01:08:26,757 --> 01:08:29,051
It was good what you said at lunch.

1112
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:30,510
What?

1113
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,846
We don't know whether
we can get there.

1114
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:37,183
Yes, that's easy to forget.

1115
01:08:38,851 --> 01:08:40,394
Before I left Houston...

1116
01:08:40,603 --> 01:08:43,940
the scientists had planned
everything for Armstrong.

1117
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:47,234
Rock samples,
measuring radiation.

1118
01:08:47,526 --> 01:08:51,071
Flight director put his foot
down. So they say:

1119
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:55,492
"When Armstrong gets to the moon,
what should he do?"

1120
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:58,328
F.D. Says: "Get off it."

1121
01:09:00,747 --> 01:09:03,166
That would be number one.

1122
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,210
I kind of felt for him.

1123
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,963
There's really only one
thing I want to see.

1124
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:16,261
There's something about putting
a footprint on the moon that...

1125
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,389
Makes our spirits soar?

1126
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:20,683
Yeah, exactly.

1127
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:22,768
Did you come up with that?

1128
01:09:24,603 --> 01:09:27,980
I'm ashamed to say I didn't.
It was my wife.

1129
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:33,903
She died last year.

1130
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:36,656
Sorry to hear that, Cliff.

1131
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,951
She was so excited by all of this.

1132
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:43,454
Made me realize I should
be excited too.

1133
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:44,788
And I am.

1134
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:50,293
The only thing is,
she's not here to share it.

1135
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,424
So... there it is.

1136
01:10:08,185 --> 01:10:10,312
34, 36...

1137
01:10:11,063 --> 01:10:12,231
Hold it there.

1138
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:15,901
- Strength?
- Negative one-forty.

1139
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:17,528
Intermittent lock on prime.

1140
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,196
- Do you want me to...?
- No.

1141
01:10:20,613 --> 01:10:22,115
Glenn, run AGC.

1142
01:10:22,323 --> 01:10:24,075
Auto Gain Control running.

1143
01:10:24,617 --> 01:10:26,828
Negative 90. Solid lock.
We're on.

1144
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:29,414
- Switching to M.E.
- Got it.

The moonwalk.

1227

They got rid of that hydrogen?

1228
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:57,667

- 30.

So, we're fine.

1239

- For now.
- Come on, Glenn.

1240
01:15:40,748 --> 01:15:42,625
If it goes above 30?

1241
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,044
Above 10, we stow the Dish.

1242

We understand that.

1244
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:53,386
Forecaster says it
doesn't make sense.

1245
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:55,637
- Great.
- He say anything else?

1246
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:58,223
Hello and goodbye. Very polite.

1247
01:16:04,187 --> 01:16:06,815
30 knots can't be the
absolute maximum.

1248
01:16:06,982 --> 01:16:08,108
It's the theoretical maximum.

1249
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:10,110
- It's never been tested?
- No.

1250

01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,577
1,000 tons is above that
azimuth track.

1254
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,036
That's not good.

1255
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:24,039
All right, let's just...

1256
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:26,751
We got 9 hours till they walk.

1257
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:29,754
Could this blow itself out?

1258
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:32,380
Yeah, I reckon it could.

1259
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,091
Yeah.

1260
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,345

1261

There in a minute!

1263
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,936

Right.

1265
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,356

1266
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,276
Oh, I see.

1267
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,695
You reckon?

Crikey.

1269
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,245

1271
01:17:08,873 --> 01:17:12,168
<i>received by the United</i>
<i>States ambassador...</i>.

1272
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:16,130
<i>and local dignitaries eager to</i>
<i>see the historic landing.</i>

1273
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:19,425
This is Cliff Buxton, the
director of the facility.

1274
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:23,137
Governor-general. That was
the official opening.

1275
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:25,305
Why did they build it here?

1276
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:27,057
If I may, Bob?

1277
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:29,392
Weather, prime minister.

1278
01:17:29,643 --> 01:17:32,521
Parkes has the stable
climatic conditions...

1279
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:35,899
conducive to the operation
of large radio telescopes.

1280
01:17:42,738 --> 01:17:43,697
Fire?

1281
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:46,867
We hit 30 knots.

1282
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:49,620
- Get back to the bureau.
- Sure.

1283
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:52,623
- What's up?
- Relax, Rudi.

1284
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:54,208
What's the bell for?

1285
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,126
Let's us know it's windy.

1286
01:17:56,627 --> 01:18:00,004
I knew that. It's blowing
a bloody gale outside.

1287
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,217
- Well done with this.
- The ladies helped.

1288
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,261
No, Apollo 11. Your dish.

1289
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:08,638
Thank you, prime minister.

1290
01:18:08,972 --> 01:18:13,268
And congratulations on the nod.
Party needs performers.

1291
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:16,937
- How are they going out there?
- Good. Perfectly.

1292
01:18:17,312 --> 01:18:21,608
We sit here for 5 bloody days,
not a breath of bloody wind.

1293
01:18:21,817 --> 01:18:24,653
And then, out of nowhere...

1294
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:29,324
when it's our turn, a bloody
cyclone parks on us!

1295
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:36,330
Sorry lads.

1296
01:18:36,622 --> 01:18:37,790
I might just...

1297
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,961
go check some bloody thing.

1298
01:18:44,005 --> 01:18:47,758
Obviously nothing's foolproof.
There's always limitations.

1299
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:51,220
There are no guarantees,
all things considered.

1300
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:54,556
Life, I guess.

1301
01:18:55,306 --> 01:18:57,350
You're joking, aren't you?

1302
01:18:58,476 --> 01:19:00,103
Yeah, everything's fine.

1303
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:03,648
We have a saying in the Party:

1304
01:19:05,233 --> 01:19:07,402
- "You don't fuck up.!
- And?

1305
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:08,653
That's it.

1306
01:19:19,538 --> 01:19:21,832
- What?
- They're going to walk early.

1307
01:19:22,082 --> 01:19:24,251
Armstrong's overruled
the sleep break.

1308
01:19:24,418 --> 01:19:26,503
He told NASA:
"We don't want to sleep."

1309
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,337
Armstrong goes for it.

1310
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,216
- When do they walk?
- Soon. Now.

1311
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,596
- So we're off the hook.
- No.

1312
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,808
Goldstone has problems.
They want us from the start.

1313
01:19:41,058 --> 01:19:43,311
We don't see the moon till one.

1314
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:44,729
12:56.

1315
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:47,939
Come 12:56, if Armstrong
hasn't walked...

1316
01:19:48,106 --> 01:19:50,108
this Dish points to the moon.

1317
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:53,111
This is locked down. I
don't care who turns up.

1318
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,072
- No one gets in. Understand?
- I understand, sir.

1319
01:19:56,448 --> 01:19:58,033
We must move this dish.

1320
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:01,036
- There's a safety issue.
- I understand that.

1321
01:20:01,286 --> 01:20:03,287
We're under no obligations.

1322
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:04,997
Mitch, what will happen?

1323
01:20:05,164 --> 01:20:06,207
Don't know.

1324
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,542
What do you think will happen?

1325
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:11,629
It's a big sail area.

1326
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:14,423
The wind grabs hold of it...

1327
01:20:20,221 --> 01:20:21,429
We wait.

1328
01:20:25,308 --> 01:20:26,601
Come on.

1329
01:20:26,893 --> 01:20:29,145
They're going early.
Could happen any time.

1330
01:20:29,395 --> 01:20:31,105
Come on, you'll miss it.

1331
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:35,193
If I'djust landed on the moon,
I wouldn't want to sleep.

1332
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,737
Like telling a kid to sleep
on Christmas morning, eh?

1333
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:42,115
- More tea, prime minister?
- Yes.

1334
01:20:42,824 --> 01:20:43,784
Lovely.

1335
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:46,453
- They're going early.
- I know.

1336
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,915
- You all right?
- I am now.

1337
01:20:50,082 --> 01:20:50,916
Sorry?

1338
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:53,710
Goldstone can take the pictures.

1339
01:20:53,877 --> 01:20:54,878
Goldstone?

1340
01:20:55,128 --> 01:20:57,880
Cliff can't move the Dish
in this wind.

1341
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:59,048
Good Lord!

1342
01:20:59,298 --> 01:21:02,677
Lt'll die down and
they'll use us later.

1343
01:21:02,885 --> 01:21:06,722
It would have been nice to
be there from the start.

1344
01:21:07,473 --> 01:21:10,434
Doesn't matter what pictures
are caught by who.

1345
01:21:10,851 --> 01:21:14,854
We're part of a team.
That's the most important thing.

1346
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:17,607
- You're right.
- Your shirt, Bob.

1347
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:21,695
The boys at the Dish will
be able to relax.

1348
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,951
Getting worse. It's gusting to 50.

1349
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:33,247
We can't move this dish.

1350
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,499
<i>PKS video, Houston TV, Net 2.</i>

1351
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:36,959
PKS video. Go ahead.

1352
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:41,297
<i>Got problems with Goldstone.</i>
<i>Need you as prime receiver.</i>

1353
01:21:41,672 --> 01:21:42,840
Prime?

1354
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:45,050
<i>The signal between Goldstone</i>
<i>and Houston is dead</i>.

1355
01:21:45,217 --> 01:21:48,679
<i>It's gone to ground and</i>
<i>it's still go for walk.</i>

1356
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,889
We'll advise when in position.

1357
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,474
<i>Roger, PKS.</i>

1358
01:21:53,766 --> 01:21:55,560
<i>Soon as possible, please.</i>

1359
01:21:58,688 --> 01:21:59,939
Glenn, come here.

1360
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:01,399
Mitch, talk to me.

1361
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:05,361
- Shaking in upright position.
- What?

1362
01:22:05,528 --> 01:22:08,780
It's not designed to take
these sort of forces.

1363
01:22:09,031 --> 01:22:10,282
Finish what you're saying.

1364
01:22:10,574 --> 01:22:11,700
It could collapse.

1365
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,874
- Man's about to walk on the moon.
- And he will.

1366
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,250
But no one will see it.

1367
01:22:21,043 --> 01:22:23,462
There are 5 lives at risk.

1368
01:22:23,712 --> 01:22:26,088
I'm responsible for those lives.

1369
01:22:28,299 --> 01:22:31,969
Many would say that's sufficient
not to move the Dish.

1370
01:22:32,428 --> 01:22:34,138
Everyone'll accept that.

1371
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:35,806
But will you?

1372
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:40,311
This is science's chance
to be daring.

1373
01:22:40,644 --> 01:22:42,812
If we don't move it,
it might as well be rubble.

1374
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:49,611
Al.

1375
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:52,697
I still think 11's a lucky number.

1376
01:22:56,075 --> 01:22:57,160
- Glenn.
- What?

1377
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:01,246
Sometimes, you got to take a risk.

1378
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:11,089
All right.

1379
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:13,550
Let's do it.

1380
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:17,387
I like Cliff. He goes for it.

1381
01:23:17,678 --> 01:23:20,473
From North to South, they
come from near and far...

1382
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,767
to witness man take to the sky...

1383
01:23:22,975 --> 01:23:26,437
in search of moon and star.

1384
01:23:27,313 --> 01:23:29,398
But ponder this as rockets fly.

1385
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:42,786
Jesus!

1386
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:45,872
65 miles an hour.

1387
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:48,667
Keep going, Mitch.

1388

What the hell was that?

1393
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:20,572
Drive cogs must've slipped.

1394
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,199
Or Janine's trying to park.

1395
01:24:23,866 --> 01:24:24,993
Stick with it, Mitch.

1396
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:26,661
I'm staying, whatever happens.

01:26:10,091 --> 01:26:11,885
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

1428
01:26:12,385 --> 01:26:13,845
<i>There</i>'<i>s contrast...</i>

1429
01:26:14,221 --> 01:26:16,055
<i>but with a fair amount</i>
<i>of detail.</i>

1430
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:19,016
That's Armstrong!

1431
01:26:20,893 --> 01:26:21,936
On the moon!

1432
01:26:22,144 --> 01:26:26,440
<i>Verify the position of the</i>
<i>opening on the camera.</i>

1433
01:26:41,955 --> 01:26:45,083
<i>Neil, we see you coming</i>
<i>down the ladder.</i>

1434
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:54,383
<i>I'm on that first step, Buzz</i>.

1435
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,553
<i>It's not collapsed too far...</i>

1436
01:26:59,221 --> 01:27:01,640
<i>but it's adequate to</i>
<i>get back up.</i>

1437
01:27:01,848 --> 01:27:04,184
<i>- We</i> c<i>opy</i>.
<i>- It takes a good little jump</i>.

1438
01:27:08,604 --> 01:27:10,606
Switch back to main axis.

1439
01:27:19,156 --> 01:27:21,325
- How's that?
- Fine.

1440
01:27:21,534 --> 01:27:23,411
<i>The LEM footpads are only...</i>

1441
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:29,791
<i>depressed in the surface</i>
<i>about 1 or 2 inches.</i>

1442
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:34,337
<i>Although the surface</i>
<i>appears to be very...</i>

1443
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:37,549
<i>very fine-grained.</i>

1444
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:39,801
<i>It's almost like a powder</i>.

1445
01:27:45,931 --> 01:27:48,058
<i>I'll step off the LAM now.</i>

1446
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:55,524
<i>That</i>'<i>s one small step for man...</i>

1447
01:27:58,402 --> 01:28:00,903
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1448
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:03,573
<i>That beautiful from here, Neil.</i>

1449
01:28:03,823 --> 01:28:06,492
<i>It has a beauty all its own.</i>

1450
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:09,037
<i>It's like the high desert</i>

1451
01:28:09,829 --> 01:28:12,165
- Dad, he's on the moon!
- I know, mate.

1452
01:28:12,582 --> 01:28:14,334
<i>It's very pretty out here.</i>

1453
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:16,544
Thank God for that hydrogen.

1454
01:28:19,254 --> 01:28:21,089
<i>Are you getting a TVpicture,</i>
<i>Houston?</i>

1455
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:22,716

1456

<i>You're in our field of view.</i>

1458
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:33,143
<i>I'm on the top step.</i>

1459
01:28:33,352 --> 01:28:36,896
<i>It</i>'<i>s simple to hop from</i>

1460
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,690

1461
01:28:47,782 --> 01:28:48,949
<i>There you go.</i>

1462
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,043
<i>Beautiful view.</i>

1463
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,544
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

1464
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,047
<i>Magnificent sight out here.</i>

1465
01:29:15,307 --> 01:29:17,392
You can stay this one.

1466
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:20,854
Enough.

1467
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:23,524

1468

1478
01:30:10,776 --> 01:30:13,654

1482
01:30:24,289 --> 01:30:26,374
<i>How's the quality of the TV?</i>.

1483
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,918
