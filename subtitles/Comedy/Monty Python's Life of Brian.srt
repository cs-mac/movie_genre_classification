1
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,709
-Who are you?
-We are three wise men.

2
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,314
-What?
-We are three wise men.

3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,392
What are you doing creeping around
a cowshed at 2:00 a.m.?

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,437
That doesn't sound very wise to me.

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,635
-We are astrologers.
-We have come from the East.

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,033
-ls this some kind of joke?
-We wish to praise the infant.

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,590
-We must pay a homage to him.
-Homage? You're all drunk!

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,955
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,671
Bursting in here with tales about
Oriental fortunetellers. Out!

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,678
-No, no, we must see him.
-Go and praise someone else's brat!

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,594
-We were led by a star!
-Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,035
-We must see him. We have presents!
-Out!

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,031
Gold, frankincense, myrrh!

14
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,112
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,397
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,471
Well, what is myrrh anyway?

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,154
-lt is a valuable balm.
-A balm?!

18
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,788
What are you giving him a balm for?
It might bite him!

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,278
-What?
-That's a dangerous animal!

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,078
-Throw it in the trough!
-No, it isn't!

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,795
-It's a great big....
-No, no, no, it is an ointment.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,155
Well, there is an animal called
a balm, or did I dream it?

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,995
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he then?

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,072
What star-sign is he?

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,710
-Capricorn.
-Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,440
Well, he's the Son of God.
Our Messiah.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,709
King of the Jews!

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,031
-And that's Capricorn, is it?
-No, no, no, that's just him!

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,317
I was gonna say,
otherwise there'd be a lot of them.

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,790
-By what name are you calling him?
-Brian.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,953
We worship you, Brian,
who are lord over us all.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,349
Praise unto you, Brian,
and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,953
-Do you do a lot of this?
-What?

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,111
-This praising.
-No, no. No, no.

35
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,033
Well, if you're dropping
by again, do pop in.

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,794
And thanks a lot for the gold
and frankincense...

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,997
...but don't worry too much about
the myrrh next time, all right?

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,277
Thank you. Goodbye.

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,391
Well, weren't they nice?

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,678
Out of their bloody minds,
but still, look at that!

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,913
Here. Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,592
Shut up!

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,437
Brian
The babe they called Brian

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,632
He grew

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,837
Grew, grew and grew

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,197
Grew up to be

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,511
Grew up to be

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,638
A boy called Brian

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,793
A boy called Brian

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,430
He had arms and legs

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,717
And hands and feet

52
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
This boy

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,956
Whose name was Brian

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,278
And he grew

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,637
Grew, grew and grew

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,439
Grew up to be

57
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,751
Yes, he grew up to be

58
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,310
A teenager called Brian

59
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,836
A teenager called Brian

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,072
And his face became spotty

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,471
Yes, his face became spotty

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,155
And his voice dropped down low

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,392
And things started to grow

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,597
On young Brian and show

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,991
He was certainly no

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,630
No girl named Brian

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,715
Not a girl named Brian

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,037
And he started to shave

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,078
And have one off the wrist

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,710
And want to see girls

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,077
And go out and get pissed

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,391
A man called Brian

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,757
This man called Brian

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,517
The man they called Brian

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,115
This man called

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,431
Brian

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,397
How blessed are those
who know that he's of God.

78
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,794
How blessed are
the sorrowful.

79
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,793
They shall find consolation.

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,630
How blessed are those of gentle spirit.

81
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,397
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,633
How blessed are those who hunger
and thirst to see right prevail.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,674
They shall be satisfied.

84
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,675
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

85
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,035
They shall see God.

86
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,794
-Speak up!
-Quiet, mum!

87
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,918
Well, I can't hear a thing.

88
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,358
Let's go to a stoning.

89
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,837
-You can go to a stoning anytime.
-Come on, Brian.

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,429
Will you be quiet?

91
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,551
Don't pick your nose!

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,119
I wasn't. I was scratching.

93
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,635
You was picking it while you
was talking to that lady.

94
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,633
-I wasn't!
-Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,277
-Do you mind? I can't hear a word.
-Don't you "do you mind" me.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,079
-I was talking to my husband.
-Talk to him somewhere else.

97
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,596
-I can't hear a bloody thing.
-Don't you swear at my wife.

98
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,911
I was only asking her to shut up
so we can hear, big nose.

99
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,275
Don't you call my husband "big nose."

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,352
-Well, he has got a big nose.
-Could you be quiet, please?

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,114
-What was that?
-I was too busy talking to big nose.

102
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."

103
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,028
What's so special about
the cheese makers?

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,077
It's not meant to be taken literally.

105
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,118
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

106
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,834
If you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, big nose.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,560
Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in!

108
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,598
Listen, might be a bit
about "Blessed are the big noses."

109
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,079
Lay off him.

110
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,194
You're not so bad yourself, conk-face.
Where are you two from? Nose City?

111
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,394
One more time,
I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!

112
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,551
Language!

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,836
And don't pick your nose!

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,991
I wasn't going to.
I was gonna thump him!

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,838
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.

116
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,350
-The Greek?
-Apparently, he's gonna inherit the earth.

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,154
-Did anyone catch his name?
-You won't thump anybody.

118
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,995
-I'll thump him if he calls me "big nose"!
-Shut up, big nose!

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,957
Right. I warned you.

120
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,997
I really will slug you so hard--!

121
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,277
It's the meek.
"Blessed are the meek."

122
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,319
That's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they getting
something. They have a hell of a time.

123
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,830
Listen, I'm only telling the truth,
you have got a very big nose.

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,551
Your nose is going to be three foot wide
across your face by the time I'm finished!

125
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,472
Who hit yours? Goliath's big brother?

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,754
-Right, that's your last warning.
-Do pipe down.

127
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,472
Silly bitch, getting in the way.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,035
Break it up!

129
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,118
-Come on, let's go to the stoning.
-All right.

130
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,311
Blessed is just about everyone with an
interest in the status quo, right, Reg?

131
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,712
What Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

132
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,158
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.

133
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,876
Come on, Brian, or they'll have
stoned him before we get there.

134
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,553
All right.

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,713
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting.
Officer, intervene here.

136
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,510
Attempted rape going on. It's the chap
with the big nose's fault. He started it all.

137
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,155
I hate wearing these beards.

138
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,108
-Why aren't women allowed at stonings?
-It's written, that's why.

139
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,070
-Beard, madam?
-I haven't got time to go to no stonings.

140
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,834
He's not well again.

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,556
-Stone, sir?
-They've got them lying on the ground.

142
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,589
Not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel
the quality of that. That's craftsmanship.

143
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,552
All right. We'll have two with points
and a big, flat one.

144
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,472
Could I have a flat one, Mum?

145
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,789
Sorry. Dad.

146
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,236
All right. Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

147
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,549
Packet of gravel.

148
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,358
Should be a good one this afternoon.

149
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,873
-Local boy.
-Oh, good.

150
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,229
Enjoy yourselves.

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,033
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,270
-Do I say yes?
-Yes!

153
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,950
...you have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

154
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,873
...of uttering the name of our Lord...

155
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,679
...and so as a blasphemer...

156
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,476
...you are to be stoned to death!

157
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,350
Look, I'd had a lovely supper,
and all I said to my wife was:

158
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,354
"That piece of halibut was
good enough for Jehovah."

159
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,751
Blasphemy! He said it again!

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,794
-Did you hear him?
-Yeah! Yes, we did!

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,154
Really.

162
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,037
Are there any women here today?

163
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,997
Very well. By virtue of the authority...

164
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,269
...vested in me--

165
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,273
Lay off! We haven't started yet.

166
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,000
Come on! Who threw that?

167
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,791
Who threw that stone? Come on!

168
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,871
She did! She did!

169
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,429
He did! He did! He did!

170
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,636
Sorry, I thought we'd started.

171
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,195
-Go to the back.
-Oh, dear.

172
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,158
Always one, isn't there?

173
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,596
-Now, where were we?
-I don't think it ought to be blasphemy...

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,877
-...just saying "Jehovah."
-He did! He did!

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,150
You're only making it worse for yourself!

176
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,788
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?

177
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,394
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

178
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more--

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,555
Right! Who threw that?

180
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,111
Come on! Who threw that?

181
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,429
Him! Him! Him!

182
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,033
-Was it you?
-Yes.

183
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,749
-Right--
-Well, you did say Jehovah.

184
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,950
Stop. Stop. Will you stop that?

185
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,109
Stop it!

186
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,752
Now, look. No one is to stone
anyone until I blow this whistle.

187
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,239
Do you understand?

188
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,597
Even, and I want to
make this absolutely clear...

189
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,752
...even if they do say Jehovah.

190
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,959
Good shot!

191
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,076
-Have I got a big nose, mum?
-Stop thinking about sex.

192
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,071
-I wasn't.
-You're always on about it.

193
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,559
Morning, noon and night.

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,188
"Will the girls like this,
will the girls like that?

195
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,272
Is it too big, is it too small?"

196
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,873
-Alms for a leper.
-Alms for a leper.

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,508
Alms for an ex-leper.

198
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,434
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same,
ain't they? Never have any change.

199
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,033
Here's a touch.

200
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,237
-Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
-Buzz off.

201
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,118
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?

202
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,510
A talent? That's more than
he earns in a month.

203
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,477
-Half a talent then?
-No, go away.

204
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,993
-Big nose, let's haggle.
-What?

205
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,790
All right, let's say you open at one
shekel, I start at 2000, we close at 1800.

206
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,949
-No.
-1750?

207
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,599
-Go away!
-1740?

208
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,320
-Leave him alone.
-All right. Two shekels, just two.

209
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,392
-ls this fun, eh?
-Look, he's not giving you any money.

210
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,869
Now piss off!

211
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,394
All right, final offer,
half a shekel for an ex-leper?

212
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,915
-Did you say ex-leper?
-That's right, sir.

213
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,877
Sixteen years behind
a bell and proud of it.

214
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,275
-Well, what happened?
-I was cured, sir.

215
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
-Cured?
-A bloody miracle, sir. God bless you.

216
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,515
-Who cured you?
-Jesus did, sir.

217
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,671
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

218
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,070
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.

219
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,358
One minute I'm a leper with a trade,
next minute my livelihood's gone.

220
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,954
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.

221
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,470
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

222
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,676
I could do that sir.
I could, I suppose.

223
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,469
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me
a bit lame in one leg during the week.

224
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,315
You know, something beggable, but
not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,994
Brian. Come and clean your room out.

226
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,958
-There you are.
-Thank you. Thank--

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,955
-Half a dinare for me bloody life story?
-There's no pleasing some people.

228
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,190
That's just what Jesus said, sir.

229
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,238
Good afternoon.

230
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,036
Hello, officer.

231
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,272
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

232
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,634
What's he doing here?

233
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,270
-Don't start, Brian. Go clean your room.
-Bloody Romans.

234
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,591
Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them,
we wouldn't have all this.

235
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,196
-And don't you forget it.
-We don't owe the Romans anything.

236
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,749
That's not entirely true, is it, Brian?

237
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,909
What do you mean?

238
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,958
Well, you know when you
were asking me about your...?

239
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,829
-My nose?
-Yes, well, there's a reason it's like it is.

240
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,513
What is it?

241
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,593
Well, I suppose I should have
told you a long time ago, but....

242
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,797
Well, Brian...

243
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,917
-...your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
-I never thought he was.

244
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,718
Now, none of your cheek!

245
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,348
He was a Roman, Brian.

246
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,034
He was a centurion in the Roman army.

247
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,193
-You mean you were raped?!
-Well, at first, yes.

248
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,114
-Who was it?
-Naughtius Maximus his name was.

249
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,510
Promised me the known world,
he did.

250
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,478
I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forum...

251
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,551
...slaves, asses' milk...

252
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,950
...as much gold as I could eat.

253
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,233
Then he, having his way with me he had:
Like a rat out of an aqueduct.

254
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,594
The bastard.

255
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,752
Yes, and next time you go on
about the "bloody Romans"...

256
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,117
-...don't forget you're one of them.
-I'm not a Roman, Mum.

257
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,433
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.

258
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,276
I'm kosher, Mum. I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian and proud of it!

259
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,197
Sex, sex, sex, that's all
they think about, huh?

260
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,954
Well, how are you then, officer?

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,591
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest is between...

262
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,470
...Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian baby-crusher...

263
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,189
...and Boris Mineburg.

264
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,839
Thank you, madam.

265
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,918
Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers.

266
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,153
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

267
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,914
Wolf-nipple chips.
Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.

268
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,516
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats....

269
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,355
I do feel, Reg, that any
anti-imperialist group like ours...

270
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,195
...must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

271
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,909
-Agreed. Francis?
-Judith's point of view is very valid...

272
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,834
...provided the movement never forgets
it is the unalienable right of every man...

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,274
-Or woman.
-...or woman...

274
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,078
-...to rid himself--
-Or herself.

275
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,275
-Agreed.
-Thanks, brother.

276
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,670
-Or sister.
-Or sister....

277
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,112
Where was l?

278
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,109
-I think you finished.
-Right.

279
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,590
-lt is the birthright of every man--
-Or woman.

280
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,069
Shut up about women, Stan.
You're putting us off.

281
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,913
Women have a perfect right to play
a part in our movement.

282
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,071
Why are you always
on about women, Stan?

283
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,711
I want to be one.

284
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,034
What?

285
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,316
I want to be a woman.

286
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,758
From now on, I want you
all to call me Loretta.

287
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,832
-What?
-It's my right as a man.

288
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,675
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

289
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,190
I want to have babies.

290
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,998
You want to have babies?!

291
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,720
It's every man's right to have
babies if he wants them.

292
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,872
-But you can't have babies.
-Don't you oppress me.

293
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,396
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.

294
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,792
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?

295
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,071
Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree
that he can't actually have babies...

296
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,516
...not having a womb, which is nobody's
fault, not even the Romans'...

297
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,673
-...but he has the right to have babies.
-Good idea, Judith.

298
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,833
We shall fight the oppressors for your
right to have babies, brother. Sister.

299
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,275
-What's the point?
-What?

300
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,673
Why fight for his right to have babies
when he can't have babies?

301
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,678
It is symbolic of our struggle
against oppression.

302
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

303
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,593
-Get out there. Get out.
-It's dangerous out there.

304
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,159
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.

305
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,992
-Got any nuts?
-Haven't got any nuts.

306
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,630
-I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens--
-No, no, no.

307
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,189
-Otters' noses?
-I don't want any Roman rubbish.

308
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,318
-Why don't you sell proper food?
-Proper food?

309
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,918
-Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
-Don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this.

310
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,594
-All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
-Make it two.

311
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,876
-Two.
-Thanks, Reg.

312
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,554
-Are you the Judean People's Front?
-Fuck off.

313
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,435
-What?
-Judean People's Front.

314
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,750
We're The People's Front of Judea.

315
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,475
-Judean People's Front, God!
-Wankers.

316
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,638
-Can I join your group?
-No, piss off.

317
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,675
I didn't want to sell this. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.

318
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,549
-Are you sure?
-Dead sure.

319
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,312
I hate the Romans already.

320
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,356
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ,
you'd have to really hate the Romans.

321
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,112
I do.

322
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,397
-Oh, yeah, how much?
-A lot.

323
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,671
Right, you're in. Listen...

324
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,472
...the only people we hate more than
Romans are the Judean People's Front.

325
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,598
-Splitters.
-And the Judean Popular People's Front.

326
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,034
-Oh, yeah.
-Splitters.

327
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,760
-And the People's Front of Judea.
-Yeah. Splitters.

328
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,275
-What?
-The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.

329
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
We're the People's Front of Judea.

330
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,916
-I thought we were the Popular Front.
-People's Front.

331
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,992
Whatever happened
to the Popular Front, Reg?

332
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,275
He's over there.

333
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,395
Splitter!

334
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,955
I think I'm about to have
a cardiac arrest.

335
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,871
Absolutely dreadful.

336
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,916
-What's your name?
-Brian. Brian Cohen.

337
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,036
We may have a little job for you, Brian.

338
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,109
What's this then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?

339
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,278
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

340
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,954
It says, "Romans go home."

341
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,317
No, it doesn't. What's Latin for Roman?

342
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,072
-Come on.
-Romanus?

343
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,514
-Goes like...?
-Anus?

344
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,194
Vocative plural of anus is...?

345
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,272
-Ani?
-Romani.

346
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,795
-"Eunt"? What is eunt?
-Go.

347
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,080
-Conjugate the verb "to go."
-Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.

348
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,037
So eunt is...?

349
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,760
Third person plural, present indicative.
"They go."

350
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,789
But "Romans go home" is an order,
so you must use the...?

351
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,235
-lmperative!
-Which is...?

352
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,276
-Oh, -i.
-How many Romans?

353
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,069
-Plural, plural. Ite. Ite.
-Ite.

354
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,400
Domus? Nominative?

355
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,269
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, boy?

356
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,989
Dative! Not dative,
not the dative, sir!

357
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,593
The accusative! Accusative!
Domum, sir. Ad domum.

358
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,513
-Except that domus takes the...?
-The locative, sir.

359
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,795
-Which is...?
-Domum!

360
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,110
Domum.

361
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,675
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

362
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,912
-Write that 100 times.
-Yes, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar.

363
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,719
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.

364
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,071
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

365
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,870
Finished.

366
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,909
Right. Now, don't do it again.

367
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,988
Hey. Bloody Romans.

368
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,115
We get in through the underground
heating-system...

369
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,840
...up through into the main
audience chamber here...

370
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,434
...and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

371
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,269
Having grabbed his wife,
we inform Pilate...

372
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,989
...that she is in our custody,
and forthwith issue our demands.

373
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,555
-Any questions?
-What exactly are the demands?

374
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,117
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle
the entire Roman imperialist state...

375
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,794
...and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

376
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,076
-Cut her head off?
-Cut all her bits off.

377
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,556
Send them back on the hour, every hour.
Show them we're not to be trifled with.

378
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,356
And of course, we point out that they bear
full responsibility when we chop her up...

379
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,796
...and that we shall not
submit to blackmail.

380
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,752
No blackmail!

381
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,629
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

382
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,116
And not just from us! From our fathers,
and from our fathers' fathers.

383
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,396
-And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
-Yeah.

384
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,348
-And our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
-All right, don't labour the point.

385
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,592
And what have they ever
given us in return?

386
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,038
The aqueduct?

387
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,596
-What?
-The aqueduct.

388
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,320
Yeah, they did give us that.
That's true, yeah.

389
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,391
And the sanitation.

390
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,757
Yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

391
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,833
I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation,
the two things the Romans have done.

392
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,389
-And the roads.
-Yeah, obviously the roads.

393
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,790
I mean the roads go
without saying, don't they?

394
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,155
But apart from sanitation,
aqueduct and roads--

395
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,629
-lrrigation.
-Medicine.

396
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,360
-Education.
-Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.

397
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,471
And the wine.

398
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,358
That's something we'd really miss, Reg,
if the Romans left.

399
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,635
Public baths.

400
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,995
It's safe to walk in the streets
at night now.

401
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,434
They know how to keep order.

402
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,956
Let's face it, they're the only ones
who could in a place like this.

403
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,636
All right, but apart from sanitation,
medicine, education, wine, public order...

404
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,270
...irrigation, roads, the fresh-water
system and public health...

405
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,750
...what have the Romans
ever done for us?

406
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,835
-Brought peace?
-Peace. Shut up!

407
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,716
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bented.

408
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,112
-It's all right, Matthias.
-It's all clear.

409
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,190
Well, where's Reg?

410
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,396
Reg. Reg. It's Judith.

411
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,030
-What went wrong?
-The first blow has been struck.

412
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,999
-Did he finish the slogan?
-100 times.

413
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,073
In letters 10 foot high,
all the way around the palace.

414
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,071
Oh, great.

415
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,712
Great. We need doers in our movement,
Brian, but before you join us, know this:

416
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,189
There is not one of us who would not
gladly die...

417
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,635
...to rid this country of the Romans.

418
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,711
Well, one.

419
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,509
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But
otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?

420
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,478
Yes.

421
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,956
From now on, you shall be called,
"Brian, that is called Brian."

422
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,315
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

423
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,630
Right. This is the plan:

424
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,154
Now, this is the palace
in Caesar's Square.

425
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,954
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street...

426
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,278
...and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

427
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,672
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

428
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,877
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the PFJ...

429
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,350
...will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head...

430
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,832
... though he will not be taking part in any
terrorist action, as he has a bad back.

431
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,468
-Aren't you gonna come with us?
-Solidarity, brother.

432
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,234
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.

433
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,312
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

434
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,193
There is a Roman feast later,
so we must move fast...

435
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,715
...and don't wear your best sandals.

436
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,873
Turning left here, we enter
the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.

437
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,474
And from there proceed directly
to the hypocaust.

438
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,475
This has just been re-tiled.
So terrorists, careful with those weapons.

439
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,996
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.

440
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,034
This is the moment
for Habakkuk to get out his prong.

441
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,753
Campaign for Free Galilee.

442
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,750
People's Front of Judea. Officials.

443
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,189
-What's your group doing here?
-We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife.

444
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,588
-So are we.
-What?

445
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,352
That's our plan.

446
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,357
-We were here first.
-What do you mean?

447
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,317
-We thought of it first.
-Oh, yeah?

448
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,516
Yes, a couple of years ago.

449
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,478
-We did.
-You got all your demands worked out?

450
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,551
-Of course we have.
-What are they?

451
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,075
-Well, I'm not telling you.
-Pull the other one.

452
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,629
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

453
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,789
-Did not.
-We did.

454
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,110
-You didn't.
-We bloody did!

455
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,350
Bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

456
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,476
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.

457
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,392
-All right.
-Why you sly--

458
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,160
Brothers! Brothers!
We should be struggling together!

459
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,351
We are.

460
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,788
We mustn't fight each other!

461
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,997
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy!

462
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,197
The Judean People's Front?!

463
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,874
No, no, the Romans!

464
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,235
-Oh, yeah.
-Yes.

465
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,873
-Yeah, he's right.
-Look out!

466
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,672
Careful.

467
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,596
-Right! Where were we?
-You were gonna punch me.

468
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,988
Oh, yeah!

469
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,878
Brothers!

470
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,110
Get off!

471
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,630
-You lucky bastard.
-Who's that?

472
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,997
-You lucky, lucky bastard.
-What?

473
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,232
-Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
-What do you mean?

474
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,834
You must have slipped him
a few shekels, eh?

475
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,838
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!

476
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,828
What wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face?

477
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,471
I sometimes hang awake at night,
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

478
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,319
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!

479
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,397
Manacles!

480
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,268
My idea of heaven...

481
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,399
...is to be allowed to be put in manacles
just for a few hours.

482
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,479
They must think the sun shines
out of your arse, sonny.

483
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,477
Lay off me, I've had a hard time!

484
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,433
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years...

485
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,910
...they only hung me the right way up
yesterday! So don't you come around--

486
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,314
All right, all right.

487
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,958
They must think
you're Lord God almighty.

488
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,715
-What will they do to me?
-You'll probably get away with crucifixion.

489
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,713
-Crucifixion?!
-Yeah. First offence.

490
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,674
-Get away with crucifixion?! It's--
-Best thing the Romans ever did for us.

491
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,989
-What?!
-Oh, yeah.

492
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,913
If we didn't have crucifixion,
this country would be a mess.

493
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,794
-Guard!
-Nail them up, I say!

494
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,833
-Guard!
-Nail some sense into them!

495
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,991
-What do you want?
-I want you to move me to another cell.

496
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,352
Oh, look at that! Bloody favouritism!

497
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,188
-Shut up, you.
-Sorry.

498
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,714
Now, take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

499
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,950
Every night they take me down
for 20 minutes...

500
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,348
...then they hang me up again.

501
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,159
Which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

502
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,951
And if nothing else, it's taught me
to respect the Romans...

503
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,510
...and it's taught me that
you'll never get anywhere in this life...

504
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,958
...unless you are prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's--

505
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,515
Shut up!

506
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,110
-Pilate wants to see you!
-Me?

507
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,153
-Come on!
-Pilate? What does he want to see me for?

508
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,869
I think he wants to know which
way you ought to be crucified.

509
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,999
-Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
-Shut up!

510
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,152
Right. Right.

511
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,835
Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.

512
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,034
-Hail Caesar.
-Hail.

513
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,395
Only one survivor, sir.

514
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,278
Throw him to the floor.

515
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,194
-What, sir?
-Throw him to the floor.

516
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,112
Now, what is your name, Jew?

517
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,995
-Brian, sir.
-Brian, eh?

518
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,918
No, no, Brian.

519
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,954
The little rascal has spirit.

520
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,997
-Has what, sir?
-Spirit.

521
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,071
Yes, he did, sir.

522
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,234
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.

523
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,638
About 11, sir.

524
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,152
So....

525
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,308
-You dare to raid us?
-To what, sir?

526
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,109
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.

527
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,840
And throw him to the floor, sir?

528
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,911
-What?
-Throw him to the floor again, sir?

529
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,197
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.

530
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,831
Now, Jewish rapscallion....

531
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,952
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.

532
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,794
-A Roman?
-No, no, Roman.

533
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,076
So your father was a Roman?

534
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,639
Who was he?

535
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,509
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

536
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,272
Really?

537
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,752
-What was his name?
-Naughtius Maximus.

538
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,159
Centurion, do you have anyone
of that name in the garrison?

539
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,152
Well, no, sir.

540
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,073
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

541
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,869
Well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.

542
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,273
Like "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

543
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,792
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?

544
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,913
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

545
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,348
I have a very great friend in Rome
called Biggus Dickus.

546
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,873
Silence! What is all this insolence?

547
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,271
You will find yourself
in gladiator school very quickly...

548
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,192
...with rotten behaviour like that.

549
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,994
Can I go now, sir?

550
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,595
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.

551
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,752
-Right! Take him away!
-Sir, he--

552
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,798
No, no, I want him fighting
rabid wild animals within a week!

553
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,236
Yes, sir. Come on, you.

554
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,074
I will not have my friends ridiculed
by the common soldiery!

555
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,031
Anybody else feel like a little...

556
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,633
...giggle...

557
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,837
...when I mention my friend...

558
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,191
...Biggus...

559
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,231
...Dickus?

560
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,793
And what about you?

561
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,270
Do you find it risible...

562
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,151
...when I say the name...

563
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,276
...Biggus...

564
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,351
...Dickus?

565
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,351
He has a wife, you know.

566
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,792
You know what she's called?

567
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,677
She's called...

568
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,115
...Incontinentia.

569
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,395
Incontinentia Buttocks. Shut up!

570
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,073
What is all this?

571
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,676
I've had enough of this rowdy-rebel,
sniggering behaviour!

572
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,957
Silence!
You call yourselves centurion guards?

573
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,675
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

574
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,990
You lucky bastard.

575
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,354
And the beast's head
shall be huge and black...

576
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,877
...and the eyes. They're of red,
with the blood of living creatures!

577
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,792
And the whore of Babylon shall ride
forth on a three-headed serpent...

578
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,909
...and throughout the land
shall be a great rubbing of parts.

579
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,073
And the demon shall bear
a nine-bladed sword!

580
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,438
Nine-bladed! Not two
or five or seven, but nine!

581
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,116
Which he will wield on all wretched
sinners. Sinners just like you, sir, there.

582
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,319
-And the horns shall be on the head....
-Through Hebediah, his servant...

583
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,270
...there shall in that time be rumours
of things going astray...

584
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,752
...and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

585
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,833
And nobody will really know
where lieth those little things...

586
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,312
...with the sort of raffia-work base,
that has an attachment.

587
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,635
At this time, a friend shall
lose his friend's hammer...

588
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,712
...and the young shall not
know where lieth...

589
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,757
...the things possessed
by their fathers...

590
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,515
...that their fathers put there only
just the night before, about 8:00.

591
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,518
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...

592
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,229
...that in that time shall the turds....

593
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,231
-How much? Quickly.
-What?

594
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,756
-It's for the wife.
-Twenty shekels.

595
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,319
-Right.
-What?

596
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,118
-There you are.
-Wait a minute.

597
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,430
-What?
-Well, we're supposed to haggle.

598
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,352
-No, I've got to--
-What do you mean, "No"?

599
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,953
-I haven't got time--
-Give it back.

600
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,792
-No, no, no, I just paid you.
-Burt.

601
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,951
-Yeah?
-This bloke won't haggle.

602
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,680
-Won't haggle?!
-All right, do we have to?

603
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,513
-Now look, I want 20 for that.
-I just gave you 20.

604
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,989
-Are you telling me that's not worth 20?
-No.

605
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,469
Look. Feel the quality,
that's none of your goat.

606
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,359
-All right, I'll give you 19.
-No, come on, do it properly.

607
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,988
-What?
-Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.

608
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,799
-Well, you just said it was worth 20.
-Oh, dear, oh, dear.

609
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,996
-Come on, haggle.
-All right, I'll give you 10.

610
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,311
That's more like it.
Ten? Are you trying to insult me?

611
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,278
Me, with a poor,
dying grandmother? Ten?

612
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,079
-All right, I'll give you 11.
-Now you're getting it. 11?!

613
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,878
Did I hear you right? 11?

614
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,793
-This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
-Seventeen?

615
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,474
-No, no, no, no, "17"!
-Eighteen?

616
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,473
-No, no, you go to 14 now.
-All right, I'll give you 14.

617
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,638
-Fourteen!? Are you joking?
-That's what you told me to say!

618
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,870
-Oh, dear.
-Tell me what to say, please!

619
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,792
-Offer me 14.
-I'll give you 14.

620
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,833
-He's offering me 14 for this!
-Fifteen!

621
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,112
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

622
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,912
-Sixteen.
-Done.

623
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,913
Nice to do business with you.

624
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,355
-I'll throw you in this as well.
-I don't want it.

625
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,033
-Burt.
-Yeah.

626
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,191
-All right.
-Now, where's the 16 you owe me?

627
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,475
I just gave you 20.

628
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,359
-That's right, that's four I owe you.
-No, that's all right.

629
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,512
-No, I've got it here.
-It's all right, that's four for the gourd.

630
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,069
Four? For this gourd? Four!?

631
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,310
It's worth 10
if it's worth a shekel!

632
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,512
-You just gave it to me for nothing.
-Yes, but it's worth 10.

633
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,279
All right, all right.

634
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,071
No, no, no, no, it's not worth 10,
you're supposed to argue.

635
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,549
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"

636
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,431
Oh, well. One born every minute.

637
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,472
-Daniel.
-Daniel.

638
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,675
-Job.
-Job.

639
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,273
-Job.
-Joshua.

640
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,634
-Joshua.
-Joshua.

641
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,869
-Judges.
-Judges.

642
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,598
-Judges.
-And Brian.

643
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,115
-And Brian.
-And Brian.

644
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,955
I now propose that all seven
of these ex-brothers...

645
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,237
...be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

646
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,915
-I second that, Reg.
-Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

647
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,959
Siblings, let us not be down on it.

648
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,716
One total catastrophe like this
is just the beginning!

649
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,678
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in a--

650
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,950
Look out!

651
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,992
Hello?

652
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,832
Matthias?

653
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,478
-Reg.
-Go away.

654
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,833
-Reg, it's me, Brian.
-Get off. Get off out of it.

655
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,149
-Stan?
-Piss off.

656
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,675
-Yeah, piss off.
-Bugger off.

657
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,671
Shit!

658
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,671
Coming.

659
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,636
Yea, verily at that time,
which is written in the Book of Obadiah...

660
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,958
...a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey...

661
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,237
...and anyone in the vicinity
of either the nephew or the donkey.

662
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,591
My eyes are dim, I cannot see.

663
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,512
-Are you Matthias?
-Yes.

664
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,274
We believe you may
be hiding one Brian of Nazareth...

665
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,637
...member of the terrorist organization
the People's Front of Judea.

666
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,316
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.

667
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,553
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled,
my eyes are old and bent--

668
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,869
Quiet!

669
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,033
Silly person. Guards, search the house.

670
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,358
You know the penalty laid down by Roman
law for harbouring a known criminal?

671
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,637
-No.
-Crucifixion.

672
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,390
-Nasty, eh?
-lt could be worse.

673
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,678
-What do you mean, "could be worse"?
-Well, you could be stabbed.

674
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,671
Stabbed? It takes a second.

675
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,038
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.

676
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,875
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

677
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,554
You're weird.

678
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,312
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.

679
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,473
Well, don't worry, you've not seen
the last of us, weirdo.

680
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,029
-Big nose.
-Watch it!

681
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,310
That was lucky.

682
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,749
-I'm sorry, Reg.
-Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.

683
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,514
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion
to our headquarters.

684
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,272
Well, that's all right then, Brian.

685
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,432
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.

686
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,079
You klutz!

687
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,268
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed--

688
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,349
--with a great juicy melon behind.

689
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,190
My legs are old and bent,
my ears are grizzled, yes?

690
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,352
There's one place we didn't look. Guards!

691
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,470
I'm just a poor old man, my sight is dim,
my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.

692
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,509
-Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
-Crucifixion's a doddle.

693
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,478
Don't keep saying that.

694
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,990
Found this spoon, sir.

695
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,754
Well done, sergeant.

696
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,754
We'll be back, oddball.

697
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,591
-Open up.
-You haven't given us time to hide.

698
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,791
Don't pass judgment on other people,
or you might get judged yourself.

699
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,995
What?

700
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,435
I said, don't pass judgment
on other people...

701
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,160
...or else you might get judged too.

702
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,594
-Who, me?
-Yes.

703
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,230
-Thank you very much.
-Well, not just you, all of you.

704
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,516
-That's a nice gourd.
-What?

705
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,796
-How much do you want for the gourd?
-You can have it.

706
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,554
-Have it?
-Yes. Consider the lilies.

707
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,836
-Don't you want to haggle?
-No. In the field.

708
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,036
-What's wrong with it, then?
-Nothing, take it.

709
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,073
-Consider the lilies?
-Well, the birds, then.

710
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,719
-What birds?
-Any birds.

711
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,838
-Why?
-Well, have they got jobs?

712
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,513
-Who?
-The birds.

713
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,398
Have the birds got jobs?!

714
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,433
-What's the matter with him?
-He says the birds are scrounging.

715
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,751
No, the point is the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

716
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,520
-Well, and good luck to them!
-Yeah, they're very pretty.

717
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,679
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

718
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,115
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?

719
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,710
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

720
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,669
I haven't got anything against birds.
Consider lilies--

721
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,752
-He's having a go at the flowers now.
-Give the flowers a chance.

722
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,911
-I'll give you one for it.
-It's yours!

723
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,308
Two then.

724
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,994
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants--

725
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,235
-What were they called?
-What?

726
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,470
-What were their names?
-I don't know.

727
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,993
And he gave them some talents--

728
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,469
-You don't know?
-Well, it doesn't matter.

729
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,471
He doesn't know what they were called!

730
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,676
Oh, they were called
Simon and Adrian. Now--

731
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,159
You said you didn't know!

732
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,880
It doesn't matter,
the point is there were two servants--

733
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,793
-He's making it up as he goes along!
-No, I'm not!

734
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,235
And he gave them--
Wait a minute, were there three?

735
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,595
-He's terrible.
-There were three--

736
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,951
-He's still a traitor!
-Oh, get off!

737
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,433
Now hear this. Blessed are they...

738
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,991
...who convert their neighbour's ox,
for they shall inhibit their girth.

739
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,188
-Rubbish!
-And to them only shall be given....

740
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,510
To them only...

741
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,232
...shall be given....

742
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,593
What?

743
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,479
-Shall be given what?
-Oh, nothing.

744
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,272
-What were you going to say?
-Nothing.

745
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,556
-You were going to say something.
-I finished.

746
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,870
-Oh, no, no.
-Come on, tell us before you go.

747
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,036
-I wasn't going to say anything.
-No, you hadn't.

748
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,997
-What won't he tell us?
-He won't say.

749
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,513
-ls it a secret?
-No.

750
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,591
-ls it?
-lt must be, otherwise he'd tell us.

751
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,239
-Tell us.
-Leave me alone.

752
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,789
-What is the secret?
-ls it the secret of eternal life?

753
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,949
He won't say!

754
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,509
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

755
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,432
-Leave me alone.
-Just tell me, please.

756
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,989
-No, tell us, master, we were here first.
-Rubbish!

757
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,798
-Five!
-Go away!

758
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,757
-Tell us, master.
-I can't go above 5.

759
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,753
-ls that his gourd?
-Yes, but it's under offer.

760
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,037
-This is his gourd.
-Ten!

761
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,149
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.

762
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,878
Master?

763
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,316
He's gone. He's been taken up.

764
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,790
-Oh, he has been taken up!
-Eighteen!

765
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,552
No, there he is. Over there.

766
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,352
Look!

767
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,748
-He has given us a sign.
-He has given us his shoe.

768
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,559
The shoe is the sign!
Let us follow his example!

769
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,234
-What?
-Let us, like him...

770
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,868
...hold up one shoe and let the other
be upon our foot...

771
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,316
...for this is his sign that all who
follow him shall do likewise!

772
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,349
No, no, the shoe is a sign that we must
gather shoes together in abundance.

773
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,150
-Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
-No, let us gather shoes together.

774
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,833
-Let me!
-Oh, get off!

775
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,036
No, it is a sign that, like him,
we must think...

776
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,919
...not of the things of the body,
but of the face and head!

777
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,833
-Give me your shoe!
-Get off!

778
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,037
Follow the gourd,
the holy gourd of Jerusalem!

779
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,998
-The gourd!
-Hold up the sandal, like he has--

780
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,799
-lt is a shoe! It is a shoe!
-It's a sandal!

781
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,838
-No, it isn't! It is a shoe!
-Cast it away!

782
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,399
-Put it on!
-Now clear off.

783
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,551
Take the shoes and follow him!

784
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,840
Come all ye who call
yourselves Gourdenes.

785
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,432
Stop, I say.

786
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,910
Stop. Let us....

787
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,036
Let us pray.

788
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,389
Yea, he cometh to us
like the seed to the grave....

789
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,272
Master!

790
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,999
Hey, is there another way down?

791
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,835
Is there another path down to the river?

792
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,956
Please, please, help me! I've got to get--

793
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,480
My foot!

794
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,076
-Damn! Damn! Damn!
-I'm sorry.

795
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,676
-Damn! Damn and blast it!
-I'm sorry!

796
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,958
Don't you shush me. Eighteen years
of total silence, and you shush me.

797
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,271
-What?
-I've kept my vow for 18 years.

798
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,353
Not a single recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

799
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,476
Please be quiet
for another five minutes.

800
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,279
It doesn't matter now,
I might as well enjoy myself.

801
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,830
The times in the last 18 years
I wanted to shout and sing...

802
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,276
...and scream my name out!
Oh, I'm alive!

803
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,790
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive--

804
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,558
Get off! I'm alive!

805
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,311
Master! Master!

806
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,992
The master! He is here!

807
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,469
-The shoe!
-lt was the gourd!

808
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,358
The shoe has brought us!

809
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,592
Speak! Speak to us, master!
Speak to us!

810
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,072
-Go away!
-A blessing! A blessing!

811
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,677
-How shall we go away, master?
-Just go away and leave me alone.

812
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,633
Give us a sign.

813
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,076
He has given us a sign,
he has brought us to this place!

814
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,840
I didn't bring you here!
You just followed me!

815
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,634
It's still a good sign,
by any standard.

816
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,758
Master, your people have walked
many miles to be with you.

817
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,672
They are weary and have not eaten.

818
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,271
-It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
-There is no food in this high mountain.

819
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,438
What about the juniper bushes
over there?

820
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,232
A miracle! A miracle!

821
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,790
He has made the bush
fruitful by his word!

822
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,678
They brought forth juniper berries!

823
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,957
Of course they brought forth
juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.

824
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,235
What do you expect?!

825
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,032
Show us another miracle.

826
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,191
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!

827
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,033
Is not the miracle
of the juniper bushes enough?

828
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,788
-I say, those are my juniper bushes.
-They are a gift from God!

829
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,309
They're all I've bloody got to eat.

830
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,712
I say, get off of those bushes!
Go on! Clear off, the lot of you.

831
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,119
-Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
-I'm healed!

832
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,113
-The master has healed me!
-I didn't touch him!

833
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,669
I was blind, and now I can see!

834
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,958
A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!

835
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,390
Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

836
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,070
A miracle! He is the Messiah!

837
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,070
-And he hurt my foot!
-Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!

838
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,710
-Hail Messiah!
-I'm not the Messiah!

839
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,037
I say you are, Lord.
And I should know, I've followed a few!

840
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,476
-Hail Messiah!
-I'm not the Messiah!

841
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,712
Would you please listen, I am not
the Messiah, do you understand?

842
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,472
Honestly!

843
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,749
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.

844
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,952
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

845
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,877
-All right, I am the Messiah!
-He is! He is the Messiah!

846
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,196
Now, fuck off!

847
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,428
-How shall we fuck off, Lord?
-Just go away! Leave me alone!

848
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,200
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries.

849
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,158
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

850
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,788
...and then you try and clean up
on my juniper bushes!

851
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,794
Lay off! This is the Messiah,
the chosen one!

852
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,793
-No, he's not.
-An unbeliever!

853
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,149
An unbeliever!

854
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:47,229
-Persecute! Kill the heretic!
-Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!

855
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,638
-Kill!
-Leave him alone!

856
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,870
Leave him alone!

857
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,109
Leave him alone.

858
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,039
Put him down. Please!

859
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,233
Brian?

860
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,197
Judith?

861
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,031
Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!

862
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,428
Brian!

863
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,758
Mother!

864
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,191
-Brian!
-Hang on, Mother!

865
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,918
-Hello, Mother.
-Don't you "hello, Mother" me.

866
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,548
-What are those people doing out there?
-Well, l....

867
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,676
Come on! What have you
been up to, my lad?

868
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,035
I think they must have
popped by for something.

869
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,069
Popped by?! Swelled by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!

870
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,878
They started following me yesterday.

871
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,555
Well, they can stop following
you right now.

872
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,751
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

873
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,391
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

874
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,279
-The who?
-The Messiah!

875
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,510
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.

876
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,079
Now go away!

877
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,271
Brian! Brian!

878
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,670
Right, my lad,
what have you been up to?

879
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,632
-Nothing, Mum.
-Come on, out with it.

880
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,552
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.

881
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,076
-What have you been telling them?
-Nothing, l--

882
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,073
-You're only making it worse for yourself.
-Look, I can explain--

883
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,189
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!

884
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,636
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

885
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,438
They believe he can
give them hope.

886
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,355
Hope of a new life,
a new world, a better future!

887
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,590
-Who's that!?
-That's Judith, Mum.

888
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,672
Judith, Mother.

889
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,109
Show us the Messiah!

890
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,792
Now you listen here,
he's not the Messiah!

891
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,236
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!

892
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,194
-Who are you?
-I'm his mother, that's who.

893
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,439
Behold his mother! Behold his mother!

894
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,751
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!

895
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,469
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!

896
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,838
All things to thee, now and always!

897
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,793
Now, don't think you can
get around me like that.

898
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,430
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

899
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,872
Now shove off!

900
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,399
No!

901
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,756
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yes!

902
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,715
-Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
-Yes!

903
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,357
All right then, you can see him
for one minute, but not one second more!

904
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,034
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

905
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,119
-Promise?
-Well, all right.

906
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,752
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.

907
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,514
-But, Mum, Judith--
-Leave that Welsh tart alone.

908
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,989
I don't really want to, Mum.

909
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,996
-Good morning!
-A blessing! A blessing!

910
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,912
No, please. Please, please, listen!

911
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,674
I've got one or two things to say.

912
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,189
Tell us! Tell us both of them!

913
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,117
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.

914
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,670
You don't need to follow anybody!

915
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,516
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!

916
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,831
Yes, we're all individuals!

917
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,911
You're all different.

918
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,873
Yes, we are all different!

919
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,031
I'm not.

920
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,270
You've all got to work it out
for yourselves!

921
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,393
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

922
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,551
Exactly!

923
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,757
-Tell us more!
-No, that's the point!

924
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,878
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

925
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,237
-Otherwise-- Oh, no!
-That's enough! That's enough.

926
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,436
That wasn't a minute.

927
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,991
-Oh, yes, it was.
-Oh, no, it wasn't!

928
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,873
Now stop that, and go away.

929
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,036
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

930
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,514
Are you a virgin?

931
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,270
I beg your pardon?

932
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,599
Well, if it's not a personal question,
are you a virgin?

933
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,430
If it's not a personal question?!
How much more personal can you get?

934
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,955
Now piss off.

935
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,555
-She is.
-Must be. Definitely.

936
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,154
Definitely. Definitely.

937
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,268
Morning, Saviour!

938
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,436
Lay your hands on me! Quick!

939
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,070
Now, don't jostle the chosen one!
Please!

940
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,313
Don't push that baby in the
Saviour's face! He'll touch it later!

941
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,629
I say....

942
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,950
Could he see my wife?
She has a headache.

943
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,519
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!

944
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,910
She's very bad,
and we've got a luncheon!

945
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,593
Look, the lepers are queuing!

946
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,274
Her brother-in-law
is the ex-mayor of Gath.

947
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,228
Can I introduce you to the man who's
letting us have the mounts on Sunday?

948
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,960
-Hello.
-Don't push!

949
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,112
Now keep the noise down, please!

950
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,751
Those possessed by devils, try and keep
them under control a bit! Can't you?

951
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,276
Incurables, you'll just have
to wait for a few minutes.

952
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,399
Women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

953
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,788
Brian?

954
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,988
Brian! You were fantastic!

955
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,232
-You weren't so bad yourself.
-No, what you said just now!

956
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,039
-Quite extraordinary!
-What? Oh, that. Was it?

957
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,193
We don't need leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long.

958
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,750
-Well, yes....
-lt needed saying, and you said it, Brian!

959
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,319
You're very attractive.

960
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,392
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!

961
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,549
I think....

962
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,076
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!

963
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,471
What?
No, that's not what I meant at all!

964
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,757
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!

965
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,672
Right!

966
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,549
Stop it!

967
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,999
Well, Brian, you've given us
a good run for our money.

968
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,991
A what?

969
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,551
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.

970
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,236
Guard!
Do we have any crucifixions today?

971
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,756
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

972
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,517
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?

973
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,671
-Hail Caesar!
-Hail!

974
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,594
The crowd are getting restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.

975
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,033
Disperse them?
But I haven't addressed them yet!

976
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,633
No, I know, sir, but--

977
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,597
My address is a high point
of Passover!

978
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,911
My friend Biggus Dickus has come
all the way from Rome to hear it!

979
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,594
-Hail Caesar!
-Hail Caesar!

980
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,515
You're not....

981
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,990
You're not thinking of giving
it a miss this year, then, sir?

982
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,033
Give it a miss?!

983
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,351
Well, it's just that they're
in a rather funny mood today, sir.

984
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,589
Really, centurion!

985
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,719
I'm surprised to hear a man like you
rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.

986
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,600
-A bit thundery, sir.
-Take him away!

987
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,479
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!

988
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,598
And crucify him well!

989
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,797
Biggus!

990
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,835
-I really wouldn't, sir!
-Out of the way, centurion!

991
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,676
Let me come with you, Pontius. I may be
of assistance if there is a sudden crisis!

992
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,314
Right! Now, item four: attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years.

993
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,438
-Francis, you've done some work on this?
-Yeah, thank you, Reg.

994
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,717
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

995
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,792
...unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next 12 months!

996
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,552
-Twelve months?
-Yeah, 12 months.

997
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,315
And let's face it, as empires go,
this is the big one.

998
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,189
So we gotta get up off our arses
and stop just talking about it!

999
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,349
Hear! Hear!

1000
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,990
I agree! It's action that counts,
not words, and we need action now!

1001
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,189
You're right. We could sit around here
all day, talking, passing resolutions...

1002
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,069
...making clever speeches,
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!

1003
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,471
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless...

1004
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,551
-...and it's getting us nowhere!
-Right!

1005
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,075
I agree!
This is a complete waste of time!

1006
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,509
They've arrested Brian!

1007
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,636
-What?
-They've dragged him off!

1008
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,279
They're gonna crucify him!

1009
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,796
Right!
This calls for immediate discussion!

1010
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,949
-What?!
-lmmediate!

1011
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,109
-Right!
-New motion?

1012
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,513
Completely new motion!
That there be immediate action....

1013
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,033
Once the vote has been taken.

1014
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,919
Obviously once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution--

1015
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,275
-Reg, let's go now, please!
-Right! Right!

1016
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,558
In the light of fresh information
from sibling Judith....

1017
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,631
-Not so fast, Reg.
-Reg, for God's sake!

1018
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,756
It's perfectly simple!

1019
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,718
All you've gotta do is to go out
of that door now...

1020
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,388
...and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1021
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,959
It's happening, Reg!

1022
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,910
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?

1023
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,630
-Yeah, hello.
-Another little ego trip from the feminists.

1024
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,268
-What?
-Sorry, Loretta.

1025
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,271
Read that back, would you?

1026
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,319
Next.

1027
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,833
-Crucifixion?
-Yes.

1028
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,551
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1029
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,914
Next.

1030
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,274
Crucifixion?

1031
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:33,753
Good. Out of the door, line on the left,
one cross each. Next.

1032
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,798
-Crucifixion?
-No, freedom.

1033
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,154
-What?
-Freedom for me.

1034
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,472
They said I hadn't done anything
so I could go free and live on an island.

1035
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,551
That's jolly good.
Well, off you go, then.

1036
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,553
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1037
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,472
I see. Very good, very good.

1038
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,755
Well, out of the door.

1039
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,229
Out of the door,
one cross each, line on the left.

1040
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,392
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?

1041
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,754
-Yes.
-Good.

1042
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,152
People of Jerusalem!

1043
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,633
Rome is your friend!

1044
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,155
To prove our friendship,
it is customary at this time...

1045
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,711
...to release a wrongdoer
from our prisons.

1046
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,314
Whom would you have me release?

1047
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,358
Release Roger!

1048
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,149
Release Roger! Release Roger!

1049
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,351
Very well, I shall release Roger!

1050
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,396
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.

1051
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:03,314
-What?
-We don't have anyone of that name, sir.

1052
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,153
We have no Roger!

1053
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,355
But what about Roderick, then?

1054
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,035
Release Roderick! Release Roderick!

1055
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,751
Centurion, why do they titter so?

1056
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,514
Just some Jewish joke, sir.

1057
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,872
Are they ragging me?

1058
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,595
Oh, no, sir!

1059
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,032
Very well. I shall release Roderick!

1060
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,031
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.

1061
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,192
-No Roger, no Roderick?
-Sorry, sir.

1062
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,956
Who is this--?
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?

1063
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,633
He is a robber!

1064
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,599
And a rapist!

1065
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,629
And a pickpocket!

1066
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,672
He sounds a notorious criminal.

1067
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,512
We haven't got him, sir.

1068
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,238
Do we have anyone in our prisons?

1069
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,152
-We've got a Samson, sir.
-Samson?

1070
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,110
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Silas the Syrian Assassin.

1071
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,989
Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1072
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,149
Sixty-seven....

1073
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,595
-Let me speak to them, Pontius!
-Oh, no!

1074
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,193
Good idea, Biggus!

1075
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:26,799
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee
Strangler, Silas the Assyrian Assassin...

1076
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,794
...several seditious scribes
from Caesarea--

1077
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,678
Next.

1078
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,111
-Crucifixion?
-Yes.

1079
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,319
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each. Jailor?

1080
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,995
-Excuse me? There's been a mistake--
-Just a moment, would you? Jailor?

1081
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,948
-How many have come through?
-What?

1082
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,839
How many have come through?

1083
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,989
What?

1084
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,072
You'll have to speak....

1085
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,355
Speak up, sir.
He's-- He's d--

1086
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,399
He's deaf-- Deaf as a post, sir.

1087
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,189
How many have come through?

1088
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,880
-Oh, dear.
-I make it 90--

1089
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,598
Ninety--

1090
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,239
Ninety--

1091
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,191
Ninety-six, sir.

1092
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,749
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1093
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,990
No, sir!

1094
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,073
Not with these b--
Bastards, sir!

1095
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,950
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.

1096
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,554
I don't think you could
say it's good, it's nasty!

1097
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,756
It's not as n--

1098
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,791
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1099
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,952
-Now, crucifixion?
-ls there someone I could speak to?

1100
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,351
-Well....
-I know where to get it if you want it.

1101
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,513
-What?
-Don't worry about him, sir. He's de--

1102
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,389
He's deaf and mad, sir.

1103
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,152
Well, how did he get the job?

1104
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,595
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!

1105
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,719
Get a move on, big nose! There's people
waiting to be crucified out here!

1106
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,952
Could I see a lawyer or someone?

1107
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,111
-Do you have a lawyer?
-No, but I'm a Roman.

1108
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,589
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.

1109
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,196
-Shut up, you!
-Miserable, bloody Romans!

1110
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,430
No sense of humour.

1111
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,589
Sorry, bit of a hurry.

1112
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,038
Can you go straight out,
line on the left, one cross each? Now....

1113
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,552
Was it something I said?

1114
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:46,039
Silence!

1115
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,079
This man commands a crack legion!

1116
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,958
He ranks as high as any in Rome!

1117
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,873
Crucifixion party?

1118
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,869
Morning.

1119
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,238
Now, we will be on show as we go through
the town, so let's not let the side down!

1120
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,472
Keep in a line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1121
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,392
...and a good, steady pace.

1122
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,189
Crosses over your left shoulders,
and if you keep your backs hard up...

1123
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,716
...against the crossbeam
you'll be there in no time.

1124
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,949
All right, centurion!

1125
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,270
Crucifixion party!

1126
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,351
Wait for it.

1127
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,795
Crucifixion party!

1128
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,919
By the left! Forward!

1129
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,469
You lucky bastards!

1130
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,389
You lucky, jabby bastards!

1131
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,238
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!

1132
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,472
Thank you.

1133
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,552
-Hey! Hey!
-What do you think you're doing?

1134
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,755
It's not my cross--

1135
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,913
Shut up and get on with it!
Come on!

1136
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,437
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!

1137
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,110
All right!

1138
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,475
I will give you one more chance!

1139
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,590
This time I want to hear
no Rubens, no Reginalds...

1140
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,718
...no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.

1141
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,791
No Spencer Tracys!

1142
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,791
Or we shall release no one!

1143
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,552
Release Brian!

1144
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,073
Yeah, that's a good one!

1145
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,756
Release Brian! Release Brian!

1146
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,477
Very well! That's it!

1147
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,870
-Sir, we have got a Brian, sir.
-What?

1148
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:49,068
-You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
-Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.

1149
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,357
-Well, go and free him, straight away!
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1150
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:00,317
Very well. I shall release Brian!

1151
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,109
-Get a move on, there!
-Or what?

1152
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,508
Or you'll be in trouble!

1153
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:11,878
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to
give up being crucified in the afternoons?

1154
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,315
-Shut up!
-That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

1155
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,357
I wouldn't have nothing to do!

1156
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,919
Thank you!

1157
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,950
Are they gone?

1158
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,873
We've got lumps of it around the back.

1159
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,075
What?

1160
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,834
Don't worry about him sir,
he's ma--

1161
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,990
-He's mad, sir.
-Have they gone?

1162
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,838
-Oh, come on.
-Yes, sir.

1163
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,194
-Anyway, get on with the story.
-Well, I just never really liked them, so l--

1164
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,874
Right! The motion to get on with it
passed with one abstention.

1165
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,395
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a second?

1166
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,630
-Let's just go.
-Yeah.

1167
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,111
-Bloody Romans!
-Watch it! Still a few crosses left!

1168
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,228
Up you go, big nose!

1169
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,038
I'll get you for this, you bastard!

1170
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,476
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.

1171
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,153
-No?
-I warn you.

1172
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,437
I'm gonna punch you so hard,
you Roman git!

1173
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,670
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

1174
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,753
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!

1175
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,718
A Samaritan? This is supposed
to be a Jewish section!

1176
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,475
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1177
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,916
It may not matter to you,
but it matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?

1178
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,274
Oh, rather!

1179
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,396
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy...

1180
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,478
...we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1181
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,710
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!

1182
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,916
And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1183
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,790
All right, all right, all right!
We'll soon settle this!

1184
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,273
Hands up, all those who
don't want to be crucified here!

1185
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,192
Right! Next!

1186
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,318
-Look, it's not my cross.
-What?

1187
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,675
It's not my cross,
I was holding it for someone.

1188
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,197
-Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
-Of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss--

1189
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,352
Look, we've had a busy day,
and there's 140 of you lot to get up.

1190
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,875
-ls he Jewish?
-Will you be quiet?!

1191
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,076
We don't want more
Samaritans around here.

1192
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,434
Belt up!

1193
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,036
-Will you let me down if he comes back?
-Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down.

1194
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,758
-Next!
-You don't have to do this!

1195
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,879
-You don't have to take orders!
-I like orders.

1196
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,433
See? Not so bad once you're up.

1197
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,069
-You're being rescued then, are you?
-It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?

1198
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,117
No, we've got a couple of days up here.

1199
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,350
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1200
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,556
Oh, yeah.
My brother usually rescues me.

1201
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,439
If he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1202
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,513
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

1203
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,395
Hello. Your family arrived then?

1204
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,595
Reg!

1205
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,911
-Hello, sibling Brian.
-Thank God you've come, Reg.

1206
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:45,392
I think I should point out in fairness
that we are not the rescue committee.

1207
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,393
However, I have been asked to read
this prepared statement...

1208
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,198
...on behalf of the movement.

1209
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,477
"We, the People's Front of Judea,
brackets, officials, end brackets...

1210
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,952
...do hereby convey our sincere fraternal
and sisterly greetings to you, Brian...

1211
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,237
-...on this occasion of your martyrdom."
-What?

1212
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,870
"Your death will stand as a landmark
in the continuing struggle to liberate...

1213
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,396
...the parent land from the hands
of the Roman imperialist aggressors...

1214
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,677
...excluding those concerned with
drainage, medicine, roads, housing...

1215
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,118
...education. And any other Romans
contributing to the welfare of Jews...

1216
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,669
...of both sexes
and hermaphrodites."

1217
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,638
Signed, "On behalf of the PF.J.,
et cetera."

1218
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,792
And I'd just like to add, on
a personal note, my own admiration...

1219
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:30,114
...for what you're doing for us and what
must be, after all, for you, a difficult time.

1220
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,512
-Reg! What are you going to do?
-Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.

1221
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,231
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.

1222
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,709
Terrific work, Brian.

1223
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,552
Right. And:

1224
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,836
For he's a jolly good fellow

1225
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,991
For he's a jolly good fellow

1226
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,833
For he's a jolly good fellow

1227
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,911
And so say all of us

1228
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,640
And so say all of--

1229
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,637
You bastards! You bastards!

1230
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,792
-Where is Brian of Nazareth?
-You sanctimonious bastards!

1231
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,714
-I have an order for his release.
-You stupid bastards!

1232
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,836
-I'm Brian of Nazareth.
-What?

1233
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,638
-I'm Brian of Nazareth.
-Take him down!

1234
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,438
I'm Brian of Nazareth!

1235
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,554
-I'm Brian!
-I'm Brian!

1236
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,517
Look, look, I'm Brian!

1237
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,638
-I'm Brian!
-I'm Brian and so is my wife!

1238
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,991
-Right! Take him away and release him!
-No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian.

1239
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,232
No, I'm not Brian! I was only--
It was a joke.

1240
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,868
I'm only pulling your leg!
It's a joke!

1241
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,349
I'm not him,
I'm just having you on!

1242
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,069
Put me back!
Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.

1243
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,318
The Judean People's Front!

1244
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,595
The Judean People's Front!

1245
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,389
Forward, all!

1246
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,389
-Look out! The Judean People's Front!
-The Judean People's Front!

1247
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,074
The Judean People's Front!

1248
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,954
We are the Judean People's Front,
crack suicide squad.

1249
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,238
Suicide squad, attack!

1250
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,318
That showed them, huh?

1251
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,469
You silly sods!

1252
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,312
Brian!

1253
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,116
Judith!

1254
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:55,832
Terrific! Great! Reg explained it to me,
and I think it's great what you're doing.

1255
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,232
Thank you, Brian. I'll never forget you.

1256
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,794
So there you are!

1257
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,110
I might have known
it would end up like this.

1258
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,114
Just think of all the love
and affection I've wasted on you!

1259
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,874
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor, old mother...

1260
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,316
...in the autumn years of her life,
all I can say is:

1261
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,359
Go ahead. Be crucified.
See if I care.

1262
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:32,355
-I might have known.
-Mum! Mum!

1263
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,590
I don't know what
the world is coming to.

1264
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,159
Cheer up, Brian!

1265
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,436
You know what they say?

1266
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,273
Some things in life are bad.

1267
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,954
They can really make you mad.

1268
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,874
Other things just make
you swear and curse.

1269
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,315
When you're chewing on life's gristle

1270
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,756
Don't grumble
Give a whistle

1271
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:03,152
And this'll help things
Turn out for the best

1272
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,912
And

1273
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:10,950
Always look on the bright side of life

1274
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:18,478
Always look on the light side of life

1275
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,071
If life seems jolly rotten

1276
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,958
There's something you've forgotten

1277
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,669
And that's to laugh and smile
And dance and sing

1278
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,592
When you're feeling in the dumps

1279
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,876
Don't be silly chumps

1280
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,952
Just purse your lips and whistle
That's the thing

1281
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:41,309
And always look on
The bright side of life

1282
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,277
Come on!

1283
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,555
Always look on the right side of life

1284
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,838
For life is quite absurd

1285
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,672
And death's the final word

1286
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,435
You must always face
The curtain with a bow

1287
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,397
Forget about your sin

1288
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,551
Give the audience a grin

1289
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,678
Enjoy it
It's your last chance anyhow

1290
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:11,312
So always look on
The bright side of death

1291
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:18,956
Just before
You draw your terminal breath

1292
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,752
Life's a piece of shit

1293
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,638
When you look at it

1294
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,349
Life's a laugh and death's a joke
It's true

1295
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,158
You'll see it's all a show

1296
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,117
Keep 'em laughing as you go

1297
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,795
Just remember that
The last laugh is on you

1298
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:42,990
And always look on
The bright side of life

1299
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:50,030
Always look on the right side of life

1300
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,794
Come on, Brian! Cheer up!

1301
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:58,318
Always look on the bright side of life

1302
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,076
Always look on the bright side of life

1303
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,038
Worse things happen at sea,
you know?

1304
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,192
Always look on the bright side of life

1305
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,669
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing...

1306
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,751
...you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost?

1307
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,239
Nothing!

1308
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,474
Nothing will come from nothing,
you know what they say?

1309
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,153
Cheer up, you old bugger!

1310
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,788
Come on! Give us a grin!
There you are!

1311
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,909
See? The end of the film. Incidentally,
this record is available in the foyer.

1312
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,831
Some of us have got to live
as well, you know?

1313
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,833
Who do you think pays
for all this rubbish?

1314
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,514
They're not gonna make
their money back, you know.

1315
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,352
I told them. I said to him.

1316
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,796
"Bernie," I said,
"They'll never make their money back."
