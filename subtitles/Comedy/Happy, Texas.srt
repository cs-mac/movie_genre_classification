00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:55,881
Hey. Why did the armadillo
cross the road?

3
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:59,880
Why?
It didn't. See.

4
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,923
Can't someone else
be on bag for a while?

5
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:07,243
Excuse me.
Wanna be the bag guy?

6
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,841
Did I say you could speak to me?
Oh, sorry.

7
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,838
When you move up
to committing real crimes...

8
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:14,122
then you can speak to the men.
Put it in the bag.

9
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,880
Hey, wait. Are you gonna just
stand there like some coward...

10
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,401
and let him talk to you
like that?

11
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,047
Hey, goat boy.
The same goes for you.

12
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,402
Now you two damn amateurs
stay in your own yard...

13
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:26,557
or else I'll chain you there.

14
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,240
Goat boy?

15
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,844
Oh, you gonna
get you some now, boy.

16
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,725
Well, then
the light is green.

17
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,001
Guard!

18
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:52,200
I have stood upon the mountain
I have seen the other side

19
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,517
As soon as we get you boys
back to lockup, this is gonna mean...

20
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,120
a week in the hole
for each of you.

21
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:00,556
Goat boy
you fight like a girl.

22
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:04,879
Seen my love forsaken
Felt the pleasure and the pain

23
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:08,164
The light is green.
No, no, no!

24
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,198
Knock it off, goddam it!

25
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,517
I have cried in tears
of sadness

26
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,757
I have cried in tears of joy

27
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,883
I have found a life
worth livin'

28
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,117
From the peace
within the noise

29
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:40,405
I have turned my back on hatred
lyin', prejudice and greed

30
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:45,242
Found the future in the present
Found hope within a seed

31
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:48,524
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, where you goin'?

32
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,440
Hey, if you're escapin'
give us the keys!

33
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,961
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't need keys!

34
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:57,676
I don't even know him.
This ain't adios.

35
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,485
It's just goodbye.

36
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,080
God!
Gotta get outta here.

37
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,443
Hey, I don't even know
who you are.

38
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,242
Harry Sawyer.
Wayne Wayne Wayne Junior.

39
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,438
Hi.
Hi.

40
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:39,004
Now we have three...
count my fingers... three runnin'.

41
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,763
First, a man who likes
to steal cars.

42
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,599
Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr.

43
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,878
Next, Harry Sawyer.

44
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,561
Fraud, credit card scam.

45
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,036
Finally...

46
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:58,005
the reason why we're all here today
boys and girls...

47
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,440
Bob Maslow.

48
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,358
Bob Maslow is a bad man.

49
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:07,200
Let's get the guy
before he kills somebody else.

50
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,517
Get anything
but it has to be nonfat.

51
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,484
Well, this is nonfat.
Don't worry about it.

52
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,956
What about this? Look it. You know, we
don't owe these people a damn thing.

53
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,515
I know. I know.
I'm not happy either, David.

54
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,200
Peas or corn?
Peas.

55
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,518
If I have to listen to one more of those
little monsters butcher "Tomorrow..."

56
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,484
I may end up doing something
very violent.

57
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,478
That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

58
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:28,035
Now I say we dump Happy.
Not that. Well, we can't dump Happy.

59
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,357
That reminds me. We need some toilet
paper. No, not that, the other one.

60
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,677
Okay, stop snapping at me.
It's softer.
I am on your side.

61
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,280
Let's just drop... I am not the enemy.
Listen to me for a second.

62
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,756
Let's just junk that crappy apartment
on wheels... I want this.

63
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,485
And quit this whole stupid business.

64
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,444
I want a real life again, you know?
A little fun.

65
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,438
You remember that word "fun"?
Yes, I do remember fun, Peter.

66
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,246
I want our old life back. You need to
get a new attitude is what you need.

67
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,557
I think that she may have overcharged us.
She did not.

68
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,480
If you would have brought the coupons
maybe we could have saved some money.
No, some of this stuff is not right.

69
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,366
Oh, my God. David.
It's gone.

70
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,005
Somebody stole our crappy camper.

71
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,885
We gotta go call the police.
No, listen to me a second.

72
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,435
Steven, if we call the police
we'll just get it back.

73
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:15,563
What?
But if we wait a couple of weeks...

74
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:20,960
call the insurance company, we can
cash in on the modern American dream.

75
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:23,521
Yes! Yes!
Yes!

76
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,757
Can we go to Maui?
Yes!

77
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,517
Trust me, it's perfection.

78
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,997
Dual tanks on this baby. Even on
back roads, it's more than enough.

79
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,521
Let's get out of Texas.
Go, Daddy, go!

80
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:39,521
A prison break today at the
Jim Hogg County Correctional Facility...

81
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,804
has brought out law enforcement
agencies in four states.

82
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:46,960
The three fugitives, including convicted
murderer Robert Alan Maslow...

83
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,403
escaped from their prison van while
being transported to the facility.

84
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:53,365
Authorities are advising motorists
not to pick up hitchhikers...

85
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,199
and to use caution
at all rest stops.

86
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:58,006
The big prisons are leaking
like a macramé diaphragm.

87
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,204
Texas finest are in full manhunt mode.
Shoot, manhunt mode.

88
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,562
Sounds like a full weekend for
you and your pals. Oh, you.

89
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,321
Hey, you folks, keep an eye out
for three orangejumpsuits...

90
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,160
unless until the marshal gets
those fellas back in the pokey.

91
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:12,364
Hey, comin'up next
another Hollywood actor is in rehab.

92
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,245
And the state's largest tomato
gets auctioned off for charity.

93
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,204
Well, I guess
we better turn around.

94
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,882
So what you're saying is north
is there, right?

95
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:26,678
Well, a little bit. Yep.
Yep. Unless I turn the map this way.

96
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,685
That is so much better.

97
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,564
Come on.

98
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,205
Ow! Yeah, I almost got it.
Come on.

99
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,076
I almost got it.
It's the cops.

100
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,398
It's the cops.
Come on, let's get outta here.

101
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,637
Pop who?
Shit.

102
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:55,080
Hi.
Must be my lucky day.

103
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,203
Lotta folks lookin' for you.
Hey.

104
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,323
Oh, my!

105
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,525
Yeah, we're on our way in, but you
better get your tow truck out there.

106
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:04,562
Over.

107
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,323
Oh, no. I've heard about this before.
Vigilante justice.

108
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,035
We're screwed.
They're gonna hang us.

109
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,685
No.
Yeah, they are.

110
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,246
Shut up.
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,725
Okay, sell me.

112
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,677
What, you want...
you want me to speak?

113
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,316
All we wanna know is if you were
offered one instead of two...

114
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,682
would you take it?

115
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,519
We... We can do one easy.

116
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,837
I know this is not
what you were expecting, but...

117
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,077
I've always found these things
to be negotiable.

118
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,283
You wanna negotiate?
Now hold on.

119
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,880
If it's all the same with you, Judge
we'd rather get less.

120
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,004
Much less. Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Now stop right there.

121
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:51,124
I didn't bring them in so you could
give them less than minimum.

122
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:54,279
These fellas are professionals.
They should get what they deserve.

123
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,961
Damn cop.
We'll take one, Your Honour.

124
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:00,517
Sold American. Let the record show
that they've agreed to one thousand.

125
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,838
Put in the time and date it.
One thousand?

126
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,838
Yes.
Thousand what?

127
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,396
Which one of you is Steven
and which one is David?

128
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,557
What?
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

129
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,684
Which one of you is Steven
and which of you fellas is David?

130
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:18,476
I'm Steven, and this is...
The other... The other one.

131
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:24,199
Well, Steven, we're talking about $ 1000
here, which you've just agreed to.

132
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,006
Two thousand is highway robbery
and you know it.

133
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,124
Now, if we're done here, you go to see
Joe at the bank in the morning.

134
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,563
You can sign for your money then.
Welcome to Happy.

135
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,207
There must be something here
with our names on it.

136
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,401
Midget clothes.

137
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:54,759
We're midgets.
We're not midgets.

138
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:58,442
No. Maybe whoever
owned this had kids.

139
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:01,641
Circus kids.

140
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,399
What about this?

141
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:15,438
Hey. Maybe we're tailors.

142
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:18,564
We travel from town to town...

143
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,480
tailoring dresses for...

144
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,678
circus midgets.

145
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,237
Travelling midget tailors.

146
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,443
Yeah, you think?

147
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:35,916
No.

148
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,846
"Pageant World.

149
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,441
A magazine for the pageant
and talent industry."

150
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,842
Heavy reading.

151
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,685
What is this?

152
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,521
Oh, my.
Whoo!

153
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:03,522
Legs that wrap around you twice.
Yeah.

154
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,238
"Princess pageants at pauper prices.
Dreams come true and we come to you.

155
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:13,401
Trust Steven and David
the pageant professionals."

156
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,921
We put on beauty pageants.

157
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,567
You mean, we drive around
in this thing here...

158
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:21,525
And slide hot bodies
into tight dresses.

159
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,915
I can do that.

160
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:27,125
Hey, it's photos.
Hey.

161
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,443
Yeah. Here we are
in front of the motor home.

162
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,165
Uh huh.

163
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,317
So we're gay.

164
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:51,999
How hard can that be?

165
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,317
It might not be hard for you
Rock Hudson...

166
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:58,116
but I have got heterosexual...
What?

167
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,926
Not gay written all over me.

168
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,759
It's business.
It's for the money.

169
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,476
I don't wanna be gay.
I'm not asking for the world here.

170
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,797
I'm not asking you to act civil.

171
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:13,677
Just... Just walk into the bank
and co sign for a thousand dollars.

172
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,325
A thousand dollars.

173
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:28,243
Do you really need a new tractor
or do you just want one?

174
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:37,523
All right. Now, can I have
your account number with the bank?

175
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,522
Hi. Uh, can I help you?
Yeah, sweetheart...

176
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:48,726
we got some confidential business
with the bank's president.

177
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,843
Oh, oh, you must be
the pageant people.

178
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,397
Yeah. We're here
to collect the thousand dollars.

179
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,206
Oh, I I think that's half
half a thousand.

180
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,642
No, no, all of it.

181
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:03,043
You wanna go fetch
the pants around here?

182
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:06,597
We prefer to deal with Joe.
Nothing personal.

183
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,320
Joe.

184
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:17,044
Josephine McClintock.

185
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,482
Howdy. How y'all doin'?

186
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,523
Folks round here call me Joe
after my dad.

187
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,520
He died quite sometime ago, so he's
gonna be kinda hard for me to fetch.

188
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,405
And I know that I'm just a girl
and everything, but I do believe...

189
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:32,038
that the agreement was 500 up front
and five upon completion.

190
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,565
Aren't we the assholes?

191
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:40,923
Fifty, four hundred.
Fifty and fifty makes five hundred.

192
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:46,525
Here you go. You're both gonna need to
sign here as proof of receipt, okay?

193
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,563
Hey, Ely, what are you doing
out here this early?

194
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:49,966
I got him.
Hey, Joe.

195
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,246
Uh, the boys at the court give me a
$20000 advance on the truck.

196
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:59,525
Mm hmm.
I'll have that in fives and twenties.

197
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:03,520
Oh, come on, Ely. You know I don't
have that kind of money round here
till harvest day.

198
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:06,838
Why don't you leave this here with me
for the next two weeks?

199
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,963
I'll pay you better interest
than that mattress of yours.

200
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,198
After harvest day, I can cash
any cheque you like. Hmm?

201
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:17,362
Well, could you let me have
three dollars for lunch, then?

202
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:20,120
Well, I'll need to see some I. D.

203
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,560
Well, here.
No, no, Ely.

204
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:23,922
That was a joke.
Oh.

205
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,077
Bye bye. Bye.
All right, thank you.

206
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,758
So, Joe, you cash a lot of $20000
cheques around here?

207
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,838
Why, you got one
that needs to be cashed?

208
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,758
Not on me.
Why, it's bad luck.

209
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:41,518
Well, uh, it was... it was real
interesting meeting you both.

210
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,756
Yeah, see ya.

211
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,762
Yeah, very nice meeting you.
Oh.

212
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:48,996
Bye.
Okay.

213
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,317
Nice.

214
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:57,525
Fan frickin' tastic. Let's find us
some wheels and get outta Dodge.

215
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:04,555
Are you thinking again? 'Cause you could
think on the road, you know.

216
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,115
We're not goin'.
What?

217
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,517
We're stayin'. We're not goin'.
We?

218
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:13,360
What, you grow another face?
'Cause I'm outta here.

219
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,245
Remember my half now, 250.
Give it over.

220
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,558
Oh, this one's sweet.
Would you just stop and think?

221
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,276
Two fifty. It's plenty enough
for me to get outta here.

222
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,880
How far?

223
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,845
Right now every law enforcement officer
in the southwest is looking for you...

224
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,918
but no one is looking for
a cake eating...

225
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,966
pageant producing, midget tailoring
gay couple in Happy, Texas.

226
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,958
Wait for the heat to cool down.
Stay here two weeks.

227
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,117
Then we take the bank down
and travel in style, right?

228
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,802
When did people in small towns
start lockin' their doors? God.

229
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,561
All right.
What about the RV?

230
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:48,205
I mean, somebody's gonna
come looking for that.

231
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,959
Worries we don't have yet.

232
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,964
If it gets hot, we just grab a car
and get gone, right?

233
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:00,880
All right. Let's say
I go along with this.

234
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,516
I mean, you're kind of a wuss.
You've been right so far.

235
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,882
What do you need me for?

236
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,764
Two man job, Wayne.

237
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,645
I need a partner.

238
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:17,524
Oh, uh, mornin'. Howdy.

239
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:20,883
Glad I found y'all.
L I looked at your place.

240
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,765
What can we do for you?
They're waitin'.

241
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,759
They're waiting?
The girls.

242
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:29,884
Oh, the girls.
They started without you.

243
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,562
I told them I'd round y'all up.
Girls are waiting. Yeah, the girls.

244
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:35,956
Hardly sit down
they're so excited to meet you two.

245
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:39,438
I've often said to David "David" I've said...

246
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:43,122
"nothing starts the day off
like an excited girl."

247
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:47,519
Yep. And I've often said...

248
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,881
"Right."

249
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,481
Well, let's giddap.

250
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:56,278
And ball change and sugar.
And ball change. Now we do a loop kick.

251
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:04,402
Now, normally I like to be
on the glamour end of a partnership

252
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,762
but you've got
a real way with people.

253
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:10,362
I've seen it. So, to use your talents
in the best way possible...

254
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm willing to take the burden
and responsibility for the bank.

255
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:17,166
Yours will be this...
Sheena, give me some sugar.

256
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:21,160
Pageant thing.
Or how about this?

257
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,717
You bite me. Why can't I do the bank?
Why do I got to do the kids?

258
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,958
Wanna know what I was doing time for?
Sorry. Good mornin'.

259
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,244
Well, I'd like to welcome you both
to Happy. I'm Miss Schaefer.

260
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,956
Good morning, Miss Schaefer.
I'm Steven.

261
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,196
I'm the other one.
David.

262
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,278
David.
Hi. Well...

263
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,245
we're just so very excited
y'all being here and all.

264
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:45,002
We're convinced with your expertise
we can finally qualify this year.

265
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,966
I'm afraid I've been doing the
Little Fresh Squeezed Pageants
for eight years now.

266
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,277
No qualifiers yet.

267
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,358
Last couple of years
even the parents stopped comin'...

268
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,244
which is a disappointment.

269
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:59,285
But we're hostin' the event
this year.

270
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,564
What, with 13 towns
and nearly 100 girls competing, well...

271
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,400
Well, you did the right thing
calling us in, because David here is...

272
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,921
what we call in the business...

273
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,521
a pageant master.
Really?

274
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,563
And there are only four of those
in the whole United States.

275
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,082
My, my.
So, what I'd like to do...

276
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,558
is to leave you in his capable hands
and let him work his magic...

277
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:22,002
All right.
While I tend to our business affairs.

278
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,396
Steven, you don't have to
go so soon.

279
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:27,126
Yes, I do, David.
No, you don't, Steven.

280
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,641
Yes, I do, darling.

281
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,038
He hates it when we're apart.
Oh.

282
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:34,560
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Schaefer.

283
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,161
Nice meeting you.
See ya.

284
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,245
Well.

285
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,359
Would you like to meet the girls?
I said don't point at me!

286
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,324
Stop it! No!
Stop it!

287
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:54,161
You mind if I just stand here
for a minute?

288
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,557
Shake, shake.
You do it with your booty.

289
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,282
You don't have to be nervous
about the girls.

290
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,757
They're fine with
uh, you know.

291
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:14,159
What?
About you being a homosexual.

292
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,602
Oh, yeah.

293
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,517
Now, everyone, I want you
to say hi to David.

294
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,918
Hi, David!

295
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,440
Hi.

296
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,443
Your booklet requested a piano.

297
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,121
Perhaps you'd like to
let the girls vocalize.

298
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,080
Great.

299
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,159
That's too high.

300
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:58,200
Old Dan Tucker
was a fine old man

301
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,517
Washed his face
in a frying pan

302
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,281
Combed his hair
with a wagon wheel

303
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,040
Died with a toothache
in his heel

304
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,996
Way out west

305
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,164
Go out west

306
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,807
Old Dan...
Kickin'around

307
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,163
Way out west, Old Dan Tucker

308
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:22,284
Old Dan Tucker.
Was that that hard?

309
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,725
Hello?

310
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,005
Hello?

311
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,805
Hello?

312
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,205
Hello.

313
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:08,325
Hello to you.

314
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,122
Jesus.

315
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:15,040
Thought I was going to
have to stop a bank robbery.

316
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,322
You really scared me.
Last man in that safe...

317
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,318
who didn't work here
my daddy shot in his tracks.

318
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,996
I understand that's the most painful
place to be shot in.

319
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,962
So, uh, what are you doing
back there?

320
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:30,596
L I couldn't find anybody.
I call out. The safe was open.

321
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:36,079
Could have been soundproof.
I'm gonna have to start beefing up
security around here.

322
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,886
Pistol whip him, Chappy. Give him
a little knick knack paddy whack.

323
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:43,882
He's one of those pageant fellas.
Oh. Oh!

324
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:47,243
Oh, Joe, ask him about the trees.
The trees?

325
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:49,522
Yeah, you are looking
at the pageant's decoration committee.

326
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,042
Yeah, we've been out shopping
for decorations. We, uh...

327
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,358
we sort of decided on orange trees
and twinkle lights.

328
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,438
I mean, if... if that's
all right with you.

329
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:59,802
Twinkle lights sounds great.

330
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,439
Um, well, so was there
something that you needed?

331
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:09,122
No. I just wanted to make sure
the decorations were taken care of.

332
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,720
And things look
great here, so, uh...

333
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,760
So I better go check on Wayne.

334
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,845
Uh, Wayne Newton.
Oh.

335
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:23,805
Music for the dance numbers.
Oh. Okay.

336
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,720
Gotta go.
Okay. Well, I'll see ya.

337
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:32,325
Bye.

338
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,722
Not how I pictured him at all.

339
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:39,321
They're crafty that way.
Mm hmm.

340
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:42,524
I mean, he's cute in a sort of
zestfully clean kind of way.

341
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:46,760
But I like my men a little dirty
and packin' heat. Hmm, Chappy?

342
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,156
L I best bring
the rest of it up.

343
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,842
All right. I got it. I got it.
All right. Thank you.

344
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,963
I thought they were gay.
They are.

345
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,845
Oh, I don't know much
but I know men.

346
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:00,725
And he was looking at you
the way a fat man looks at fried food.

347
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:07,120
Sixty four bottles of beer on the wall
Sixty four bottles of beer

348
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:11,359
You take one down, pass it around
Sixty four bottles of beer on the wall

349
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:18,116
No, goddam it. They're keeping us
totally in the dark here.

350
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:23,675
Yeah, I got my tactical
display here. Mm hmm.

351
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,322
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

352
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,205
Come on in here.
Come on. Save me a trip.

353
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,485
Hold. Hold.
Let me get a pad of paper here.

354
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:39,035
Hold on.

355
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,517
Look at that.
What do you think of that?

356
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:46,157
Okay, give it to me.
Wasn't my idea to escape.

357
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:47,839
Hold on one second.
It was a fight between Wayne and Bob.

358
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:51,317
Hey, can I finish this phone call
please? Thank you.

359
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,762
Go ahead. Send it to me.

360
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:59,001
No, don't fax it to me. Goddam it
that's what I've been tellin' ya.

361
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:03,717
It's... It's all mushy.
I can't make heads or tails out of it.

362
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,286
Bring it to me, you bet.
That'd be fine.

363
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:15,277
Tomorrow? Fine.
I'll keep an eye out for you.

364
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,801
Oh. I was gonna find you.
The boys at the garage...

365
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:27,960
your RV there...
basically a piece of crap.

366
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,446
Sorry.

367
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,800
So how are you?
Better all the time.

368
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:46,681
Mexican authorities
have been brought into the search...

369
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:50,282
for the three men who escaped
from a prison van yesterday.

370
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,279
Police now think the three may have
crossed the border into Mexico...

371
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:57,246
so the manhunt is being concentrated
along the Rio Grande Valley.

372
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:06,316
You won't believe
what just happened to me.

373
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:10,361
Thank goodness
for small town sheriffs.

374
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:13,041
The guy's holding my mug shot
in his hand.

375
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,243
Next thing I know, we're drinking
a beer and talking about...

376
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:22,757
If you ever leave me
with a kid again...

377
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,122
I will make sure
that you never have one!

378
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:29,041
You have no idea what it is like
to have these screamin'...

379
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:31,880
little booger eaters
lookin' up at you...

380
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:35,004
expectin' you to...

381
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,236
know stuff.

382
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:45,484
An ordinary love
comes in a plain brown wrapper

383
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,518
Why can't we do the bank now?
Because right now that bank...

384
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:53,565
is just an ugly stepsister to when
the harvest money comes in, that's why.

385
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:55,444
I don't care
whose sister's at the bank.

386
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,200
I can't go back in there
and play the fool.

387
00:24:58,287 --> 00:25:00,243
All right. I agree.

388
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,003
All right?
Don't.

389
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,918
That's just the price

390
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:11,320
That life imposes on a heart

391
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,046
An ordinary heart

392
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,322
We gotta get the girls
into the pageant.

393
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:20,559
It's the answer to keeping
the whole town busy on bank day.

394
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,843
It's the best
of all possible diversions.

395
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,883
It's our alibi.

396
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:28,164
We can't rob a bank if we're hosting
a beauty pageant, can we?

397
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,681
No.
Wayne.

398
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,235
Come on, Wayne.

399
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,557
Solitary...

400
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:39,117
Iousy food
big men with bad breath.

401
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,447
Or we're rich...

402
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,325
great beaches...

403
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:49,319
foreign women with large breasts.

404
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,878
I'm gonna pick that one.
All right.

405
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,846
All right. Sold American.
All right.

406
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,839
To pull it off, this needs to
be more of a partnership.

407
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,078
All right.
Thank you, guys. Yeah.

408
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,407
Hello? Sheriff?
Anybody here?

409
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,085
Hello?

410
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,359
Sheriff Dent?

411
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,400
Gimme that gasoline, Jency!

412
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:20,923
I promise you I'm gonna let you do
your flaming baton trick later.

413
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:28,644
Sissies, sissies
Pageant sissies

414
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,162
David, do you want
to help me with something?

415
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,400
Right.

416
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:43,199
I wanna get him!
No! Let go of me, you homo!

417
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:54,200
You come anywhere near these girls
again, I won't say nothin'.

418
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:57,324
I'm just gonna come over to your house
late at night when you're asleep...

419
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,477
and kill you
with a chain saw.

420
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:09,085
Cool.
You got no room to talk, lady.

421
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:13,206
Don't you ever let me
catch you fight like that again.

422
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:18,284
And don't ever drop your lead shoulder
when you throw a punch.

423
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,721
You think shoulder to face
when you hit.

424
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:25,366
Shoulder to face.

425
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:28,801
Sure you're okay?
Yeah.

426
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,355
Do you smoke?
No, thanks.

427
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:36,556
Man, I've never seen
Miss Schaefer that mad before.

428
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:40,002
She was mad?
I think she was expecting...

429
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,317
m more from this whole thing.

430
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:46,286
She's been talking about all this
great stuff you were going to teach us.

431
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,757
And, well, so far, nothin'.

432
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,557
All right, goddam it!
Shut your yappers!

433
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:58,844
Get your diapered butts in line!
Get over here!

434
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:03,239
Over here! Now, we got work to do!
Cool!

435
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,921
All right, this might
look hard at first.

436
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:10,319
All right. Head back! Oh, my God.
One, two, three, four!

437
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,318
Go! Okay!

438
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:23,924
It's a tornado!
It's a tornado...

439
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,918
goin' through the small town!

440
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,521
Whippin' around.

441
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:32,566
Watch it. Make it go.
Winds of fury!

442
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:35,366
Giddap! Go! Go!

443
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,718
Okay.
All right. Let's get started.

444
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:52,843
Girls, would you like to try
to follow what he did?

445
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:55,725
Going once.
Going twice. Sold!

446
00:29:55,807 --> 00:30:00,927
$350 for this nice
Mako gas range over here.

447
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,522
Cute butt, sexy eyes

448
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:08,202
Tall and dark
I know what I like

449
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:11,518
Heart of gold
Brain to match

450
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:14,565
Ain't gonna settle for less than that
Next up here we have a wonderful item.

451
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:16,922
This is a classic.
It's antique.

452
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:18,918
It's a Ming vase.
It's a Ming vase?

453
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:23,762
It's a Wyo ming vase. I brought it in
from Wyoming, but it's a nice one.

454
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,441
There's a little crack in the back
but you can fix that up.

455
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:29,280
How about we start this at $ 100?
A $ 100 bid.

456
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:32,564
A hundred dollars, anybody? A hundred.
How about this outstanding picture here?

457
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:36,163
A man sitting on a tractor.
I don't believe it's a John Deere...

458
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:39,444
but his wife probably
calls him John Dear.

459
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:43,486
Right now our next lot is lot 24.
It's a collection of tyres.

460
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,525
You all know Varnel's
affection for tyres.

461
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:49,247
It's unnatural.
There's a lot of good rubber in these tyres

462
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,318
and there's some
steel belteds in there.

463
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,524
We'll start the bidding at, uh... at 200.
Two hundred, two hundred.

464
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:57,519
Give me three. Lookin' for three.
Three hundred dollar bid, dollar bid.

465
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,882
Three hundred dollars. Lookin'...
Hi.

466
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,527
Am I glad to see you.
I thought I was gonna die.

467
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:04,484
Dollar bid, dollar bid over here.
We got a $400 bid.

468
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:07,559
Hey, Varnel
what are you biddin' on?

469
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:12,960
Joe, that's a hell of a price.
But, Varnel, those are your tyres.

470
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:17,517
Judge, don't let him buy those tyres.
Sorry, Varnel.

471
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,520
Okay, we'll continue bidding here.
Are you always taking care of everyone?

472
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:24,043
You know what they say about small
towns... like big families, no secrets.

473
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:30,722
Which is, um, sort of why
I wanted to, uh, talk to you.

474
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,083
Uh, I need some advice.

475
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,717
You can trust me.
This is a little hard, um...

476
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:42,482
but I feel that I can talk to you
because you're, um...

477
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,799
because you're sort of...
Because I'm an outsider?

478
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:49,082
You are. Yes, you are
but that's not it.

479
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,237
Because I'm handsome?
No.

480
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:56,003
I mean, you're very handsome, I think
um, but that's not really what I'm, uh...

481
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,726
Okay.
Because I'm a man?

482
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:01,196
Yes.

483
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:05,040
And no.

484
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:08,403
I sort of feel like I can talk to you like a
girlfriend. You know what I mean?
That's a first.

485
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:11,365
I mean it in a good way. I mean I haven't
had a girlfriend in a really long time.

486
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:13,517
Me either.
That's funny.

487
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:17,395
Hilarious.
I couldn't help but notice that...

488
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:21,526
you seemed to have kept
a certain amount of...

489
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,395
passion in your relationship.

490
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,479
With David? Passion?

491
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,117
Yeah. I, uh... I guess I work hard
to keep that in my life.

492
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:37,041
See, relationships for me have all
just been a little bit fuzzy.

493
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,800
I mean, the difference between
what is good and what is settling...

494
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,526
has... has always been
a real problem for me.

495
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:47,556
So I'm just lookin' for anything
that would help. You know what I
mean? Um, a tip or a magic spell.

496
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,558
For a relationship
that you're in?

497
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,036
Yeah.
Oh.

498
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:55,517
And this guy, uh...
It is a guy, right?

499
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,041
Yes, it's a guy. Of course it's a guy.
Good.

500
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:00,561
Guys are easy.
I mean, all they want is...

501
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,722
The bank. The bank!

502
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,001
The bank?

503
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:15,524
Sugar, stop cryin'.
It's all right.

504
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:18,281
It's just an accident.
Everybody all right?

505
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:32,316
Here's your baton, Jency.
I'm sorry it melted.

506
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,967
It's out!
The fire is out!

507
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,483
All you people go home!

508
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:42,799
No, no, no.
Lefty loosey, righty tighty.

509
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,436
And will somebody turn off
the damned alarm?

510
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:59,206
Man, I always get scared
when I hear that old tornado siren.

511
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,198
You thought a tornado
hit the bank?

512
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:04,438
No, no, the bank's alarm
fire department and public safety...

513
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,438
are all tied into
the same system.

514
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,563
My heart is goin'
a mile a minute.

515
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,525
Girl, you need to relax.
Yeah, well, I'm open to suggestions.

516
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:14,565
Why don't you let me
give the girlfriend role a try?

517
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,798
Help you out with the decorations.
Okay.

518
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,718
Why don't you come by tomorrow then?

519
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,355
David

520
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,438
may I have a word
with you, please?

521
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:31,402
Now, most times I don't like
to have to say anything...

522
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,320
about what people say
or what they do.

523
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,319
But I will not stand by
and allow you...

524
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:41,366
to use vulgar language like the GD word
in front of those little girls.

525
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,756
I will not let that happen.
Do you understand me?

526
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,724
I wish you wouldn't
talk to me like that.

527
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:49,243
Well, I'm sorry, David
but it had to be said.

528
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:51,204
I'm sorry.
Hi, Miss Schaefer.

529
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:52,925
Would you mind if I borrow David
for one second?

530
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,885
No.
It's the end times.

531
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,685
What the hell are you trying to do?
About what?

532
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:01,726
Fry a bunch of little girls?
Need I remind you...

533
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:05,197
Need I remind you that those girls
are our meal ticket here?

534
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:13,963
What did you do that for?
Don't talk to me like that.

535
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:17,926
Okay. God.

536
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:19,326
My mistake.

537
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:31,123
Everything, uh, copacetic
with your companion there?

538
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:34,517
Yeah. We're more
like just friends now.

539
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,404
Yeah, it seems friendly.

540
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,876
Yeah, in many ways, we just
stick together 'cause of the job.

541
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:42,437
Your, uh... your work's
awful important to you.

542
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:44,518
Sure. I gotta go.

543
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,997
Yeah, hold... hold on there.
Hold on.

544
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,760
I was thinkin'...
Something occurred to me.

545
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:53,680
If you got the time, I'd like
to ask you some questions...

546
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,156
about you and your...
your friend there.

547
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:58,397
You mind comin' over
to my office?

548
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:00,955
Could I do it another time?
Be better for me.

549
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,444
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

550
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:10,759
Well, I'm not superstitious
but when she was passin'by

551
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,517
How's it goin'?

552
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:16,518
You know what they say.

553
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:18,723
What are they sayin' now?

554
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:22,917
Well, you know.

555
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:25,840
Measure twice, cut once.
You?

556
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:30,717
How are you doing?
Good.

557
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:34,243
I'm almost finished with my masterpiece.
I call it "Family Tree."

558
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:37,239
I think I may have
just found my true calling.

559
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:41,286
How are you doin'? You almost done
with the tree trunks? We need 'em.
Be right there.

560
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,518
So, tell me about this man of yours.
Uh, his name is Glen.

561
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,279
Uh huh.

562
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,484
Where's Glen now?

563
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:54,277
He's in Van Horne. He stops by every once
in a while for dinner and breakfast.

564
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,882
A few late night phone calls.
It's a very modern relationship.

565
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,204
Yeah, we've been together
six years next month.

566
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,801
Six years of what?
Breakfast and phone calls?

567
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:11,197
Sounds kind of convenient.
Doesn't sound very... very permanent.

568
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:14,518
Well, I can wait.
What for?

569
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,245
You know, you're in your twenties and
everything's gonna happen "someday."

570
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,522
And then you get a little
past your twenties...

571
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:25,759
and "someday" is happening
or has happened.

572
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,440
Your dad dies and you go
from being Josephine to Joe...

573
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:32,119
president of the bank.

574
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,846
And everybody starts
dependin' on ya.

575
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:37,236
Your love life
sort of takes a back seat.

576
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:39,966
You start to realize
that maybe... maybe your...

577
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,878
maybe your ultimate dreams
are just unattainable.

578
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,842
I don't know. I guess I'm
still waitin' for "someday."

579
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,407
Well, on the plus side, he does
do somethin' every once in a while...

580
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,523
that feels worth waitin' for.

581
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:58,441
What's that?
He tells me that he loves me.

582
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:02,884
Aw, come on. "Love you" is easy.
Men say it all the time.

583
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,481
Men say they love their work.

584
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,963
Love their cars
love their...

585
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,441
Love their freedom.

586
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:15,085
He should tell you
something more than that.

587
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,203
Like what?

588
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:21,325
He should take you in his arms
look you straight in your eyes.

589
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,844
He should say...

590
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:32,519
I don't know. He should say
"I may have seen a woman in my life...

591
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,245
"who is considered prettier...

592
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,602
"but I've never seen one
more beautiful.

593
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,876
"When you laugh and your eyes
are happy, I think...

594
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,276
"I think no matter what...

595
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,595
I'm a success."

596
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:48,479
He should say, "I want you."

597
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,042
Yeah.

598
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:53,958
"I want you, Joe.

599
00:38:55,487 --> 00:39:00,117
"You'll never be second to
anything else because I want you
more than anything else.

600
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:04,802
"I wanna kiss you.

601
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,845
I wanna breathe in the air
out of you."

602
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,356
Right. Like some straight guy's
ever gonna say that.

603
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:20,324
Oh, my God.

604
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:25,117
Ooh, man, you are good. You know that?
You are really, really good.

605
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:30,519
Well, a man in love is a man in love.
Yeah.

606
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,757
You know, it makes him say
the strangest things.

607
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:37,956
Come on.
Finish the trees.

608
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:40,402
Yeah, the trees.
Let's go.

609
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:44,366
Well, I better... I, uh...
I better go wash this off so we can...

610
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,881
move on to gettin' covered
in tree trunk brown, yep.

611
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,159
Oh, excuse me.

612
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,925
Don't move.

613
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:20,397
Gotcha. Bang.

614
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:26,526
There's one less bunny rabbit
that'll be bothering you.

615
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:29,759
Damn rodents. Chewing up
everything in sight.

616
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,566
You know
they breed like rabbits.

617
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,444
Yeah, I heard.

618
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,681
Sheriff, why are we out here?

619
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:43,761
Let me choose
the right words here. Uh...

620
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,762
Ever since you and David
come to town...

621
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:51,396
I've been thinking
"What's wrong with this picture?"

622
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:56,561
There's one. You want him?

623
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,239
No.
Whoop. There he goes.

624
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:00,716
Oh, there, he's got two.
Thank you.

625
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:09,486
Truth to tell, I invited you out here
because I need some advice.

626
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,205
Sure, if I can help.

627
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:15,563
I'm just a crusty old redneck
and I don't express myself well.

628
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:19,162
And recently there's someone
that I would...

629
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:21,556
Iove to express myself to.

630
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,683
Why, Sheriff.

631
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:27,555
You've got a crush on
some sweet thing. That's great.

632
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:29,558
There comes a time in a...
in a man's life...

633
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:33,720
when he must be bold.

634
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:37,436
Sure. I've learnt that you've
gotta say what's in your heart.

635
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,358
Life is short.

636
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:43,679
To let the chance pass you by
of spending it with someone you love...

637
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,156
that's a sin
a real sin.

638
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:49,398
Here we go.
You want this one?

639
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,921
You take him.
Bring it up nice and slow.

640
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:55,522
Easy, easy, easy.
You got the safety off there?

641
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,167
Is it tight against your shoulder?
Keep it tight.

642
00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:00,317
Nice and tight. That's good.
You're good.

643
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,523
Yeah.
I guess like...

644
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,326
like everybody else
I'm scared of bein'...

645
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,796
you know, rejected.

646
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,798
Well, there's no way, man.

647
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:13,402
You're a real catch.
You're a man's man.

648
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,240
You're a nice guy.
You got your health.

649
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:19,956
And everybody knows what
a turn on that uniform is.

650
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:23,323
Just bring it up tight
into your shoulder there.

651
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,479
You're gonna just squeeze it.

652
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:30,242
Don't jerk it.
Just squeeze it.

653
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:32,841
Look right down the barrel.
Keep both your eyes open.

654
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,838
You mean all that stuff
that you said?

655
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,997
If you were gay...

656
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:42,443
you'd be just my type.
Pop him.

657
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:47,318
Jiminy crickets.

658
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:48,965
Are... Are you all right?

659
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:52,835
Yeah. Yeah.
Did I get it?

660
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:57,682
Uh, I don't think there's any danger of
that. Are you sure you're all right?

661
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,325
Yeah, I'm fine.

662
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:02,478
I think you're mighty handsome.

663
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,797
I'd never split up
another couple.

664
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:07,959
But now that I see that you and David
aren't together any more...

665
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:09,719
well, that's a cat
of a different colour.

666
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,035
So...

667
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:14,284
bein' bold here...

668
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:21,363
what do you say you and me
go out on a proper date?

669
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:18,287
Two Cokes.

670
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:22,799
And left, and left.

671
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:26,562
Like an aeroplane.
'Cause I got my weight in my hip.

672
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,320
Weight in my hip.

673
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:33,320
Weight in the hip.
And left, and...

674
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:48,675
Put it up!

675
00:44:56,847 --> 00:45:00,203
Punch it! Punch!
And come on!

676
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:03,997
Shh!

677
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:07,802
That way. All right.
You do it.

678
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:10,720
Yeah! Put it up here.
Doing the swan head.

679
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,799
Face me, though. Good. All right.
Let's go inside and show the others.

680
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,397
That's pretty much my story.

681
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:31,239
Up to high school, anyway.

682
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,205
Lucky we had the 21/2 hour drive
to get here.

683
00:45:34,287 --> 00:45:37,040
It's just that I've heard about
this place for so long...

684
00:45:37,127 --> 00:45:39,197
I figure this is a good time...

685
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,562
Do you believe in love
at first sight

686
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:43,558
Tell you what.
I'll get us a couple of beers.

687
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,240
You can tell me about yourself.

688
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:49,036
I'm glad that we agreed
believe me

689
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:50,924
That's a big relief

690
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:54,556
This place is awful crowded
and this music is so loud

691
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:58,402
Would you like to go
and grab a bite to eat

692
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,966
Me neither

693
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:03,517
Whoa, whoa, hold on there. God knows
when we're gonna see you again.

694
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:07,965
Uh, we need
two more Tecates. Each?

695
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:10,163
At least.
There ya go.

696
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:14,240
And, uh, give me the meanest
steak you got. Rare, and I mean rare.

697
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:17,125
Just dehorn it, wipe its butt
and send it in.

698
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,562
Steven?
Two.

699
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,046
There you go.

700
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:31,597
Well, first things first.

701
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:34,645
I'm glad you're here.

702
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,526
I wish you'd start
callin' me Chappy.

703
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,518
Chappy.

704
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:49,881
There you go.

705
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:55,201
Got me a room
in a cheap motel

706
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:58,962
My head was spinnin'
and I didn't feel well

707
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:01,880
Hope you'll understand
if we take this very slow.

708
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,322
Oh, I wouldn't have it
any other way.

709
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:10,319
I fixed up my bed
and I covered up my head

710
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:13,877
It's just that
I feel we're a lot alike.

711
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:16,322
There's a lot
you don't know about me.

712
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,196
Well, that's what life's for
isn't it?

713
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,847
Findin' out.

714
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,918
I'm gonna spin you again.
No.

715
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:30,395
A one, two.
I turned and I tossed

716
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:34,287
Love is stranger than fiction

717
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:38,201
And I make this prediction
Even though you say you won't

718
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:40,801
I know you'll let me down

719
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:45,324
Tell me I'm your heart's desire
Love me long, you little liar

720
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:50,322
We've got a strange love
Love love

721
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,837
How was the prom?

722
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:30,003
Your date. Did you get any?
Yeah, very funny.

723
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,517
Screw you.
Well, that would be...

724
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:36,519
cheatin' on the sheriff.

725
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,838
Did you do some dancin'?
Why do you care?

726
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:43,158
I'll tell you why I care.

727
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:45,556
You don't... You don't think
I know what you're doin'.

728
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,160
Do you?
What?

729
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:51,718
What, goin' to the banker lady's house
for popcorn and pillow talk.

730
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:54,924
Goin' huntin'. What did you do?
Did you go someplace nice for dinner?

731
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:58,522
Did you have a few drinks?

732
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:02,520
You don't think I'd like to get out
some night, have a nice meal...

733
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:04,996
spend one night
not thinkin' about the girls?

734
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:07,396
You know what I did tonight?
I'll tell you what I did.

735
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,523
I spent it right here...

736
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:12,884
tryin' to figure out if...

737
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:17,165
slip stitchin' or bastin' is the best
way to put on a sparkly heart.

738
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:20,922
Because you know what?
I don't know how.

739
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:23,043
Judges are gonna be here tomorrow.

740
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,721
Madison's not gotten
all the way through her song.

741
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:28,958
Numbers are all over the place.
Nobody can keep the beat.

742
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:34,364
And I'm scared to death that
Jency is gonna drop her baton...

743
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:36,961
and fry like one of them
Buddhist monks.

744
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:38,275
There...

745
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:43,680
I thought this was
a partnership.

746
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:48,478
You know what I don't see?

747
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,043
I don't see no keys
to the bank.

748
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,846
Fine, Wayne, let's trade.

749
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:57,157
You come pretend to be
Chappy's life mate.

750
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,761
You explain how you don't...

751
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:03,362
kiss early in the relationship
'cause you're not that kind of guy.

752
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,324
So now it's "Chappy."

753
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:08,763
Yes, damn it, it's "Chappy"!

754
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,844
We're dating!

755
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:17,960
I gotta get outta here.

756
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:22,199
Every time we start to have
a nice talk, you gotta go.

757
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:26,326
Fine. You know what?
Maybe I'll just go do the bank myself.

758
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:29,444
Okay, Wayne. Go.
You go do it.

759
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,358
You go do the bank.
All right.

760
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:37,199
First I gotta make little polka dotted
flowers for the girls' hats.

761
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:48,002
You're quiet today.
Are you all right?

762
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,317
Every time I think about you I am.

763
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,961
What?

764
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:03,403
You're such a surprise.
What do you mean?

765
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:08,684
I don't know.
Just a surprise.

766
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:15,122
Well, I have to
get back to work.

767
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,596
I'll clean up.
Thanks.

768
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:23,156
Can I see you later?
It's last night in town.

769
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,045
I can't. I'm havin' company.
How about after?

770
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:28,766
It's Glen, Steven.

771
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:30,599
"After" will be tomorrow.

772
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:33,998
Okay.

773
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:45,243
Well, thanks again for lunch.

774
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:49,758
I'll see ya.

775
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:10,115
David, where you been?
I just woke up. Where's the girls?

776
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:15,156
They're inside with the judges now.
So close. We're so close this year.

777
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:17,761
Just once I'd like
to show those people...

778
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:21,476
from Pecos and Fort Davis that
we are just as good as they are.

779
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:25,243
Sorry.

780
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:27,682
Well, I think we'll do fine.

781
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:30,964
I just wanted to tell you
that next year...

782
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:34,437
you don't need my help
'cause you done real good.

783
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,438
Well, thanks.

784
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:39,280
Comin' from a professional
like yourself, that means so much.

785
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,562
Yep. Well...

786
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:45,686
And you are, I must say
you are fuckin' great!

787
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:55,523
Don't mean to be rude.
We still have the girls to see...

788
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,518
over in Fort Davis
this afternoon.

789
00:52:57,687 --> 00:53:01,566
And thanks so much for your hospitality.
Everything looks very festive for tomorrow.

790
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:04,560
Oh. Here...
Mm hmm.

791
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:07,115
Are the final instructions
for the programme...

792
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:10,517
and your copy
of the contestant list.

793
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,916
Are you telling me
that somebody qualified?

794
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:15,362
Miss Schaefer
they all qualified.

795
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:21,360
They all qualified!

796
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:31,842
It zips!

797
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,561
Trouble
Love trouble

798
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:42,163
Love trouble
Love that trouble

799
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:46,798
Aw, I think we can
do something about that

800
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:17,166
Now, I haven't had a whole lot of
experience, but you're incredible.

801
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:21,525
I mean, considerin' the fact
that you are a homosexual.

802
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:26,920
Well, that whole gay thing
is just kind of a...

803
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:28,281
hobby, really.

804
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:32,519
I thought you had a lot of girls'
names on you for a, you know...

805
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,962
Who's Jessica?
Jessica Lange.

806
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:40,444
Who's Jamie?
Jamie Lee Curtis...

807
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,564
from that movie Trading Places.
Who's this?

808
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:46,924
That's not a tattoo.
Oh, my!

809
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:15,520
Three most romantic sounds
in the world.

810
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,281
Plane engine
a ship's whistle...

811
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:20,881
and a locomotive's horn.

812
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,800
Somebody once said that.

813
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,879
Or maybe it's the three
loneliest sounds. I can't remember.

814
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:31,999
What are you thinkin' about
out here watchin' freighters go by?

815
00:55:33,087 --> 00:55:35,760
Goin'.

816
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:40,878
I'm always thinkin' about goin'.

817
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:44,403
Oh, Lordy, we sure did get
to the "gettin' goin"' part quick.

818
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:52,757
I got somethin' for you.
Oh, Chappy, you shouldn't have.

819
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:55,486
Oh, go on, now.
It's for luck tomorrow.

820
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,075
And to say thanks.

821
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,965
Thank you for the...

822
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,845
the gift that
these last days have been.

823
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:12,559
You know, I been thinkin'
hell, Dallas ain't that far.

824
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:15,724
My schedule's pretty flexible.

825
00:56:17,047 --> 00:56:20,005
Nah, we...

826
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:22,555
we don't need to talk about that now.

827
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:24,478
There's time for that later.
Go on. Open it.

828
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:32,478
It's a rabbit's foot.
I made it. It's for luck.

829
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,040
That come off the only one
you hit that day.

830
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:41,926
Thank you.

831
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:46,239
I want you to know
when you leave...

832
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:48,557
I know folks around here.

833
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:50,558
They'll talk about it for years.

834
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:54,804
"Remember when them two fellas
came for that beauty pageant?"

835
00:56:58,087 --> 00:56:59,918
I'll think about you.

836
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:05,162
Just want to make sure
you got somethin' of me with you.

837
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:56,325
You want some coffee?

838
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,123
Hang on a second.
I'll be right there.

839
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:10,924
I didn't mean to be rude.
I just wanted to get out of that robe.

840
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,480
So, I take it this is your
"I stayed up all night" look...

841
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:22,560
as opposed to your
"I'll get up early and go get
Josephine some breakfast" look.

842
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:26,560
That bad, huh? I guess I should
be flattered by your stalking.

843
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:31,005
It's such a fine line between
stalking and being attentive...

844
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:34,124
and I was, I don't know
being attentive.

845
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,998
How's Glen?

846
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:46,525
Oh. He's gone.

847
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:51,715
I know. I saw him leave.
No, I mean he's gone gone.

848
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:56,157
Yeah.
I told him it was over, and...

849
00:59:58,607 --> 01:00:01,883
he said, "Fine" he wasn't havin'
all that much fun anyway.

850
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:04,276
Very adult of him.

851
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,200
I mean, I was at least hopin'
for some tears...

852
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:10,597
or a tantrum or somethin'.

853
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:17,324
Well, how about that, huh?
You all right?

854
01:00:18,487 --> 01:00:21,126
No. Which is stupid.

855
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,801
I mean, it's not like anything
he said was such a big surprise.

856
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:26,276
It's just that...

857
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,278
I had this big speech
all worked out, right

858
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:31,803
about how I didn't want
to be second any more...

859
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:34,879
how I wanted a relationship
that felt...

860
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,959
permanent, you know
not just convenient...

861
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:43,326
how I wanted to be part
of a couple that did things as a...

862
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:46,399
as a couple, you know?

863
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:48,398
I wanted him to talk to me
the way that you did...

864
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:51,763
Iook at me, pay attention to me
the way that you do.

865
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:55,638
I mean...

866
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:01,360
That's not too much to ask, right?
It's not too much to want.

867
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,840
Joe.

868
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,202
Joe.

869
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,798
God.

870
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,082
I wish...

871
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:21,635
Here.

872
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:33,400
You're great.

873
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:35,318
You are. You're great.

874
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:41,199
You'll meet somebody.
You'll meet someone.

875
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,727
Yeah.

876
01:01:44,807 --> 01:01:47,560
And with my luck
he'll turn out to be gay.

877
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:13,325
Jesus! I'm in the crosswalk!
I'm walkin' here!

878
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,083
All right.

879
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,682
All right, outside. Let's go.
Hey, you and me, we ain't talkin'.

880
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:29,036
I know what you're doin' here.
It's not right.

881
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:31,482
Hi there.

882
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,478
Sure lookin' forward
to that pageant this afternoon.

883
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:36,924
Listen
I am not waitin' for you...

884
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,840
to clean this place out
this afternoon and I get zip.

885
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,839
I'm going to sign for my other 250
which I have more than earned...

886
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,838
and then...
Morning, boys.

887
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,883
Piss on you, I am gone.

888
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,878
Wait, wait, wait. Two fifty?

889
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,958
Saw Liberace one time
in Laughlin.

890
01:02:52,047 --> 01:02:55,198
Great show. He's an all right fella too.
Like y'all

891
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:57,676
but sittin' at the far end of
that counter, if you know what I mean.

892
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:01,638
Would you excuse us?
Oh, sure.

893
01:03:02,807 --> 01:03:07,039
Two fifty? You're here to sign
for the other half of the salary?

894
01:03:07,127 --> 01:03:09,925
I thought you were gonna rob the bank.
Me? I'm not robbin' the bank.

895
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:12,840
You're robbing the bank.
I'm not robbing the bank!

896
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,478
It was your idea.

897
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,127
Yeah, it was my idea
but now it's not.

898
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:21,243
I think I'm falling in love.

899
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,316
With the sheriff
or the banker?

900
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:29,518
With Joe.

901
01:03:30,847 --> 01:03:31,996
Bad luck.

902
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:34,999
Boys, in case no one else
got around to tellin' ya

903
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:37,806
we sure do appreciate
what y'all done around here.

904
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:39,798
Yep, sure do.
That's it.

905
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,718
See you both at the show.

906
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,724
Hey. You done
a good job, Wayne.

907
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:51,362
Better than I could've done
with those kids.

908
01:03:51,447 --> 01:03:55,884
You're a good partner. You take
my share. It's time for me to go.

909
01:03:57,727 --> 01:03:59,558
Buenos dias, girls.

910
01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:02,525
I got my new car parked outside.
Y'all want to come look at it?

911
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,000
Next.

912
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:10,406
Ain't life funny
us back together again.

913
01:04:10,487 --> 01:04:13,445
Kind of like a Kodak commercial.

914
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:15,757
Imagine my surprise
when I come out of my hole...

915
01:04:15,847 --> 01:04:19,806
where I've been waitin' for things to
cool off a little bit, and who do I see?

916
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:22,355
In my bank.

917
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,086
Goat boy's girlfriend here.

918
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:29,718
So, tell me, girlfriend... tell me
about your plan to get my money.

919
01:04:29,807 --> 01:04:32,116
Or if we can just do my plan
but I always figured...

920
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:35,165
killin' a bunch of people
makes for a slower getaway.

921
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,683
All right, I'll give you the combo.
Hey. Alarm.

922
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,156
Thank you, Wayne.
What about that?

923
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,159
Don't worry about the alarm. I'll cut the
alarm. If it's on a reset switch

924
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,397
it'll it'll
start before you...

925
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,845
What about that?
Lt'll be on for a second or two.

926
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:54,636
I'll coordinate the break in
with... with something loud.

927
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:57,116
What's loud?

928
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:01,325
Well, when my girls come on stage
that entrance music is pretty loud.

929
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:04,355
David!
How you doin'?

930
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:07,958
When?
Quarter of 4:00.

931
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:12,484
Okay. 3:45, I cut the alarm
then you're on your own.

932
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,957
How... How long has he been in there?
Huh?

933
01:05:16,047 --> 01:05:18,242
In the bathroom. How long
do you think he's been in there?

934
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:21,922
What's it matter?
L... I was thinkin'...

935
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,079
if he has the cramps or somethin'
we could surprise him.

936
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,476
What are you gonna do
jump him in the can?

937
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:30,400
I can take him. No, you can't.
I think I can take him.

938
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:33,320
Wayne, I hate to be the one to tell
you this, but you're a lousy fighter.

939
01:05:34,927 --> 01:05:36,997
Well, at least I ain't actin'
like a pee waddlin' hound...

940
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:39,476
handin' out the combination
of my girlfriend's bank!

941
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,842
I am not helping him.

942
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:47,195
All right, I am helping him.
But it's better this way.

943
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,160
It's better
that no one gets hurt.

944
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:54,125
You should've seen it.
Lifted me right off the seat.

945
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:57,119
I could've named it Flipper.

946
01:05:57,207 --> 01:06:00,085
Hey! You both look, uh
que bonita.

947
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,283
Just like everything's normal.
That's good.

948
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:06,718
Steven, it's me, Chappy.
Who's Chappy?

949
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:09,682
The sheriff.

950
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:13,640
You get rid of him right quick
or else I will.

951
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:17,316
Getting dressed.
Just a second.

952
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:24,082
Hey, Chappy. Hey.
Hey, you.

953
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,564
I wasn't tryin' to catch you
with just your drawers on, I promise.

954
01:06:31,647 --> 01:06:34,559
Hey, David.
How are you?

955
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:39,562
I thought I'd stop and visit for a bit
before the festivities begin.

956
01:06:39,727 --> 01:06:42,799
Uh, I got a line
on some transportation for you.

957
01:06:42,887 --> 01:06:44,843
It ain't pretty
but it'll get you where you're goin'.

958
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,845
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

959
01:06:51,927 --> 01:06:55,442
Yeah, you sort of are right now.
Oh, I'm sorry, Steven.

960
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:58,360
I'm... Think I'm bein'
a little selfish right now

961
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,438
and it's your last day
in town and all...

962
01:07:00,527 --> 01:07:04,361
and I'm tryin' to fit in
as much time as I possibly can.

963
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:08,520
Me and the boys are fixin' up
your, uh... your RV there.

964
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:11,326
We're gonna tow it to El Paso.
I think we can, um...

965
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:13,557
Chappy, I need you to go.

966
01:07:13,647 --> 01:07:16,525
I can stay out of your way here
till you're done.

967
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:20,760
No, I don't want you
in here right now, all right?

968
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:23,566
Of course.
Sure. All right.

969
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:27,959
Um, we still goin' to sit together
durin' the show, right?

970
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:30,322
No. No, I don't think so.

971
01:07:30,407 --> 01:07:33,558
What? What are you talkin' about?
Will you just go away!

972
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:36,320
I don't want to sit with you tonight.
I don't want to see you back here again.

973
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:39,524
I don't want you looking for me
after the show.

974
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:42,918
Steven if there's somethin' I've done...
Here.

975
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:47,875
No.
I must have been out of my mind...

976
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:50,527
wasting my time with some...

977
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:52,757
redneck hick sheriff...

978
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:56,476
with bug eyes
and two left feet.

979
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,881
Just leave me alone.

980
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:20,281
It's nice my new amigo
is so concerned about his friends.

981
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:23,165
We don't have to worry
about how this is gonna go down.

982
01:08:29,407 --> 01:08:30,362
Let's do it.

983
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:45,238
All right.

984
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:50,518
Around, around.
Like that?

985
01:08:50,687 --> 01:08:53,599
Like that.
And around the other way.

986
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,917
Hi.
Hi.

987
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:14,444
Okay, everyone. I hope we're all ready.
Come on. Come on. Come here.

988
01:09:17,807 --> 01:09:20,526
Okay. Do you think
we should pray?

989
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:25,516
Yeah.
Yeah. Why don't you go ahead.

990
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:31,565
All right.

991
01:09:31,727 --> 01:09:36,278
Bow your heads.
What about hold hands?

992
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:40,565
All right. Let's hold hands.
Okay. Yeah.

993
01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:43,286
Okay, God

994
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:47,326
just want you to look down
on these girls here.

995
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:49,841
They're like little flowers...

996
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:52,077
and the rain you send 'em...

997
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:54,556
gotta be gentle and sweet.

998
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:59,038
We come to you today
and we ask you to just help 'em...

999
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:04,082
help us grab this pageant
by the balls and rip 'em off.

1000
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:08,161
I mean, if those judges
don't like us, then screw 'em.

1001
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:13,241
These girls here, they're...
they're talented, they're pretty...

1002
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:17,286
and if if those judges
say anything different

1003
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:22,441
then I hope that on Judgement Day, you
put their asses through a meat grinder.

1004
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:28,278
Amen.
Amen!

1005
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:30,676
Amen.
It's show time, folks!

1006
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,679
Let's go.
Good luck. Break a leg. Not really.

1007
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:39,444
All right.
Break an egg.

1008
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:51,443
Ladies and gentlemen.

1009
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:55,795
Straight from
the big bend of Texas...

1010
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:59,562
your nominees for
Little Miss Fresh Squeezed!

1011
01:11:03,207 --> 01:11:07,519
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
All right!

1012
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:09,518
Welcome to Happy

1013
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,516
where we are more than happy
to be hosting...

1014
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:17,519
the 18th Annual
Little Miss Fresh Squeezed...

1015
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,280
Preteen Talent Competition.

1016
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:24,679
97 girls from 13 communities...

1017
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:27,327
competing for a chance
to represent their hometown...

1018
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,841
at the state pageant
in Dallas next month.

1019
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:44,042
What's going on?
No matter what, remember, 3:45!

1020
01:12:12,687 --> 01:12:13,517
Speak.

1021
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:17,726
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

1022
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:19,798
This little light of mine

1023
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:22,162
I'm gonna let it shine

1024
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,442
This little light of mine

1025
01:12:24,527 --> 01:12:26,165
I'm gonna let it shine

1026
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:29,478
Let it shine, let it shine
let it shine

1027
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:40,006
How ya doin'?
That's why... I have good news.

1028
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,157
The Del Rio girls
they haven't shown up

1029
01:12:42,247 --> 01:12:44,681
so the Happy girls are gonna
go on stage early.

1030
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:47,156
I thought maybe we could
go back to my place.

1031
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,477
That would be... What?

1032
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:51,478
I thought we'd go back to my place.

1033
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:55,276
Wait. Happy girls aren't supposed
to go on till quarter to 4:00.

1034
01:12:55,367 --> 01:12:57,198
Well, 15 minutes early.

1035
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,805
David. David.
No. David.

1036
01:13:08,407 --> 01:13:09,237
Hi ho.

1037
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:14,807
You know
this reminds me of a story.

1038
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:22,715
Well, I'll be dipped.

1039
01:13:26,447 --> 01:13:30,360
Hey, Alton. Get yourself a map
get ahold of the SWAT boys...

1040
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,039
and get your best body armour.
Yes, sir.

1041
01:13:32,127 --> 01:13:35,199
We have been invited to a party.
Call the local boy. Tell him what's up.

1042
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:39,921
Way out west
Old Dan Tucker

1043
01:14:40,007 --> 01:14:43,044
Popped some corn
Old Dan Tucker

1044
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:47,484
Let's go!
I am in the middle of a song here.

1045
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:51,116
Our plans have been changed.
Hey, come on!

1046
01:14:51,207 --> 01:14:54,199
Please trust me.
Get us a car.

1047
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:06,277
I could not be prouder today
to introduce to you the Happy girls!

1048
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:23,562
What the hell are we doin' here?
The alarm is in Chappy's office.

1049
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,998
Okay.

1050
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:43,045
Enough. I consider
the bank robbed, town safe.

1051
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:46,199
It's time to go.
Where are they?

1052
01:15:46,287 --> 01:15:48,039
Who?
Texas Marshals.

1053
01:15:51,487 --> 01:15:53,239
You saw Texas Marshals
out there?

1054
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:55,557
No.
Aw, Jesus, you scared me.

1055
01:15:55,727 --> 01:15:57,683
For a minute there
I thought we were in trouble.

1056
01:15:57,767 --> 01:16:00,235
They should be here by now.
No, see now

1057
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:02,522
if they responded to alarms
which they don't...

1058
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:07,158
I called them.
Jesus on a crutch! What the...

1059
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:10,796
I couldn't let him have Joe's bank.
I can't let Bob do that.

1060
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:16,199
They're here. I think it's time to go.
Thank you.

1061
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,801
No.

1062
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:26,764
Joe! Don't!

1063
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:31,437
Joe!

1064
01:16:31,527 --> 01:16:36,681
No, you gotta hit
Farm Market Road 2448. South to Happy.

1065
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:40,760
Great oogly moogly.
What is goin' on now?

1066
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:44,761
Look who's here, mija.

1067
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:46,200
Joe.

1068
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:48,517
He's talkin' to you.
Steven...

1069
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,918
That's enough.
I put four of them inside.

1070
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:54,396
Let's assume the woman
is a civilian.

1071
01:16:54,487 --> 01:16:57,001
You let me know when one of
you boys got a clear shot.

1072
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,556
You know what I
don't figure, goat boy?

1073
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:04,002
Either you're here for the cut...

1074
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:06,078
in which case
I'd just as soon shoot you

1075
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,283
or maybe you've come
for mi novia here.

1076
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:11,723
You don't have to hurt her, Bob.
Hurting her is not part of the deal.

1077
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:44,397
Now, you stand real still.
You hold this.

1078
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:49,441
I'm gonna have to ask you for your gun.
Gun?

1079
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:53,485
Amateurs.
Got an unidentified on the street.

1080
01:17:58,767 --> 01:18:03,283
Did anybody get ahold of the local?
Bob, we had a deal.

1081
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:05,323
You take the money.

1082
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:08,843
But I'm warnin' you, that's all
you're takin' out of here.

1083
01:18:08,927 --> 01:18:12,636
You're warning me?
You are one dumb peon.

1084
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,402
Shots fired!
Shots fired! Get him!

1085
01:18:24,687 --> 01:18:27,281
Will you tell your boy to cease fire
before he kills us all.

1086
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:28,800
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1087
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:45,518
Sir, we got us an officer in there.
What are we gonna do?

1088
01:18:45,607 --> 01:18:47,837
Admire him, son.

1089
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:49,758
That is one big dicked cop.

1090
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:02,964
Officer down!
Holy hell!

1091
01:19:03,047 --> 01:19:05,481
Somebody kill me
one of them bastards!

1092
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:21,282
Come on, lover!
Oh, Jesus!

1093
01:19:24,207 --> 01:19:26,038
Well, here's a surprise.

1094
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,642
You all right?
Don't you worry about me.

1095
01:19:31,127 --> 01:19:35,518
I've been hurt worse today.
Aw, Chappy.

1096
01:19:35,607 --> 01:19:37,882
Chappy.

1097
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:41,721
I want you to know
I'm not tryin' to rob the bank.

1098
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:46,164
That's good to know. I'd hate to think I
got shot tryin' to stop a bank robbery.

1099
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,283
You gonna be okay?

1100
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:54,122
I think I can take him.

1101
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:58,558
I'm a bit confused.

1102
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:06,281
I love small towns.

1103
01:20:12,127 --> 01:20:14,436
Get in!

1104
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,756
Damn!

1105
01:20:20,527 --> 01:20:23,405
What now?
Hit the brakes!

1106
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:29,962
You stay here with the local.

1107
01:20:35,807 --> 01:20:38,924
He's shooting! Turn!

1108
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,919
Hey! Jesus on a cracker!

1109
01:20:43,847 --> 01:20:45,963
We are in pursuit
of a late model tow truck...

1110
01:20:46,047 --> 01:20:48,117
pullin' an early model
recreational vehicle.

1111
01:20:48,207 --> 01:20:51,279
We're travellin' east
on Farm Road.

1112
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:53,722
Farm Road. Farm Road. Uh...

1113
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,526
1832, but you don't
wanna go that way.

1114
01:20:56,687 --> 01:21:00,396
1832 makes a big, lazy loop east.

1115
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:04,241
Instead, you fellas ought
to take 2886 south

1116
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,238
and I'll head 'em to you.

1117
01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:09,479
I'm gonna try to get up there.

1118
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:12,127
Ely, you still workin'
that east parcel?

1119
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:15,085
Hey, Chappy.
I need a favour.

1120
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:19,165
You mind drivin'?
I'm feelin' a little lightheaded.

1121
01:21:19,247 --> 01:21:22,364
Look, shooting them is not gonna
make this truck go any faster.

1122
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:24,802
But dumpin' them will.
Now, I want you to take the wheel.

1123
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:29,086
Joe!
Steven!

1124
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:32,239
What are you doing?
Trying to save you!

1125
01:21:32,327 --> 01:21:35,364
Well, cut it out!
I'm tryin' to save you!

1126
01:21:37,607 --> 01:21:39,882
If I don't kill you first.

1127
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:43,516
Tractor!

1128
01:21:44,407 --> 01:21:46,284
Watch it!

1129
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,718
Go! Go! Go!

1130
01:22:04,407 --> 01:22:07,205
Oh, beautiful.
Cops everywhere.

1131
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,802
Pull in there.
Oh, no. Not the pageant.

1132
01:22:20,647 --> 01:22:24,003
Out!
So there!

1133
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:27,926
Hey! The light is green!

1134
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:30,646
Oh! Hey! Ha!

1135
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:36,078
Adios, amigo.

1136
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:39,642
You all right?
He hurt you?

1137
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:49,721
Move! Move! Move!
Hold your fire.

1138
01:22:49,807 --> 01:22:51,763
That's real nice.

1139
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:54,566
Now, what we got here is
an old fashioned Mexican standoff.

1140
01:22:59,847 --> 01:23:02,520
Don't you ever talk to me
like that!

1141
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,484
Sic him!

1142
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:18,563
Hey, you guys are good.
You're fast.

1143
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,116
I don't know
what I run a 40, but...

1144
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:26,076
Whew! In those shoes?
Why, you guys are really good.

1145
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:32,082
That was for my girls!

1146
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:34,886
Hog tie that little convict prick!

1147
01:23:37,007 --> 01:23:38,838
What was that all about?

1148
01:23:47,847 --> 01:23:52,557
Escaped bank robbin' convict
and I'm dancin' with him.

1149
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:57,243
You know what they call that
in my line of work? Retirement.

1150
01:23:58,527 --> 01:24:01,121
Chappy, uh...

1151
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:04,005
I never meant...
Yeah, but you did.

1152
01:24:14,647 --> 01:24:19,243
And that's what life's for, right?
Findin' out?

1153
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:52,437
Sheriff Dent?

1154
01:24:53,607 --> 01:24:56,360
I just wanna shake your hand.

1155
01:24:56,447 --> 01:24:59,519
I wish there were more men
like you in law enforcement.

1156
01:24:59,687 --> 01:25:02,485
You are one big dicked cop.

1157
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:04,926
Thank you.

1158
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:19,683
Oh, my God! David!

1159
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:22,600
Miss Schaefer, don't you
worry about a thing.

1160
01:25:23,927 --> 01:25:27,078
I love you.
I love you too, David.

1161
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:28,725
Maddy!

1162
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:33,039
Maddy, I'm sorry! I'm not gonna be able
to hear your whole song, all right?

1163
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:35,402
I think you're a great kid!

1164
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:37,523
I like you a lot!

1165
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:39,518
Maddy!

1166
01:25:39,607 --> 01:25:41,165
Maddy!

1167
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:43,522
Remember to keep the beat!

1168
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:49,040
And let the beginning
start soft! Start soft.

1169
01:26:17,927 --> 01:26:19,758
Shh.

1170
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:31,918
Shh.

1171
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:38,364
It's oh so quiet

1172
01:26:41,607 --> 01:26:44,360
It's oh so still

1173
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:50,522
You're all alone

1174
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:52,723
Miss Schaefer.

1175
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,957
I love you, Miss Schaefer.

1176
01:26:55,967 --> 01:26:59,357
Doreen. You can call me Doreen.

1177
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:03,045
You can call me Wayne.

1178
01:27:03,127 --> 01:27:06,278
Look.
Looky what I done for you, sweetheart.

1179
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:11,080
Oh, Wayne!

1180
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:15,316
Wayne?

1181
01:27:15,407 --> 01:27:16,920
What's wrong, sugar darlin'?

1182
01:27:19,487 --> 01:27:21,318
Look what I've done.

1183
01:27:29,647 --> 01:27:31,478
I love that woman.

1184
01:27:34,487 --> 01:27:38,366
And so peaceful until

1185
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,798
You ring my bell

1186
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:43,718
Bam, bam

1187
01:27:43,807 --> 01:27:45,240
Shout, you yell

1188
01:27:47,127 --> 01:27:48,799
You broke the spell

1189
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,360
Gee, this is swell
You almost have a fit

1190
01:27:53,447 --> 01:27:55,324
This guy's gorge
and I got hit

1191
01:27:55,407 --> 01:27:57,967
There's no mistake
This is it

1192
01:27:58,047 --> 01:27:59,878
Until it's over

1193
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:01,958
And then

1194
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:08,843
It's nice and quiet

1195
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,921
But soon again

1196
01:28:32,527 --> 01:28:34,518
You look good.

1197
01:28:34,687 --> 01:28:37,121
There are very few things
that I remember about my mother.

1198
01:28:38,367 --> 01:28:40,676
But I do remember her tellin' me...

1199
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:44,316
"Look out for boys.
They have a way about 'em.

1200
01:28:44,407 --> 01:28:46,796
"Make you feel
like fine crystal one minute...

1201
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:48,366
an old penny the next."

1202
01:28:50,087 --> 01:28:52,317
I didn't come down here for you.
I came for me.

1203
01:28:54,727 --> 01:28:59,118
I just wanted to know all that time that we
were together all those things that you said

1204
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:01,084
were they just so you
could get into my bank?

1205
01:29:09,047 --> 01:29:10,958
Joe... Joe...
Please, Joe, wait!

1206
01:29:11,047 --> 01:29:12,924
Joe, I've been a screwup
my whole life

1207
01:29:13,007 --> 01:29:16,044
and I never thought twice about it
even in prison, not until you.

1208
01:29:16,127 --> 01:29:18,357
You make me think about it.

1209
01:29:18,447 --> 01:29:21,007
Don't make me come after you.
They'll shoot me!

1210
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:29,878
My life up till now
has been very fuzzy.

1211
01:29:29,967 --> 01:29:33,801
Now, the difference between
what is truth and what is not truth...

1212
01:29:33,887 --> 01:29:35,798
has been a problem for me.

1213
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:39,766
Joe. There is nothin'...

1214
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:41,565
fuzzy...

1215
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:43,957
about what I feel for you.

1216
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:49,884
You know, you spoke better
when you were gay.

1217
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:53,846
I want you to know, if you think
it will help, I'm willing to try that.

1218
01:29:53,927 --> 01:29:55,918
Please don't.

1219
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:57,884
You forgive me?

1220
01:29:57,967 --> 01:30:00,197
Not right now, no, but...

1221
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:04,121
I've got three to five
to think about it, don't I?

1222
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:07,357
Good behaviour
out in 22 months.

1223
01:30:07,447 --> 01:30:09,199
You think you're capable
of good behavior?

1224
01:30:09,287 --> 01:30:11,562
If you give me the chance
I could be very, very good.

1225
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:17,000
Perfect.

1226
01:30:17,087 --> 01:30:19,396
You blow a fuse

1227
01:30:19,487 --> 01:30:21,045
Zing, boom

1228
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:22,958
The devil cuts loose

1229
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:24,765
Zing, boom

1230
01:30:24,847 --> 01:30:26,519
So what's the use

1231
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,915
Whoa, bam

1232
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:29,838
Of falling in love

1233
01:30:32,807 --> 01:30:36,322
The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose

1234
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:40,525
You blow, blow, blow
blow, blow your fuse

1235
01:30:42,447 --> 01:30:45,245
When you've fallen in love

1236
01:30:51,807 --> 01:30:53,081
Shh.

1237
01:31:01,327 --> 01:31:04,797
Cute butt, sexy eyes

1238
01:31:04,887 --> 01:31:08,562
Tall and dark
I know what I like

1239
01:31:08,647 --> 01:31:10,319
Heart of gold

1240
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:12,523
Yes, yes, I'm here.

1241
01:31:12,687 --> 01:31:15,440
I want to report
a stolen recreational vehicle.

1242
01:31:15,527 --> 01:31:17,279
Very expensive.
Very expensive.

1243
01:31:17,367 --> 01:31:20,359
Brand new.
I'm very upset. It's brand new.

1244
01:31:20,447 --> 01:31:22,517
It is brand new
and I'm very upset.

1245
01:31:22,687 --> 01:31:24,723
Yes, I will. I will.

1246
01:31:24,807 --> 01:31:26,843
Okay. He's transferring me
to a detective.

1247
01:31:26,927 --> 01:31:30,317
I wish you would stop talkin' and
yappin' away when I'm tryin' to do this.

1248
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,363
Okay, if you want to do it
you can do it.

1249
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:34,961
I should have done it.
Well, then, don't sit and talk about
should've and would've.

1250
01:31:35,047 --> 01:31:36,719
I can cry on cue, Steven.

1251
01:31:36,807 --> 01:31:39,037
Well, I am trying to cry
and make it believable.

1252
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:41,595
I'm doing the best I can.

1253
01:31:42,595 --> 01:31:52,595
