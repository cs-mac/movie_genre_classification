1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Fitted to 2 CDs by azeroth

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,200
I am not a bum.

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a jerk.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
I once had wealth...

5
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,100
...power...

6
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
...and the love of a beautiful woman.

7
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,200
Now l only have two things...

8
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,600
...my friends...

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,900
...and...

10
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,000
...my thermos.

11
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,700
My story?

12
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
Okay.

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,700
It was never easy for me.

14
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,300
I was born a poor black child.

15
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,200
I remember the days...

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,500
...sitting on the porch with my family...

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
...singing and dancing...

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
...down in Mississippi.

19
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,400
-"Oh, lordy
-"Pick a bale of cotton

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,700
-"Oh, lordy

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,300

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,300
Boy, l hope everybody's good and hungry.

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,100
-I know l am.
-And l'm ready for that.

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
Here's corn bread.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Collard greens.
And l cooked up those hog maws you like.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,500
Mother, dear,
ain't we forgetting something?

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,400
No, l'm not. Today is Navin's birthday.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Happy birthday!.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,700
It's Navin's birthday!.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,700
And l cooked you up your favorite meal.

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Tuna fish salad on white bread
with mayonnaise...

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
...a Tab and a couple of Twinkies.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,900
-Here, darling.
-Mom, thanks.

55
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,400
You're gonna like that shit, man.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
I got you a present.

57
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,600
-Gee, Elvira.
-I made it myself.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,800
We got you something, too. A half bottle
of lilac vegetal. It's from both of us.

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,100
I drew you this picture.

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,400
-Here.
-Thank you.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
I want you to have my Zippo.

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,300
Dad, you had this since the war.

63
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Thanks.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,100
Thanks, everybody.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
God bless us...

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
...everyone.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,300
Navin!.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Will you pass me the potatoes
and the collard greens?

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,900
-Navin, darling.
-I'm sorry l spoiled the party, Mom.

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,600
You didn't spoil the party.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,100
I brought you a Twinkie.

72
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not hungry right now.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Feeling different again?

74
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
It's like l don't fit in.
It's like l don't belong here.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
It's your birthday, and it's time you knew.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
You're not our natural-born child.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm not?

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
You were left on our doorstep...

79
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,400
...but we raised you
like you were one of us.

80
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,500
You mean l'm going to stay this color?

81
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,500
I'd love you if you were the color
of a baboon's ass. Come here.

82
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,400
Navin, l wrapped your sandwich
in cellophane, just like you like it.

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,700
You want to come in and sing some blues?

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,100
No, thanks, Taj.

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,000
There's something about those songs.

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
They depress me.

87
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,000
Come here, darling.

88
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
That's it, darling.

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
You're getting the rhythm. See?

90
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
And that concludes
this Sunday night Gospel Hour...

91
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,400
...live from the
Four Square Gospel Church...

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,500
...at the Divine Salvation
in St. Louis, Missouri.

93
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,900
The Reverend Willard Willman, Pastor.

94
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,200
And now, music throughout the night.

95
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Music in a mellow mood.

96
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
-Grandma!.
-What happened?

97
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,300
-Look!.
-What happened?

98
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Don't touch that radio!. Don't touch it!.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,700
Turn it up!. Turn it up!.

100
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,900
I've never heard music like this before!.

101
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
It speaks to me!. Taj!. Dad!.

102
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
This is unbelievable. Now watch.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,500
Yeah?

104
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,500
Well, if this is out there,
think how much more is out there!.

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,900
This is the kind of music that tells me
to go out there and be somebody!.

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
-But Navin--
-Let him go.

107
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
Now that you're going out into the world...

108
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,500
...there's something you should know.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,100
-You see that?
-Yeah.

110
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
That's shit.

111
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,300
And this is Shinola.

112
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Shit.

113
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,100
Shinola.

114
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,500
Son, you're gonna be all right.

115
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,200
Now, what town
are you gonna try for first?

116
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,500
I thought l'd go to St. Louis 'cause
that's where that radio show was from.

117
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,500
And remember,
the Lord loves a working man.

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
-"Lord loves a working man."
-And son...

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,500
...don't never, ever trust Whitey.

120
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,200
"Don't trust Whitey. Lord loves
a working man, don't trust Whitey."

121
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,600
Baby.

122
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,000
Daddy.

123
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Pierre. Come here.

124
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
Don't you forget to grow up now.

125
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,100
-Good luck, brother.
-Send me a picture postcard.

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay, let the boy go.

127
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
-Bye.
-We got work to do.

128
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,000
And l hope you find
whatever it is you're looking for.

129
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,500
I will, Ma. I know it's out there.

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,400
It's out there, all right. If you catch it,
see a doctor and get rid of it.

131
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
-"See a doctor and get rid of it."
-Good luck.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
"Lord loves a working man.
Don't trust Whitey.

133
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,800
"See a doctor and get rid of it."

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Bye, Grandma!.

135
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
I sure do miss Navin.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,100
Is he ever coming back?

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Take away his place setting.
It's making us too goddamn sad.

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I wonder if he's doing all right?

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Navin!. How you doing?

140
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,100
Don't worry about me.
I think l see a car coming.

141
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,600
No, wait. It's a truck!.

142
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,100
Lord...

143
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,600
...take care of our little boy.

144
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
-I'm hitchhiking.
-How far you going?

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,300
St. Louis. How far are you going?

146
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,900
To the end of this fence.

147
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,100
Okay.

148
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm Navin Johnson. What's your name, sir?

149
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
-Here we are.
-Okay.

150
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,800
Thanks for the company.

151
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,300
I hope l can repay you someday.

152
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Well, what is it, boy? Are you lost?

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you want to play? ls it trouble?

154
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Trouble?

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Is it an accident?

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,300
A drowning?

157
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,300
A fire?

158
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Fire!.

159
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
We've got to warn everybody!.

160
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,600
I've heard about dogs like you.
You're going to be famous!.

161
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,000
You're going to get your picture taken,
and they'll put it in the paper!.

162
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,800
This is exciting!.

163
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,800
You saved my life!.
Come on, let's warn everybody!.

164
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,300
Fire!. It's a fire!. Fire!. There's a fire!.

165
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,400
Everybody!. Up!. Wake up!. It's a fire!.

166
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,500
It's a fire!.
This dog, he's saving everybody's life!.

167
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,100
He's unbelievable!. He's some dog!.
He's a lifesaver!.

168
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,700
That's what l'll call him, too!.
Ol' Lifesaver!. That will be your name!.

169
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Folks!. False alarm. There's no fire.

170
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Mister, don't call that dog "Lifesaver."

171
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
-No?
-Call him "Shithead."

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
Good. "Shithead."

173
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,900
It's exciting.

174
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,400
It's just exciting to have
this kind of life on the road.

175
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,500
A guy and his dog.

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
St. Louis?

177
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,300
No. Navin Johnson.

178
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
No, do you want a lift to St. Louis?

179
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
-Okay, thanks.
-Hop in.

180
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,900
This'll be fine right here.

181
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
Thank you.

182
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,500
-Where you going?
-To the bathroom.

183
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
-Got to have a key.
-Can l get one?

184
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,200
My key is for customers who buy gas.

185
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm buying gas.

186
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't see no car.

187
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,700
I just need enough for my lighter.

188
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
Look at this!.

189
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
And my wife wanted me to stay home.
Look what l would've missed.

190
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
A complete fill-up for a whole lighter?

191
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
-It's on that wall.
-Thank you.

192
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,100
-And don't walk away with it.
-I won't.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,300
Pop-top.

194
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
Silver Bird, l'm talking to you!.

195
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,200
Listen, you want to be
president of Texaco Oil?

196
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
-Sure!.
-Then clean up the sink in there.

197
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,300
Then l'll be president of Texaco Oil?

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Whatever happened
to working your way up?

199
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,900
Working for me 10 minutes, and already
he wants to be president. The nerve.

200
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,300
Get to work in there!.

201
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,700
But, sir, l don't work here.

202
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
Not even for $1 .10 an hour?

203
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,400
"Dear Folks, l got this greatjob
in a gas station.

204
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
"l don't want to say
how much l'm getting...

205
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,900
"...but let'sjust say it's a lot!

206
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
"l'm enclosing $2!"

207
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,400
That's a good boy!.

208
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
"lt's a lot of fun working,
and Mr. Hartounian is really nice.

209
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
"He's teaching me how to be impatient.

210
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,500
"Well, l've got to go now. What do you
think l do, write letters all day?"

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,000
-You actually sleep here?
-Yes. Is that okay?

212
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,900
Come with me.
I got a beautiful little place for you.

213
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,600
Put the light on.
You're going to like it here.

214
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,700
Like it? l love it!. This is fabulous!.

215
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,800
You got the toilet here!.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,600
This must be the kitchen. No.

217
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,700
You know what l could do...

218
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,100
...is take this wall
and just turn it this way...

219
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,400
...so l've got a larger living space...

220
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,300
...plus it'll create a flow into
the main living area. It'll be incredible.

221
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,900
No, l'll just elevate this about six inches...

222
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,700
...create the illusion of two rooms,
and yet still have that flow.

223
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Then l can take bookshelves
and put it here.

224
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,000
No, l'll put the books right over here.
That way l can be relaxing over here...

225
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,000
...the customers can use the urinal. I won't
disturb them, they won't disturb me.

226
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,000
Take it easy. It's not here. It's in here.

227
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,800
I couldn't afford this anyway.

228
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
Well, this is it.

229
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,700
It's perfect!.

230
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I won't have to change this at all!.

231
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,300
Take a look.

232
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
No kitchen, no windows,
no chairs, no tables.

233
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
It's a masterpiece of understatement.

234
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,500
I'll put a bed down here, get a bigger bulb.
I'll bring some sheets from the house.

235
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
You'll be set for life.

236
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
How much is this gonna cost me?

237
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Nothing. When you're rich and famous,
you'll send me a postcard.

238
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,400
A postcard?

239
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,100
Okay!. It's a deal.

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,200
It's a deal.

241
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,700
What are those?

242
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,800
Step outside for a second, darling.

243
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Navin, this is my wife Lenore.
Lenore, this is Navin.

244
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
Pleased to meet you.

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Do you know why a woman
of such pulchritude is married to me?

246
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
'Cause l make a comfortable living.

247
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,100
This is the first time
l'm leaving you alone on a Sunday.

248
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,100
If anything should happen to this station,
this woman would leave me like a--

249
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
In other words, there would be no more....

250
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
-Do you know what l'm talking about?
-Yes, sir. No more....

251
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,600
So remember,
guard this station with your life...

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,500
...because my sex life is in your hands.

253
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,900
I can fix those shocks.

254
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,400
No. We just want some gas, muchacho.

255
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Okay. But it's Sunday.
We've got to have a credit card.

256
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,700
And all the cash is locked up?

257
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,700
No, not locked up. We got a lot of cash.
Just that the banks are closed...

258
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,600
...and l'm not allowed to have cash
coming in or out.

259
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,700
I'm alone for the first time.
I don't want anything to happen.

260
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,900
You flash this kind of wad in front
of some people, they'll kill you for it.

261
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
So, we've got to have a credit card.

262
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,300
Have we got a credit card in there?

263
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
Credit card.

264
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

265
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
-What kind of cigarette is that?
-Joint.

266
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Joint?

267
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,800
They don't make 'em very good.

268
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,200
-MasterCharge do?
-That's fine. We take MasterCharge.

269
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,200
You want a fill-up, Mrs. Nussbaum?

270
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm Mr. Nussbaum.

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,700
Yeah, that's his wife's card.

272
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
-His wife's card?
-Yeah, l'll vouch for him.

273
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Okay, as long as we got a voucher.

274
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
Stolen!.

275
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,500
I got it!. Just send a police car over.

276
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,100
Mrs. Nussbaum's credit card!.
I got the guys who stole it.

277
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Hold on, they're calling me!.
I'll be right back!.

278
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,800
-Yes?
-Yeah, throw a couple of tires in the trunk.

279
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,500
Put it on the card. Radials.

280
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,300
-Make them whitewalls.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Nussbaum.

281
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm back, only it's worse than l thought.

282
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,400
They're not only sticking us for gas,
but grabbing tires and everything.

283
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
They're really socking it to us.

284
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
Yeah, it's Hartounian's Gas Station
at the corner--

285
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,900
Hang on a second.
I don't want to get 'em suspicious.

286
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,400
Don't worry, l can keep 'em here.
I saw this trick in a movie.

287
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
-Got your tires!.
-Yeah, good.

288
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,900
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

289
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,100
We'll take that money
you got in your pocket.

290
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Sure. I'll just put it on the card.

291
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,600
Guess what!.
You're our eighth customer today!.

292
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
You won a free oven mitt!.

293
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,000
I'll go get it for you.

294
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
Yeah, l'm back.

295
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,600
Yeah, they're gonna be here for a while.
Don't worry. I've rigged it.

296
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,300
You guys want to stick around
for an oven mitt?

297
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,000
Hang on just a second.

298
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,700
They might not be here
exactly when you get back but...

299
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,700
...it's a blue Chevy two-door.

300
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
And it'd be going south on Hertado Street.

301
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,200
No, l can't make out
the license number, but...

302
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,300
...it'd be pulling a small church.

303
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,700
Any blue Chevy pulling a small church
l figure that'd be the one, yeah.

304
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,300
Believe me, l'm not mad at you.

305
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
What's the matter with you?
What did l lose, a couple of tires?

306
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,100
Look at the bright side.
We also lost a church.

307
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,800
Mr. Hartounian.

308
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, my God!.

309
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Thank you.

310
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,300
The new phone book's here!.

311
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,700
I wish l could get that excited
about nothing.

312
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,600
Nothing? Are you kidding? Page 73!.

313
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,700
"Johnson, Navin R."

314
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,600
I'm somebody now!. Millions of people
look at this book every day!.

315
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,200
This is the kind of spontaneous publicity...

316
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,500
...your name in print, that makes people!.

317
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,300
I'm in print!.

318
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,200
Things are going to start happening
to me now.

319
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
"Johnson, Navin R."

320
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,000
Sounds like a typical bastard.

321
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,700
Die, Navin R. Johnson.

322
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,300
Bastard!.

323
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,800
Random son of a bitch,
typical run-of-the-mill bastard.

324
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,000
-Fill 'er up?
-Fill 'er up and a little bit extra.

325
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
-Stan Fox, buying gas.
-Navin R. Johnson selling it, sir!.

326
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,500
Gotcha, you average...

327
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,000
...typical blocking-the-view-
of-a-goddamn-average-victim bastard!.

328
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,400
-Check your oil?
-Check away, Navin R. Johnson.

329
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,100
Oil rag at the ready, sir!.

330
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
-Let's check the oil together.
-Yes, sir.

331
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Thank you.

332
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,700
Son-of-a-blocking bastard!.

333
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
Looks good to me, sir,
but l'd like your opinion.

334
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,100
Damn these glasses.

335
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,000
It looks good to me, too.
Hurry up. Time's a wasting.

336
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm going to the john. Don't forget
to check those tires. Damn these glasses.

337
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes, sir!. I damn thee!.

338
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,600
Damn!.

339
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,100
Damn these glasses!.

340
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
-I can fix those glasses.
-You can?

341
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Well, here, fix those suckers!.

342
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,300
Shit!.

343
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,400
Guess what? l fixed 'em.

344
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,600
I was back there thinking...

345
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
..."What causes glasses to slip on and off?. "

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,500
And it's because
when you take them on and off...

347
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
...you're putting pressure on the frames.

348
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,500
It causes them to spread.

349
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,700
So l put a little handle
right here in the center...

350
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,300
...that puts the pressure on the bridge.

351
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Just like the tie rods on a '72 Buick.

352
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,700
Plus, l put a little nose brake on here
to prevent slippage. Try it.

353
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Use the handle.

354
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Well, l'll be.

355
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,000
It works.

356
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,700
I make a pretty good living
selling shit like this. I'll tell you what.

357
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,200
If l can develop this gizmo,
l'll split it with you fifty-fifty.

358
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,200
How much for the gas?
l got a load of shit to sell.

359
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,200
-$26.41 .
-Here's a triple dix. Keep the change.

360
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Thanks!.

361
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,900
Dead center!. Say your prayers, half-breed!.

362
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,200
Harry!. Look at this!.

363
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,400
What's the matter with these cans?

364
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Die, milk-face!.

365
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,500
These cans are defective.
They're springing leaks.

366
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Come and look at this.

367
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,200
You better run for cover
or you'll spring a leak.

368
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,300
We don't have defective cans.
We have a defective person!.

369
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,600
He hates these cans.

370
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,900
Stay away from the cans!.

371
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
Die, gas pumper!.

372
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,500
I've got to get away from those cans!.

373
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,700
There's cans in there, too!.

374
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,100
Run!. Run!.

375
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,500
More cans!.

376
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,000
Die, you bastard!.

377
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,000
He doesn't want to put holes in cans.
He wants to put holes in you.

378
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
What?

379
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,500
Milk-faced bastard!.

380
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh, my God!. I'm endangering your life!.

381
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,000
-Cover me!.
-You're covered.

382
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,500
Suck my toes!.

383
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,800
You stay here!. I'll distract him!.

384
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,300
Shithead!. Come on!.

385
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,800
Come on, boy!. Good boy!.

386
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,600
"Carnival personnel only." Damn!.

387
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
Shithead, come on!.

388
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
You're not carnival personnel!.

389
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,100
He's not carnival personnel!.

390
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
Okay, move it out!.

391
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
"So, Mom, when l told Mr. Hartounian
l'd come back, he said:

392
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,900
"'Don't be a putz.

393
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,400
"'See the world. Me you've seen already.'

394
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,000
"l took his advice and got a job with
SJM Fiesta Shows as a weight guesser.

395
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,800
"Frosty, my boss, told me
there's a big future in weight guessing.

396
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,100
"Enclosed is $4.75 for my loving family.

397
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,600
"P.S. Is grandma still farting?"

398
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,400
For $1, l'll guess your weight,
your height or your sex.

399
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,400
The most exciting thing on the midway.

400
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,800
Imagine the thrill of getting
your weight guessed by a professional.

401
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,100
You can blow up your cheeks,
you can stick out your chest...

402
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,700
...but you're not going to fool the guesser!.

403
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,100
How 'bout you, sir? Step right up!.

404
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,800
Honey, let's see how good this guy is.
Now, what do l win?

405
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,700
Anything in this general area right in here.

406
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Anything below the stereo and
on this side of the bicentennial glasses.

407
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,200
Anything between the ashtrays
and the thimble.

408
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Anything in this three inches
right in here, in this area.

409
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,500
That includes the Chiclets,
but not the erasers.

410
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,400
No, sir!. Come on, honey.

411
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,800
He thought he had himself a rube.

412
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,000
Frosty, l'm no good at this.

413
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,000
Come on. You're doing fine.

414
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,000
I've already given away eight pencils,
two hula dolls and an ashtray...

415
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,400
...and l've only taken in $15.

416
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,500
Navin, you have taken in $15...

417
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,300
...and given away 50 cents worth of crap!.

418
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,100
Which gives us a net profit of $14.50.

419
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,400
It's a profit deal.

420
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,400
Takes the pressure off.

421
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,200
Get your weight guessed right here!.
Only a buck!.

422
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Actual weight guessing!. Take a chance,
win some crap. Step right up--

423
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,500
Ladies and gentlemen...

424
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,400
...l draw your attention now
to the left side ofthe midway.

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,300
Presenting the amazing Patti Bernstein...

426
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
...doing her special ride...

427
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
...through the Flaming Wall of Death!

428
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Want to guess my weight, Greenie?

429
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,300
I saw you last night. You were great.

430
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,800
Yeah, right. Turn around.

431
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,800
What?

432
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,700
Turn around.

433
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,200
Go like this.

434
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,500
You're okay.
Give me a bite of that corn dog.

435
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,900
What about germs?

436
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,700
Put a rubber on it.

437
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,800
Get on.

438
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,800
Don't you wear him out!.
He's got to work tonight.

439
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,400
What a great place!.

440
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,400
You know, you can tell so much
about a person from the way they live.

441
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Just looking around here, l can tell...

442
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,500
...you're a genuinely dirty person.

443
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,800
What do l do with this?

444
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,100
You keep it there.

445
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
Where's your garbage?

446
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
There.

447
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,200
-Do you know what l'd like to do?
-What?

448
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Guess your weight.

449
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,900
That would be interesting for me.

450
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,300
No one has tried to guess my weight.

451
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
-I guess their weight so it would be sort--
-Put your arms up.

452
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,900
This will give me
a whole different perspective on this.

453
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,500
You're really trying to be accurate.

454
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,300
Is it getting hot in here?

455
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,300
Wait a minute!.

456
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
What's happening to my special purpose?

457
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,700
What's your special purpose?

458
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,900
When l was a kid, my mom told me
that was my special purpose...

459
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,000
...and someday l'd find out
what that special purpose was!.

460
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,900
Today's the day!.

461
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,700
This is like a ride!.

462
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,900
"My dear family, guess what?

463
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,000
"Today l found out
what my special purpose is for.

464
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,400
"Gosh, what a great time l had.

465
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,700
"l wish the whole family
could have been here with me.

466
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,900
"Maybe some other time...

467
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,500
"...as l intend to do this a lot...

468
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,700
"...every chance l get.

469
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,700
"l think next week
l'll be able to send more money...

470
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,400
"...as l may have extra work.

471
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,000
"My friend Patti promised me a blow job.

472
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,100
"Your loving son, Navin."

473
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,000
And he's got the kisses here.

474
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,100
-That Patti must be a sweet girl.
-God bless her.

475
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,600
Do you think we'll get to know each other
well enough to kiss?

476
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
We don't have to. You're my man.

477
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,200
It's like we're married. Look at my ass.

478
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,400
You have my last name tattooed
right there under the J's.

479
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,400
First l get my name in the phone book,
and now l'm on your ass.

480
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,700
You know, l'll bet more people
see that than the phone book.

481
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,300
End of the line.

482
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,900
This is Engineer Fred.
Come back and visit me again.

483
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,500
Billy!.

484
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,600
Have you seen a 5-year-old boy, blond hair,
wearing a T-shirt that says "bullshit" on it?

485
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,100
No, there was just one kid had a T-shirt
that said "life sucks" on it.

486
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,000
We got off the Round-Up,
and he said he wanted to go on the train.

487
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
There he is!. Billy!.

488
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
-Come back here!.
-Get off the train.

489
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Pull that lever!. Pull the lever!.

490
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,200
Here, hold that!. And these!.

491
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,700
Take my keys. And hold my wallet. Okay.

492
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Don't touch the Johnson bar,
you'll explode the fuel casing!.

493
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,600
And if the Wolfe and Smith
indicator gets above 160...

494
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,700
-...turn that off there.
-I can't take you here anymore.

495
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
There's a screwdriver.
Put it in, turn it one quarter.

496
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,000
Listen, we're going into a tunnel.

497
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,700
Don't stand up.
The clearance is only 4 foot--

498
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
-No.
-I'm okay.

499
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,100
I was protected by the bill
of my Engineer Fred cap.

500
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Thanks for pulling my cap down.

501
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,600
You scared me half to death.
Thank you so much.

502
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
It would've been so embarrassing
to go home without Billy.

503
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,100
Here's your gloves
and your oil can and your wallet.

504
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,500
And this fell out.

505
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,200
Those guys!.

506
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Listen, what you did just now
was very brave.

507
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,200
Is there some way l could repay you?

508
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,900
Repay me?

509
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,200
I could never accept anything from you
for saving your child.

510
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,600
He's not my child.
I'm just baby-sitting for a friend.

511
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,200
-Would it be too much if l asked for a kiss?
-No.

512
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,900
He's a real little dickens.

513
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,200
Thank you.

514
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,100
Miss?

515
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I was just standing here right now,
and l was...

516
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,600
...wondering, if you weren't
doing anything tomorrow...

517
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,300
...maybe you might want to go out with....

518
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,300
What?

519
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,200
I thought maybe you might
want to go out with me.

520
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,100
Are you trying to ask me for a date?

521
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,900
Once for no, twice for yes.

522
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,300
Okay.

523
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
You're so cute.

524
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,600
How about 3:30 tomorrow
at the Round-Up?

525
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
Okay.

526
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Do you have any boyfriends?

527
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,000
Not really.

528
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,900
Are they crazy? lf l was a fella,
l'd be around all the time.

529
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,700
Well, see if you can work it out.

530
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,900
We have a date tomorrow.

531
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,400
What's your name?

532
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Marie.

533
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,200
What's yours?

534
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,600
I'll tell you tomorrow. It'll give us
something interesting to talk about.

535
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Hi!.

536
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
What's up, hubby?

537
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,800
I got these for you.

538
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,300
Thanks.

539
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Navin, you know the other day
when l showed you the tattoo?

540
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,300
Yeah.

541
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Well, l forgot to tell you something.

542
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,900
-Really? What?
-This.

543
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,800
That's what's going to happen to you if
l ever catch you looking at another broad.

544
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,800
I'm glad you told me.

545
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,500
And remember, l did this without anger.

546
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,100
And l stayed away from your crotch.

547
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,000
Bye, sweetie.

548
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,100
-Hi!.
-What happened?

549
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,600
It was unbelievable.
These guys jumped me.

550
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,800
They tried to get these flowers.
I got 'em for you.

551
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
It's kind of a traditional date deal.

552
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,900
Yeah, l've heard of that. What were they?

553
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,300
Couple of dozen roses.

554
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,900
Look like daisy stems.

555
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,000
What? That guy gypped me.

556
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,100
Put daisy stems on my roses.

557
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,300
Look, these hoodlums are dangerous.

558
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,200
I think we ought to get out of here
before she sees us.

559
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,800
-"She"?
-What?

560
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,700
-You said "she."
-No!.

561
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,600
I always call a gang "she."

562
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,200
It's like when you call a boat "she"
or a hurricane "she."

563
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,500
Or a girl?

564
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,300
You can call a girl "she." That's just one
of the many things you can call "she."

565
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,100
Why are you smiling?

566
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,400
You're the fiirst person
l've ever had at my place.

567
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,100
Do you live here?

568
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,200
It's nice.

569
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,600
Did you decorate it?

570
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,300
I got this from the old Cup O' Pizza place
before they tore it down.

571
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,100
That was really good pizza.

572
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
This is the best pizza in a cup ever.

573
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,000
This guy's unbelievable. He ran the old
Cup O' Pizza guy out of business.

574
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,700
People come from all over to get this.

575
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,700
You know, you have beautiful skin.

576
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,100
May l?

577
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,100
So smooth and flexible.

578
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,700
I take after my mother's side of the family.

579
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,700
It's amazing the way it
just snaps back like that. Amazing.

580
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
-Are you a model?
-No.

581
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
I'm a cosmetologist.

582
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,300
Really? A cosmetologist?

583
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,100
That's unbelievable.

584
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,300
That's impressive.

585
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,500
It must be tough
to handle the weightlessness.

586
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,500
Can l ask you a personal question?

587
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,600
What is it?

588
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,100
Now be totally honest.

589
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,800
You do have a boyfriend, don't you?

590
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,800
Kind of.

591
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
I know this is our first date, but...

592
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,100
...do you think the next time
you make love to your boyfriend...

593
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,600
...you could think of me?

594
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,300
-I haven't made love to him yet.
-That's too bad.

595
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,500
Do you think it's possible that...

596
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,200
...someday...

597
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,000
...you could make love with me
and think of him?

598
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,600
Who knows?

599
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Maybe you and he can make love
and you could think of me.

600
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,100
I'd just be happy to be in there somewhere.

601
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,500
Do you have a girlfriend?

602
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,500
-Does it matter?
-I'd like to think you were available.

603
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,600
I'm available.

604
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,600
Did you forget about my ass?

605
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,000
No, l've been thinking about it.

606
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
She tattooed my name on her ass.

607
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Not just my name. A lot of names!.

608
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,600
And funny things, too. She's got one
up here that says "Slippery when wet."

609
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,900
-How do you know that?
-What is she, some great piece of ass?

610
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,300
She's no great piece of ass!.

611
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,100
I mean, wait a minute.

612
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,500
We're all adults here.
Let's reason this out.

613
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,100
Marie's the type of person that if you got--

614
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,400
If this gash doesn't get out of here...

615
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
...l am gonna drive this bike up her butt!.

616
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,900
While Patti tends to be more direct.

617
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
As for you, farm boy....

618
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,500
We're married!.

619
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,900
And as for you, kewpie doll--

620
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,500
You protected me.
You must really like me.
