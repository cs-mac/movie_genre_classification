1
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,203
<i>- Good morning, Dad.
- Morning, Jennifer.</i>

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,843
<i>When you were in school,
did you ever cut class?</i>

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,321
<i>Yeah. Most kids cut classes.</i>

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,247
<i>- Good. Sign this.
- Get your mother to sign it. I'm late.</i>

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,882
<i>But Mom doesn't understand.
She never cut classes.</i>

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,490
<i>- Mommy never cut classes.
- Will you stop copying me?</i>

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,722
<i>- Jack, breakfast!
- I haven't time.</i>

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,441
<i>Make time. You can't start your day
without a good breakfast.</i>

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,241
<i>Yeah, I made it for you, Dad!
Breakfast is my class project.</i>

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,042
<i>- What did you make?
- Spaghetti and one hard-boiled egg.</i>

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,969
<i>Tell you what, hold the spaghetti, throw
in another egg and I'll eat it in the car.</i>

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,011
Jack!

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,491
Jack!

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,371
You stop, or I'll shoot! Jack!

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,771
- Go away, I'm late.
- What's in the cup?

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,161
- Herbal tea.
- Liar. Give it to me.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,641
I like coffee! It picks me up.

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,690
It gives you heartburn
and flattens your adrenals.

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,571
- How does it feel to always be right?
- I revel in it.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,291
Watch your toes, Mother Teresa.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,085
- I love you!
- Bring it up now when I'm going to work.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,571
Great!

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
Don't they teach those kids anything?

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,083
You're supposed to put it in cold water
after you boil them.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,645
Wonderful.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,324
Not bad.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,488
<i>If you did contribute, the Lord
will guarantee you a place in heaven.</i>

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,644
<i>Will there be weeping
and gnashing of teeth, or...?</i>

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,088
<i>Jesus said, "Don't talk to me
when I'm talking to you..."</i>

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,163
<i>- Jeez!
- ...an enemy of the Lord?</i>

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,201
<i>Wouldn't you like the Reverend Archie's
personally edited Bible In your home?</i>

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,848
Jeez!

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,243
My fault, it was my fault! My fault!

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,449
I should've told him
to boil the other egg.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,886
Son of a bitch, why don't you come
back and try that again? Moron!

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,770
- Hey, excuse me! Hello?
- Sorry, pal, I'm late.

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,447
What am I supposed to do?
Wait here all day?

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,403
This is great. Nice way to start the day.

39
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,248
Oh, God! I'm not built for this.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,569
Damn! I'm going to get that guy.

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,001
I'm late now.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,169
What are these things for?
I've been here ten years.

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,484
They know who I am by now.
Stupid thing!

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,849
I'm late again. This is going to look good.

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,245
You descend and maintain 12,000.
Pan Am three, descend to 15,000.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,804
- <i>Then</i> turn right <i>to 2-5-0 degrees.</i>
- <i>This is Pan Am three, say again.</i>

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,326
I say again, descend to 15,000

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,723
and turn right to 2-5-0.

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,761
<i>A Lufthansa jumbo is in that space.
What are you trying to do? Mate us?</i>

50
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,445
Pan Am three, disregard.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,208
Maintain at 17,000
and present heading 2-2-0.

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,161
United three-two, turn right,
heading 1-7-0.

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,802
American four-one, reduce ten knots.

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,361
And you,
November-three-four-seven-Golf...

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,722
Where are you?

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,008
Where the hell are you?

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,528
Come in! Where are you? I should...
Acknowledge, please!

58
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,887
Acknowledge! Where are you?

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,371
- It's OK.
- No!

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,047
- I got a small plane here I can't find.
- Jack...

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,931
...a fly landed on your screen.

62
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,130
I hate flies! I hate them. Filthy things!
They do that, that's what they do.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,965
Jack, let's take your break.

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,926
- Hal, can't you pull some strings for me?
- The Agency gave you a mandatory five.

65
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,244
You've been landing planes for 13 years.
Face it, you're burned out.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,803
It's not a dirty word in this business.
As your friend, you need this rest.

67
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,407
I can't believe they're doing this!
Just because of a fly!

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,523
- Rats! That hurt!
- What's he kicking, Mom?

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,604
- I don't know.
- Oh, boy!

70
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,411
He's just a little over...

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,320
- Daddy, can I drive?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,681
- You can have the second 100 miles.
- Are you going to keep doing that?

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,002
- Bobby, knock it off.
- OK.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,565
I've forgotten something. What is it?

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,963
Only the wallpaper,
but we can get some on the road.

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,401
Don't mock me, Sandy. It's the first time
I've gone on one of these.

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,609
- I'm a little nervous, all right?
- I know. Sorry.

78
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,127
- All got your seat belts on?
- Dad!

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,521
All right, here we go.

80
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,251
- All right!
- Yeah!

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,324
- All right!
- Can't wait to swim in the ocean.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,404
OK, OK! Next stop, Citrus Cove, Florida.

83
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,002
- Daddy, I have to pee.
- Now I know what I forgot.

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,364
- He didn't say how many rooms?
- It's three bedrooms and on a beach.

85
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,651
- It was real nice of Hal to find it for us.
- And to point out I'm cracking up.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,009
You are not cracking up.
You just need a rest.

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,686
Didn't we just get back from Hawaii?

88
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,208
Jack, that was our honeymoon.

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,091
Yeah. Hey, this might be fun.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,810
Rise and shine, everybody! We're here!

91
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,451
- Hey, look! Water!
- Dad, can we go swimming?

92
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,889
- Look at the water! It's beautiful!
- I told you I'd find Florida.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,567
Now all you have to do
is find Citrus Cove.

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,643
Found it.

95
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,849
- Beach Lane. Good navigating, honey.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,447
- What are we looking for?
- 411, 411

97
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,125
413...

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,203
415! This is it.

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,651
Oh, my! Hal is a friend.
It's two storeys, it's redwood...

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,327
It's got balconies!
Can I have a balcony room, please?

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,721
- This is great!
- Goodness!

102
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,251
- Watch me! OK, Dad, here I go.
- This is gorgeous.

103
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,291
It really is very lovely.
I hope the keys are in the mailbox.

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,731
There they are, just like the old man said.
All right, let's go! Come on!

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,727
All right, contestants, let's see
what's behind door number one.

106
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,167
- Oh, Jack!
- It's beautiful!

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,120
- Look at these glass pieces.
- Mom, this is huge.

108
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,282
Look, they got a piano.

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,841
Honey, look at the view!

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,446
We're right on the water! Wow!

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,848
- It's a brochure.
- It's a postcard.

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,321
Don't run up those stairs.

113
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,324
- Bobby, move!
- I'm trying! These are heavy.

114
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,847
- This is heavy, too.
- Hi.

115
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,328
Archie! It's OK,
he's just barking, that's all.

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,881
Just barking. Don't be afraid.

117
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,610
Come on, Arch!

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,970
He always barks at people he likes.
Come on, Arch!

119
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,931
He must really like you a lot.
Archie, get your ass up here!

120
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,326
- Where do they go?
- Let me help.

121
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,767
No, don't throw off my balance.

122
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,526
Why not empty the U-Haul tomorrow?

123
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,641
No, I'm putting all my suffering into
one day. I don't mind unloading bags.

124
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,247
- I just don't want to do it for a living.
- It's still early.

125
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,803
I'll go to the grocery store. When you've
finished, take the kids swimming.

126
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,487
Swimming?
Gee, I forgot my bathing suit!

127
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,530
Guess I can't go in the water all summer.

128
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,889
Jack, nobody cares what you look like
in a bathing suit.

129
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,724
That's just it.

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,360
- I'll pick one up.
- I won't wear it.

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,971
- Not until I lose three or four pounds.
- I love the way you look in a bathing suit.

132
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,169
My mother was right. You're twisted.

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,930
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, Dad.

134
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,491
Me neither.

135
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,563
- We want to go in.
- Good idea.

136
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,724
- You guys go for a swim.
- Aren't you coming?

137
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,362
No, I'll watch.
I don't want to get too wet my first day.

138
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,206
- All right. Can you hold these for me?
- Yeah, sure.

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,723
There you go.

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,569
This thing must be pretty good for $80.

141
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,724
How do you shut it off? Equaliser...

142
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,610
Loud, eh?

143
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,401
Hi. Jack Chester, I'm your neighbour.
And you're?

144
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,244
Having lunch.

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,890
Looks good.

146
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,731
Just enjoy. I don't want to bother you.
I'll join you later for Martinis.

147
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,690
Kidding.

148
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,763
Just watching my kids.

149
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,604
I'll be here.

150
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,051
Enjoy.

151
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,571
- Don't worry, it's dead.
- Bobby, I told you not to do that.

152
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,246
Dad, she told me to do it!

153
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,450
- Enough! Just get it out of here.
- Dad, you're kind of red.

154
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,810
Good.

155
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,681
I wanted to get a little colour, you know.

156
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,604
That's a good base.

157
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,367
That's a good base.
You got to do these things in stages.

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,604
- Let me put this on.
- Does it look that bad?

159
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,207
Your nose would show up on satellite.
Want me to drive?

160
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,523
I'm OK, as long as
I don't have to make many turns.

161
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,126
Where are we going? I'm starving.

162
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,046
- A place called the Yachthouse.
- It has fresh seafood.

163
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,441
- Let's talk lobster.
- Lobster!

164
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,003
- Would that be a three pounder?
- Three pounds, one quarter.

165
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,085
- Perfect.
- Yours is the next table.

166
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,605
Sorry. Excuse me. You're next.
I'm not next. I was just...

167
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm next way down the line. I was just
checking out my dinner... Sorry.

168
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,124
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon. Pardon. Sorry.

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,131
- Excuse me.
- How does it look?

170
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,081
- A while yet. I got mints and toothpicks.
- Can I take some home for Archie?

171
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,286
The same guy's in all the pictures.

172
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,522
Captain Al Pellet.

173
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,048
- He's won seven years straight.
- Guess he's good.

174
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,168
- Wow, they're big!
- Excuse me, sir, how much longer?

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,449
Yours should be the very next table.

176
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,682
- Great.
- I'm starving.

177
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,650
- So am I.
- It's been hours since we ate.

178
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,928
Excuse me, little lady.

179
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,844
Excuse me.

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,082
Excuse me.

181
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,925
- Mr Pellet! How were your winds today?
- Blowing.

182
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,208
- Did you have a nice sail?
- Fine.

183
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,761
There'll be five of us tonight.

184
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,290
Would you part the waves
and let my party through, please?

185
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,322
It's OK, it's OK!

186
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Excuse me, weren't we next?

187
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,408
You are. Your table should be ready
very shortly, sir.

188
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,566
- What about the group that just went in?
- Mr Pellet had a reservation, so...

189
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,009
- I thought you don't take reservations.
- We don't, except for Mr Pellet.

190
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,528
I'm sure we'll have a table for you
any moment.

191
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,210
I see several of them are drinking
their coffee. Why not look at the menu?

192
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,204
I know what we're having. Lobster!

193
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,328
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

194
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,364
- I took care of everything. We're next.
- Thanks, sweetie.

195
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,524
Nobody tells me I can't sit.
Sit when I want to.

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,331
We're next. Sit next.

197
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,485
No need for those. What do you say,
let's all have the lobster.

198
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,883
Show us what you got.
And Stan, no arguments.

199
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,168
This dinner...

200
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,448
...is on you.

201
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,809
He thought
I was going to say on me! Huh?

202
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,323
Wait a minute...

203
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,283
Maybe they're just
taking them for a walk.

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,206
- Look at these beauties!
- Don't serve those.

205
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,488
- What?
- These are mine.

206
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,201
- Yours?
- You got my table, but not my lobsters.

207
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,727
This is your table?

208
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,131
My table!

209
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,611
I see.

210
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,808
This is your table.

211
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,770
- These are your lobsters.
- You got it.

212
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,049
I suppose this is your wife?

213
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,968
- Is this your tie?
- No.

214
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,602
Is this your shirt? Is this your belt?

215
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,683
Are these your shorts?

216
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,925
I've driven all day. We just get into town,
wait in line for two hours...

217
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,085
You just got into town?
Well, I've been in town for 30 years.

218
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,882
30 years! Every summer, you renters
think you can take over the town.

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,405
You can't!

220
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,723
- Boil them!
- Wait a minute, pal...

221
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,566
Now, we will have a table
for you in 20 minutes.

222
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,604
Forget it!

223
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,001
- We're going.
- Good idea.

224
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,322
- I'm hungry.
- I know, sweetheart.

225
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,370
You don't want to eat here.
I just found rats in the back.

226
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,888
- How disgusting!
- A whole nest of rats right in the back!

227
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,646
I apologise. The man was a slob.

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,210
- This is it?
- There's the Barnacle.

229
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,082
There's the boat. The guy at
the gas station said the food's great.

230
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,006
- It's the only place open.
- Well, it's got character.

231
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,640
And live entertainment.

232
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,283
I don't want any complaints.
Let's just sit down and enjoy ourselves.

233
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,321
- This place sucks!
- Where did you learn that?

234
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,723
- I told her never to say things "suck".
- Look!

235
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,283
- An ugly old pirate!
- Oh, really?

236
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,446
Where? Hello, me buccaneers.
Me name's Scully.

237
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,002
And what might your name be, me lass?

238
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,209
My name's Laurie,
and where's your hand?

239
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,641
You don't want to know.

240
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,569
- So, what's it going to be?
- Can you recommend something?

241
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,963
Scully's Catch-of-the-Day!

242
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,126
It's fresh grouper, slightly breaded,
sauteed to a golden brown,

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,011
and lemon butter, shallots...

244
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,606
...with a teasing hint of Dijon.

245
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,967
- We'll take five.
- Cortez!

246
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,241
- Si, sefior?
- Cinco Scully's Catch-of-the-Day.

247
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,483
Cinco Scully's Catches-of-the-Day.

248
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,201
- Bon <i>appétit.</i>
- Thank you very much.

249
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,331
Isn't this nice? Listen to gas station
attendants. They know where to eat.

250
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,085
<i>- What are you doing?
- Honey, it's OK.</i>

251
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,643
It's just Noxzema. You were moaning
in your sleep about your sunburn.

252
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,805
- Why did you remind me? It hurts!
- Poor baby!

253
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,045
I'm not a baby.
Mummy, make it go away. It hurts.

254
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,930
- I hate the sun!
- I know.

255
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,443
- But I love this house.
- I know.

256
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,523
I love you.

257
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,371
- We should rent it every summer.
- OK, I'll talk to the guy in the morning.

258
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,603
- You smell so good.
- It's the Noxzema.

259
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,125
More on here.

260
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,203
- That's not burnt.
- I know!

261
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,211
Sandy, did you hear that?

262
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,964
Get up!

263
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,089
Archie, if that's you, I'll kill you.

264
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,808
Archie, what did you do?
What's going on?

265
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,290
Archie!

266
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,091
Somebody's at the door. See who it is.

267
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,725
Cover me.

268
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,084
- Freeze!
- No! Take what you want.

269
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,210
- Just don't harm the children.
- I won't.

270
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,805
Jack!

271
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,211
What is it?

272
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,567
- I'll handle this.
- Who are you?

273
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,722
The Three Bears! Who are you?

274
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,522
- Dan Gardner, the owner of this house.
- Well, look, Dan.

275
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,526
I don't know how many owners there are,
but I rented it from Elwin Haskell.

276
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,207
You rented... May I see your receipt?

277
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,044
You want to see my receipt?

278
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,010
- OK. Where's my receipt?
- On the table.

279
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,006
All right. What is this,
one of those time-sharing places?

280
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,050
Here it is, month of July,
Jack Chester, that's <i>moi.</i>

281
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,090
415 Beach Road, $2,000!

282
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,609
- 415 Beach Road.
- That's right.

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,844
This house is 415 Beach...

284
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,445
...Lane.

285
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,851
This must be yours.

286
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,286
Come in.

287
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,043
- You have wonderful closet space.
- It makes life so much easier.

288
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,010
When it comes to closet space...

289
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,369
- Come on, Arch.
- Come on, Arch.

290
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,841
Archie, come on!

291
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,401
OK, kids, upstairs. Let's go.

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,923
This should do it.

293
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,487
It's just kibble.
Do you have a vacuum cleaner?

294
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,648
That's enough!
Do you have a dustpan, maybe?

295
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,290
Leave that.

296
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,480
Good idea. You might have a visitor
this summer and they have a dog.

297
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,362
This is excellent. It's a nice little...
Come on, Archie, let's go. Come on.

298
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,366
Last time you ate a whole bag
you got sick. Come on, Arch.

299
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,851
Goodbye.

300
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,003
Have a nice summer.

301
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,962
I forgot my Noxzema.

302
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,971
Have a little patience, dear.
He does have a bad burn.

303
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,763
And my daughter.

304
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,208
- I wet my bed, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, you didn't wet your bed.

305
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,283
You wet their bed.

306
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,611
Flies! We got flies. They followed me
all the way from Atlanta.

307
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,205
GOt you!

308
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,611
- Bananas?
- A little.

309
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,207
I called a plumber.
He might be here this afternoon.

310
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,840
The landlord should pay.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,970
I can't reach him.
They say he's in intensive care.

312
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,762
Get out of here!

313
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,328
Pass the milk, please?

314
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,083
- Here.
- Thank you.

315
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,930
- What's that? What is it?
- Here we go.

316
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,610
Great!

317
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,930
What is this? What is this?

318
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,081
- You're in pyjamas.
- I know.

319
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,404
Excuse me, why are you people
going through here?

320
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,404
Oh, perfect!

321
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,001
Come on through.
I'm Joe Public, welcome to my beach.

322
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,571
I'm taking Laurie to nursery school.
I'll be at the beach later.

323
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,520
Daddy, wait.
I've got to get my stuff from the car.

324
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,321
Where do you think you're going?
This isn't a nude beach.

325
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,086
Who do you think you are? Lolita?

326
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,451
Hi!

327
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,291
Just move in? I'm Russ.

328
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,444
- Hi. Jennifer.
- This is Annie.

329
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,922
- That's one of those CPR dolls.
- I teach CPR.

330
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,527
- I'm known as Mr Mouth-to-Mouth.
- Jennifer, I got a great idea!

331
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,605
- We both take Laurie to nursery school?
- Not today, Dad.

332
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,286
- No?
- I thought you'd left.

333
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,047
Laurie, you forgot your lunch.
I have those muffins you like.

334
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,124
- Should she be talking to him?
- Why not?

335
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,921
Are you crazy? He's a lifeguard!
They're all sex maniacs.

336
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,845
Each of his gonads is screaming,
"Me first!"

337
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,846
Ain't nothing to worry about.
I'm going to be around her.

338
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,447
- See you later, honey.
- OK, ladies, let's go! It's late!

339
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,007
- Take a bow!
- Jack off!

340
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,447
Great. We live next door to lifeguards.

341
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,601
A whole gaggle of them.

342
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,730
Well, I guess I won't drown.

343
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,608
Mom, they whistled at us. Don't look!

344
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,646
See that one on the left? He was cute!

345
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,401
- We should have brought shoes.
- I can't walk any more.

346
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,689
- My feet are burnt.
- Just hop, honey, just hop.

347
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,607
Come on up on Daddy's shoulders.
There you go! There's my girl.

348
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,569
Hold on.

349
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,961
Boy! Here we go.

350
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,771
Just got to find Mommy now.

351
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,251
Excuse me.

352
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,007
- Jeez, I'm sorry. Really.
- That was my hand, mister!

353
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,403
Sorry about that.
It's just sand, it's fine.

354
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,405
It's this darn cooler.
The thing broke off again.

355
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,964
- I'm waiting for a part from Minneapolis.
- My camera! Lift up your foot! My lens!

356
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,451
The sand!

357
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,321
If there's any damage,
send the bill to 415 Beach Lane, OK?

358
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,050
Damn right!

359
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,249
- You big bozo!
- That's my lunch!

360
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,564
- Watch it, that's my hat!
- Hey, honky!

361
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,130
Sorry! Just iced water. Just iced water.

362
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,767
- What are you doing?
- You should've covered it.

363
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,207
No! Watch it!

364
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,285
You shouldn't cook on the beach.
It's illegal. I think. Sandy?

365
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,089
Didn't you hear me calling?
I've been all over.

366
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,368
OK, sweetheart, get down.
Am I glad to be here!

367
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,650
I'm glad, too. Bobby wanted this
blowing up. Can you finish it?

368
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,002
Yeah, I'm breathing out anyway.

369
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,083
What the heck.

370
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,890
Thank you.

371
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,647
- How was nursery school?
- It was great. She graduated.

372
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,202
- What?
- Yeah, Mother Goose retired.

373
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,401
What a shame! We'll find other things
to do. Want to build a sandcastle?

374
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,125
Hey, Sandy.

375
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,329
- Yeah?
- What's Jennifer doing up there?

376
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,370
- She's talking with a new friend.
- Is that something we want?

377
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,205
They're just talking.

378
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,250
That's how she got here, remember?

379
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,691
Dad!

380
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,646
Here, ace, here's your raft.

381
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,407
I don't want it now.
I want to play Frisbee. Here, catch!

382
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,042
<i>Oh, say, can you see...</i>

383
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,242
- Bobby, throw long.
- Go!

384
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,004
Nice one!

385
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,089
Albert, you octopus!

386
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,685
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Your wife's on my Whammo.

387
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,526
- Get out of here!
- Sure. You can have that if you want.

388
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,971
When you're done with it, I'm at 415
Beach Lane. Beach Road! Carry on!

389
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,248
- 14-13.
- We're next, Dad.

390
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,368
Relax. Control's the thing.

391
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,410
- I know.
- If you get in trouble, pass it to me.

392
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,202
Your hands and my height,
we'll destroy them!

393
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,206
- Are you ready, mister?
- Yeah, we're ready. Let's go!

394
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,648
- Let's go! Let's eat them up!
- Go, team!

395
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,564
Best 2 out of 3?

396
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,760
You're being too hard on yourself.
You haven't played volleyball for years.

397
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,651
Yeah? Why don't you tell that to Bobby?

398
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,806
I embarrassed him for life. Right now,
he's wishing you were a widow.

399
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,521
Have a grape.
I think your blood sugar's low.

400
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,081
That's it! How could I be so stupid?

401
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,049
Of course!

402
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,288
I'm a sailor.

403
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,602
I'm a great sailor!

404
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,081
I'll take my son sailing!

405
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,562
- Excuse me, you rent sailboats here?
- We sure do.

406
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,803
All right!
We want to take a look at them.

407
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,602
They're all rented for the next two weeks.
Everyone's practising for the regatta.

408
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,163
I want to teach my son to sail.
ls there another place we can rent one?

409
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,004
There's one.

410
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,731
Maties, which boat will it be?

411
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,923
Tough choice, isn't it?

412
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,686
What about a big one like this?

413
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,607
- Without the crud on it.
- Young 'un, it's crustaceous morticus.

414
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,926
Pejoratively referred to as barnacle.
She was a fast lady in her day.

415
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,845
I'm sure. We'll take the 12-footer here.

416
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,971
That's a fine choice.
You're your own ballast in that vessel.

417
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,205
That's good. Puts a little sport into it.
Come on. Here we go.

418
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,328
- Ready to cast off?
- You bet!

419
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,326
You get a free lesson with each rental.
Yorku, I'll take them out.

420
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,326
- Watch the bar.
- It's OK. I already know how to sail.

421
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,201
Ready, son? Here we go! All right!
Hey, I got it going!

422
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,761
- All right!
- Here we go!

423
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,085
Bye !

424
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,842
Pull this rope, the sail comes
towards you, and you're sailing.

425
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,642
- Dad, there's a boat in front of us!
- I see it! It's OK. Let's make a turn.

426
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,406
- Sharp turn we're making!
- Yeah!

427
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,281
- Hey, we made it. Were you scared?
- Not me!

428
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,490
You should have been. I was.
I was a little scared there.

429
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,611
- Where did you learn how to sail?
- Camp Weehorn. They had a big lake.

430
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,561
- Hey, Dad, there's the incisor.
- Yeah. Isn't she a beauty?

431
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,166
- Let's go closer!
- OK, Captain.

432
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,561
- Here we go!
- All right!

433
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,848
That sure is a gorgeous boat, isn't it?
Too bad a big fart like that owns it.

434
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,606
Yeah, the big fart!

435
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,843
Watch your language.
Where do you learn that?

436
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,730
Veer off to starboard, Al.
That skiff looks close.

437
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,850
No, we got the right of way.
Let him move.

438
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,129
Watch out, Dad!
We're heading straight toward him!

439
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,124
The smaller craft has the right of way.

440
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,127
- I don't think he has those rules! Turn!
- What are you doing?

441
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,884
My knee!

442
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,328
- Is it your bad one, Dad?
- Yes, yes!

443
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,086
Idiot! You put a hole in my boat!

444
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,888
It's you, again! You hit my boat!
You put a hole in my boat!

445
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,921
- Why didn't you give way?
- Are you telling me how to sail?

446
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,529
I was on a starboard tack.
I had the right of way! You city rat!

447
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,968
I got a kid in the boat!
You should've moved!

448
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,565
Big fart!

449
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,202
I'm going to get you for this, renter!
I'm going to get you!

450
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,409
- You're finished!
- He's not! Tell him, Dad!

451
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,801
No point. Shit for brains!

452
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,887
He put a hole in my boat! Look at it!
Give me a hand with the hole here!

453
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,643
- You're not hungry?
- I'm not anything.

454
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,122
The doctor said you'd only be
off your feet two days.

455
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,170
- There are things we can do.
- Like what?

456
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,167
- Well... Free tonight, sailor?
- I don't want your pity.

457
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,642
Take what you can get.
Going once...twice...

458
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,041
I'll take it.

459
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,965
<i>Now, Monty Ewing, the rookie with
a chance to make his name on the tour.</i>

460
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,728
<i>- He has a 32-foot putt for the birdie.
- This green has taxed the pros today.</i>

461
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,407
<i>There's the touch!
There's the roll! And oh, my!</i>

462
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,121
<i>Look at that! He's got that birdie.
Unbelievable, Dick.</i>

463
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,682
<i>Take a look at it again in slow motion.
Look at this, Bill.</i>

464
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,524
<i>Ever so gentle.</i>

465
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,446
Hurry up, come on!
We are always late. Let's go!

466
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,921
Let's get in. Go on, Ma.

467
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,481
Mom, it's about to start!

468
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,769
OK! Sit here for a second, sweetie.

469
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,721
Oh, no! I can't believe it.
I forgot my wallet. I can't believe it.

470
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,247
We'll miss the beginning!

471
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,323
Shit! Shoot, I mean!

472
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,244
- Shoot!
- Excuse me.

473
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,564
- Take their tickets out of this.
- No, I can't let you do that.

474
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,406
- Please, it'll be my pleasure.
- Mom, let him!

475
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,124
- OK, if you'll let us pay you back.
- OK. Four adults and two kids.

476
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,887
- I'm Don Moore. This is my son, Gregg.
- Nice to meet you.

477
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,408
I'm Sandy Chester.
This is Laurie, Jennifer and Bobby.

478
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,289
Hi. Let's go.

479
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,808
- Yeah!
- Popcorn, popcorn!

480
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,568
- What are you listening to?
- WHAM 104.

482
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,005
Hey!

483
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,327
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

484
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,087
<i>Don Gufferson now,
his first shot at 17.</i>

485
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,687
<i>Looks like it could be
the longest of the foursome.</i>

486
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,849
All right!

487
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,287
Come in, Arch.

488
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,240
Oh! Couldn't you do that outside?

489
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,363
What do you want?

490
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,767
Your bone. You get it.

491
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,921
We", go get n!

492
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,605
OK, I Will!

493
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,085
Jeez, God! I thought the dog
was the one supposed to go fetch.

494
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,402
Archie! Archie!

495
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,731
Open it! Open this damn door!

496
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,411
Get out of my chair! Go on, get out!

497
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,086
Out of my popcorn, you dirty...

498
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,971
Sure! For you, the TV clears up!

499
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,248
He missed that!

500
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,085
Jeez! Archie! Archie!

501
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,971
If I get in there, you're a rug!

502
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,128
Breakfast with the family.

503
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,602
Dad, get dressed.
We're going out in a speedboat today!

504
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,683
- Yeah?
- Don just called.

505
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:45,086
The guy who lent us money. He invited
us out on his cabin cruiser. Feel like it?

506
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,921
- No, not today.
- We can find something else to do.

507
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,401
- No, you should go.
- Sure?

508
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,121
I'm sure. Of course, I'm sure.
I got lots to do today.

509
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,284
- I'm changing the air in my splint.
- OK.

510
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,321
- We're going outwith Don and Gregg!
- We're going outwith Don and Gregg!

511
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,290
- Is his wife nice?
- She's in Ohio with a guy.

512
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,729
Don got a divorce last year.
Have a lovely day, darling! I love you!

513
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,803
Love you, too!

514
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,691
So, how is everybody? Good.
You look good. You do.

515
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,610
Want an orange? A juice or something?

516
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,606
<i>At 105 degrees, climbing to 110,
it's a record for this date.</i>

517
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,330
Bobby, you're doing great!
You're so good at this! All right, Bobby!

518
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,208
Way to go, Bob!

519
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,971
Hi!

520
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,403
- Oh, what a shame!
- Leave it.

521
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,483
- Sorry.
- You did nothing.

522
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,250
- I've been waiting to meet you.
- Really?

523
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,883
- I'm your neighbour, Vicki Sanders.
- Jack Chester.

524
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,968
I just made some fresh lemonade.
Why not come over and have some?

525
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,485
Oh, no.

526
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,361
- Oh, come on!
- I wouldn't want to impose.

527
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,684
Impose! What are neighbours for?
Come on!

528
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,322
- Really?
- What happened to your leg?

529
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,925
Boating accident.

530
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,926
- Does it hurt?
- I suppose it would if I let it.

531
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,405
I wanted to be a pilot,
but with a family and responsibilities,

532
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,291
I became a controller instead.

533
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,922
You know,
you and I have so much in common.

534
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,486
I wanted to be a stewardess, but Ed
didn't want me away. So I do electrolysis.

535
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,764
Hello?

536
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,603
Anybody home?

537
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,281
- It looks like nobody's here.
- Mom, I have to go real bad!

538
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,363
Go on, but hurry up.

539
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,888
- And don't sit on the seat!
- Excuse me.

540
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,807
I hate to bother you, I'm dying of thirst.
Could I get a glass of water?

541
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,521
- Help yourself.
- Thanks a million.

542
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,962
Hello.

543
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,488
You have good vision?
You have to in your business, right?

544
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,087
- It helps.
- And you're very observant, I can tell.

545
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,561
Can I have an honest opinion?

546
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,366
What do you think of these?
Well, what do you think?

547
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,810
About what?

548
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,611
- These!
- Oh, those!

549
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,161
Yeah. How do they look?

550
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,171
Similar?

551
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,244
No, I mean, do they look good?
I just got them.

552
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,081
Who had them before you?

553
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,643
Nobody, silly!
I just recently had them enlarged.

554
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,450
Oh, I see.

555
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,080
They cost $2,000!

556
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,449
- It was these or a chain-saw for Ed.
- Good choice.

557
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,011
Think so?

558
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,050
I'd take those over a power tool any day.

559
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,965
Do they look like real breasts to you?

560
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,929
You fooled me!

561
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,766
- You don't think they're too big?
- No! No, no.

562
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,331
- Is that Ed?
- Yeah, he's waking up.

563
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,007
Ah! You'll excuse me, I'm a dead man!

564
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,284
Oh, great!
The husband's coming and I blow a leg!

565
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,771
Again?

566
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,922
Put your top on!

567
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,687
- I'm sorry! I didn't see anything, I swear!
- He's our neighbour!

568
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,127
- I'm just renting.
- Sorry, mister.

569
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,922
- She's boring the whole world with them.
- Be quiet, Ed. I just want his opinion.

570
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,846
She's insecure. Last night,
she showed them to a clerk at 7-Eleven.

571
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,243
Relax! They're beautiful.
They look right and feel right.

572
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,722
- Yeah.
- Try them and tell her they feel right?

573
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,803
As a favour to me?

574
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,569
Oh, yeah! Boy, those are so lifelike,
it's ridiculous!

575
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,326
Honey, everybody likes them. Thanks.

576
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,087
- I owe you one.
- What are neighbours for? I've got to go.

577
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,609
- I gave up a power tool for those.
- Christmas is right around the corner.

578
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,683
- $2,000 a set?
- For both.

579
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,401
That's a deal! They're fun for
the whole family. I've got to tell my wife.

580
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,450
We'll give you the doctor's number.
Take care.

581
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,051
Bye !

582
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,361
Cut that out! Get out of here!
That's our bike! Get off my bike!

583
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,404
- Who's got the cheese omelette?
- Right here!

584
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,531
- You got it. How do you like it?
- Fluffy.

585
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,643
Watch it, Fats!

586
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,968
- Are you going to be long?
- Wait, this is important...

587
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,567
...I have to have those pants.
I only have two pairs here,

588
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,121
but 50 per cent of the pant...

589
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,961
Get out!

590
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,967
Party's over! Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

591
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,010
Get out, get out!
Get off the phone!

592
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,323
- I'll call you back!
- Get off the phone! Out!

593
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,403
Jesus!

594
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,562
You, out!

595
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,530
Bug off, buddy. I was here first.

596
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,726
- Get the hell out of here now.
- You go. I'm trying to watch The Smurfs.

597
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,247
<i>Trying to watch The Smurfs?</i>

598
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,803
See the one where Papa Smurf smashed
the shit out of a guy with a red hat?

599
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,247
You want to see that one?

600
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,443
Archie, you stink!

601
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,204
Traitor!

602
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,603
Morning, Colonel.

603
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,971
Good to see you. What can I get you?

604
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,806
How about drunk?

605
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,041
We can handle that.

606
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,764
Thank you.

607
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,691
You have an ice cube for this?

608
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,202
W rQh g! " Y QLJI FQ W r “"9!

609
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,410
I've tried to tell you that,
as a fighter, pound for pound,

610
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,442
my boy, Jimmy Cagney,
will disintegrate your Sylvester Stallone!

611
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,002
- He'll knock his block off!
- In a street fight, maybe.

612
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,811
I give you that. But not in a movie!

613
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,763
Especially with today's cinemanatic
progress. It's technologically impossible!

614
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,925
- Do you have any more oyster crackers?
- You ate them all!

615
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,010
They were so good. I'll have another
beer. They're filling, aren't they?

616
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,844
<i>Més cerveza!</i>

617
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,447
Yeah, it's probably better for me.

618
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,565
Good shot.

619
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,408
OK, count them up.

620
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,484
- Who threw this one?
- Blue, that's you.

621
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,964
- All right, I win.
- Big winner there, Scull-man!

622
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,286
I love you, Scully. I mean that.
It's not the booze talking, either.

623
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,523
Sorry I wrecked your boat.
Let me pay for it.

624
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,286
She's fine. It'll give her more character.

625
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,046
I'm at fault for not giving you that lesson.

626
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,048
You're not at fault. I am! I'm the one
who said I could sail. I can't sail.

627
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,489
I don't know... I used to sail
when I was a kid, but I can't sail.

628
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,566
Do you know what it's like to peak
when you're 18 years old?

629
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,569
Yes, I do.

630
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,360
Would you like to learn to sail?
Really to sail?

631
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,921
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

632
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,969
Yeah.

633
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,525
I call this craft Shotzie.
It's nicknamed for my sweetheart.

634
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,766
We name vessels after women to remind
us to treat them gently, like ladies.

635
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,606
Otherwise,
they won't respond like ladies.

636
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,970
Remember, always gentle on the tiller.

637
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,327
You understand that?

638
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,925
Yeah, I...

639
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,203
Oyster crackers.
Good, that should be the last of it.

640
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,690
- Can we go home now?
- You said you wanted to be a sailor.

641
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,287
So, we're going to stay out here
until you become one.

642
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,843
This is the life.

643
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,722
There's nothing like the sea to lift your
spirits and put a song in your heart.

644
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,089
I know.
You must know a lot of ocean songs.

645
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,890
I do.

646
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,169
Here's a sea ditty me mother taught me.

647
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,243
<i>Love</i>

648
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,007
<i>Exciting and new</i>

649
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,731
<i>Come aboard</i>

650
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,486
<i>We're expecting you</i>

651
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,881
<i>And love</i>

652
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,931
<i>Life's sweetest reward</i>

653
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,765
<i>Let it flow</i>

654
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,651
<i>It'll float back to you</i>

655
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,486
<i>The Love Boat</i>

656
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,168
<i>Soon will be making another run</i>

657
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,483
<i>The Love Boat...</i>

658
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,851
Jack?

659
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,811
Jack!

660
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,003
That's cute.

661
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,731
Are you going to sleep all day?

662
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,321
I guess you are.

663
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,527
We'll be home early!

664
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,131
I'm up.

665
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,886
I'm up. I'm up.

666
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,488
It's still dark.

667
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,087
Oh, I'll feel that in the morning!

668
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,364
<i>- Hi.
- Buenos dias.</i>

669
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,488
Where's Scully?

670
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,611
- Thanks. Scully!
- Over here!

671
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,765
- He's over there.
- That's what I says.

672
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,527
- You know what to do.
- When I'm ready, I say, "Jibe ho."

673
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,729
- That's right. Prepare to jibe. Jibe ho.
- Jibe ho!

674
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:50,125
- What happened? I yelled jibe ho.
- You say jibe ho, then you jibe!

675
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,251
- I don't know what to say. Sorry.
- Why not say you'll pick me up?

676
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,325
I'm... Yeah, right... Let me tack...

677
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,486
Hey, why don't you swim to me?
Can you tread water with that hook?

678
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,247
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, it does.

679
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,083
- It was my fault, wasn't it?
- Oh, yes.

680
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,963
- I guess I'm not much of a sailor, am I?
- No, you're not.

681
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,809
But you will be.

682
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,444
When I get through with you,
you'll be as good a sailor as I ever was.

683
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,684
Maybe better.

684
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,608
Do you want more ice?

685
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,403
I got the lotion and your towel.
Please, let's hurry.

686
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,244
- OK.
- Bye, Dad.

687
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,006
Bye. What, no kiss?

688
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,485
Look, I'll make you a deal.
if your leg starts to hurt, I'll carry you.

689
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,089
- Bye!
- Bye! I don't want to push it, you know.

690
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,687
Besides, I just wanted to sit around
and kill some flies.

691
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,844
- Honey, do you want to have a talk?
- No.

692
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,961
- This was for you. You're not having fun.
- Are you having fun?

693
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,887
- I'm having lots of fun.
- If you're having fun, I'm having fun.

694
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,887
And, in a couple of days,
we'll all be having fun together.

695
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,725
- I'm off to have today's fun.
- Great!

696
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,763
Got him!

697
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,211
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

698
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,804
- Perfect day for sailing.
- We're not sailing today.

699
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,883
We're going dancing.

700
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,601
- Know what your trouble is?
- I have to lose a few pounds.

701
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:10,369
You're an air controller. if you think you'll
control the sea like a 747, I fear for you.

702
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,128
The sea is a wondrous,
mysterious, dangerous lady.

703
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,409
She'll make you rich
or feed you to the fishes.

704
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,849
You can't control her.
You've got to give yourself to her.

705
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,164
She wants you to dance, sonny boy.
You got to follow her lead.

706
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,928
- Didn't I see that on your restroom wall?
- Yes!

707
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,404
As true today as when I hung it there.
Hoist the mainsail.

708
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,891
Roger!

709
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,524
The apparent wind and the true wind
are different. Watch the telltales!

710
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,971
That's right, bring her about.
Take your time, boy! She's a lady.

711
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,250
Give me a chance to get the jib
through the foresail.

712
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,206
No, don't pinch.
The beam reach is your fastest line.

713
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,648
- So keep your sails full.
- Hard to lee!

714
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,724
- How's that?
- Fine.

715
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,726
You can release your sheet
a little faster, you know.

716
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,928
- All right.
- How's this?

717
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,402
Ah, that's fine. Ah, nice!

718
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,485
All secure.

719
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,601
Here, a graduation pin. A hook
of your own from Scully's sailing school.

720
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,084
- You're a sailor now.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate this.

721
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,686
You didn't have to do this.

722
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,044
- It's real.
- Aye.

723
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,409
This is great. I'm bleeding.
Is that how you lost your hand?

724
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,450
- Aye, sure.
- Thanks a lot.

725
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,050
Gregg told me about this island
with excellent shells. Can we go?

726
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,965
- Sounds good to me. Jack?
- No.

727
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,726
- Why not?
- Why not what?

728
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,930
Weren't you listening?
It's like you don't even hear us now.

729
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,244
- Don't say that. I hear you.
- What did I just say?

730
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,564
- You said I don't hear or listen to you.
- Dad, it's for you.

731
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,645
See? I heard that!
Don't tell me I don't listen to you!

732
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,327
- You and Scully, what do you do all day?
- Dance.

733
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,604
Hello.

734
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,171
Yes, it is.

735
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,210
Oh, right, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

736
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,727
Sure. Where?

737
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,769
OK.

738
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,082
All right, I'll be right there.

739
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,447
OK, fine. Bye.

740
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,251
- What's up?
- Our landlord just got out of hospital.

741
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,927
- Oh, good.
- I'm going in to straighten out our rent.

742
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,284
Jack, glad you could make it.
I hate to do business here.

743
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,365
The new owner knew the principals
would be here to wrap it up.

744
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,249
No problem.

745
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,042
Sorry, I thought I was going to your
office. I didn't know. I feel like an idiot.

746
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,602
Your brother was a great man, Floyd.

747
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,001
A beacon to us all.

748
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,323
He'll be sorely, sorely missed.

749
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,324
And now, I'll sign the papers.

750
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,564
Could I have a little room here, please?

751
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,725
Mr Pellet, this is Jack Chester,
the tenant.

752
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,601
Well, well, well, renter.

753
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,649
It looks like you're my renter now.

754
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,845
Well, I guess...this goes to you, then.

755
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,209
That's for the last two weeks' rent.

756
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,124
Thank you.

757
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,081
I'd just like to say, it's a terrific place.
My family's having a great time.

758
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,561
It's the best money I ever spent.

759
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,165
- Really?
- Yeah!

760
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,483
Why are you doing that?

761
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,407
I wouldn't take this cheque from you
if my children were starving.

762
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,689
I want you and your family
out by Saturday midnight,

763
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,730
or I'm going to toss you out personally.

764
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,841
I told you I'd get you.

765
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,320
I'd have given you any amount
you wanted for that house!

766
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,484
And that's the best money I ever spent.

767
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,970
So that's it?
We have to go home in four days?

768
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,920
We can't! I have a date with Gregg
to go to the regatta!

769
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,243
I have got a date for the regatta, too.

770
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,165
Shut up! Stop saying everything I say!

771
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,891
- I'm not leaving! I don't care!
- I'm not leaving! I don't care!

772
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,281
There he is, Captain Al Pellet.

773
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,842
You shouldn't have rammed him,
but sunk the bastard!

774
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,209
He tried to buy me out once.

775
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,682
When it didn't work, he got tough.
Tried to deport Cortez.

776
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,606
- <i>Canalla!</i>
- <i>Called the Barnacle</i> a <i>garbage scow!</i>

777
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,604
All right, all right, hard to lee!

778
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,286
He's a squid stick!

779
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,649
A squeeze dick! You say!

780
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,444
...he was about a half a length ahead.

781
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,083
He looks over, he sees me.
He gets so frustrated, he misses...

782
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,969
Pellet!

783
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,122
Hey, landlord!

784
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,851
Amazing! I thought they were extinct.

785
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,923
I could swear that's the call

786
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,402
of the red-beaked,
seersuckered, summer renter.

787
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,370
And it is.

788
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,921
Why aren't you packing?

789
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,803
You took away my family's vacation.
I'm going to take something from you.

790
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,725
- What can you take from me?
- That!

791
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,565
- What? My cup?
- Yeah!

792
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,566
- You think you can out-sail me?
- Yes!

793
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,963
You couldn't beat my dinghy.

794
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,043
- Really?
- Really.

795
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,649
- You want to bet?
- What are you going to bet? What?

796
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,165
Popcorn?

797
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,725
Lobsters?

798
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,085
$1,000! The last two weeks' rent.

799
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,891
You win, keep the cheque, we go home.

800
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,886
I win, I keep the cheque,
we stay here two weeks rent-free.

801
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,407
Do we have a bet?

802
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,127
Know something, Dumbo?

803
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,602
You're even stupider than you look.

804
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,131
So, if I win, we get to stay here two
more weeks for free! What do you think?

805
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,169
I'll start packing.

806
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:47,248
Jack, just suppose there was
the slightest possibility you could win.

807
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,962
There's a pivotal point that escapes me.
You don't have a boat.

808
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,886
- A-ha! Yes, I do!
- You do?

809
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,644
<i>Yes, the Barnacle.</i>

810
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,007
<i>- The Barnacle?
- Yes!</i>

811
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,446
Dad...

812
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,524
...you're going to sail a fish restaurant?

813
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,610
Well, what do you make of my girl?

814
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,530
That's easy for you to say.
But what do we do about it, Angus?

815
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,886
In layman's terms, how bad is she?

816
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,566
- She's a total pig!
- Thank you!

817
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,327
- You're telling me my girl won't sail?
- Now, hold your wind!

818
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,007
I've not said that!
She'll sail, but it'll take work.

819
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,245
And a good bit of luck, too,
to find the right sail to fit her mast.

820
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,491
What?

821
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,849
He's saying that we'll make our own luck,
you dumb Swede.

822
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,726
Where's Angus with that sail?
There's only two shopping days left.

823
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,929
He's combing the entire coast for it.
He'll find it.

824
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,926
- How can you be so sure?
- if he don't, I'll kill him!

825
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,609
This is too slow. What I need for this
is a power-saw attachment.

826
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,410
Yeah, right.

827
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,884
How many more?

828
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,361
- Keep cutting.
- What are they for?

829
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,524
I really don't know,
but we need a lot of them!

830
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,002
So, you were a sailor, Mr Scully!

831
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,288
Yeah, that's right.

832
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,284
- You must have good vision.
- Aye.

833
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,889
They're perfect! Tell her they're perfect!

834
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,769
They're perfect!

835
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,801
- What are you doing?
- Taking a dirty picture.

836
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,521
It's the filthiest version of you
I've ever seen.

837
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,924
- What's with Frances Farmer?
- There's an outbreak of depression here.

838
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,289
- How about you?
- I'm hiding it.

839
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,808
- I've kept your dinner waiting.
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

840
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,721
And he's so nice.

841
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,962
And Gregg's so funny.

842
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,603
His teacher asked what happens
after the sperm meets the egg.

843
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,810
And Gregg goes,
"You smoke a cigarette."

844
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,247
You're still a non-smoker, aren't you?

845
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,927
- Daddy!
- Just being a dad, that's all.

846
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,727
- How's the boat coming?
- It's coming. A little slow.

847
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,167
- Not good, huh?
- Could be better.

848
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:27,001
- Can't win them all.
- But you'd like to win one, wouldn't you?

849
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,401
One would be nice.

850
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,805
- Here it is. Dry rot.
- I got a thing for that here.

851
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,327
Let's go and check the port.

852
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,529
- I'll be right with you.
- Right, coming.

853
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,001
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi. What's the matter?

854
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,640
We've made a decision.

855
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,211
About what?

856
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,489
<i>We want to help you fix the Barnacle.</i>

857
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,564
We thought we'd give you a hand.
Is it all right?

858
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,449
Yeah. Come aboard.

859
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,250
All right!

860
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,043
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

861
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,931
This could be the one.

862
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,730
Thanks.

863
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,248
My kids. You knew that already though.
Of course you would.

864
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,448
God's blood!

865
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,723
Don't tell me that you can't find a sail!

866
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,247
So, go to Tampa, then!

867
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,482
- You dumb Swede!
- Nae dumb Swede, a dumb Scot!

868
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,211
Same thing.

869
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,610
Honey!
Can you come up here a minute?

870
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,971
Yeah?

871
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,926
Painted yourself in a corner?

872
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,404
- How do I get out?
- I don't know. I did it, too. Damn!

873
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,929
I'd like to propose a toast.
To my new friends.

874
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,845
And to my best friends, the Chesters.

875
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,804
And to the Barnacle, for all this fun.
We've already won.

876
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,928
- Cheers!
- All right!

877
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:48,921
Would the crew of the Barnacle
please raise your drinks?

878
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,129
Is something wrong with your arms?
Raise your drinks!

879
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,444
You mean, we're crew?
We can race with you?

880
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,841
- What did I say?
- Excellent!

881
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,401
And we'll win! Right, Admiral?

882
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:06,122
Aye! It's going to be a hell of a victory.
We'll have won it without a sail!

883
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,806
Why? Where's Angus?

884
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,327
Last I heard, Savannah.

885
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,524
Hi, man, I need a grand sally,
50-foot high she be!

886
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,445
- No.
- I'll never find her by tomorrow!

887
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,088
- That better be the new jenny you have!
- Yes, it is.

888
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,561
Tuck your shirt in, Floyd!

889
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,608
- Be of good cheer, Angus is here!
- Angus!

890
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,923
<i>Welcome to the Twelfth Annual
Citrus Cove Regatta.</i>

891
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,084
<i>Again, we have some
of the best skippers in Florida.</i>

892
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:00,848
<i>The boat to beat, as ever, is the lncisor,
skippered by Citrus Cove's Al Pellet,</i>

893
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,721
<i>winner of this event
for the last seven consecutive years.</i>

894
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,930
<i>As they ready for the start,
we wish them all luck.</i>

895
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,130
So, he didn't show up. He's still going
to cough up that dough.

896
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,928
- Well, we've got a late arrival.
- They just made it.

897
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,448
- It hasn't started yet!
- We made it.

898
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,171
- We haven't made nothing yet.
- I know.

899
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,211
Number two-eight-two-seven.
The Barnacle?

900
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,166
Ain't that a restaurant?

901
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,685
Look!

902
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,367
Look there! It's Captain Blackhawk
and the SS Moveable <i>Feast!</i>

903
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,410
Don't worry, we'll have the last laugh.

904
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,724
There's Gregg and Don! Gregg!

905
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,483
- I think we have a start.
- Give them the gun!

906
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,690
- The boat feels different.
- What's different?

907
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,448
- Twice as big as I'm used to.
- She don't know that.

908
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,288
- Just follow her lead.
- It's their lead I'm worried about.

909
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,444
You're worried, are you?
Good, that's the proper attitude.

910
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,321
- It's a long race. We'll catch them.
- I hope so.

911
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,211
Ease off on the jib a bit.

912
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,601
- Aye, I heard him.
- Sorry.

913
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,526
- Can I play in the basement with Yorku?
- If it's OK with Yorku.

914
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,810
- It's OK. I play.
- I'll be right here if you need me.

915
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,286
I'm going to head up a little higher.

916
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,528
- Head her up a bit higher.
- Heading up a bit higher.

917
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,964
All right!

918
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,291
- Look sharp.
- Coming about.

919
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,161
Hard to lee. We don't want to blow it
at the first marker.

920
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,966
All right, cleat it! Cleat it!

921
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,128
Do up the jib halyard!

922
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,490
- Prepare to come about.
- Prepare to come about!

923
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,281
Look smart on the forward deck.
Hard to lee. Coming about!

924
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,923
- Turn her back wind.
- Jennifer, walk that jib across.

925
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,481
Ave, aye, Dad!

926
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,851
- Trim the other jib.
- Not the jib!

927
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,049
- MainsaiFs too tight.
- Ease off on the main.

928
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,125
- Yorku, you're so pretty.
- Your baby's a beauty.

929
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,090
- We be set, Captain.
- That's good.

930
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,490
- Jack!
- Yeah.

931
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,325
Take off your hat and wave.

932
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,007
- Steady on the helm!
- Keep your hand on the wheel!

933
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,811
- Sorry. I got it, though.
- Thanks.

934
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:25,241
- Have we fetched the second marker?
- Not yet. Damn! They're losing us!

935
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,971
Prepare to jibe!

936
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:34,002
Check that turtle! Jibe ho! All right,
let's get it down, Floyd, let's get it down!

937
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,643
Prepare for the downwind run!
Cortez, drop the jib!

938
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,007
Hoist the spinnaker after the marker.

939
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,731
Hoist, damn it! Move, move!

940
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,809
Get up there!

941
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,648
Trim the backsail! Come on, hustle!
Ease the after guy a little!

942
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,925
All right, everybody, this is it,
the run for the money! Prepare to jibe!

943
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,847
Jibe ho!

944
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,883
Ease the pole forward 3 inches.
Take the bearing on that last craft.

945
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,129
- How are we doing, Dad?
- We're OK!

946
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,763
We're not closing.

947
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:41,408
Jack, you've done beautifully, but this
old girl ain't got nothing else to give us.

948
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,210
- You think we're going to win?
- Yeah.

949
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,685
- What you got there?
- It's good. Scully's Catches-of-the-Day.

950
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,730
- You want some?
- No.

951
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,082
- Where did you get it?
- From the freezer.

952
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,961
Didn't I tell you, "Removar
all the food and the freezer?"

953
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:17,251
I think you says to me,
"Don't move the food and the freezer!"

954
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,926
Thank God for my bad Spanish!

955
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,131
- Everything out!
- We got hundreds of pounds of ballast!

956
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,170
- We're still in this!
- Kids, help with the garbage!

957
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,890
Let's go!

958
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,210
This old girl's got
the straight-away power.

959
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,330
- Run the bastards down!
- We get the squeeze dick!

960
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,802
- You're doing great, Dad!
- Now she's on her line!

961
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,284
I can feel her! Right, Pellet,
I'm coming to get you! Out of my way!

962
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,206
- Eat our waves!
- We're catching up on the big fart!

963
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,682
- Watch your language!
- The kid's right. He is a fart.

964
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,606
- They look very natural.
- Vicki!

965
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,969
He's a judge! I value his opinion.
Thank you.

966
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,963
- Thank you.
- Come on!

967
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,886
<i>- We'll show people in the stands!
- Word from the Committee Boat.</i>

968
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,804
<i>The Barnacle's gaining.</i>

969
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,483
Slug up the foreguy.

970
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,523
- Damn!
- What's going on? What's happening?

971
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,160
- The bastard stole our wind!
- They can't do that, can they?

972
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,803
- They've done it!
- Can we use the engine to catch him?

973
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,606
- No.
- I know.

974
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,363
Falling off. Stand by to trim.

975
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,806
Aye.

976
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,966
- What the hell are you doing, Jack?
- See that plane? It's in a microburst.

977
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,762
A low-altitude funnel gunnel. I've seen it
at the airport a hundred times.

978
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,491
All right, go for it, boy!

979
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,404
Here it comes.

980
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,528
Here we go!

981
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,523
Trim her in!

982
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,811
- Can't you see we're in a funnel gunnel?
- Ah, you lovely sally!

983
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,691
- We're going so fast!
- We're gaining.

984
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,083
- Where are they getting that wind from?
- Dad, we're closing in!

985
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,723
- You're doing great, Dad!
- I want a picture of Pellet as you pass.

986
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,042
Make two copies for me.

987
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,283
We're closing on the scurvy bastard!
Hold her steady!

988
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,162
Trim the main! They're gaining!
Trim it when I tell you, trim it!

989
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,642
- Come on, Dad, we're going to beat him!
- Attaway, Dad!

990
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,491
Faster, Dad!

991
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,166
We're gaining on him!

992
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:10,882
- How do we get more speed?
- We can't. We need more sail.

993
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,011
Aye. Damn! With two more yards of sail
we could have made it!

994
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,967
Scully, take the wheel!

995
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:26,126
<i>At this moment, the Barnacle appears
to be a real threat to the lncisor!</i>

996
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,685
Are we in a wind pocket?
Is it the funnel? Come on!

997
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,808
I told you this boat could fly!

998
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,931
We can beat them!
Here's the finish line!

999
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,084
- Floor it!
- Go, Dad, go!

1000
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,843
What is it? What, are we dragging
something? What is it?

1001
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,007
Come on, Dad!

1002
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,607
We're so close! Keep it up, Dad!

1003
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,322
Pants! Al!

1004
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,881
He's flying his pants, Al!

1005
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,245
<i>Barnacle, captained by Jack Chester,
is the winner!</i>

1006
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,247
We did it!

1007
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,007
Pants? I got beat
by a restaurant wearing pants!

1008
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:38,564
- Trousers? Is that legal?
- I don't know if it's legal, but I like it!

1009
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,085
We did it!

1010
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,766
I did not hear that horn!

1011
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,445
- Daddy, did you win?
- We won, baby! Your daddy won!

1012
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,922
- Yorku, Daddy won!
- Wonderful!
