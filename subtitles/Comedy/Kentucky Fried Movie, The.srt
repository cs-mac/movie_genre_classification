1
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,628
<i>Yes, ma'am, how ya doin'?</i>

2
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:49,001
<i>Is this Rose Hill?</i>

3
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:51,632
<i>Good.
This is Ed Couch.</i>

4
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,142
<i>I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

5
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,441
<i>I need to get up there
and see her,</i>

6
00:02:56,513 --> 00:03:00,506
<i>but I'm gonna be late
'cause I'm lost out here.</i>

7
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:03,052
<i>We're off the Alabama interstate
but I don't know where.</i>

8
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,391
Did you hear that?
What?

9
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,519
The train.

10
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:48,462
No, I didn't hear no train.

11
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,565
Oh, nothin', I guess.

12
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:57,039
Where's "Whistle Stop" on
the map? I can't find it.

13
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:00,975
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

14
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:06,039
God, you got a negative
sense of direction, hon.

15
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,983
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,250
Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

17
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:17,317
I know she's been looking forward
to this visit all week long.

18
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:20,660
Bless her sweet,
little ol' heart.

19
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,669
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V
this afternoon?

20
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:30,332
Remember us?

21
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:33,468
<i>Don't you look pretty!
We brought you something.</i>

22
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:36,707
<i>Let me look at
you.</i>

23
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,375
<i>Don't you know Evelyn loves you?</i>

24
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,285
Well, honey, I guess it'd be
better if you wait out here for me.

25
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:48,815
I'll get all this stuff.
Well, if you think it's best.

26
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:52,192
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

27
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,424
Have a nice day, Aunt Vesta.

28
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,433
<i>Don't you pitch a fit like that!</i>

29
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:11,108
Did you know
they took my gallbladder out?

30
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,677
No, I didn't.

31
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:18,415
<i>Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in a jar.</i>

32
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:23,290
I guess that's where
they keep 'em.

33
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,329
I guess.

34
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:27,626
When I was in the hospital,

35
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,657
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

36
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:34,330
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

37
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:37,704
82 year old widow,
imagine that.

38
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,903
Actually,
everybody calls me Ninny.

39
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:43,208
'Course I'm just visitin' here.

40
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:48,548
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

41
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,553
Um, well?

42
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,680
No.

43
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:55,988
You'd remember it.

44
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,723
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

45
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:01,992
You ever been to Whistle Stop?

46
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,467
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

47
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:10,405
<i>She's lived down the street
from me for 30 years or more.</i>

48
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,465
After her son died,

49
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:16,138
her daughter-in-law had a fit for
her to come live at the nursing home.

50
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,512
They asked me to come
and be her roommate.

51
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:23,816
<i>Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going
home just soon as she gets settled in good.</i>

52
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:29,558
Does the name "Idgie 
Threadgoode" ring a bell?

53
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:33,154
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

54
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,028
You'd remember her.

55
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,002
You see, I was practically
adopted by the Threadgoode family.

56
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,403
I married her brother,
Cleo. Oh, uh-huh.

57
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:47,240
<i>Idgie  and her friend, Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

58
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,245
<i>Oh.</i>

59
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:52,009
Idgie  was a character,
all right.

60
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,416
<i>But how anybody
could've thought...</i>

61
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:59,513
<i>she murdered that man
is beyond me.</i>

62
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,558
I beg your pardon?

63
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:05,187
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

64
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,890
Oh, now, let's see.

65
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:11,423
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

66
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:15,461
<i>That same rainy, summer day...</i>

67
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,476
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for
the murder of the owner of that truck,</i>

68
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,514
<i>Frank Bennett.</i>

69
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,251
I guess, to understand ldgie,

70
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,017
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

71
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,027
<i>Idgie  was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

72
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,197
<i>I 'member the day we was all
gettin'ready for Leona's weddin'.</i>

73
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,236
<i>The war had just ended,</i>

74
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,635
<i>the Great one,
you know.</i>

75
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:52,370
<i>And another one was about to
begin in the Threadgoode house.</i>

76
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,878
<i>Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

77
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:59,383
<i>Buddy, get dressed, honey. Mama?</i>

78
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,419
Leona, what is it?

79
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,351
Idgie 's upstairs in her room...

80
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,390
And says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

81
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,584
She is gonna ruin my weddin'! Shh.

82
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,457
Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

83
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,794
Of course she is, Papa.

84
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:17,801
Your papa has spent every last
nickel he has just to make you happy.

85
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:21,669
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

86
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,834
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

87
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,435
This is your mama!

88
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:34,785
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

89
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:37,481
Buddy, fetch her. She'll listen
to you. Come on down, little bit.

90
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,116
<i>There's no firin'
squad waitin' for you.</i>

91
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:45,528
<i>Ohh! Come on,
honey. Let us see you.</i>

92
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:47,758
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

93
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,666
<i>I see London, I see... Hush!</i>

94
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:55,840
Julian, hush.

95
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,637
<i>Come ahead, sweetheart.</i>

96
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,441
<i>You look awful nice in that.</i>

97
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,106
Mama!
You look fine.

98
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,673
<i>She looks like a monkey.</i>

99
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:08,549
<i>Julian, stop it
right this second!</i>

100
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,953
<i>Take it back!
Take it back! Idgie , hey!</i>

101
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,117
I told you she
was gonna ruin my weddin'!

102
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:17,559
<i>Idgie , get up.
Take it back!</i>

103
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:19,790
Take it back!

104
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:23,198
I'll get you for this.
No, Buddy.

105
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:30,065
<i>We have to be careful
when she's dressing up.</i>

106
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,076
<i>She's just a pain!</i>

107
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:35,671
<i>Leona, will you
stop shrieking!</i>

108
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,443
<i>This is your
weddin'day!</i>

109
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:52,294
<i>Looks like you got
yourself up a tree, little bit.</i>

110
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,390
I'm sick of
people makin' fun of me.

111
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,992
So you're gonna stay up here
all day long.

112
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:01,266
Yep.
The hell with them.

113
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,275
Who wants to wear
that stupid ol' dress anyway?

114
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:08,710
<i>I ever tell you about
the oysters? Oysters?</i>

115
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,714
I tell you about the oysters? No.

116
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:15,446
<i>Think about the millions
of oysters lyin'around the ocean.</i>

117
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,852
Then one day...

118
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:20,721
God comes along and sees one
and he says,

119
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,693
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

120
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,957
You know what he does?

121
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:29,195
He puts a little
piece of sand in it.

122
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:33,500
Guess what it can do that
the others can't. What?

123
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,872
It can make a beautiful pearl.

124
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:39,104
What if God made a mistake?

125
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:44,275
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

126
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,114
I mean, he made sure
we got together.

127
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:49,177
He made sure you got
the best looking,

128
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:51,450
most charmin' brother
in the world...

129
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:54,891
Who's gonna beat you to the
chocolate cake. You will not.

130
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,327
Got you out of the tree,
didn't I?

131
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,331
Did not!

132
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,028
<i>Into this estate,
these two come now to be joined.</i>

133
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:06,196
<i>If any man present
can show cause...</i>

134
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,672
<i>why they may not lawfully
be joined together,</i>

135
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:13,872
let him speak now or
forever after hold his peace.

136
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:16,608
Please be seated.

137
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,180
If either of you
know any reason...

138
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:24,223
<i>why you may not justly be joined
together in holy matrimony,</i>

139
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,758
do you now confess it?

140
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,098
It is then your will
to proceed.

141
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:42,868
<i>Do you,
Charles Osgood Justice...</i>

142
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:52,047
<i>Thank you. I don't know what
we'd do without your generosity.</i>

143
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:55,087
Sipsey, especially you.
Look what you've done!

144
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:59,090
Thank you, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Gimme that, you rascal!

145
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,989
Ohh!
Jump on my back.

146
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:09,694
<i>I don't think there ever was
a sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.</i>

147
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,263
You look beautiful, Lily.
Yes, Lily, you sure do.

148
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,776
<i>I had the biggest crush on him.</i>

149
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,175
<i>He was a terrible flirt!</i>

150
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:23,477
<i>But his heart belonged
to Ruth Jamison.</i>

151
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,712
<i>She was the daughter of
a friend of his mama's...</i>

152
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:29,584
<i>who was visitin'
that summer.</i>

153
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:33,113
Ruth Jamison, you're just
the one I've been lookin' for.

154
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:36,286
Are you thirsty? Let's
go visit someplace else.

155
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:42,129
<i>A little nest
that's nestled</i>

156
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:45,534
Think that's a big lake, you should've
seen the one next to our house.

157
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,731
We used to swim in it and fish.

158
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,469
I sure do miss it.
Sure do.

159
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:53,273
What happened to it?
Did it dry up?

160
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,280
No, worse than that.

161
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,407
Last fall, a flock of ducks,

162
00:12:57,483 --> 00:13:01,749
<i>40 or 50 of'em, landed right
smack in the middle of it.</i>

163
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,686
This fluke thing happened.

164
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:06,224
The temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

165
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,283
In three seconds,
just like that!

166
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,659
Those poor little ducks.
Did it kill them?

167
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,927
No, they flew off
and took the lake with 'em.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,367
To this very day, that lake
is somewhere over in Georgia.

169
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:20,872
Buddy Threadgoode.

170
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:35,185
Come a little closer.
I wanna give you something.

171
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,689
<i>Come here.</i>

172
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,791
Whoop!

173
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,857
<i>You'll see
a smiling face</i>

174
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:51,335
<i>Come back here, hat.
Where do you think you're goin'?</i>

175
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,507
Whoa!

176
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:58,669
I got it. Hold on, Ruth.
Hold on, little bit.

177
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,813
It's all right.
I got it.

178
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:11,685
Come here, you damn hat. Got it!

179
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:14,693
<i>Oh, I meant to do that.</i>

180
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:19,493
I... got it!

181
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,431
<i>Ta-da!</i>

182
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,761
All right.
Damn!

183
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,807
Come on.

184
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:39,317
Come on. Get out.
Get out.

185
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,320
Buddy!

186
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:44,619
<i>- Buddy!
- Buddy Threadgoode!</i>

187
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,954
<i>Come on, Buddy!</i>

188
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:49,757
Get out.

189
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,358
Get out of there.

190
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:58,501
<i>Buddy!</i>

191
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,700
<i>- Come on, Buddy!
- Buddy!</i>

192
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,369
Buddy!

193
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:09,507
No-o-o!

194
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,417
<i>Buddy!</i>

195
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,888
<i>Buddy, no!
No!</i>

196
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,721
<i>No! Buddy!
No-o-o!</i>

197
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,819
No! Buddy!
Let me go!

198
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:28,097
- No!
- Buddy!

199
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,797
<i>You got to go back
to the house.</i>

200
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:34,363
<i>Come on.
We're gonna go home.</i>

201
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:37,274
- Buddy!
- You have to be strong.

202
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,245
It'll be okay.
Buddy!

203
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,248
"The Lord is my Shepherd,

204
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:45,511
<i>I shall not want. "</i>

205
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:48,577
<i>Oh, it like
to have killed us all.</i>

206
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,317
<i>But nary a one took it
as hard as ldgie,</i>

207
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:59,888
<i>everyone thought she'd die
right along with him.</i>

208
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,816
<i>Night after night,
she stayed by the river.</i>

209
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:25,051
<i>Big George was the only soul
she'd let near her,</i>

210
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,652
<i>and he watched over her
night and day.</i>

211
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:31,526
<i>You know,
a heart can be broken,</i>

212
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:34,658
<i>but it still keeps a-beatin'
Just the same.</i>

213
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,362
Miss ldgie, you'll have
to keep this blanket on...

214
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,338
Or you'll catch your death
of cold, you hear me now?

215
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:44,811
That's so sad.

216
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,812
Ah.

217
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,878
Would you like one of these?

218
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:56,947
Oh, thank ya, honey.

219
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,889
<i>Evelyn?</i>

220
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,121
Honey, we gotta get goin'.

221
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,595
The Braves' game's
fixin' to start...

222
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,291
And you're gonna miss
your... thing.

223
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:09,097
Excuse me.
That's my husband, Ed.

224
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,229
Hi, ma'am.
How you doin'?

225
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,741
Um,

226
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,868
I can't believe Buddy died.

227
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:19,538
Neither could I.

228
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:23,015
Oh, well, I enjoyed
talkin' to you, honey.

229
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,075
What's your name?

230
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:28,212
Evelyn...
Evelyn Couch.

231
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:33,056
I've got to go. You come
back and see me, you hear?

232
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:37,029
Okay.
Bye-bye.

233
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:39,495
<i>First of all, I want you...</i>

234
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,161
<i>to truly
dedicate yourselves...</i>

235
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:46,263
<i>to finding little ways to
putting that magic, that spark...</i>

236
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,535
back into your marriage.

237
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,545
When we think of
romance and marriage,

238
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,640
<i>what is the first thought that
comes into your mind? Divorce!</i>

239
00:17:56,717 --> 00:18:00,414
Remember when counselors used to tell
you to wrap yourself in cellophane...

240
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,683
To put a little charge
into your marriage?

241
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,555
Do we really pay
for these lectures?

242
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,322
<i>You can see,
it is truly up to you...</i>

243
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:11,888
<i>to put romance back
into your relationship.</i>

244
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:21,407
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

245
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,672
<i>Da-na-na
da-na-na-na</i>

246
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:29,808
<i>As I walk this land
of broken dreams</i>

247
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:34,321
<i>I have visions
of many things</i>

248
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,482
<i>Happiness
Hi, honey.</i>

249
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:39,526
<i>Is just an illusion</i>

250
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,561
Evelyn, have you gone insane?

251
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,563
<i>My God,
people can see you!</i>

252
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,690
<i>What if I had been
the paperboy?</i>

253
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,529
Get in there!

254
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,399
<i>What are you
thinking about?</i>

255
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:54,538
<i>Evelyn?</i>

256
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,906
Evelyn!
Oh.

257
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:00,936
You know, what we really need
instead of this baloney...

258
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:05,076
Is an assertiveness training
class for Southern women.

259
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:08,713
But that's a contradiction
in terms, isn't it?

260
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,020
Especially you, sweetheart.
You're livin' in the Dark Ages.

261
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:19,094
<i>The roots of love
grow all around</i>

262
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,001
<i>But the leaves
they come tumblin'down</i>

263
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:29,099
<i>Every day, heartaches
grow a little stronger</i>

264
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:34,170
<i>I can't stand this pain
much longer</i>

265
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,876
Hi, honey. I need one of those. Hi!

266
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:40,716
Mmm, you smell good too.

267
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,813
I need one of these.

268
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,825
Oh, this looks good! Uh-huh.

269
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,828
Yes, indeedy.

270
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:52,959
<i>Always movin'
but goin'nowhere</i>

271
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,936
<i>[Indistinct]</i>

272
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,974
Ed.

273
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,837
<i>Why don't you come in
and sit down at the table...</i>

274
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,848
and have dinner with me? I'm
sorry. The game's almost over.

275
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,749
I just want to see a little bit
of it. Why you so dressed up?

276
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,310
Honey, don't get in the way.
Scoot over a bit.

277
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,017
Ed?

278
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,086
If I'd answered the door
wearing only cellophane,

279
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,463
would you still be
watching the baseball game?

280
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,265
No, honey. I'd probably be
checking you into a looney bin.

281
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:55,825
<i>Hi, sugar.</i>

282
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,831
<i>How's my dumplin'?
Trick or treat!</i>

283
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,833
<i>You're not gonna throw
them hissy-fits, are you?</i>

284
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:03,132
<i>Happy Halloween!
Oh, no. No, no, no!</i>

285
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,298
<i>You're meaner than a damn snake.</i>

286
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,364
I'm glad you're feeling better.

287
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,673
<i>Get back in bed. Good thing
your eyesight's failing.</i>

288
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,450
Hey!
Mmm. Oh.

289
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:26,926
Hey. I was hopin' you'd be here.

290
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:31,056
My roommate, Mrs. Otis,
said I could visit her family,

291
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:33,066
but I said, "Thank you kindly,

292
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,762
but I think I might have
my own visitor."

293
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,828
And here you are.

294
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:40,170
Well, sit down.
Thank you.

295
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:43,769
And doughnuts to boot!
You can't beat that.

296
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,678
Well, help yourself, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Thank you.

297
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,439
How's your friend?

298
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,508
Mrs. Otis?
Uh-huh.

299
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:53,520
Well, not so good.
Oh.

300
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:56,318
Looks like I won't be
gettin' home for quite a while,

301
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:59,827
and I sure miss it.

302
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:03,160
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

303
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:05,631
I miss the smell of coffee...

304
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,498
And bacon fryin'.

305
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,064
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a
plate of fried green tomatoes...

306
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,837
Like we used to have
at the cafe.

307
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:18,311
Ooh!

308
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,910
I never told you about the cafe, did I?

309
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,920
No, ma'am.

310
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:31,584
Oh, well...
now let me back up a bit.

311
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,893
<i>You see, ldgie never
quite got over losing Buddy.</i>

312
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,294
<i>She hardly
ever come home.</i>

313
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,237
<i>Only Big George
knew how to find her.</i>

314
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:50,040
<i>She just didn't seem to care
about anythin'anymore.</i>

315
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:52,045
<i>Then, one summer day,</i>

316
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:55,083
<i>her mama sent for her.</i>

317
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:57,085
<i>Like they say,</i>

318
00:22:57,153 --> 00:23:00,645
<i>God never shuts one door
without opening another.</i>

319
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:04,352
<i>That was also the day ldgie
met Frank Bennett, Mama!</i>

320
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:07,157
<i>The man whose murder
got her arrested.</i>

321
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:11,256
Well, hello there, miss.
And who might you be?

322
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,826
Towanda to you.
Who are you?

323
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:19,136
Oh, Frank Bennett's
the name, Miss Towanda.

324
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:23,201
I must say you are lookin'
mighty fine today.

325
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,270
You a politician...

326
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:28,545
Or does lying
just run in your family?

327
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,547
<i>Mama!</i>

328
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,487
Well, there you are!

329
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:37,549
<i>Well, it's about time,
ldgie.</i>

330
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:43,264
If you don't look like
the wild man of Borneo.

331
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:46,927
Here you go. Well, thank you.

332
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:49,335
Guess who's here?
Who?

333
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:52,067
Ruth. She's stayin'
with us this summer...

334
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:55,542
And will be in charge of all the young
people's activities at the church.

335
00:23:55,611 --> 00:24:00,378
Is that why you wanted to see me?
We have so many things planned.

336
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,576
<i>Ruth?</i>

337
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:06,144
<i>You remember my youngest
child? Of course I do.</i>

338
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:08,156
Hi, ldgie.

339
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,216
Hi.

340
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:18,995
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

341
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,628
Oh, it's got to work.

342
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:25,196
<i>Somebody's got to help her. I can't.</i>

343
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:29,571
Are you sure you want
to go to this river club, Miss Ruth?

344
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,579
These ain't no
churchgoing folks.

345
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,878
<i>I'll do just
fine, George, thank you.</i>

346
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,384
Oh, excuse me.

347
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,752
Is ldgie Threadgoode here
by any chance?

348
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:43,621
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

349
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:47,129
Here? Okay.
Uh-huh.

350
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,824
I'll see you, Grady Kilgore,

351
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:51,958
and I'll raise you twenty.

352
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,594
You ain't got nothin'!

353
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,969
<i>Maybe I do and maybe I don't.</i>

354
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,272
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.

355
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:08,943
Well, look what
the cat drug in!

356
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:12,886
I came to talk to you.

357
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:15,321
You're gonna have to wait.
I'm busy.

358
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,985
Come on, Grady, this is your
big chance. You in or out?

359
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,494
<i>I'll make you
a rich man.</i>

360
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,555
<i>You just bluffin'again as usual.</i>

361
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:26,624
I'm afraid you're gonna have to excuse
ldgie. She's goin' home for dinner.

362
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:28,863
Say good-bye, ldgie.
Where you goin'?

363
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:33,307
Where the hell you goin' with
my money? We're goin' home!

364
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:37,311
<i>- Who are you to boss me around?
- The one holdin' your money!</i>

365
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,313
Give it back.

366
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,508
Now, get in the car.

367
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:46,616
All right, I'll get in the car.

368
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:49,180
You win!

369
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,227
Come on.

370
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:53,852
Sucker!

371
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,954
<i>I'll leave when I want!</i>

372
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,832
I don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

373
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:02,064
I'm not doin' anything
to my mother.

374
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,699
Oh, no? Why do you think
I'm here for the summer?

375
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:08,142
Your mother was so worried, she thought I
might be able to talk some sense into you.

376
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,543
<i>But you're too busy
being selfish!</i>

377
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:13,583
What are you talkin' about?

378
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,347
You're not the only one
who lost Buddy.

379
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,513
We all miss him...

380
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:22,456
But turning your back on
your family is not gonna help.

381
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:26,887
What's he got to do
with anything?

382
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:31,093
<i>Looks like you're the one with
the problem forgetting my brother.</i>

383
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,963
<i>Why, just ten miles away...</i>

384
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,941
<i>down by the river,</i>

385
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,240
<i>there lurks
a den of the devil...</i>

386
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:46,146
<i>where liquor
and gamblin'...</i>

387
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:49,049
<i>and sin abide!</i>

388
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,782
Snakes and serpents...

389
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,017
<i>Hey, Scroggins!</i>

390
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:59,050
You're finally preachin' about
somethin' you're kin to... snakes!

391
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:02,428
<i>As I said,</i>

392
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:07,630
snakes and serpents
take many disguises.

393
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:10,969
<i>Let's turn to page 53
in our hymnal.</i>

394
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,072
Yoo-hoo!

395
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,951
Big George thought
I might find you here.

396
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:32,659
If you give me a chance,
a chance to get to know you,

397
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:36,460
maybe it'll be fun!

398
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,934
Fun?

399
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:43,268
Idgie , just spend
some time with me.

400
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,274
Please?

401
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:47,276
Suit yourself.

402
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:50,640
<i>You sure you
don't wanna back out?</i>

403
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:53,911
It's not too late.
I'm sure.

404
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,316
Here, hold this.

405
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:01,017
Tell me now, you like trains?

406
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:04,891
Yes.
Good.

407
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,863
We'll get along just fine!

408
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,859
Boy, did we luck out tonight.

409
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,970
Hop in.

410
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:21,567
Hop?

411
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:24,671
Oh. Give me
your hand.

412
00:28:24,748 --> 00:28:27,216
Put your foot up there.

413
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,653
Hold that.

414
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:42,360
Ooo-ooo!
Look at all this!

415
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,531
Don't you think we should get off
the train? It's startin' to move.

416
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:54,407
No. The fun
just started!

417
00:28:57,747 --> 00:29:00,147
You all right?

418
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:04,448
Well, sometimes I get
a little dizzy lookin' down.

419
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:07,218
Don't look down.

420
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:23,870
What are you doin'?
Come on. Look.

421
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:26,842
<i>They're throwin'
away food!</i>

422
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:33,309
You talk about
"give unto others."

423
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:36,444
Yes, but this food
isn't yours to give.

424
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,681
That's church talk.

425
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:41,748
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday...

426
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,454
Over at the river club every
other night of the week,

427
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:48,396
doin' anything
but pray. Come on.

428
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,942
<i>More!
Give me some.</i>

429
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:34,642
Okay, time to get off.

430
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,247
We gotta jump.

431
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,908
Jump?

432
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:43,044
<i>Yeah, jump. The next stop's
five miles down the tracks.</i>

433
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,111
I don't wanna walk
that far back.

434
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:48,056
Are you crazy?

435
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,491
<i>You're not kiddin'.</i>

436
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:54,224
Well...

437
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:56,766
I give up. Jump.

438
00:30:56,834 --> 00:31:00,099
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you...

439
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:02,435
You'll never jump, will you?

440
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:07,603
Don't say "never" to me.

441
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:22,421
Towanda!

442
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,900
<i>You all right?
I'm fine.</i>

443
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:41,536
<i>I'm all right.</i>

444
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,739
Ow!

445
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:46,146
Does this hurt?

446
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:48,981
Guess so.

447
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,351
We better get you to
a doc... doctor. Shit!

448
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:53,515
Which way is it?

449
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:57,186
About two miles
down the tracks.

450
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:59,491
All right, let's go.

451
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:04,790
You'll never be able
to carry me that far.

452
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,565
I know.
Never say never.

453
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:11,769
I'm not carryin' you.
You're walkin'.

454
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:22,449
<i>Thank you,
Julian. I owe you one.</i>

455
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,300
Uh. Ow.

456
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:39,929
Aren't you ready yet?

457
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:42,098
What?

458
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:47,236
This doesn't have anything
to do with trains, does it?

459
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:50,376
You like honey?

460
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,416
Yeah, I like honey.

461
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,475
Fresh honey?
Yeah.

462
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:58,080
Me too.
There it is.

463
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:02,354
There what... is?

464
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:06,295
<i>You'll see soon enough.</i>

465
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:12,498
Now... stay here.

466
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:15,506
No matter what happens,
don't move.

467
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:18,839
What are you gonna do?

468
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,938
Ah.

469
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:34,143
<i>Here you are, madam.
This is for you.</i>

470
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,588
Why did you do that?
You could have been killed.

471
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:42,149
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:44,923
Don't you want the honey?

473
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:48,329
I got it just for you.

474
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,868
It's all right.
I do it all the time.

475
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,701
I never get stung, honest.

476
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,764
Don't be mad at me, Ruth.

477
00:34:56,841 --> 00:35:00,743
Idgie , I'm not mad at you.

478
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,372
No foolin'?

479
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,884
Is it bad, what I did?

480
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,289
No.

481
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,522
I thought I might
be crazy or somethin'.

482
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:20,394
No, no.

483
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:24,129
I've heard there were people
who could charm bees.

484
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:27,832
I've just never seen
it done... before today.

485
00:35:29,742 --> 00:35:34,111
You're just a bee charmer,
ldgie Threadgoode.

486
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,640
That's what you are,
a bee charmer.

487
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:41,448
Here, you want to taste it?

488
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:50,323
<i>"Satan started to
laugh at Job's devotion.</i>

489
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:55,629
<i>"He bet God that Job would
never have so much faith...</i>

490
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,794
"if he didn't have
so many blessings.

491
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,738
"He went on and on so long and
so much that God finally agreed...

492
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:04,503
"to let Satan
put Job to a test.

493
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:07,705
<i>"Suddenly, from bein'
on top of the world,</i>

494
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,409
<i>Job was plunged down into
the deepest pits of misery. "</i>

495
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:16,182
Surprise!

496
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:20,391
Idgie  Threadgoode!

497
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,393
Tonight we're gonna have
a real party.

498
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,691
Drink this... and then,
we're gonna play some poker.

499
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:28,632
I don't know how to play
poker and I never drink...

500
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:30,692
But thank you anyway.

501
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,764
<i>Oh,
my darlin' Oh, my darlin'</i>

502
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:38,332
<i>Here comes the windup.</i>

503
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,743
Burn that ball in here.
Burn 'em in here!

504
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:45,182
Right in the pocket. I
don't know how to bat.

505
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,049
And you don't drink, either.

506
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,214
<i>It's gonna be a spitter.
Hold the bat and swing.</i>

507
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,019
Spitter?

508
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:56,289
<i>- She gonna spit at me?
- She's gonna spit on the ball.</i>

509
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:59,559
Swing that bat!
Take another crack at it.

510
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,793
I'm gonna take
another crack at it.

511
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:05,064
<i>Get 'em in here.</i>

512
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,376
Now run, Ruth.
Run!

513
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,439
Come on around the bases!

514
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:19,507
Don't kiss everybody.
Run!

515
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:22,611
I have never had so much fun...

516
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:25,020
In my whole life.

517
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:28,389
I even got a home run.

518
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:31,430
A clean one at that!

519
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:34,694
A straight beats
three of a kind.

520
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:44,037
You know, poker isn't half bad.

521
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,270
What's your mother gonna say...

522
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:49,712
When she sees us both...
drunk?

523
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:53,684
You gotta stop worrying about
what people think. I know.

524
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,743
You've always done
the right thing.

525
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:59,257
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

526
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:03,193
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

527
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:05,992
You're gonna
take care of your mama.

528
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,592
And I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

529
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:11,932
You gettin' married?

530
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:16,270
As soon as the summer's over.

531
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:23,510
Oh, am I gonna miss you.

532
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:26,711
This is the best birthday...

533
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:29,755
I ever had.

534
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:45,897
<i>Ruth invited
ldgie to the weddin',</i>

535
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:48,566
<i>but ldgie never did
write back.</i>

536
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:53,045
<i>No, but she did drive all night
to Valdosta, Georgia,</i>

537
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,047
<i>to watch from afar.</i>

538
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:58,084
Oh, here we go!

539
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:01,643
<i>And she swore
she'd never see Ruth again.</i>

540
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:04,952
<i>No sir! Whew!</i>

541
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:09,291
Now, Mama Jamison,
you put that down.

542
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:11,956
Oh, my Lord!

543
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:20,598
<i>During these next few weeks,</i>

544
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:25,008
<i>we will be learning to reclaim
our own power as women!</i>

545
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:27,171
Hallelujah!

546
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:32,014
And tonight, we're gonna
begin to explore...

547
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:34,280
<i>our own femaleness...</i>

548
00:39:34,354 --> 00:39:38,916
<i>by examining the source
of our strength...</i>

549
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:41,358
and our separateness.

550
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,396
Our vaginae.

551
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:48,163
<i>So if y'all will just
slip off your panties...</i>

552
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:51,761
and straddle your mirrors.

553
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,500
<i>Ms. Couch!</i>

554
00:39:54,574 --> 00:39:58,010
Ms. Couch!

555
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:02,447
Um, I need to be excused
for a minute.

556
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:06,576
Um, Missy, could you come
with me to the ladies' room?

557
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:10,384
- Do you find this threatening?
- Uh, well, um...

558
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:14,587
<i>do you have a problem with
your sexuality? No, ma'am.</i>

559
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:17,687
But I do have a problem
with my girdle.

560
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:36,040
<i>Cherish is the word
I use to describe</i>

561
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:42,387
<i>Hi, baby. All the
feelings that I have...</i>

562
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:46,016
All right, fried chicken!
My favorite.

563
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:51,830
<i>I don't know how many times
I wish that I had told you</i>

564
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,025
Ed?

565
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,160
<i>Ed?</i>

566
00:40:57,237 --> 00:41:01,731
Those classes I've been taking
aren't helpin' us one bit.

567
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:04,470
Let's go to Florida...

568
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,876
Like when we got married.

569
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:10,279
Kyle's gone,
busy with his own life.

570
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,341
It'd be just the two of us.

571
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:15,354
Well, honey, it's just
the two of us here now.

572
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:18,118
Boy, you got a good scald
on that chicken!

573
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:21,183
I'm tellin' you, that's
really good. Thank you.

574
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,195
We could rent a boat...

575
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:26,926
And drift around
in the hot sun.

576
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,094
What do you think about it?

577
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,162
I'm just gettin' used to it
being quiet around here.

578
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,005
Honey, if those classes
aren't doin' you any good,

579
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,046
then don't go to 'em.

580
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:41,707
<i>Everyone needs a
miracle in their life.</i>

581
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:45,912
Damn, game's blacked out!

582
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:56,422
Yoo-hoo,
Mrs. Threadgoode?

583
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:59,898
Hey, Evelyn!

584
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,162
Do you like it?

585
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:05,603
Oooh! Well,

586
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:08,608
<i>who did it for ya,
darlin'? Believe it or not,</i>

587
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:10,610
it was a student,
a little bitty thing,

588
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:14,273
no bigger than a midget
from the beauty college.

589
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:17,681
Sometimes they come out here
and do our hair for free...

590
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:20,550
Just for the practice,
you know.

591
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:25,149
Is Ed with ya?
No, ma'am.

592
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:28,957
His aunt said she didn't want
visitors anymore, especially us.

593
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:33,261
It's a shame.
I know he feels bad,

594
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,326
but Lord if he'll
talk to me about it.

595
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,505
Oh, thank you.

596
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,546
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

597
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:50,916
Mrs. Threadgoode...

598
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:58,124
How about tellin' me
some more... about ldgie?

599
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,558
Oh, well, now, let me see.

600
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:05,930
Where were we? Ruth had just
gotten married to Frank Bennett?

601
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,332
Wasn't that the man ldgie
was arrested for murderin'?

602
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:11,599
That's right.

603
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:17,235
After Ruth left, ldgie
went back to her old ways,

604
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,839
<i>Hangin'out with Grady
and the boys at the river club.</i>

605
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:27,786
<i>But after a few years,
temptation got the better of her.</i>

606
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,525
I don't wanna wake you, Miss ldgie,
but it's an all-day drive to Valdosta.

607
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:37,621
Your mama said if you're goin', she
wants you to take this pie to Miss Ruth.

608
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:42,635
How does she know where
I'm going? I told her.

609
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,139
Don't you go stirrin' up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

610
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,505
Yes, ma'am.
Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

611
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,544
You can stay in my house
as long as you want,

612
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,307
but don't treat me
like you treat your mama.

613
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,780
Grandma!
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:24,911
Hi there.

615
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:28,881
Yes?
Uh, is Ruth at home?

616
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,076
Who's callin'?

617
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:35,452
You just tell her it's the
bee charmer from Alabama.

618
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:38,492
Ruth,

619
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,360
there's some bee person
here to see you.

620
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,939
<i>Idgie .
Hi.</i>

621
00:44:59,014 --> 00:45:02,609
You got a real nice home,
real nice things and all.

622
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:04,675
Mm-hmm,
thank you.

623
00:45:04,753 --> 00:45:09,213
Mama said to give you this pie.

624
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,055
So...

625
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:19,123
Idgie  Threadgoode, how are ya?

626
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,796
You look so...
so grown up.

627
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:28,434
All the guys
must be wild about you.

628
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,276
Tell me,
do you have a fella yet?

629
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:36,784
A... couple.

630
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:39,217
I haven't decided on any.

631
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,221
Grady's the most
persistent, but...

632
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:44,190
Grady Kilgore? Don't say it so loud.

633
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,921
<i>Ruth, honey, who's down there?</i>

634
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:50,031
Hey...
Well...

635
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,566
What happened to you?
Nothin'.

636
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:54,761
Nothin'!
Where'd you get the shiner?

637
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,770
<i>Well, l... Who's down there?</i>

638
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,001
You'd better leave now. Did he hit you?

639
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:03,772
Did he beat you? Somebody's
got to talk to him. Idgie .

640
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,972
You're not gonna do
anything. I'm gonna kill him.

641
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:08,106
I'm gonna have a
conversation with him about...

642
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,947
You're not gonna do anything.
...pickin' on somebody his own size.

643
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,487
You're not gonna do
anything, understand?

644
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:15,750
If you care about me,
if you really do,

645
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:19,726
you'll turn around and leave
this minute. You understand?

646
00:46:32,741 --> 00:46:36,404
Well, what'd she want?

647
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:41,744
Nothin'.

648
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:56,155
Ruth's a grown woman, and
she knows what's best for her.

649
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,723
Mmm, I'm not so sure
about that.

650
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,260
<i>Idgie ?</i>

651
00:47:02,337 --> 00:47:04,635
Grady.
Hi.

652
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:08,335
Idgie , will you dance with me? No.

653
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,038
Come on.
It's only a dance.

654
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:17,943
Miss ldgie Threadgoode...
Get your butt off the floor.

655
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:21,250
Will you dance with me?

656
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:28,224
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

657
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:31,459
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

658
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:35,492
But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

659
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:40,003
You're just a goofy girl,
ldgie, a goofy girl.

660
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:42,067
Who're you callin'
a goof? Ow-ow-ow!

661
00:47:42,144 --> 00:47:45,307
Who you callin' a goof? Stop
that before I get mad and hurt ya.

662
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:47,542
Oh, yeah.
You try it.

663
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:51,143
Grady! There now, you give up?

664
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,188
No, I'll never give up!

665
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:57,783
<i>Grady finally
got dizzy and give up.</i>

666
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,490
<i>Try as they might, none of them
fellas could tame ldgie.</i>

667
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:05,394
<i>Now,
a little while later,</i>

668
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:09,234
<i>a letter
come from Ruth.</i>

669
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,505
Oh, it's an obituary.

670
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:20,015
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

671
00:48:20,082 --> 00:48:22,016
Oh.

672
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:24,177
And this is from the Bible.

673
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:26,813
<i>It's from
the book of Ruth.</i>

674
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:32,122
"And Ruth said,
whither thou goest, I will go;

675
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:34,526
"where thou lodgest,
I will lodge;

676
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:38,294
Thy people
shall be my people."

677
00:48:56,152 --> 00:49:00,248
All right, Julian,
you and Big George wait here.

678
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,463
Mama died.
I know.

679
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:21,975
And I'm pregnant.

680
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:42,890
<i>Julian, I got another
box here when you're done!</i>

681
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,667
<i>I never seen
anybody with so many hats.</i>

682
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:57,905
<i>Why don't we put
three in one box?</i>

683
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,915
<i>I don't think we can fit
all these in the car.</i>

684
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:04,077
<i>We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.</i>

685
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,087
<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>

686
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:08,089
Looks like your wife's
leavin' you, mister.

687
00:50:08,157 --> 00:50:12,992
<i>Sure she is. Don't
you touch her! Let go.</i>

688
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:16,657
You bastard!

689
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:18,666
<i>Put her down!</i>

690
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:20,964
Bastard!
Whoooo!

691
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:23,163
<i>Stop it!</i>

692
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:27,636
Don't you hurt her!

693
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,611
<i>Frank!</i>

694
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:37,283
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

695
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:43,655
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

696
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:46,126
<i>And he's crazy.</i>

697
00:50:46,195 --> 00:50:50,292
<i>There's no tellin'
what he might do.</i>

698
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:14,454
Go on, get outta here.

699
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,195
Hey!

700
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,569
<i>Come on!
Hey, hey! Come on now!</i>

701
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,632
Let's go. Come on.
You okay?

702
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,304
<i>Let's get Miss
Ruth and get outta here.</i>

703
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:40,076
<i>Come on, Miss Ruth.
Come on.</i>

704
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:45,577
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

705
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:54,492
<i>Well, I sure as
hell scared him, didn't I?</i>

706
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:57,192
<i>Yeah, you sure scared him.</i>

707
00:51:57,267 --> 00:52:00,236
<i>Towanda, the
amazing Amazon woman!</i>

708
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:02,294
<i>Towanda?</i>

709
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,170
<i>Towanda! Towanda!</i>

710
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:11,013
<i>Evelyn?
Evelyn!</i>

711
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:13,242
Oh!
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:13,316 --> 00:52:15,375
I was just lookin'
at the pictures, Missy.

713
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:18,785
They have the greatest stories
in that magazine, don't they?

714
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:21,221
Will I see you
in group tonight?

715
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,816
We'll be talking about
masturbation.

716
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:27,989
No, I don't think so. I think I've
had enough learnin' for the time bein'.

717
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:31,830
Thank you.
Thank you.

718
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,631
Oh!
Excuse me.

719
00:52:34,704 --> 00:52:37,696
Screw you!

720
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:46,472
Excuse me, young man.

721
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:50,349
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me.

722
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,980
Get away from me, you fat
cow. What did you call me?

723
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:55,547
Beat it, you old bitch.

724
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,594
Why are you being
so mean to me?

725
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:01,824
What did I ever do to you...

726
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:05,356
I don't understand!

727
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,770
Look at my Stove Top!

728
00:53:23,253 --> 00:53:26,086
Boo!

729
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:30,752
Oh, honey, what in the world
is the matter?

730
00:53:30,827 --> 00:53:33,557
I don't know.

731
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:38,698
Come on.

732
00:53:38,768 --> 00:53:41,760
Come on.
I need some exercise.

733
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:55,684
Now, you tell me what's
botherin' you, sugar.

734
00:53:55,753 --> 00:54:00,315
I just...
I just feel so useless.

735
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:04,225
So...
So powerless.

736
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:09,232
Everybody goes through that.
But I can't stop eatin'.

737
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,237
Every day I try and try
and every day I go off.

738
00:54:17,274 --> 00:54:20,300
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

739
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:23,346
A candy bar ain't
gonna hurt ya none.

740
00:54:23,414 --> 00:54:27,748
One, no.
But 10 or 11?

741
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:32,520
I can't even look
at my own vagina.

742
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:36,048
I can't help ya on that one.

743
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:40,529
I wish I had the courage to get
it over with and get really fat.

744
00:54:44,468 --> 00:54:48,905
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just...

745
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:53,467
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

746
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:58,212
Maybe I'm just goin' crazy.

747
00:54:59,817 --> 00:55:03,014
You get hot flashes?

748
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:05,021
Sometimes.

749
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:09,116
You get the sweats and your
hearts starts a-poundin'?

750
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:11,525
- How did you know?
- Simple, honey.

751
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:15,292
You're going through
the change.

752
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:19,860
I used to burst
into tears for no reason at all.

753
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,837
You need some hormones. Hmm?

754
00:55:23,908 --> 00:55:27,503
Maybe some Stresstabs
number 4 for good measure.

755
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:31,036
- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

756
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:33,447
You get yourself some hormones.

757
00:55:33,517 --> 00:55:37,009
Then you get outta
the house and get a job.

758
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:40,823
With your pretty complexion...

759
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:44,657
I'll bet you'll be
great with cosmetics.

760
00:55:46,063 --> 00:55:49,624
I know how you feel.

761
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,136
I was about your age
when I had my child.

762
00:55:53,203 --> 00:55:55,694
Then I went through
the change of life.

763
00:55:55,773 --> 00:56:00,403
I didn't know you had
a child. Yes, I did.

764
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:03,446
Albert.

765
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:08,110
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him.

766
00:56:08,185 --> 00:56:12,281
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five,

767
00:56:12,356 --> 00:56:15,325
and I should just put him
in an institution...

768
00:56:15,392 --> 00:56:20,056
Because the burden of raisin' a
child like that would be too great.

769
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:26,100
Well, I thought about Ruth.

770
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:30,003
She always said...

771
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:33,510
There was a separate
God for children.

772
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:38,480
So I smiled at him and
I asked for the baby.

773
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:43,248
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

774
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,550
Could ever be a burden?

775
00:56:45,623 --> 00:56:49,923
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

776
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:53,020
the Lord's greatest gift.

777
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:57,659
I don't believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth.

778
00:56:57,735 --> 00:57:00,705
I had him with me
till he was 30.

779
00:57:00,772 --> 00:57:05,038
Then he went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

780
00:57:06,444 --> 00:57:09,174
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

781
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:14,751
<i>Whoo!</i>

782
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:18,084
Shit!
It's a boy!

783
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,988
I think a prayer of
thanksgivin' would be in order.

784
00:57:24,062 --> 00:57:28,055
Goddamn it to hell, son-of-a-bitch,
she did it! Here's to Ruth!

785
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:32,399
<i>Idgie  always did have a
way with words around the reverend.</i>

786
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:36,596
<i>Well, Ruth had a baby.</i>

787
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:39,405
<i>She named him Buddy...
Buddy Junior.</i>

788
00:57:39,477 --> 00:57:44,608
<i>Papa went out and borrowed money so
Ruth and ldgie could start a cafe,</i>

789
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:46,913
<i>the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

790
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:56,923
<i>When you come by my house
come down behind the jail</i>

791
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:59,589
<i>I've got a sign
on my door</i>

792
00:57:59,664 --> 00:58:01,928
<i>Barbecue for sale</i>

793
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,764
<i>I'm talkin'
about barbecue</i>

794
00:58:04,836 --> 00:58:09,773
<i>Only thing I crave</i>

795
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:12,901
<i>And a good-doin' meat</i>

796
00:58:12,977 --> 00:58:18,244
<i>Will carry me
to my grave</i>

797
00:58:18,316 --> 00:58:23,083
<i>I'm sellin' it for cheap
'cause I got good stuff</i>

798
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:25,418
<i>Miss ldgie,
can you get the door?</i>

799
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,085
Yes.
Big George.

800
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,459
<i>Miss Ruth, me and the
missus want to thank you...</i>

801
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,691
for sendin' that soup
over last night.

802
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:38,998
I'll pay you when I get
ahead. You don't owe me, Ocie.

803
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,732
Thank you. I'm just glad they're better.

804
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:45,469
How is this, by the way?
It's good, very good.

805
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:49,001
<i>I'm not happy
till I see clean plates.</i>

806
00:58:51,683 --> 00:58:54,208
Can't go on, ldgie.

807
00:58:54,285 --> 00:58:56,583
I'm talking to you as a friend.

808
00:58:56,654 --> 00:59:01,114
There's people in this town, paying
customers too... There you go.

809
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:04,821
But some people
don't like you...

810
00:59:04,896 --> 00:59:07,057
<i>sellin' to coloreds.</i>

811
00:59:07,132 --> 00:59:09,100
Here you go.

812
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:13,069
Tell you what. Next time
those "some people" come here,

813
00:59:13,138 --> 00:59:15,572
I'm gonna ask if they
don't want anybody to know...

814
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,801
Who they are
under those sheets...

815
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:21,972
When they go marchin'
in those stupid parades,

816
00:59:22,046 --> 00:59:24,879
how come they don't have
sense to change their shoes?

817
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:28,282
Hold on there.
Y'all ain't foolin' anybody.

818
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:32,551
I'd recognize those size 14
clodhoppers you got anywhere.

819
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:35,752
- Just a minute, ldgie.
- More pie, Grady?

820
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:38,318
No, thank you, Ruth.

821
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:41,957
Idgie , I'll talk to the boys.

822
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:44,194
You just keep them
on out back there, ya hear?

823
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:49,036
<i>Bye, Ruth.
Bye, Grady.</i>

824
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:51,174
You're gonna get yourself
in a heap of trouble.

825
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:55,235
What, Grady?
He's harmless.

826
00:59:55,313 --> 00:59:59,340
You shoulda seen that
big ox down by the river.

827
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:03,444
Three solid days, drunk as
a dog, cryin' like a baby...

828
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:06,286
'cause Joe, that ol' colored
man that raised him, died.

829
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:08,292
<i>Remember that, Sipsey? Yes'm.</i>

830
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,056
<i>He sure ain't jokin' now,
is he, son? No, ma'am.</i>

831
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,496
He won't even sit in the same
room and have a meal today.

832
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:18,503
Don't make no sense. Big ox like Grady
won't sit next to a colored child,

833
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:22,007
but he eats eggs... Shoot
right out of a chicken's ass.

834
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:35,442
<i>Now some like it hot
some like it cold</i>

835
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:40,982
<i>Some take it any way
any way it's sold</i>

836
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,824
<i>I'm talkin' about
barbecue</i>

837
01:00:43,896 --> 01:00:46,865
<i>All these things I pray</i>

838
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:49,594
Come on, Smokey,
let's go for a walk.

839
01:00:58,577 --> 01:01:01,341
I'm sorry about
spillin' my food, ma'am.

840
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:05,076
I'll just head on.

841
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:16,818
See that piece
of land over there?

842
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:19,694
See it?
That used to be a lake.

843
01:01:19,765 --> 01:01:21,756
Yeah.

844
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,768
This one November,

845
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:25,770
all these ducks come by...

846
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,103
<i>and they landed
on that lake.</i>

847
01:01:29,174 --> 01:01:33,270
Then the temperature dropped so
fast, the whole lake just froze.

848
01:01:33,345 --> 01:01:36,371
Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with 'em.

849
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:39,246
Now that lake's somewhere
in Georgia, the way I hear it.

850
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:41,980
<i>Go on now.</i>

851
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:58,069
God bless you, ma'am.

852
01:02:08,113 --> 01:02:13,710
<i>Cool down, down
down by the bank</i>

853
01:02:13,786 --> 01:02:16,914
<i>Banks of Jordan</i>

854
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:22,518
<i>Cool down by
the banks of Jordan</i>

855
01:02:22,594 --> 01:02:26,997
<i>Cool down by
down by the bank</i>

856
01:02:27,066 --> 01:02:29,330
Here, try this.

857
01:02:33,105 --> 01:02:37,132
So what do you think? They're okay.

858
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:40,906
The truth.
Well...

859
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:46,279
They're terrible.

860
01:02:46,352 --> 01:02:51,289
Oh, well, don't be shy.
Tell me how you feel.

861
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:53,882
I will.

862
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:08,733
What'd you go and do that for?

863
01:03:11,544 --> 01:03:14,809
I just thought you needed
a little coolin' off.

864
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:18,977
You're right.

865
01:03:32,332 --> 01:03:35,733
Try these.

866
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:42,234
I think we need
to make a little paste.

867
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:04,057
What in the name of
Christmas are you two doing?

868
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:06,064
She's tryin' to teach me how to cook.

869
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:08,999
Look at those
fried green tomatoes.

870
01:04:13,106 --> 01:04:17,440
You better stop this. I'm gonna have
to arrest you for disorderly conduct.

871
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,978
<i>Arrest us then.
Let me handle this.</i>

872
01:04:20,046 --> 01:04:22,310
All right.
Grady.

873
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:26,608
Ha-ha-ha!

874
01:04:26,686 --> 01:04:30,850
Arrest us.
Go ahead, arrest us.

875
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:35,293
Ruth, I have to say it. I believe
ldgie's been a bad influence on ya.

876
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:38,489
I agree.

877
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,633
<i>I, I, I</i>

878
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:46,536
<i>I, I, I don't wanna</i>

879
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:50,372
Hear you weep no more
when I'm gone

880
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:55,244
Don't wanna hear you weep
when I'm gone in my grave

881
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:58,216
In my grave

882
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:20,598
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

883
01:05:20,673 --> 01:05:22,732
<i>Y'all keep the show
going till then.</i>

884
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,834
<i>We ain't goin'
nowhere.</i>

885
01:05:25,979 --> 01:05:29,107
...down again.
She's still poorly.

886
01:05:29,182 --> 01:05:32,174
<i>- Where's the baby?
- Who are you?</i>

887
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:36,920
<i>What do you want?</i>

888
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:39,823
<i>Frank!</i>

889
01:05:41,528 --> 01:05:44,122
<i>Get outta here.</i>

890
01:05:44,197 --> 01:05:47,928
<i>Get on outta here! Go on, get
outta here and leave us alone.</i>

891
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:50,299
Come on now, Ruth.

892
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:55,069
You wouldn't deny a father the
right to see his son, would ya?

893
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:57,939
<i>You git, I say. Scat you!</i>

894
01:05:58,011 --> 01:06:01,879
Damn! Gimme that. Let it go!

895
01:06:08,655 --> 01:06:13,752
Well, that's my boy, isn't it?

896
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:21,160
<i>Everything all right, ma'am?</i>

897
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,930
Our guest is just leavin'.

898
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:28,941
<i>Come on, Frank, let's go.</i>

899
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:35,348
I'll be back.

900
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:39,182
In the end, you and
the baby gonna be back.

901
01:06:42,356 --> 01:06:46,383
I ain't scared
of you! No, sir!

902
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,861
<i>You should be.</i>

903
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:01,973
<i>Mind your manners, boy!</i>

904
01:07:10,884 --> 01:07:13,250
Grady,

905
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,551
what does Gladys think
of you stayin' out late...

906
01:07:16,624 --> 01:07:20,924
And losin' your money to me
in poker night after night?

907
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:24,595
She likes it just fine.

908
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:31,797
They got Big George. Idgie !

909
01:07:31,872 --> 01:07:34,363
- Let go of him!
- Let me handle this!

910
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:38,309
We seen how you treat your niggers
around here and we don't like it.

911
01:07:38,379 --> 01:07:42,645
I'm the law in these parts. I don't
care what you like or don't like.

912
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:44,684
Turn him loose.

913
01:07:44,752 --> 01:07:47,949
<i>Don't get riled up,
nigger lover.</i>

914
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:52,482
You deaf or somethin'?
I said, let him go!

915
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,528
<i>Before you get yourselves in a
whole lot of trouble! Calm down.</i>

916
01:07:55,596 --> 01:07:58,360
We wanted to have
a little get-together...

917
01:07:58,432 --> 01:08:01,401
<i>and make sure we see
eye to eye on some things.</i>

918
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:04,904
<i>You hear me now?</i>

919
01:08:04,972 --> 01:08:06,997
Let's let him go, boys.

920
01:08:07,074 --> 01:08:08,769
<i>We've had enough fun
for one night.</i>

921
01:08:08,842 --> 01:08:10,776
<i>Turn him loose.
Come on.</i>

922
01:08:10,844 --> 01:08:12,812
No, you're gonna
get in trouble.

923
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,907
Well, now, that's more like it.

924
01:08:17,985 --> 01:08:20,920
Seems I don't recognize
any of you boys.

925
01:08:20,988 --> 01:08:23,218
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop,
are you?

926
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,319
This ought to do it.

927
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,387
I want to thank you,
Miss ldgie.

928
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:36,630
Forget it. You'd have
done the same for me.

929
01:08:36,704 --> 01:08:40,504
Try to get some sleep.

930
01:08:45,312 --> 01:08:48,406
Who the hell
were those assholes?

931
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:53,749
They's just some old boys from Georgia
come over here to put a scare in you.

932
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:56,255
Well, it worked.

933
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:59,019
One of'em was here
the other day for something,

934
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,618
seen you sellin' food
to coloreds.

935
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:05,756
They decided to come back,
shake you up a bit.

936
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:09,269
I told 'em we don't need anybody
from Georgia comin' over here...

937
01:09:09,336 --> 01:09:11,861
Tellin' us what
we can or cannot do.

938
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:17,104
They won't be back. I
guaran-gol-damn-tee you that.

939
01:09:17,177 --> 01:09:20,237
One other thing,
little Miss Smarty-pants,

940
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:24,581
I do not wear a size 14 shoe...

941
01:09:24,652 --> 01:09:28,213
And I don't
much care for parades,

942
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,884
bedsheets or otherwise.

943
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:48,835
<i>Hey. What's the matter?</i>

944
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:52,311
It was Frank.
He saw the baby.

945
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,474
<i>You sure it was him?
Yes, I'm sure.</i>

946
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,451
So that's why those
Kluxers were here.

947
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,853
Let me take him.

948
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:07,489
Don't worry. I mean, if he's
dumb enough to come back here,

949
01:10:07,562 --> 01:10:10,463
Grady and the Alabama boys
will take care of him.

950
01:10:10,532 --> 01:10:14,559
If they don't,
I'll think of somethin'.

951
01:10:14,636 --> 01:10:17,537
Don't take any chances.

952
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:20,904
Promise me you won't do
anythin' crazy, no matter what.

953
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:24,536
Me?
Not me.

954
01:10:26,614 --> 01:10:29,981
I'm gonna put him down.

955
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:31,916
<i>Hey, little Buddy.</i>

956
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,351
<i>That was the last
anyone saw of Frank Bennett...</i>

957
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:37,721
<i>until the night
of the town follies.</i>

958
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:42,195
<i>Ruth was away at one of the
Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.</i>

959
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:45,198
One thing a woman
expects when she gets married...

960
01:10:45,266 --> 01:10:47,200
Is sympathy.

961
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:49,668
Haven't you got that
since you married me?

962
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:54,197
I sure have...
from the whole town.

963
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,573
Hey there! You got to come quick.

964
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:31,806
Well, the show
has hardly begun.

965
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,610
You got to come quick now.
You hear me?

966
01:11:37,352 --> 01:11:39,650
Run, get help! Run,
quick! Where's the baby?

967
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,746
Never mind.

968
01:12:01,175 --> 01:12:06,704
Excuse me, sir. I don't believe
you should be goin' anywhere...

969
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,341
With Ruth's baby.

970
01:12:54,096 --> 01:12:56,064
Thank you.

971
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:58,565
Hi there. What can I do for you boys?

972
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:00,568
Idgie .
Grady.

973
01:13:00,636 --> 01:13:03,799
This here is Sheriff
Curtis Smoote. Hi there.

974
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:06,932
He's over here from Georgia.
He's lookin' for a fella. Oh.

975
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:12,137
You recognize him?
No.

976
01:13:12,214 --> 01:13:16,981
That's my husband, but I
haven't seen him in months.

977
01:13:17,052 --> 01:13:20,283
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armored truck.

978
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:22,381
What's he done?

979
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:26,451
Nothin' that we know of. We're tryin'
to find out what's been did to him.

980
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:30,020
He told his hired man he was
comin' to see his wife and baby,

981
01:13:30,099 --> 01:13:34,092
but he ain't never
showed up back home.

982
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,865
Hell, I told him
if he showed up in this town,

983
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:39,066
we'd all have known.

984
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:41,575
Looks a little sissified to me.

985
01:13:41,644 --> 01:13:45,637
From what I hear,
most you boys in Georgia...

986
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:47,147
<i>are a little light
on your feet.</i>

987
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:50,379
That's the way I heard it.

988
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:52,579
Could I interest you
in some pie?

989
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:56,557
No, ma'am, but that
barbecue sure smells good.

990
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:00,061
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

991
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,919
Here you go.
That's your 4th one today.

992
01:14:31,994 --> 01:14:34,827
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

993
01:14:34,897 --> 01:14:40,702
Sit down.

994
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,499
You ain't foolin' me,
girlie girl.

995
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:47,235
I know who you are.

996
01:14:47,309 --> 01:14:50,472
I heard from Bennett's hired hand
that you threatened to kill Frank.

997
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:53,743
<i>He ain't showed up
dead yet.</i>

998
01:14:53,816 --> 01:14:57,582
But if he does, you in a whole
mess of trouble. You understand?

999
01:14:57,653 --> 01:15:01,714
<i>What we talkin'about
is murder here.</i>

1000
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:04,987
<i>Runnin'a foul of the law
and nobody gets away with that,</i>

1001
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,860
not even a bunch
of Alabama smart alecks.

1002
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:11,559
If I find so much
as a hair of his head,

1003
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:14,295
I'll arrest you faster
than you can slap a tick,

1004
01:15:14,369 --> 01:15:19,932
<i>'cause I'm the law,
and you can't beat the law.</i>

1005
01:15:40,196 --> 01:15:43,563
Hey there.

1006
01:15:43,633 --> 01:15:46,227
Tell me what he said.

1007
01:15:46,302 --> 01:15:51,171
Smoote's? I told you.
He said...

1008
01:15:51,241 --> 01:15:54,540
That was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

1009
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:57,341
That's all?
No.

1010
01:15:57,413 --> 01:16:03,818
What else? He said the
pie was pretty good too.

1011
01:16:08,758 --> 01:16:11,420
You sure you ain't
never seen this man, boy?

1012
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:15,123
<i>Yes, sir, and I already
told ya, I ain't never seen him.</i>

1013
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:17,689
You'd do anything for
Miss ldgie, wouldn't ya, boy?

1014
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:21,536
Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:24,774 --> 01:16:28,369
Would ya kill for her?
Did ya kill for her?

1016
01:16:35,752 --> 01:16:37,879
No, sir.

1017
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:42,789
Well, now, maybe one of these
days you'll tell the truth.

1018
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:47,524
Just remember, we hang
lyin' niggers in Georgia...

1019
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:50,566
Just as fast as
they do in Alabama.

1020
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:54,399
Yes, sir, I remember.

1021
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:36,412
Sorry.

1022
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:41,416
What are ya doin' in
here? No milk in the house.

1023
01:17:41,484 --> 01:17:43,577
Where were you?

1024
01:17:43,653 --> 01:17:46,588
Takin' care of business,
havin' a good time.

1025
01:17:49,325 --> 01:17:52,886
I've been thinkin'
maybe I should move on...

1026
01:17:52,962 --> 01:17:55,430
<i>because of Frank
and all.</i>

1027
01:17:55,498 --> 01:18:00,435
I just don't want
you to feel like...

1028
01:18:00,503 --> 01:18:03,438
You have to look out for us.

1029
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:05,940
<i>I just...</i>

1030
01:18:06,009 --> 01:18:08,239
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

1031
01:18:08,311 --> 01:18:10,643
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

1032
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:15,616
I'm as settled
as I ever hope to be.

1033
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:34,932
Then... why can't you
tell me where you were?

1034
01:18:45,049 --> 01:18:48,541
I had a dream...
the other night.

1035
01:18:48,619 --> 01:18:53,921
I dreamt that Buddy was gone.

1036
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:58,451
I ran to his crib and there
he was, sleepin' like an angel.

1037
01:18:58,529 --> 01:19:01,157
You know, I thanked God...

1038
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:04,200
For lettin' me
still have Buddy.

1039
01:19:04,268 --> 01:19:06,828
And I remembered...

1040
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:10,635
Havin' the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

1041
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:14,405
thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

1042
01:19:14,478 --> 01:19:16,639
And I remembered...

1043
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:21,151
Thankin' the Lord
for each day my mother lived,

1044
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:25,518
even when she was
spittin' up blood...

1045
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:29,457
And prayin' for me to kill her.

1046
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:33,622
<i>I looked in my mother's eyes
pleadin'for me to help her...</i>

1047
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:38,191
and all I could do was pray.

1048
01:19:41,972 --> 01:19:45,965
While you were gone,
as I was holdin' Buddy,

1049
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:50,503
I thought if that bastard,
Frank Bennett...

1050
01:19:50,581 --> 01:19:55,280
Ever tries to take my child,

1051
01:19:55,352 --> 01:19:58,788
I won't pray.

1052
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:01,450
I'll break his neck.

1053
01:20:04,795 --> 01:20:08,822
<i>Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett anymore.</i>

1054
01:20:08,899 --> 01:20:12,528
How can you say that?
It's his child too.

1055
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:15,333
He won't give up on his blood.

1056
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:18,773
I'm only gonna
tell you this one time.

1057
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:24,113
Frank Bennett won't
be bothering you no more.

1058
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:26,945
<i>Understand?</i>

1059
01:20:28,986 --> 01:20:31,386
You killed him,

1060
01:20:31,455 --> 01:20:34,322
<i>didn't you?</i>

1061
01:20:34,391 --> 01:20:36,655
No!

1062
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:45,501
You don't believe me.

1063
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:50,131
Right now, I don't know
what to believe.

1064
01:20:52,609 --> 01:20:55,908
Believe me when I tell ya
I don't want ya to move out.

1065
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:13,395
<i>If I can help</i>

1066
01:21:13,464 --> 01:21:18,800
<i>Somebody</i>

1067
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:21,429
<i>As I go</i>

1068
01:21:21,505 --> 01:21:24,838
<i>Finally.</i>

1069
01:21:24,908 --> 01:21:28,639
<i>Thanks, I've been
out here all day.</i>

1070
01:21:28,712 --> 01:21:32,239
<i>If I can show</i>

1071
01:21:32,316 --> 01:21:38,619
<i>Somebody</i>

1072
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,125
<i>That they're travelin'</i>

1073
01:21:42,192 --> 01:21:45,787
<i>Travelin'wrong</i>

1074
01:21:45,863 --> 01:21:50,198
<i>Then my livin'
Hey...</i>

1075
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:55,729
<i>Shall not
shall not be in vain</i>

1076
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:58,207
Excuse me.
I was waiting for that space.

1077
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:03,213
Yeah? Tough! Face it, lady,
we're younger and faster.

1078
01:22:23,768 --> 01:22:26,669
Towanda.

1079
01:22:30,175 --> 01:22:33,201
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1080
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:38,181
Yeah!
Whooo!

1081
01:22:42,554 --> 01:22:45,022
Towanda!

1082
01:22:49,894 --> 01:22:52,692
Yes, ma'am.

1083
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:55,460
<i>Whoooo!</i>

1084
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:01,961
Help, someone! What are
you doing? Are you crazy?

1085
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:06,977
Face it, girls. I'm older,
and I have more insurance.

1086
01:23:15,587 --> 01:23:19,216
I never get mad, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Never!

1087
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,850
The way I was raised
it was bad manners.

1088
01:23:21,926 --> 01:23:25,089
Well, I got mad
and it felt terrific.

1089
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:28,462
I felt like I could beat
the shit outta all those punks!

1090
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:31,263
Excuse my language.
Just beat 'em to a pulp!

1091
01:23:31,336 --> 01:23:33,463
Beat 'em till
they begged for mercy.

1092
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:35,563
Towanda, the avenger!

1093
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,666
After I wipe out
all the punks of this world,

1094
01:23:38,743 --> 01:23:41,211
I'll take on the wife beaters,
like Frank Bennett,

1095
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,840
and machine gun their genitals.

1096
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:47,180
Towanda will go on the rampage.

1097
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:49,948
<i>I'll put tiny bombs
in Penthouse and Playboy...</i>

1098
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:52,216
so they'll explode
when you open 'em.

1099
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:56,750
I'll ban all fashion models
who weigh less than 130 pounds.

1100
01:23:58,563 --> 01:24:02,124
I'll give half the military
budget to people over 65...

1101
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,930
And declare wrinkles
sexually desirable.

1102
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:09,633
Towanda, righter of wrongs,
queen beyond compare!

1103
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:13,006
How many of them
hormones you takin', honey?

1104
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:24,579
<i>Oh, when you give more
than you get</i>

1105
01:24:24,656 --> 01:24:28,422
<i>You're in danger
Well, honey,</i>

1106
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:30,984
what I can't understand is...

1107
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:34,657
How in the hell
you can hit someone...

1108
01:24:34,732 --> 01:24:36,962
Six times by accident.

1109
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:40,061
Oh, Ed, don't make
such a big deal about it.

1110
01:24:40,138 --> 01:24:44,234
<i>Who knows what evil lurks
within the hearts of men</i>

1111
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:46,402
<i>When you find
that you're losin'</i>

1112
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:51,005
- What the hell is this?
- A low cholesterol meal.

1113
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:53,017
Happy Valentine's.

1114
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:56,213
<i>That's danger and
heartbreak dead ahead</i>

1115
01:24:56,288 --> 01:24:59,223
<i>My God!
Are you tryin'to kill me?</i>

1116
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,556
If I was gonna kill ya,
I'd use my hands.

1117
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:06,997
Stop in the name of love

1118
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:10,467
Before you break my heart

1119
01:25:10,536 --> 01:25:12,536
Think it over

1120
01:25:19,478 --> 01:25:22,072
I'm worried about
my little friend Evelyn.

1121
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:24,707
She said her husband...

1122
01:25:24,783 --> 01:25:27,081
Will just be watching
his sports on TV...

1123
01:25:27,152 --> 01:25:30,315
And she has an urge to hit him
in the head with a baseball bat.

1124
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:33,256
Hell, that seems normal to me.

1125
01:25:33,325 --> 01:25:35,316
<i>Hi, Janeen.
Mm-hmm.</i>

1126
01:25:35,394 --> 01:25:37,862
Mrs. Threadgoode, would
you like some crudites?

1127
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:42,333
Thank you, but this raw stuff
don't sit good with me.

1128
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:46,565
Mrs. Threadgoode, you
have to tell me something.

1129
01:25:46,638 --> 01:25:51,405
Did ldgie murder Frank Bennett
or not? Hold your horses, honey.

1130
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:54,503
Where were we?

1131
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,310
You didn't kill Ed, did ya?

1132
01:25:57,383 --> 01:26:01,046
Not yet.
Oh, good.

1133
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,784
Anyway, five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1134
01:26:05,858 --> 01:26:10,557
<i>And Smokey Lonesome been
missin'ever since that same terrible night.</i>

1135
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:13,689
<i>I 'member the day
when he showed up again.</i>

1136
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:16,601
My God, son,

1137
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:18,829
you're the spittin'
image of Ruth.

1138
01:26:18,904 --> 01:26:22,237
Buddy Threadgoode, Jr.
Nice to meet you, sir.

1139
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,673
Well, sir, Smokey Lonesome.

1140
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:27,940
<i>Curtis Smoote was making one
of his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama,</i>

1141
01:26:28,013 --> 01:26:30,811
<i>still huntin'and peckin'
for any scrap of evidence...</i>

1142
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:33,909
<i>about Frank Bennett's
whereabouts.</i>

1143
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:36,477
<i>Who wants to begin? Oh, I do.</i>

1144
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:38,386
<i>I do, Miss Ruth.
Thank you.</i>

1145
01:26:38,457 --> 01:26:41,722
We'll begin on page five.

1146
01:26:41,794 --> 01:26:45,059
<i>Life has a funny
way of working things out.</i>

1147
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,961
Well, hey there!

1148
01:26:47,032 --> 01:26:50,593
<i>Smokey!
Idgie ?</i>

1149
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:54,196
Smokey Lonesome!
If it isn't old home week.

1150
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:57,868
How are you? Well, I'm
rattlin' but I'm rollin'.

1151
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:01,504
What brings you to these
parts? Smell of good cookin'.

1152
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,172
Hey, Smokey.

1153
01:27:03,248 --> 01:27:06,308
Sipsey. Let me fix you some lunch.

1154
01:27:06,385 --> 01:27:10,788
You know just about everybody
except Curtis Smoote.

1155
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:14,348
<i>He's the officer from
over at Valdosta, Georgia.</i>

1156
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:18,522
He's been lookin' for the same man for
almost 5 years. Very stubborn fella.

1157
01:27:18,597 --> 01:27:22,533
<i>He loves our barbecue.</i>

1158
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:23,932
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

1159
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,044
<i>Buddy.</i>

1160
01:27:34,112 --> 01:27:36,046
Everybody outta the way.

1161
01:27:36,114 --> 01:27:39,880
Give him here.
Let him go. I've got him.

1162
01:27:41,854 --> 01:27:44,049
Come on. You're
gonna be all right.

1163
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:46,454
Open the door!

1164
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:50,586
<i>Put him in the
car. It's all right, honey.</i>

1165
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:13,718
<i>I can understand...</i>

1166
01:28:13,786 --> 01:28:16,311
having a funeral for an arm.

1167
01:28:16,389 --> 01:28:19,916
I just don't know why she
insists on callin' him "Stump."

1168
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:22,985
<i>She say everybody
else gonna be callin'him that...</i>

1169
01:28:23,062 --> 01:28:27,158
so we might just as well
be the first.

1170
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:31,397
Okay, ice cream
and cake for everybody.

1171
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:33,268
Go on.

1172
01:28:37,544 --> 01:28:41,537
My daddy always used to say there
was a separate God for children.

1173
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:48,945
<i>The good Lord was
watchin' over stump that day.</i>

1174
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:52,389
<i>But then it started to rain
that month.</i>

1175
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:57,293
<i>It rained and rained, and it
flooded parts of Whistle Stop.</i>

1176
01:28:57,363 --> 01:29:02,494
<i>That's why Grady's deputies stumbled
onto Frank Bennett's pickup truck,</i>

1177
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:06,562
<i>and I just knew ldgie'd
never get out of this mess.</i>

1178
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,405
Now, you in or out? Remember,
I didn't take any cards.

1179
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:12,910
Look at me and
let me see your face.

1180
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:15,209
Idgie , I have to talk
to you. You're bluffin'.

1181
01:29:15,281 --> 01:29:19,047
Why don't you sit in? I'll deal
you a new hand. Gladys won't mind.

1182
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:21,211
In private, ldgie.

1183
01:29:21,287 --> 01:29:24,313
Excuse us, Ruth.

1184
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:28,656
A-ha. I'm just tryin' to teach
you not to fall for any tricks.

1185
01:29:28,728 --> 01:29:31,356
You're doin' a great job.

1186
01:29:40,173 --> 01:29:42,403
What's your hurry?

1187
01:29:42,475 --> 01:29:45,706
And what is so important?

1188
01:29:45,778 --> 01:29:48,008
What's that?

1189
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:51,414
<i>Somebody found Frank
Bennett's truck in the river.</i>

1190
01:29:51,484 --> 01:29:54,647
What's that got to do with me?

1191
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:58,680
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1192
01:29:58,758 --> 01:30:01,659
You're in my custody
until tomorrow.

1193
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:04,424
I'm supposed to take you to
Georgia first thing in the morning.

1194
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:08,694
<i>Unless, of course...</i>

1195
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,498
Well, some people have
been known to pack up...

1196
01:30:11,571 --> 01:30:15,974
And sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1197
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:20,270
<i>What about Big George?</i>

1198
01:30:20,346 --> 01:30:23,076
Well, the way I figure it,

1199
01:30:23,149 --> 01:30:26,380
they'd be satisfied
if they had him.

1200
01:30:26,452 --> 01:30:28,511
Idgie , this is serious.

1201
01:30:28,588 --> 01:30:31,182
We're talkin'
murder of a white man.

1202
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:33,487
Someone's gonna have to pay.

1203
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:36,392
Nobody wants to hang a woman.

1204
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,921
No deal.

1205
01:30:39,999 --> 01:30:42,593
Idgie , I know how you feel
about Big George.

1206
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:44,796
Hell, we all do.

1207
01:30:44,871 --> 01:30:48,034
But these just
the facts of life.

1208
01:30:50,476 --> 01:30:52,740
I can't do that.

1209
01:30:52,812 --> 01:30:55,576
Take me to jail if you have to.

1210
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:58,139
Well, that's what
I thought you'd say...

1211
01:30:58,217 --> 01:31:00,617
'cause you're absolutely,
unconditionally,

1212
01:31:00,687 --> 01:31:05,182
<i>positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.</i>

1213
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:11,726
<i>Idgie  and Big George went
to the county jail in Valdosta...</i>

1214
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:15,599
<i>to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.</i>

1215
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:17,796
<i>They didn't have
to wait too long.</i>

1216
01:31:17,871 --> 01:31:21,272
Did you know Frank Bennett? No, sir.

1217
01:31:21,341 --> 01:31:23,741
You mean, you
never met the man...

1218
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:28,339
<i>whose wife, Ruth, is your
business partner? That's right.</i>

1219
01:31:28,415 --> 01:31:31,248
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1220
01:31:31,318 --> 01:31:35,015
In front of his hired man
in June of 1932?

1221
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:40,117
<i>The same Frank Bennett you did not
know. Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

1222
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:43,425
<i>I thought you wanted to know if we'd
ever met... and the answer is no.</i>

1223
01:31:43,497 --> 01:31:46,057
<i>Um, I threatened
to kill him,</i>

1224
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:50,297
<i>but we were never, what you
might say, properly introduced.</i>

1225
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:54,363
Is it not true that in September
of 1932 you came to Valdosta...

1226
01:31:54,441 --> 01:31:58,275
<i>and took Frank Bennett's wife and
child back to Alabama with you?</i>

1227
01:31:58,345 --> 01:32:00,813
Um... just the wife.
The child came later.

1228
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:04,339
How much later? The usual. Nine months.

1229
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:07,285
<i>I suggest that you bribed...</i>

1230
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:12,656
this poor, weak woman with
promises of liquor and money,

1231
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:16,457
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily.

1232
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:19,522
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1233
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,230
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1234
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,031
No, sir.

1235
01:32:27,107 --> 01:32:32,374
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1236
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:34,744
I was at the town hall
doing a show.

1237
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,909
And after that? I was
at my mother's house.

1238
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:40,510
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1239
01:32:40,587 --> 01:32:44,921
<i>Just Big George and myself. What about
your mother? Can she confirm that?</i>

1240
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,256
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1241
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:49,818
I'm sorry to hear that.

1242
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:53,594
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1243
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:56,295
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1244
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,771
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1245
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,104
You expect these men
to take your word for it...

1246
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,838
<i>Just because
you say so?</i>

1247
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:09,440
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1248
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:12,974
<i>One more outburst like that...</i>

1249
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:16,545
and I'll hold you in contempt
of court. You understand?

1250
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:19,421
Yes, sir.

1251
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:24,689
Oh, Lord.
Next witness.

1252
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:28,734
<i>Did you know
that you were pregnant...</i>

1253
01:33:28,802 --> 01:33:31,737
<i>at the time
you left Valdosta?</i>

1254
01:33:31,805 --> 01:33:33,739
<i>Yes.</i>

1255
01:33:33,807 --> 01:33:37,402
<i>And yet, you tell us
over and over...</i>

1256
01:33:37,477 --> 01:33:42,039
<i>that you went with this
woman... willingly?</i>

1257
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:46,313
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1258
01:33:46,386 --> 01:33:48,479
<i>But why?</i>

1259
01:33:48,555 --> 01:33:52,753
<i>Did this woman promise you money? No.</i>

1260
01:33:52,826 --> 01:33:55,386
<i>A bigger home?</i>

1261
01:33:55,462 --> 01:33:58,556
No. No.

1262
01:33:58,632 --> 01:34:01,260
<i>Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,</i>

1263
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,860
<i>why would a respectable
Christian woman...</i>

1264
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:06,735
<i>go anywhere with this ldgie
Threadgoode... I object.</i>

1265
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,934
<i>Whose reputation
is known far and wide...</i>

1266
01:34:09,009 --> 01:34:11,240
<i>as a notorious liar
and drunkard?</i>

1267
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,610
<i>- Objection!
- Sustained!</i>

1268
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:19,316
<i>Why did you leave...</i>

1269
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:23,346
<i>with ldgie Threadgoode
that day?</i>

1270
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:28,058
<i>Answer the
question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

1271
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,956
Because she...

1272
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:37,129
She's the best friend
I ever had,

1273
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:39,298
and I love her.

1274
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:42,909
<i>Thank you, Mrs.
Bennett. That will be all.</i>

1275
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:45,810
<i>The defense
calls as its last witness...</i>

1276
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,610
<i>the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.</i>

1277
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:52,943
Place your right hand
on the Bible, please.

1278
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:56,218
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1279
01:34:56,291 --> 01:35:00,352
You swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1280
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:02,419
I do.

1281
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:08,697
<i>You have
information about the whereabouts...</i>

1282
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,365
<i>of ldgie Threadgoode and her
colored man, known as Big George,</i>

1283
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,206
on the night
of September 30, 1933?

1284
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:18,245
Yes, sir, I do.

1285
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:20,747
<i>It has been
suggested here...</i>

1286
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:24,273
<i>that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.</i>

1287
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:28,584
<i>Can you confirm that?
No, sir. That is a lie.</i>

1288
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,386
Oh, shit.

1289
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:34,690
<i>It has been my
habit to write all the dates...</i>

1290
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:37,697
<i>of the activities of
the church in my Bible.</i>

1291
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:42,429
<i>I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...</i>

1292
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:45,529
was the start of our
annual revival...

1293
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:48,370
Down at the Baptist campground.

1294
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:50,536
Sister Threadgoode was there...

1295
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:54,638
<i>along with her hired man,
George Pullman,</i>

1296
01:35:54,716 --> 01:35:58,846
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1297
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,582
<i>for the last ten years.
Objection.</i>

1298
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:06,184
That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've
taken place any time the next couple of days.

1299
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:11,288
<i>Have you ever been to one of
our revivals, sir? Well, no.</i>

1300
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:13,425
Do you attend church
regularly, sir?

1301
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,696
'Course I do.

1302
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:20,298
<i>Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,</i>

1303
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,741
<i>you'd know
they last three days...</i>

1304
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,142
and three nights, Your Honor.

1305
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:30,384
<i>Approach the bench.</i>

1306
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:35,150
Percy, it don't look like
you got a case at all.

1307
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:37,783
In the first place,
there's no body.

1308
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:41,124
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1309
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:45,393
But, Your Honor... I'm tellin' you.
What you got is a lot of nothing.

1310
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,697
<i>I say Frank
Bennett got himself drunk,</i>

1311
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:52,934
<i>drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...</i>

1312
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:56,170
and I don't give
a good goddamn!

1313
01:36:56,244 --> 01:36:59,702
What we got here is a
case of accidental death.

1314
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:01,408
Case dismissed.

1315
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,916
Whoo!

1316
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:13,759
See you in church, Sister?

1317
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,893
Reverend.

1318
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:21,265
I can't believe he
actually swore on a Bible.

1319
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,270
Well, not really.

1320
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,329
If that judge
had looked closer,

1321
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:28,467
<i>he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.</i>

1322
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:34,915
But why did he do it? For the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again...

1323
01:37:34,983 --> 01:37:37,816
Which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1324
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:40,514
You didn't promise him,
did you? Yes, ma'am, I did.

1325
01:37:40,589 --> 01:37:42,523
And I never break my word.

1326
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:46,960
If I live 1,000 years,
I will never forgive you.

1327
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:51,193
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1328
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:05,305
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1329
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,507
Oh, yes, honey.

1330
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:12,247
You'll have me lookin' like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1331
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:16,553
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1332
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:21,291
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1333
01:38:21,363 --> 01:38:24,491
You've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1334
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:28,866
I'm just so happy Big George
and ldgie got off.

1335
01:38:28,937 --> 01:38:31,929
I would have killed Frank
Bennett if I could've.

1336
01:38:32,007 --> 01:38:34,532
Did anybody really
think she did it?

1337
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:37,238
Some said yes, some said no.

1338
01:38:37,312 --> 01:38:40,440
'Course the only one who really
knew was Frank Bennett.

1339
01:38:40,516 --> 01:38:45,920
And you know what they say.
Dead men tell no tales.

1340
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:48,886
<i>Towanda-a-a!</i>

1341
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:15,207
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1342
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:18,185
I need some light and air.

1343
01:39:18,253 --> 01:39:21,450
Why don't you take one of
your walks or your jog...

1344
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:25,050
Or whatever it is you do?

1345
01:39:25,127 --> 01:39:28,028
There's no dinner either!

1346
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:32,533
Ed, you have any idea why I've
been goin' to all these classes?

1347
01:39:32,601 --> 01:39:36,128
<i>No. I've been trying
to save our marriage.</i>

1348
01:39:36,205 --> 01:39:38,230
What's the point
of my tryin'...

1349
01:39:38,307 --> 01:39:42,971
If you're gonna sit on
your butt drinking beer...

1350
01:39:43,045 --> 01:39:45,878
And watching baseball,
basketball, football...

1351
01:39:45,948 --> 01:39:49,076
Bowling and hockey and golf...

1352
01:39:49,151 --> 01:39:53,019
<i>and Challenge
of the Gladiators?</i>

1353
01:39:58,727 --> 01:40:03,255
<i>Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,
Mrs. Otis'daughter-in-law.</i>

1354
01:40:03,332 --> 01:40:06,768
How are you? I've heard about
you from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1355
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:10,532
She is so sweet. She's been
lookin' after my mother-in-law.

1356
01:40:10,606 --> 01:40:13,370
Now, how is Mrs. Otis doin', by the way?

1357
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:17,902
Much better, thank you. It takes
time getting used to a strange place.

1358
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:22,007
I'm glad to hear it. Mrs.
Threadgoode's been anxious to get home.

1359
01:40:22,084 --> 01:40:26,283
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house anymore.

1360
01:40:26,356 --> 01:40:29,814
They tore that down. What?

1361
01:40:29,892 --> 01:40:34,124
They had to. It was falling
apart, and it was condemned.

1362
01:40:34,197 --> 01:40:37,132
Oh, no.

1363
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:41,398
<i>Does she know that? No, well, we
didn't see any point in telling her.</i>

1364
01:40:41,471 --> 01:40:43,962
<i>It would just break her heart,
poor old thing.</i>

1365
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:47,976
But I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1366
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:51,241
You take care of yourself now.
Bye-bye.

1367
01:42:01,217 --> 01:42:03,515
Oh, Evelyn, hey!

1368
01:42:03,586 --> 01:42:06,054
Hey.

1369
01:42:06,122 --> 01:42:08,488
Do you like my roses?

1370
01:42:08,558 --> 01:42:11,891
Since I can't get home
to look at my own roses...

1371
01:42:11,961 --> 01:42:14,327
I made myself a paper garden.

1372
01:42:14,397 --> 01:42:17,889
<i>Got everything but the
bugs. They're lovely.</i>

1373
01:42:17,967 --> 01:42:21,232
You been here long?
Happy birthday!

1374
01:42:21,304 --> 01:42:23,795
Oh! I shouldn't have woken you up.

1375
01:42:23,873 --> 01:42:28,139
'Course you should've. Don't you never let
me sleep through a visitor's day, honey.

1376
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:32,944
I look forward to them all
week. So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.

1377
01:42:33,015 --> 01:42:36,348
Oh! I can't
believe you remembered.

1378
01:42:36,419 --> 01:42:40,617
You made me
fried green tomatoes!

1379
01:42:43,059 --> 01:42:45,084
Mmm!
They're delicious.

1380
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:48,494
It's your recipe. Are they
cold? No. They're just the way...

1381
01:42:48,564 --> 01:42:52,830
We used to have 'em at
the Whistle Stop Cafe. Mmm!

1382
01:42:52,902 --> 01:42:56,838
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you was my own daughter.

1383
01:42:56,906 --> 01:42:59,067
Here's your napkin.

1384
01:42:59,142 --> 01:43:01,167
And wait-wait-wait.

1385
01:43:01,244 --> 01:43:03,804
Queen, queen.

1386
01:43:06,983 --> 01:43:11,113
You know, I don't feel 83.

1387
01:43:11,187 --> 01:43:15,317
It sorta slipped up on me.

1388
01:43:17,427 --> 01:43:20,863
I never expected
to live this long.

1389
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:26,527
'Course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1390
01:43:35,546 --> 01:43:39,175
Are you all right?

1391
01:43:39,249 --> 01:43:41,581
I was thinking about Ruth.

1392
01:43:41,652 --> 01:43:44,450
After the trial was over,

1393
01:43:44,521 --> 01:43:46,716
everything went back
to normal...

1394
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:50,556
<i>till that fall
when Ruth lost her appetite.</i>

1395
01:43:50,627 --> 01:43:53,187
<i>By the time Doc Hadley
looked at her,</i>

1396
01:43:53,263 --> 01:43:57,461
<i>he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.</i>

1397
01:43:57,534 --> 01:44:00,264
<i>Well, we moved her
to the Threadgoode house...</i>

1398
01:44:00,337 --> 01:44:05,172
<i>and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.</i>

1399
01:44:05,242 --> 01:44:09,736
<i>Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.</i>

1400
01:44:09,813 --> 01:44:11,940
<i>Hold on, baby. I'm right here.</i>

1401
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:16,679
<i>Idgie  just prayed for a miracle.</i>

1402
01:44:35,973 --> 01:44:39,431
Now, listen to me.

1403
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:42,035
Make sure he graduates.

1404
01:44:42,112 --> 01:44:46,310
And don't... let him
come to the funeral.

1405
01:44:46,383 --> 01:44:49,045
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1406
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:52,418
Would you quit talkin'
like that?

1407
01:44:52,489 --> 01:44:54,980
What funeral?

1408
01:44:55,058 --> 01:44:57,424
You're gonna be back on
your feet feelin' just fine...

1409
01:44:57,494 --> 01:45:00,156
<i>in just a few days.</i>

1410
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:03,131
<i>Just you wait.</i>

1411
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,328
Oh, what's the matter, son?

1412
01:45:12,175 --> 01:45:15,838
Well, let's go for a walk.

1413
01:45:16,547 --> 01:45:18,139
<i>Did you get into a fight?</i>

1414
01:45:18,215 --> 01:45:20,911
I got punched in the nose.

1415
01:45:20,984 --> 01:45:24,476
I can't play
like everyone else.

1416
01:45:24,555 --> 01:45:28,082
Did I ever tell you the
story about... the oysters?

1417
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:30,626
All the millions of'em
just lying around...

1418
01:45:30,694 --> 01:45:35,529
And God put sand in one of'em,
and it makes a pearl. Oh.

1419
01:45:37,301 --> 01:45:39,963
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1420
01:45:40,037 --> 01:45:42,130
How it never felt sorry
for itself...

1421
01:45:42,205 --> 01:45:45,834
And how I ought to be smarter than a
dumb dog and not feel sorry for myself.

1422
01:45:47,644 --> 01:45:50,977
You listen to everything
I say, don't you?

1423
01:45:51,048 --> 01:45:54,017
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1424
01:45:54,084 --> 01:45:55,779
Well,

1425
01:45:58,255 --> 01:46:01,247
you know about your mama.

1426
01:46:01,325 --> 01:46:03,816
She's sick.

1427
01:46:03,894 --> 01:46:05,919
Mm-hmm.

1428
01:46:07,464 --> 01:46:10,900
See, now is the time
for courage.

1429
01:46:10,968 --> 01:46:14,665
<i>I guess you already know
that there are...</i>

1430
01:46:14,738 --> 01:46:17,730
angels masqueradin' as people
walkin' around this planet,

1431
01:46:17,808 --> 01:46:20,971
and your mom's
the bravest one of those.

1432
01:46:25,248 --> 01:46:27,341
Come here.

1433
01:46:35,059 --> 01:46:37,459
Mama, I can hit!
You should see me.

1434
01:46:37,528 --> 01:46:40,326
Idgie , she hit me in
the back with a curveball.

1435
01:46:40,398 --> 01:46:42,559
I didn't duck,
and I hardly cried.

1436
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:46,092
She hit you?

1437
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:50,163
Well, she did that
to me once too,

1438
01:46:50,241 --> 01:46:53,005
but I think I did cry.

1439
01:46:54,912 --> 01:46:58,871
<i>Mama, I'm sorry
if you're sad.</i>

1440
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:01,248
Well,

1441
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:04,413
give me a big kiss then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1442
01:47:11,963 --> 01:47:14,864
And you best not be sad
neither.

1443
01:47:14,932 --> 01:47:18,163
You understand?

1444
01:47:18,236 --> 01:47:20,170
You promise?

1445
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:22,263
Promise.

1446
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:26,276
Attaboy.
You go and wash up.

1447
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:52,126
Sweet baby.

1448
01:47:56,107 --> 01:47:59,372
You two be alone now.

1449
01:48:00,078 --> 01:48:03,741
Hey, girl.

1450
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,309
No.

1451
01:48:10,254 --> 01:48:13,314
That's nice.

1452
01:48:14,325 --> 01:48:18,022
Will you do one thing for me?

1453
01:48:18,096 --> 01:48:21,691
Yeah, anything.
Be good to yourself.

1454
01:48:21,766 --> 01:48:24,701
Even...

1455
01:48:24,769 --> 01:48:27,294
Settle down if
you can find someone...

1456
01:48:27,371 --> 01:48:30,101
Who can beat you in poker.

1457
01:48:37,815 --> 01:48:42,775
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

1458
01:48:42,854 --> 01:48:45,379
No.

1459
01:48:46,224 --> 01:48:48,886
I love your stories.

1460
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,895
Tell me a story, ldgie.

1461
01:48:54,766 --> 01:48:58,600
Oh, God.

1462
01:48:58,669 --> 01:49:01,763
<i>Go on,
you old bee charmer.</i>

1463
01:49:01,839 --> 01:49:05,502
<i>Tell me
a good tall tale.</i>

1464
01:49:06,911 --> 01:49:10,608
Tell me the one about the lake.

1465
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:16,546
What lake? The one...
that used to be here.

1466
01:49:18,689 --> 01:49:20,623
Oh.

1467
01:49:22,693 --> 01:49:26,254
Well, that was just a lie.

1468
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:29,094
I know that, fool.

1469
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:31,226
Tell me anyway.

1470
01:49:31,302 --> 01:49:34,703
Tell me the story.

1471
01:49:36,274 --> 01:49:39,710
Well...

1472
01:49:41,747 --> 01:49:44,215
One time...

1473
01:49:44,283 --> 01:49:47,081
There was this lake.

1474
01:49:51,523 --> 01:49:55,892
And, uh, it was
right outside of town.

1475
01:49:55,961 --> 01:50:01,399
We used to go fishin' and
swimmin' and canoein' in it.

1476
01:50:01,466 --> 01:50:04,697
And see, one November...

1477
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:07,068
This big flock of ducks...

1478
01:50:07,139 --> 01:50:12,167
Came in and landed
on that lake and, uh,

1479
01:50:12,244 --> 01:50:17,079
and then the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

1480
01:50:17,149 --> 01:50:19,413
And the, uh,

1481
01:50:19,484 --> 01:50:23,250
the ducks, they...

1482
01:50:23,322 --> 01:50:27,486
Flew off, you see,
and took that lake with 'em.

1483
01:50:27,559 --> 01:50:30,790
And, uh,

1484
01:50:30,863 --> 01:50:35,857
now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1485
01:50:35,934 --> 01:50:38,994
Can you imagine?

1486
01:51:36,695 --> 01:51:39,960
It's all right, honey.

1487
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:46,001
Let her go.

1488
01:51:46,071 --> 01:51:50,303
You know, Miss Ruth was a lady.

1489
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:53,640
And a lady always knows...

1490
01:51:53,712 --> 01:51:56,704
When to leave.

1491
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:06,316
<i>When I think on
our departed sister, Ruth Jamison,</i>

1492
01:52:06,391 --> 01:52:09,485
<i>I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...</i>

1493
01:52:09,561 --> 01:52:12,029
<i>and how his teachings...</i>

1494
01:52:12,097 --> 01:52:16,534
<i>It's funny how
strong Ruth affected everyone,</i>

1495
01:52:16,601 --> 01:52:20,002
<i>even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

1496
01:52:20,072 --> 01:52:22,734
<i>When he died
a few years back...</i>

1497
01:52:22,808 --> 01:52:25,504
<i>he had one possession
on him,</i>

1498
01:52:25,577 --> 01:52:28,171
<i>a picture of Ruth.</i>

1499
01:52:29,548 --> 01:52:33,644
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

1500
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:36,586
<i>We all were.</i>

1501
01:52:42,561 --> 01:52:45,029
I shouldn't
a-told you this.

1502
01:52:46,966 --> 01:52:50,925
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1503
01:52:51,004 --> 01:52:53,529
Death is nothin'
to be afraid of!

1504
01:52:53,606 --> 01:52:56,666
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'-off place,

1505
01:52:56,743 --> 01:52:59,974
<i>and I ain't afraid
one bit.</i>

1506
01:53:00,046 --> 01:53:03,743
Oh, Ninny, you're so brave.

1507
01:53:05,318 --> 01:53:09,254
Ruth and ldgie were brave,
not me.

1508
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:12,689
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1509
01:53:12,759 --> 01:53:17,696
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1510
01:53:19,966 --> 01:53:24,903
Oh-oh-oh

1511
01:53:24,971 --> 01:53:27,804
Just listen to that rain

1512
01:53:27,874 --> 01:53:30,342
A-rainin' in the north

1513
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:32,002
A-rainin' in the south

1514
01:53:32,078 --> 01:53:35,377
A-rainin' in the east

1515
01:53:35,448 --> 01:53:37,609
A-rainin' in the west

1516
01:53:37,683 --> 01:53:40,083
Ooh-ooh

1517
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:43,680
Tell me didn't it rain children

1518
01:53:43,756 --> 01:53:45,690
<i>Rain all night long</i>

1519
01:53:45,758 --> 01:53:47,919
<i>Didn't it
you know it did</i>

1520
01:53:47,994 --> 01:53:52,260
<i>I said, o my good Lord
didn't it rain</i>

1521
01:53:52,331 --> 01:53:55,767
Hey, it rained 40 days and
40 nights without stoppin'

1522
01:53:55,835 --> 01:53:58,235
Noah got worried
and the rain kept a-droppin'

1523
01:53:58,304 --> 01:54:00,704
He sent out a raven
Sent out a dove

1524
01:54:00,773 --> 01:54:03,071
The water, good God
came down from above

1525
01:54:03,142 --> 01:54:05,406
<i>They tell me my God
went and sent the rain</i>

1526
01:54:05,478 --> 01:54:07,912
The women and the children
did begin to scream

1527
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:10,039
They knocked on the windows
and they batted at the doors

1528
01:54:10,116 --> 01:54:13,017
While they... Hoo, hoo
Take on more

1529
01:54:13,086 --> 01:54:15,350
<i>Noah said
No, no, my friend</i>

1530
01:54:15,421 --> 01:54:17,548
<i>God said
I can't let you in</i>

1531
01:54:17,623 --> 01:54:20,251
Hoo, hoo

1532
01:54:20,326 --> 01:54:22,760
Listen to the rain

1533
01:54:22,829 --> 01:54:27,562
Uh-oh
Just listen to the rain

1534
01:54:27,633 --> 01:54:29,931
Listen to the rain

1535
01:54:30,002 --> 01:54:32,027
Just listen to the rain Oh, oh

1536
01:54:32,105 --> 01:54:35,074
Listen, a-listen to the rain
Oh, oh, listen

1537
01:54:35,141 --> 01:54:37,507
Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen

1538
01:54:37,577 --> 01:54:40,011
Listen to the rain
Uh-oh, listen

1539
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:42,570
<i>Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen</i>

1540
01:54:42,648 --> 01:54:47,108
<i>Last chance
Listen to the rain now</i>

1541
01:54:47,186 --> 01:54:49,780
<i>And then drip, drop
drip, drop</i>

1542
01:54:49,856 --> 01:54:53,986
Drip, drop drip,
drip, a-drop drip, drop

1543
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:57,094
<i>Yeah, drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1544
01:54:57,163 --> 01:54:59,324
<i>Now, drip, drop</i>

1545
01:54:59,398 --> 01:55:03,198
<i>Drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1546
01:55:12,912 --> 01:55:15,904
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1547
01:55:15,982 --> 01:55:18,007
Ah...

1548
01:55:18,084 --> 01:55:21,542
Ed, how sweet!

1549
01:55:21,621 --> 01:55:24,055
Lilies! My favorite. Yeah.

1550
01:55:24,123 --> 01:55:27,251
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1551
01:55:27,326 --> 01:55:31,422
What's the occasion?
Oh, honey, I just...

1552
01:55:31,497 --> 01:55:34,466
Feel sorry about
the past few months.

1553
01:55:34,534 --> 01:55:38,527
I don't know what you're really
up to and what's going on with you,

1554
01:55:38,604 --> 01:55:43,007
but I guess I could've been more helpful
with your job and everything, you know.

1555
01:55:44,243 --> 01:55:46,108
Well, why are you...

1556
01:55:46,179 --> 01:55:49,148
Puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1557
01:55:49,215 --> 01:55:52,343
Well...
I changed my mind.

1558
01:55:52,418 --> 01:55:55,183
I don't mean to seem
dense or anything,

1559
01:55:55,255 --> 01:55:59,487
but what's changed?
The air and the light.

1560
01:56:01,862 --> 01:56:04,456
Ed...
Hmm?

1561
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:06,999
You remember how
you used to tell me...

1562
01:56:07,067 --> 01:56:09,797
You always wanted
two women in your house?

1563
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:12,168
Oh, God.

1564
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,900
Yeah.

1565
01:56:13,974 --> 01:56:15,999
Well...

1566
01:56:16,076 --> 01:56:19,011
What if I was
the younger of the two?

1567
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:22,606
I don't believe
I get your drift.

1568
01:56:22,683 --> 01:56:27,211
I want something more than I've
ever wanted anything before.

1569
01:56:27,287 --> 01:56:30,051
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1570
01:56:30,123 --> 01:56:32,318
To our home.

1571
01:56:32,392 --> 01:56:35,020
I want her
to live here with us.

1572
01:56:35,095 --> 01:56:37,586
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

1573
01:56:37,664 --> 01:56:41,828
You're kiddin' me,
aren't you? I'm absolutely serious.

1574
01:56:41,902 --> 01:56:46,737
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1575
01:56:46,807 --> 01:56:49,867
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1576
01:56:49,943 --> 01:56:52,605
I mean, she's an old woman.

1577
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:55,910
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1578
01:56:55,983 --> 01:56:57,678
I will!

1579
01:56:57,751 --> 01:56:59,742
I can't leave her
in that place.

1580
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:03,722
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1581
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:06,850
She's family to me.
Now, Evelyn.

1582
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:10,754
<i>Evelyn?</i>

1583
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:12,696
<i>Honey?</i>

1584
01:57:12,766 --> 01:57:14,757
<i>Ah, look...</i>

1585
01:57:14,835 --> 01:57:19,067
have you mentioned this
harebrained idea to her?

1586
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:22,199
Not yet.
Well, good!

1587
01:57:22,276 --> 01:57:24,744
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

1588
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:27,837
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1589
01:57:27,914 --> 01:57:31,475
You don't have to do a thing.

1590
01:57:31,551 --> 01:57:34,042
Evelyn...

1591
01:57:34,121 --> 01:57:36,589
It's never gonna happen.

1592
01:57:36,657 --> 01:57:39,319
So just forget about it.

1593
01:57:40,927 --> 01:57:43,691
Don't you ever
say "never" to me.

1594
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:55,437
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1595
01:57:55,509 --> 01:57:58,103
and I didn't like
what I saw one bit.

1596
01:57:58,178 --> 01:58:02,012
You know what I did?
I changed.

1597
01:58:02,082 --> 01:58:05,984
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1598
01:58:06,053 --> 01:58:10,547
She needs my love and care,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

1599
01:58:12,326 --> 01:58:15,955
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

1600
01:58:20,901 --> 01:58:23,927
And if you won't listen
to reason...

1601
01:58:24,004 --> 01:58:27,633
There's always Towanda.

1602
01:58:42,422 --> 01:58:45,391
Hey, Nin...

1603
01:58:48,061 --> 01:58:51,087
What are you doing?

1604
01:58:51,164 --> 01:58:53,894
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1605
01:58:53,967 --> 01:58:57,061
What are you doing in here?
Where's Mrs. Threadgoode? Who?

1606
01:58:57,137 --> 01:58:59,971
Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman
who lives here. Are you deaf?

1607
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:02,942
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1608
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:07,208
Was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1609
01:59:09,083 --> 01:59:11,210
Oh, my God!

1610
01:59:11,285 --> 01:59:15,619
Wha... What
are you sayin'?

1611
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:17,851
<i>She died early
this morning.</i>

1612
01:59:17,925 --> 01:59:22,259
<i>They were shorthanded so they asked
me to take all this stuff down.</i>

1613
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:24,821
<i>That's all I know.</i>

1614
01:59:44,218 --> 01:59:46,152
Stop that!

1615
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,586
What is the matter
with you people?

1616
01:59:48,656 --> 01:59:51,591
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Chrissake?

1617
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:54,651
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1618
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:58,893
I'm sorry, but they told me to get
this room ready for another patient.

1619
01:59:58,966 --> 02:00:02,163
She may be just
another patient to you,

1620
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:06,332
but she was my friend,
and I loved her. I'm sorry.

1621
02:00:06,407 --> 02:00:08,341
I'm just following orders.

1622
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:11,344
What is going on? Why
didn't you call me?

1623
02:00:11,412 --> 02:00:14,745
You could've called me before
you sent that idiot... I'm sorry.

1624
02:00:14,816 --> 02:00:17,478
It never occurred to me that
you would take it this hard.

1625
02:00:17,552 --> 02:00:21,181
I didn't even get to tell
her good-bye. Oh, I know.

1626
02:00:21,255 --> 02:00:25,214
These things are difficult, but
she died peacefully in her sleep.

1627
02:00:25,293 --> 02:00:28,558
To tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1628
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:31,655
Happy? Why, yes! This
is what she wanted.

1629
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:33,666
What?
To be dead?

1630
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:36,259
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1631
02:00:36,337 --> 02:00:38,771
She left in a yellow cab
about a half hour ago.

1632
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,536
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1633
02:00:41,609 --> 02:00:45,875
She said there wasn't no reason for
her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.

1634
02:00:45,947 --> 02:00:48,575
Mrs...

1635
02:00:48,649 --> 02:00:50,810
Otis is dead?

1636
02:00:50,885 --> 02:00:54,753
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1637
02:00:54,822 --> 02:00:56,813
Mrs. Otis died!

1638
02:00:56,891 --> 02:01:00,088
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1639
02:01:00,161 --> 02:01:04,188
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just...

1640
02:01:04,265 --> 02:01:06,893
Oh, God, I've gotta stop her.

1641
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,571
Hey, Evelyn,
somebody stole my house.

1642
02:01:49,644 --> 02:01:52,545
It was right here when I left.

1643
02:01:52,613 --> 02:01:57,380
Unless... Oh, Evelyn, you
don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

1644
02:01:57,451 --> 02:02:01,649
It was here when I left.
No, honey, you're not crazy.

1645
02:02:01,722 --> 02:02:04,486
This is the place.

1646
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,587
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1647
02:02:08,664 --> 02:02:10,791
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1648
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:14,267
Oh, honey, nobody stole it.

1649
02:02:14,336 --> 02:02:18,204
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1650
02:02:18,273 --> 02:02:20,400
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1651
02:02:20,475 --> 02:02:23,740
Well, somebody shoulda told me.

1652
02:02:23,812 --> 02:02:28,647
I'm old. I'm not a child. I'm sorry.

1653
02:02:28,717 --> 02:02:32,050
My husband Cleo and I
lived in this house...

1654
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:34,611
For more than 40 years.

1655
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:38,091
Now, it's... it's gone.

1656
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:41,721
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1657
02:02:41,797 --> 02:02:45,824
Is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1658
02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:48,369
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1659
02:02:48,437 --> 02:02:50,564
This is my home!

1660
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,630
And now it's gone.

1661
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:55,233
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1662
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:57,403
I...

1663
02:02:57,479 --> 02:03:00,073
I don't quite know what to do.

1664
02:03:00,148 --> 02:03:03,982
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

1665
02:03:04,052 --> 02:03:06,418
You can come
look after me and Ed.

1666
02:03:06,488 --> 02:03:08,786
Oh, you're sweet,

1667
02:03:08,857 --> 02:03:11,655
but I think you're doin'
just fine on your own.

1668
02:03:11,727 --> 02:03:16,027
Don't you know you'd be
like a gift for us?

1669
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:19,261
You're the reason
I get up every morning...

1670
02:03:19,334 --> 02:03:22,667
And that Mary Kay's
havin' such a good year...

1671
02:03:22,738 --> 02:03:27,300
And I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1672
02:03:27,376 --> 02:03:31,403
Well, with a little help
from ldgie and Ruth.

1673
02:03:32,981 --> 02:03:35,506
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1674
02:03:35,584 --> 02:03:37,984
What does Ed say
about all this?

1675
02:03:38,053 --> 02:03:41,887
He'll learn to love it.

1676
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,490
Did I ever tell you that Mrs.
Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

1677
02:03:49,564 --> 02:03:52,226
No, ma'am.
Yes, she was.

1678
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,168
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey
and me the night Sipsey died.

1679
02:03:56,238 --> 02:04:01,403
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

1680
02:04:01,476 --> 02:04:04,604
<i>A story about
what really happened...</i>

1681
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,013
<i>the night Frank Bennett
disappeared.</i>

1682
02:04:40,582 --> 02:04:44,109
Hey there! You got to come quick.

1683
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:49,146
The show has hardly begun. You
got to come quick. You hear me?

1684
02:04:55,063 --> 02:04:57,657
Run, get help! Run,
quick! Where's the baby?

1685
02:04:57,733 --> 02:04:59,530
Never mind.

1686
02:05:18,254 --> 02:05:19,915
Excuse me, sir.

1687
02:05:19,989 --> 02:05:25,484
I don't believe you should be
goin' anywhere with Ruth's baby.

1688
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:39,870
Like I said,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

1689
02:05:39,942 --> 02:05:42,502
Damn, you a thickheaded
son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?

1690
02:05:46,716 --> 02:05:48,684
<i>I told you...</i>

1691
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:53,188
you ain't goin' nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

1692
02:05:58,828 --> 02:06:01,023
Come on, angel.
Come on.

1693
02:06:01,097 --> 02:06:04,931
Come on, sweetheart.
It's all right.

1694
02:06:05,001 --> 02:06:07,492
Come on.
It's all right, baby.

1695
02:06:10,406 --> 02:06:13,136
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

1696
02:06:13,209 --> 02:06:18,044
I don't know why any white
jury would care why I did it.

1697
02:06:18,114 --> 02:06:20,912
Well, I saw it, and I can
testify. Excuse me here.

1698
02:06:20,983 --> 02:06:23,144
I don't mean no offense here,

1699
02:06:23,219 --> 02:06:26,279
but I don't know who's less
likely to convince a jury,

1700
02:06:26,355 --> 02:06:28,619
my mama...
or Mr. Smokey.

1701
02:06:28,691 --> 02:06:31,489
No offense taken.

1702
02:06:31,561 --> 02:06:33,961
You're a good man,
Mr. Smokey.

1703
02:06:34,030 --> 02:06:38,057
You did good.
The sun's almost up.

1704
02:06:41,604 --> 02:06:44,971
George?
Mm-hmm?

1705
02:06:45,041 --> 02:06:47,805
I think...

1706
02:06:47,877 --> 02:06:51,404
It's hog-boiling time.

1707
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,744
No, ma'am. It
ain't cold enough.

1708
02:06:53,816 --> 02:06:56,580
It's hog-boiling time.

1709
02:06:59,522 --> 02:07:01,456
<i>Big George?</i>

1710
02:07:01,524 --> 02:07:04,618
Uh-huh? When is that
barbecue gonna be ready?

1711
02:07:04,694 --> 02:07:07,026
It's gonna be ready
any time now.

1712
02:07:07,096 --> 02:07:11,999
Smells so damn good I just
can't wait to get me some.

1713
02:07:12,068 --> 02:07:16,368
Now, don't you forget to call
me when that's ready. All right.

1714
02:07:30,119 --> 02:07:32,383
Here you go.

1715
02:07:33,956 --> 02:07:37,585
Miss ldgie? Smokey left town. Yeah?

1716
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:41,653
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

1717
02:07:41,731 --> 02:07:45,690
He asked that
you tell Ruth good-bye.

1718
02:07:45,768 --> 02:07:48,236
Shame he had to go.

1719
02:07:55,211 --> 02:08:00,114
<i>Hold on! I'm comin'.</i>

1720
02:08:04,987 --> 02:08:07,751
What you want?
We want some barbecue.

1721
02:08:07,823 --> 02:08:11,520
Not today you don't.
Go on.

1722
02:08:24,574 --> 02:08:27,702
Why, this is about the
best barbecue I ever ate!

1723
02:08:29,212 --> 02:08:32,704
The secret's in the sauce.

1724
02:08:41,491 --> 02:08:45,359
Sipsey?
My God!

1725
02:08:45,429 --> 02:08:49,763
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1726
02:08:51,535 --> 02:08:55,995
Did ldgie really barbecue Frank
Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?

1727
02:08:56,073 --> 02:08:59,770
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

1728
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,114
Now you know why
ldgie had to go on trial.

1729
02:09:07,184 --> 02:09:10,813
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1730
02:09:10,887 --> 02:09:13,378
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of color...

1731
02:09:13,457 --> 02:09:16,915
Would've been hangin'
from the nearest tree.

1732
02:09:16,994 --> 02:09:19,258
To this day,
I'm still not sure...

1733
02:09:19,329 --> 02:09:21,889
Whether Ruth ever believed...

1734
02:09:21,965 --> 02:09:26,095
That ldgie didn't kill
Frank Bennett.

1735
02:09:26,169 --> 02:09:30,401
Truth's a funny thing
sometimes.

1736
02:09:30,474 --> 02:09:34,433
I feel better now.
Good.

1737
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:37,810
I feel better 'cause
all these people'll live...

1738
02:09:37,881 --> 02:09:40,941
As long as you remember 'em.

1739
02:09:41,018 --> 02:09:42,952
You reminded me...

1740
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,421
About what the most
important thing in life is.

1741
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:48,822
Do you know what I
think it is? No, ma'am.

1742
02:09:48,892 --> 02:09:52,157
Friends.
Best friends.

1743
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:55,255
Oh, Ninny!

1744
02:09:56,433 --> 02:09:58,162
Look.

1745
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,271
Oh!

1746
02:10:24,494 --> 02:10:26,428
Idgie ?

1747
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:33,768
<i>Idgie 's alive?
Oh, yes!</i>

1748
02:10:33,837 --> 02:10:38,103
She's still out and about
charmin' bees and selling honey.

1749
02:10:38,175 --> 02:10:42,134
Sometimes I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

1750
02:10:48,051 --> 02:10:50,485
Maybe we'll see her today.

1751
02:10:50,554 --> 02:10:53,182
Maybe.

1752
02:10:54,858 --> 02:10:57,554
Let's go.

1753
02:11:09,072 --> 02:11:13,372
<i>After Ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin',</i>

1754
02:11:13,443 --> 02:11:17,436
<i>the cafe shut down, and everybody
Just scattered to the winds.</i>

1755
02:11:18,782 --> 02:11:22,149
<i>It was never more than just
a little knockabout place.</i>

1756
02:11:22,219 --> 02:11:25,018
<i>But now that
I look back on it,</i>

1757
02:11:25,089 --> 02:11:27,353
<i>when that cafe closed...</i>

1758
02:11:27,425 --> 02:11:31,521
<i>the heart of the town
Just stopped beating.</i>

1759
02:11:31,596 --> 02:11:34,429
<i>It's funny how
a little place like this...</i>

1760
02:11:34,499 --> 02:11:38,333
<i>brought so
many people together.</i>

1761
02:12:33,524 --> 02:12:36,425
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1762
02:12:39,063 --> 02:12:43,261
<i>When I've forgotten
all the rest</i>

1763
02:12:45,937 --> 02:12:49,737
<i>You to me were true</i>

1764
02:12:52,009 --> 02:12:55,570
<i>You to me were the best</i>

1765
02:12:56,881 --> 02:13:00,180
<i>When there is no more</i>

1766
02:13:00,251 --> 02:13:03,049
<i>You cut to the core</i>

1767
02:13:04,488 --> 02:13:09,516
<i>Quicker than anyone
that I knew</i>

1768
02:13:09,594 --> 02:13:13,724
<i>Now when the roses fade</i>

1769
02:13:13,798 --> 02:13:17,734
<i>I'm in the shade baby</i>

1770
02:13:17,802 --> 02:13:21,169
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1771
02:13:21,239 --> 02:13:25,232
<i>Now listen didn't I</i>

1772
02:13:25,309 --> 02:13:29,336
<i>Didn't I love you</i>

1773
02:13:29,413 --> 02:13:35,784
<i>Didn't I didn't I care</i>

1774
02:13:35,853 --> 02:13:41,814
<i>Didn't I sleep
and didn't I weep beside you</i>

1775
02:13:41,892 --> 02:13:47,228
<i>With the rain that
was blowing in your hair</i>

1776
02:13:47,298 --> 02:13:49,357
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1777
02:13:50,468 --> 02:13:53,403
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1778
02:13:54,672 --> 02:13:56,902
<i>When the wind blows</i>

1779
02:13:56,974 --> 02:14:01,070
<i>On through
the piney wood</i>

1780
02:14:02,513 --> 02:14:08,918
<i>It was you who came
right through for me, baby</i>

1781
02:14:08,986 --> 02:14:12,615
<i>It was you
who understood</i>

1782
02:14:13,758 --> 02:14:16,989
<i>Though I'd never say</i>

1783
02:14:17,061 --> 02:14:21,930
<i>That I turned the way</i>

1784
02:14:21,999 --> 02:14:26,561
<i>That you have led me to</i>

1785
02:14:26,637 --> 02:14:30,574
<i>Darling, in the end</i>

1786
02:14:30,642 --> 02:14:34,772
<i>My dear sweet friend</i>

1787
02:14:34,846 --> 02:14:38,145
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1788
02:14:38,216 --> 02:14:41,811
<i>Yes, I will now</i>

1789
02:14:41,887 --> 02:14:44,481
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1790
02:14:44,556 --> 02:14:46,854
<i>Yes, I will now</i>

1791
02:14:49,161 --> 02:14:52,562
<i>I'll remember, remember</i>

1792
02:14:52,631 --> 02:14:54,963
<i>I'll remember</i>

1793
02:14:55,033 --> 02:14:58,298
<i>I will remember you
Yes, I will</i>

1794
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:09,912
<i>Time ain't gonna
change nothin', baby</i>

1795
02:15:09,981 --> 02:15:13,212
<i>We can be halfway across
the world from each other</i>

1796
02:15:13,285 --> 02:15:16,516
<i>Don't make no difference</i>

1797
02:15:16,588 --> 02:15:22,919
<i>I'll remember</i>

1798
02:15:22,994 --> 02:15:26,088
<i>Every hour, every second</i>

1799
02:15:26,164 --> 02:15:29,998
<i>Every moment that we had</i>

1800
02:15:30,068 --> 02:15:33,162
<i>We do it, we do it</i>

1801
02:15:33,238 --> 02:15:36,332
<i>We do it don't do it</i>

1802
02:15:36,408 --> 02:15:41,436
<i>Gonna do it, do it
do it, do it, do it</i>

1803
02:15:42,781 --> 02:15:45,978
<i>I'll remember,
I'll remember</i>

1804
02:15:46,051 --> 02:15:49,248
<i>Oh, I'll remember you</i>

1805
02:15:49,321 --> 02:15:54,452
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1806
02:15:58,864 --> 02:16:01,424
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1807
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,764
<i>Yes, I will</i>
