1
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:25,040
Dad, I made
this flower for you.

2
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,610
Oh, thank you.
Exactly what I needed.

3
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,012
Hey, don't think about eating
that cake yet, Clio, please.

4
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,482
- Oh, please! -Thank you.
Have you seen your mother?

5
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,116
No!

6
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,992
Whoa, there, slugger. Watch
out, don't concuss anyone.

7
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:48,164
There you go. Could someone super...
Adult supervise them?

8
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,867
Hey, Meanne. Have you
seen Charlie anywhere?

9
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:54,303
I don't see anything.

10
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,077
The party's outside.

11
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,914
That's not your cape.
I know your parents.

12
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,284
I just, I... I don't think
I want to have kids with you.

13
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:13,555
And it's not your fault, it's not
anything you've done, it's just that...

14
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:16,791
Hey, have you guys
seen Charlie?

15
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:18,660
Who's Charlie?

16
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:22,097
Have a great party.

17
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,305
Charlie?

18
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,974
Oh, wait. Wait...

19
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,648
It's not
what you think.

20
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,783
I think you've been having sex.

21
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,386
Okay... It is what you think.

22
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,589
But you pushed me into this.

23
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,925
I was just looking
for the matches.

24
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,960
- I think I better go.
- No, stay.

25
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,563
- I want you to be here.
- I'd really like to go.

26
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:58,132
- Yeah, why don't you go?
- He's not going anywhere.

27
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,535
Okay, well, could he
at least put on a shirt?

28
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,104
This isn't about him!

29
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,072
No, I know,
it's about us but...

30
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:07,908
I would feel more comfortable
if he had a shirt on.

31
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,278
Fine. Sure...

32
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,713
There. Is that better?

33
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,316
No, of course not,
that's much worse.

34
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,750
I don't care!

35
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,252
Stop looking!

36
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,387
What happened?
I thought we were happy.

37
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,287
You thought we were happy?

38
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,756
Well, happiness is not really
a sustainable condition...

39
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,893
- Right. See what I mean?
- Just take it easy.

40
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,263
I'm sure it's really hard for him
to process all of this so suddenly.

41
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:31,764
- Shut up!
- Hey, man, I'm...

42
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:35,835
I know that you're upset, but I'm
just, I'm trying to help here.

43
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,369
I'm gonna fight you.

44
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,237
Please don't. Don't do that.

45
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,272
There are children
downstairs...

46
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,575
Whoa! Oh, my God!

47
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,042
No, no.

48
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,344
Careful! Will...

49
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,611
Ah... Easy...

50
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,912
Stop holding me!

51
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:51,782
- Get your arms off my arms.
-  Calm down, calm down.

52
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,450
The kids are ready to go.

53
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,651
- Take it easy!
- Never mind.

54
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:55,719
Let me go.
I'm gonna punch you!

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,887
I'm not gonna do that
until you calm down.

56
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,156
Forget it, Will. It's over.

57
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:02,558
Ow!

58
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,196
- What's over?
- Us.

59
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,566
Us? What, just like that?

60
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,668
It didn't happen
just like that.

61
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,036
We have kids.

62
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,737
Don't drag them into this.

63
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,072
What do you mean,
"Don't drag them into this?"

64
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,207
They're having
a birthday party downstairs.

65
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,844
It takes a lot of courage
to try and change your life.

66
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:25,578
Oh, yeah...

67
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,681
Well, I admire your bravery.

68
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,817
Don't be bitter, Will.
It doesn't suit you.

69
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,118
Don't be bitter?

70
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,654
How should I be?

71
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:39,492
I love you.

72
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,995
Then what's the problem?

73
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,563
The problem is...

74
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,865
I don't love my life.

75
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:53,371
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

76
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:59,445
- I'm sorry, too. Yeah.
- Are you?

Let's blow it out. -Me...

84
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:37,148
Okay, here's a tiny, tiny bit for you.

85
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,185
I can't believe you guys
are six years old.

86
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,520
It's like it was yesterday
you were five.

87
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,221
It was yesterday, Dad.

88
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,957
You know what I mean.

89
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,625
Uh, who wants presents?

90
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:48,892
Me!

91
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,194
Okay.

92
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,043
I got you iPads.

93
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,879
They're not iPads.

94
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,823
Oh, hey!
Hey, Charlie, how are you?

95
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,158
<i>- Yeah, we're at the park.
-  How's the girls?</i>

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,195
<i>- Oh, yeah, I made them some kites.
- Oh, okay.</i>

97
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:28,031
Yeah, I made them myself. No...

98
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:31,635
No, you know...
No, myself, I made them.

99
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,171
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, they're flying.</i>

100
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,940
Well, they're, they're
kind of flying. Yeah.

101
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,043
Hey, uh, I hope you don't
mind, the girls asked,

102
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,412
if they could stay
a little bit longer.

103
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,379
<i>Okay.</i>

104
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,482
<i>- Great. Are you sure you don't mind?
- Yeah.</i>

105
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,485
Okay, yeah I'll have them
back before bed, yeah.

106
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,354
<i>I don't want them eating pizza.</i>

107
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,956
Okay, thanks a lot.

108
00:08:55,627 --> 00:09:00,063
Hey, girls, your mom asked if I could
keep you guys busy a little longer.

109
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,464
Sound okay?

110
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:02,799
Yeah?

111
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,367
Ah.

112
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:25,086
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Gary.

113
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:26,588
Girls...

114
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,158
Hey, Gary.

115
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,726
Uh... I'll get Charlie.

116
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,095
Um, Charlie!

117
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:35,731
- You can go in...
- Hi, girls!

118
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:39,067
Oh, hi! Happy birthday!

119
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,304
Oh my God, those are so cool.
Go show Gary your kites!

120
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,705
Those are awesome.

121
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,374
Have a great week, girls!

122
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,409
Does he have to
answer the door?

123
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,712
He thought you were
the Thai food.

124
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,613
Not surprising.

125
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,815
Um, can I talk to you?

126
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:58,485
- Sure.
- Uh, not now. Tomorrow?

127
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:01,754
Noon, Ted and Honey.
I'll buy you a cookie.

128
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,255
Are you okay?

129
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:07,626
Yeah, noon... Noon's fine.

130
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,495
Good night, girls, I love you!

131
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:12,397
Bye, Dad, love you too!

132
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:08,761
Hey. You're lonely.

133
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:19,673
Sorry I'm late.

134
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,809
I promised you a cookie.
I promised. -I'm fine.

135
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,944
- It's okay.
- I promised.

136
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,426
- Oatmeal chocolate chip.
- No, I said I was fine.

137
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:40,394
- It's your favorite.
- I'm not...

138
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,595
- Take a bite. -I'm trying
to give up sugar...

139
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:46,167
- It's your favorite. You should
take a bite. -Thank you.

140
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,135
How's work?

141
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:50,303
Teaching? It's good.

142
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,573
Gives me an excuse
to put off the book.

143
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,975
- You should be doing both.
- I know.

144
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:58,145
I've been getting over
a big break-up.

145
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,783
I'm well. Thanks for asking.

146
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:04,751
Oh, how are you?

147
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,454
I'm taking improv classes.

148
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:11,158
- Oh, that's funny.
- Why is that funny?

149
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,057
No, I just mean...

150
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,260
Is it supposed to funny?
Improv?

151
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:15,361
I don't know much about it.

152
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:18,063
There's a lot more to it
than just being funny.

153
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:19,365
Oh.

154
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,368
Gary thinks I have
a lot of unexplored talent.

155
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,936
Does he?

156
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:25,838
I'm sure you do then.

157
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:31,143
- Gary wants to get married.
- What?

158
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:33,344
I know, it's crazy, I...

159
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:35,547
I still don't know
how I feel about it.

160
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,681
What did you tell him?

161
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,617
I don't know,
I'm still thinking about it.

162
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:44,522
I thought you never
wanted to get married.

163
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:45,090
I know.

164
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,591
You said it was the surest
way to ruin a relationship.

165
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:50,996
Well, not getting married
doesn't seem to work either.

166
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,263
Are you kidding me?

167
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:55,532
Look, I know this is sudden

168
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:58,669
but if I'm going to do this,
I'd really like your support.

169
00:12:58,671 --> 00:12:59,903
I thought you were still
thinking about it.

170
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,272
I am. I am still thinking
about it.

171
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:06,510
You're thinking right now
about it, as we speak?

172
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:08,778
I'm pregnant.

173
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,949
Oh. Oh, wow.

174
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:16,284
Is it his?

175
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,320
- Of course it's his!
- Just asking.

176
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:24,059
Look, I just want to know there's going to
be someone there when I'm old and gross.

177
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:26,995
I was going to be there.

178
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,097
Don't.

179
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,535
- I think I should go.
- Why?

180
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:36,870
I don't know.

181
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,639
Just feels like what
I should do right now.

182
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:41,607
- Will?
- Yeah?

183
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,143
Take the cookie.

184
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,547
Okay, great.

185
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:07,200
"Why does life suck..."
Double underline... "So hard?"

186
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,367
Any thoughts?

187
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,104
Because people are selfish
and petty.

188
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:13,573
I love that passion, but no.

189
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:14,140
It doesn't?

190
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:18,678
No, life sucks because my ex left
me for an Off-Broadway monologist

191
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,782
who just knocked her up
and asked her to marry him.

192
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:25,619
Now Gary is going to see my
daughters more than I do.

193
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,754
He's going
to live in my old house,

194
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,222
he's going to take over
my family

195
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:33,995
while I eke out a lonely existence
in a studio apartment in Astoria.

196
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,130
Have you been to Astoria?

197
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:40,334
I think like once,
for a party or something.

198
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,870
- Yeah, once.
- What's a monologist?

199
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,005
It's like a comedian without
the jokes.

200
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,172
- That's a thing?
- Yeah, that's a thing.

201
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,341
According to the MacArthur
Foundation, it's a thing.

202
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,678
He's probably monologuing
to my daughters right now.

203
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,245
I don't get it.

204
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,182
Does any of this have to do
with the graphic novel?

205
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,883
Why are we here?

206
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,116
To learn?

207
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:04,187
You're on fire today, Paul.
To learn. To learn what?

208
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,754
How to tell a story.

209
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,758
Why does anyone need to tell
a story in the first place?

210
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,593
Because...

211
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:12,430
You did it again. Anyone else?

212
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:13,864
To understand ourselves better.

213
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,366
Okay, that sounds
nice, but, uh...

214
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:19,068
If that's the only reason, then
why not just go to therapy?

215
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,705
Because therapy is stupid?

216
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:22,939
Yeah...

217
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:25,608
Maybe it's stupid.

218
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:29,479
Yeah, can I go home?

219
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,417
Just... Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.

220
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:37,253
Great comments, guys,
thank you.

221
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:48,031
- Uh, Mr. Henry?
- Yeah?

222
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,098
Are you okay?

223
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,103
- Yeah, I'm fine. -I'm
just having a bad life.

224
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:55,738
It'll be over eventually.

225
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,406
Um...

226
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:58,775
I don't want this to seem
weird or anything,

227
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:02,212
but would you maybe like to
come to my place for dinner?

228
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,182
Uh...

229
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,620
Listen... Thank you so much...

230
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,092
- Kat.
- Kat? Yeah, Kat.

231
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:19,161
Uh, that's a really
kind offer, Kat.

232
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:19,829
Ah, but...

233
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:22,231
We're not
supposed to date students.

234
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,166
No, oh, my God, no!

235
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,702
Oh, this? Yeah, no never!

236
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,737
Did you think I was
asking you out?

237
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,239
- No!
- Oh, my God!

238
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,241
No, no,
definitely not.

239
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,945
No, no, I would never do that.
That is so gross!

240
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:41,182
Wow, I... Sir, I would never, I
would never, ever, ever do that.

241
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:42,484
Okay, I'm not the Elephant Man.

242
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:45,186
No, no, I know, you're just,
you're so old.

243
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,087
Why the hell did you ask me
over for dinner for?

244
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,557
Because I want you
to meet my mom.

245
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,891
Oh, your mom?

246
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,159
- Yeah, a cute mom.
- How old is your mom?

247
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,128
- Forty-five.
- How old do you think I am?

248
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,033
Oh, I don't know, I...
Like, between 50 and 62?

249
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,735
I'm only 39...
Uh, no, I turned 40.

250
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:06,071
- I'm a young 40.
- Well, here she is.

251
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,773
Oh, that... That's your mom?

252
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,609
Yeah, and she likes
your work too.

253
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,177
Well, that's sweet.

254
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,179
Mmm-hmm, she's sweet.

255
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:19,550
Listen, Kat, I'm...
I'm still getting over my ex.

256
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,919
Look, you should
just meet my mom.

257
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,288
I promise you won't meet
anybody nearly as hot as her

258
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,089
in your apartment, okay?

259
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:28,058
God, I hate that apartment.

260
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:31,194
You know what, Kat?

261
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:33,063
What the hell,
I'll meet your cute mom.

262
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:36,966
Great. Here's the address,
be there at 8:00.

263
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:40,837
And wear something nice.

264
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,805
Like this kind of thing?

265
00:17:58,958 --> 00:17:59,556
<i> Who is it?</i>

266
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,629
Hey, uh, it's Will Henry, I'm
here for the... For the date.

267
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,615
Gosh...

268
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:25,916
You brought wine!

269
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,852
This is just so awkward.

270
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,756
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it would be awkward.

271
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,692
- Uh, you must be?
- Oh, I am Diane...

272
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,192
- Kat's mom.
- Oh, well, I am, uh...

273
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:40,864
Will. Yes, I know. Uh, and
it's nice to meet you too.

274
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,702
Look, I don't mean
to be rude, but,

275
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:47,338
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm seeing someone.

276
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,472
Oh... Uh, well...

277
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,274
Yeah, you know,
Kat doesn't know.

278
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,942
Which is why she set this up.

279
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:52,943
Truth is, I don't think
she'd like the guy.

280
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,713
I'm not even sure if I like him
but, we've had a couple dates

281
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:59,316
and I just, I don't know, I just feel as
though I should be straightforward with you.

282
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,485
I know a lot of people date a
lot of people nowadays and...

283
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,554
I don't know, I'm not comfortable
with that sort of thing. Yeah.

284
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,355
No judgment of course
if, if that's what you do.

285
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:10,059
I mean you could be coming from a
date right now for all I know, right?

286
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,661
You're not coming from
a date right now though?

287
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,094
Huh?

288
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:15,664
Uh-uh, no, no, don't
answer it, don't answer it

289
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,134
and as a matter of fact,
just forget it.

290
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:20,503
That is none
of my business. Hmm.

291
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:25,040
But I did hear you recently split up.
And I'm sorry.

292
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:28,510
Mmm. Dating sucks.

293
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:30,612
It does.

294
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:32,981
Um, well, okay...

295
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,452
I guess I'll... I guess
I'll just go home then.

296
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:38,820
Oh, no...

297
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:41,056
- You can't go.
- Why not?

298
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,156
Kat's here.

299
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:46,861
All right, listen, I'm not sure about this.
It seems very messy to me.

300
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,729
I... I don't really want to be involved...

301
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:51,633
- With deceiving a student.
- Uh...

302
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:54,469
- Mr. Henry?
- Hey, Kat!

303
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:56,170
Hey.

304
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,805
What are you guys
doing out here?

305
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,042
- Nothing.
- Mmm-hmm.

306
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,511
I, uh, just, uh...

307
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:06,514
I'm just getting
to know your teacher.

308
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,148
- Tight.
- Yeah.

309
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,685
Very tight...
Very tight friends.

310
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:20,161
So, how long have you been
making comic books?

311
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:23,998
I'm not sure, um, ever since
I was a kid, I suppose.

312
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
Hmm, really?

313
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:26,801
Were your parents encouraging?

314
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:29,637
- Oh, not at all.
- Why not?

315
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:32,774
Not a lot of successful comic
book artists where I'm from.

316
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:36,511
- Oh. Where are you from?
- New Zealand.

317
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:38,846
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

318
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:41,382
Oh, you've been to New Zealand?

319
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,515
No, but...

320
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:45,719
<i>Kat makes me go see
all the  Hobbit movies, so...</i>

321
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:48,388
Oh, so, you know
all about us and our ways.

322
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,393
- That was sassy. -Yeah, I'm
a sassy little hobbit.

323
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,162
I like it.

324
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,162
Now tell me, truthfully...

325
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:59,599
Are there any successful
comic book writers anywhere?

326
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:02,836
Well, the School of Visual
Arts has had its share. Yeah.

327
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,773
Right. SVA.

328
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,141
Do you have a problem
with the SVA?

329
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,845
No, it's just, um, well, I
wanted Kat to go to Columbia.

330
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:17,116
- Oh, Columbia is a good school.
- Columbia is a great school.

331
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:20,586
- What do you do?
- I teach at Columbia.

332
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:25,391
Oh... Wow. That's, uh... Wow.

333
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,827
Really? Wow. What do you teach?

334
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,630
- American literature.
- American literature?

335
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,868
Early American, pre-comic book.

336
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,272
Is, uh... Is that supposed
to be a joke?

337
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,341
- Maybe.
- So hilarious.

338
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,178
You do realize,
uh, comic books are part of

339
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,147
American literature, don't you?

340
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,381
I don't know
if I would necessarily...

341
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:53,685
- How many comic books have you read?
- Oh, gosh...

342
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,919
Including yours?

343
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,221
Sure, including mine.

344
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,792
Actually, I've only read yours.

345
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:01,959
Unbelievable!

346
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,227
And this is why people still
don't take comics seriously.

347
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:07,864
Because the literature department
of Columbia University

348
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,765
doesn't even recognize it
as literature!

349
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,400
Listen, I liked
your little book.

350
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:13,235
My little book?

351
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:15,870
I liked your comic book.
Better?

352
00:22:15,872 --> 00:22:16,871
My little comic book?

353
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:19,140
Oh my God, are you guys
arguing already?

354
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:22,076
Ah, please,
mind your business, Kat.

355
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,411
Mind your business, Kat.

356
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:33,254
It's good wine.

357
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:36,323
- Would you like some more?
- Really, no, I actually shouldn't.

358
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:40,761
Good, then you won't mind
when I take the rest home.

359
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:45,266
Well, uh...

360
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:46,700
Thank you, uh, good night.

361
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:51,205
It really was, um, I don't
know, it was something.

362
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:52,438
Yes.

363
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,409
Thanks for helping me
with Kat tonight, it was...

364
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:58,077
Nice meeting you.

365
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,714
Yeah... Thank you
for the pork cutlets.

366
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,382
- Delicious.
- Hmm...

367
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:05,585
- It was swordfish.
- Oh.

368
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,486
- Oh!
- Listen...

369
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:12,124
Kat told me you're kind of
really going through something.

370
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:13,291
Believe me, I...

371
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,995
I know how that is.
So for what it's worth, I...

372
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:22,000
I just want you to know that I
really do think that you are...

373
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:27,473
- Nice.
- Thank you.

374
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:32,712
I think you're
nice, too, I guess.

375
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,988
Good night. Yeah.

376
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:44,925
- Bye, Kat.
- Bye.

377
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:50,397
- How'd it go?
- Hmm, he's a bit of snob.

378
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,568
Okay, well,
you're a bit of a snob, so...

379
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,742
- Dad!
- Daddy!

380
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,616
Are you girls ready for the
greatest weekend of your lives?

381
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,751
- You say that every weekend.
- Yeah.

382
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:42,821
We're doing it again. Come on.

383
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,923
There you go.

384
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:49,627
Where did you get this car?

385
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:53,130
I borrowed it from a student.
We're going upstate.

386
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:53,831
What for?

387
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,767
What do you mean "what for?"
To get out of the city.

388
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,335
Are you in trouble?

389
00:24:58,337 --> 00:24:59,203
No, I'm not in trouble.

390
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:02,206
Where would you get
a crazy idea like that?

391
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,173
What a crazy question.

392
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:08,078
I just thought, uh, you girls spend
too much time cooped up in New York.

393
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,579
Are we staying in a hotel?

394
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:13,450
Uh, no, I thought
we could go camping.

395
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:15,319
- Camping?
- Yeah.

396
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:18,855
- Like, in a tent?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:22,125
- Do you own a tent?
- I do not own a tent.

398
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:23,860
But there is a tent in the car.

399
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:26,797
Mom wants us to practice
cello this weekend.

400
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,565
You can practice cello
in the woods.

401
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,043
Get back here!

402
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:04,235
Ow.

403
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,805
Sounds beautiful, girls.

404
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:10,408
That sounds amazing,
what song is that?

405
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,518
It's okay, I'll sleep outside, under
the stars, it'll be romantic.

406
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,253
It's fine, don't worry.

407
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:40,839
- So, how are you guys?
- Fine.

408
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,874
Yeah?

409
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,378
- How's your mom?
- She's okay.

410
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:51,750
- Did she tell you about her...
- Yeah.

411
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:55,053
And how are you feeling
about everything?

412
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:57,189
I don't know.

413
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,859
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know.

414
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:04,261
Good. Fine.

415
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:08,665
You guys know I'll always
be your dad, right?

416
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,198
Yeah?

417
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,367
Are you going to the wedding?

418
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,536
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

419
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,438
Dad, do you hate Mom?

420
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,276
- Of course not, Clio.
- Colette says you hate her.

421
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:22,577
I love your mother.

422
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,346
Does she love you?

423
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:28,116
Yeah, I think, you know,
in a way, yeah.

424
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,551
Sure, yeah, she does.

425
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,754
Then why is she marrying Gary?

426
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,391
Love is complicated, girls.

427
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:39,659
- Mom's a bitch!
- Hey, Colette!

428
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,327
I'm telling Mom you said that.

429
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,128
Go ahead
and you're a bitch, too.

430
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,631
Girls, listen... Stop, okay?

431
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,034
It's really important we give
your mom our support right now.

432
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,403
Understand?

433
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:53,773
- Why?
- Because she needs it.

434
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:59,979
Don't! I know you're trying to
knock my hotdog off into the fire!

435
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,450
You want me to starve?

436
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:04,851
Okay.

437
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:06,419
Good night, girls, I love you.

438
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,120
Love you too, Dad.

439
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,672
- Dad?
- Yeah.

440
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:29,610
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No, honey.

441
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:31,611
Good.

442
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,325
Time!

443
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:19,961
- Rhinoceros!
- Rhinoceros?

444
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,796
Oh, yeah!

445
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:23,931
- Oh, my god!
- I got it!

446
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:32,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

447
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,875
- How did you get in here?
- I texted you.

448
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,343
You said you could keep
them tonight.

449
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:39,112
Yeah, sure, that's fine,
I can keep them.

450
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:43,983
- I meant at your place.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

451
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,922
- I want more time with them.
- What?

452
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:53,293
- Where is this coming from?
- I need to see them more.

453
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:54,827
I want some weekdays.

454
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,628
- You live in Astoria.
- So what?

455
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,099
So, that's an hour-and-a-half
commute to school every day.

456
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,467
I can move closer.

457
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:04,070
Since when can you
afford to move closer?

458
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:05,905
I'm a good father.

459
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:09,742
- You're good at having fun with them.
- They're six years old.

460
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,211
They should always
be having fun.

461
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,379
They should be learning things.

462
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:14,247
- Did they practice their
cellos this weekend? -Yes.

463
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,847
They need to practice
that every day.

464
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:16,882
I want more time with them.

465
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:21,487
Can we talk about
this tomorrow? I'm tired.

466
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:24,656
Where's, uh, Gary,
the monologist?

467
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,626
- He's at his apartment.
- He has an apartment?

468
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:30,061
Yeah, he keeps it
as a workspace.

469
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:32,097
Why? Do you think that's weird?

470
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,699
- It is.
- Yeah, it is.

471
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,869
Shit. What am I getting into?

472
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,471
Don't answer that.

473
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,946
What is happening here?

474
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,948
Uh, an eye is blinking?

475
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,383
Why do you say that, Paul?

476
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,251
Because that's
what's happening?

477
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:57,988
Do you see any eye actually blinking
in either of these two images?

478
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,858
- Well, no...
- No, you see an eye open.

479
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,161
In the next image,
we see an eye closed.

480
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:06,464
And we create
the blink in our minds.

481
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,066
And this is called closure.

482
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,967
- What's it called?
- Closure.

483
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:12,135
- What's it called? Yeah.
- Closure.

484
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,137
Respect that gap
between your panels.

485
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,873
It can do a lot of
work for you.

486
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,107
It can travel time and space.

487
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,643
It can create
and destroy whole worlds.

488
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,077
Kaboom!

489
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,182
In some way, that little gap
between the panels,

490
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:31,788
is just as important as the images
in the panels themselves because...

491
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,256
There is the story
you're telling

492
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:36,926
and then there are the things
that you're leaving out.

493
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:41,299
And in that way, the story
becomes a shared creation

494
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,333
between the writer,

495
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,804
you guys in the future
and the reader.

496
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:49,939
I don't get it.

497
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,775
What's supposed to be
happening here?

498
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,178
It's not always
as simple as a blink.

499
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,348
I don't know,
it just seems random.

500
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,382
You seem random.

501
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,251
Okay, that's enough for today.

502
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,587
I want sketches for your
memory pieces next week.

503
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,022
Everyone. No exceptions.

504
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:10,292
Celia. Paul.

505
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:55,978
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

506
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,447
- I've been thinking.
- Hey, girls!

507
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,048
Yeah, what are you doing here?

508
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,517
You said you wanted
more time with the girls.

509
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,852
- Yeah.
- Let's give it a try!

510
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:07,622
- What, right now?
- Yeah. You busy?

511
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:11,593
Well, I was kind of... I was
kind of working on a thing.

512
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:13,194
Okay, so you can't take them?

513
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:15,430
No, yeah, of course,
I can take them.

514
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,598
Yeah, come in. Come in, girls.

515
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:22,369
Uh, I could have
used a little notice.

516
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,237
I don't even have
any groceries.

517
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,940
You said you wanted
more time with them.

518
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:29,775
I've only got one egg.

519
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:32,345
Figure something out,
go to the store.

520
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:36,783
What's going on?
Why are you here?

521
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,718
- Meanne quit. Yeah.
- She quit?

522
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,355
- Why'd she quit? -She got
a job with Jon Stewart.

523
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:45,291
- What... The Jon Stewart?
Whoa, really? -Yeah...

524
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:46,760
What's she doing,
sketches? Or...

525
00:33:46,762 --> 00:33:48,962
No, not sketches,
watching his kids.

526
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:51,097
- What do you think?
- Oh... Oh, yeah, of course.

527
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,400
They met during
my improv showcase.

528
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,268
That's not...

529
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,470
- Uh... Yeah, that's not funny, sorry.
- Yeah.

530
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,006
It's terrible timing. Gary's
doing this new monologue

531
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,842
and his family's in town for it.
It's just kind of awful.

532
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:06,613
Which, the monologue or the family?
A combination?

533
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:08,816
I'm just... I'm so
pissed at Meanne.

534
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:12,987
The girls must be sad. She's been
around since they were babies.

535
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,821
Okay, here's their schedule
for the rest of the week.

536
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:17,491
Make sure they practice their cello
for at least 20 minutes a day.

537
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,459
- No problem.
- And cook them vegetables.

538
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,496
I don't want them eating pizza.

539
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,364
- Bye girls!
- Bye, Mom!

540
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,667
- I love you!
- Love you too!

541
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,902
- Call me.
- Okay.

542
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,373
Are you guys hungry?

543
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,674
Bath and bed
straight after dinner, okay?

544
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:39,412
We're going to have to wake up super
early to make it to school on time.

545
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:41,047
- How early?
- 6:00 AM.

546
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:43,349
6:00 AM, are you kidding me?

547
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:44,017
No, I'm serious.

548
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,586
We've never woken up
that early in our life!

549
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,187
You're going to tomorrow.

550
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,056
No, we're not.

551
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,558
- Pardon?
- No, we're not.

552
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:57,229
- Yes, you are.
- Do you wanna bet?

553
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:58,463
I'm not going to bet you.

554
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,833
Have you ever woken up
that early?

555
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:02,801
Okay, 6:45.

556
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,054
But we're going to have
to move really fast.

557
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,329
I don't want to be late.

558
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,738
Stop the look.

559
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,007
Don't give each other
secret looks.

560
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:14,912
<i>Uh, Dad? CARTOON
 Uh, Dad?</i>

561
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:18,683
<i>- Dad!
- Dad!</i>

562
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,052
<i>- Wake up!
- Wake up!</i>

563
00:35:21,054 --> 00:35:21,919
<i>- Shit!
- Shit!</i>

564
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:24,622
<i>- Shouldn't say shit.
- Shouldn't say shit.</i>

565
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,624
Stop playing with my phone
and get dressed!

566
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,593
<i>Stop playing with my phone
and get dressed!</i>

567
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:32,229
Are you guys okay with pizza for breakfast?
Don't answer that.

568
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,298
I have to poop...

569
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,166
- Really bad.
- Okay.

570
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,301
Just wait,
just wait a little...

571
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,036
<i>- Hey, Charlie!
-  You're late!</i>

572
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,272
Yeah! We're almost there.

573
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,074
<i>I can't believe you!
Did you set your alarm?</i>

574
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:44,841
No, I did set my alarm...

575
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:48,311
- No, no. -

576
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,112
Yeah...

577
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,781
No, I set...

578
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,783
But, but... I set my...

579
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,953
I set my alarm...
I set my alarm... Okay...

580
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,388
<i>What did they have for breakfast?
Did they have breakfast?</i>

581
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,159
<i>- Yeah, they're having breakfast.
- What are they eating?</i>

582
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,595
<i>- Uh, you know, some cheese...
- Huh?</i>

583
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,330
- Tomatoes... Okay! -

584
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,468
Okay, I'll call you when they
get to school, all right? Okay?

585
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,340
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, bye.

586
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,011
Mom says good morning.

587
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:43,502
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let's take a look at you.

588
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,440
You look wonderful.

589
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:50,575
Have a great day.

590
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,947
Sorry. I'm sorry...

591
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:24,846
So, what did you guys
do at school today?

592
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:26,448
I don't know, kid stuff.

593
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,449
Just kid stuff?

594
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,253
What kind of grown-up stuff?

595
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:34,489
You know, like,
just walking around,

596
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:35,724
doing a job,

597
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:37,791
talking in a serious voice...

598
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,895
Like this... "Hello."

599
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:43,733
- What'd you do, Colette?
- Same as her.

600
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,334
- What?
- Kid stuff.

601
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:46,936
Kid stuff, just kid stuff?

602
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:51,307
Is that all the information
I'm going to get out of you?

603
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,441
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

604
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,777
Hmm.

605
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:56,245
Hold on.

606
00:37:58,048 --> 00:37:59,514
Uh-oh.

607
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:00,815
<i>- Hey, Charlie...
-  Hey.</i>

608
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:03,785
Can I call you back later? They're
just in the middle of their supper.

609
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,052
<i>You missed the girls'
French lesson.</i>

610
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:07,187
<i>- I thought it was on Tuesday.
Oh!  -It is Tuesday, Will!</i>

611
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,989
<i>- It's Tuesday. Today is Tuesday.
 -Right.</i>

612
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,591
Well, I didn't realize
it was Tuesday.

613
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:12,558
<i>- Are you fuckin' kidding me?
- Okay.</i>

614
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,794
- It's Tuesday, Will... -

615
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,795
<i>- Yeah, I know. Okay.
- It's fucking Tuesday!</i>

616
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:21,033
Hey, that's why the kids have
picked up some bad language.

617
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:24,570
<i>- Can you do this?
- I can do it. I can do this.</i>

618
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,572
They're eating
vegetables right now.

619
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:29,409
Yes, they'll be at school
on time tomorrow.

620
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:30,376
All right, okay.

621
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,478
<i>- Okay, see you, bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

622
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,483
Girls, you could have told me you
had your French lesson today.

623
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:37,183
<i>Merde!</i>

624
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:39,653
Hey, that's a bad
word in France!

625
00:38:42,357 --> 00:38:44,657
Look, ladies...

626
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,693
We're all on
the same team here.

627
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:48,194
I can use a little help.

628
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:51,631
Especially if you want to
spend more time with me, okay?

629
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:53,900
Okay.

630
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:08,549
Wake up, wake up, it's 6:00 AM.

631
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:12,118
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy!

632
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,018
Come on!

633
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,789
I don't know if the animals
should be eating popcorn.

634
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,157
They can...

635
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:23,796
- What happened?
- Bomb threats.

636
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,998
A bomb threat?

637
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,666
How long do we have to wait?

638
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:30,134
School canceled.

639
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:32,370
It can't be canceled.

640
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,739
I have to teach today.

641
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:48,353
<i> What?</i>

642
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:51,622
Hey, it's, uh,
Will Henry, your teacher.

643
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:54,359
Can we talk for a second?

644
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:00,965
Okay. Come on.

645
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,309
What are you doing here?

646
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,112
I need someone
to look after my girls.

647
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,848
You want me
to babysit your kids?

648
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,618
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone
else to call on such short notice.

649
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,554
Charlie got all our friends
when we split.

650
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:25,090
Please. I'm desperate,
I've got a class in an hour.

651
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,258
Yeah, I know,
I'm in that class!

652
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,028
Well, I'll, uh, excuse
your absence.

653
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,699
Really? That's unbelievable.

654
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,968
Uh, I can pay you.

655
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:39,637
- Do they watch TV?
- They love TV!

656
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,972
Right, girls,
you like TV, right?

657
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:45,276
- Come on!
- Yeah, okay, fine...

658
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,445
- Whatever.
- Thank you so much.

659
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,278
Sure, what is this?

660
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,780
These are just
a couple of cellos.

661
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,482
- Couple of cellos? -Are they
supposed to play this right now?

662
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,451
No, you know, of course not.

663
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,753
Okay, girls, this is Kat.

664
00:40:56,755 --> 00:41:00,124
- What's up?
- That means "hello."

665
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,893
C'mon, ya'll carryin'
your own cellos.

666
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,332
All right.

667
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:13,804
Memory pieces. Who wants
to share theirs first?

668
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,010
- Tom.
- Yeah.

669
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,018
Hi.

670
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,989
I decided to write about
how I learned to masturbate.

671
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,989
I was 12.

672
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,127
So, one day, I walked into my
dad's office,

673
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,295
where he kept
all the dirty magazines.

674
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,933
And, uh, I found
some lotion and...

675
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,142
You have a lot of nerve,
do you know that?

676
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:55,079
Is this because I didn't call you, because
I thought you were dating someone.

677
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,648
- No! No! -I thought... I wasn't
sure if the chemistry...

678
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,284
What are you
even talking about?

679
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:02,452
This has nothing to do with us!

680
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:03,152
What's this to do with then?

681
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:07,090
This is about the fact that you asked
my daughter to skip your class

682
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,891
so that she could
baby-sit your kids.

683
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,126
I'm sorry, I was in a desperate
situation this morning.

684
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:14,497
But you didn't think to ask any
of your male students for help?

685
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,465
Are you kidding?
My male students are idiots.

686
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,134
Oh! So, the idiots get to
go to class

687
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:22,205
while the bright girl stays at
home and takes care of your kids?

688
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,506
What kind of message
does that send to Kat?

689
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,975
Or to your daughters,
for that matter?

690
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:30,547
- I'm sorry, I just didn't think...
- Yeah, guys never do.

691
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,215
Is she here?

692
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,185
She went out, after she
put your girls to bed.

693
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:39,422
- They're asleep? It's only seven o'clock.
- They were exhausted!

694
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,857
What are you doing to them?

695
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,061
I just wanted
more time with them.

696
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,198
Come inside.

697
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,536
Look, it's, it's none of my
business but...

698
00:42:55,538 --> 00:43:00,643
It just seems to me like you and your ex
are a little loose about all of this.

699
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:01,509
I mean they're children.

700
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:05,213
You can't just pass them
back and forth like puppies.

701
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,249
Yeah, I know.

702
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,286
- Why not? Why not?
- They need structure.

703
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,490
- Stability. -They get
that most of the time.

704
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:18,628
Look, it's pretty simple. In this kind
of situation, a child just wants to know

705
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,496
where they're gonna
sleep at night.

706
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,731
You shouldn't change that
on a whim.

707
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,235
- Yeah. Our kids are so screwed.
- No.

708
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,337
Believe me, I've made just about
every mistake there is to make

709
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:34,477
and if it's any consolation... Kat
made it through intact, more or less.

710
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,278
Oh, Kat's a great kid.

711
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,815
Yeah, she is.
She really admires you.

712
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,550
She does? Why?

713
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:44,251
She thinks you're
a great teacher.

714
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:48,489
- Not counting today, maybe.
-  No, minus today.

715
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:50,423
Wow, that's...

716
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:52,458
That's really nice to hear.

717
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,597
I think she was a little disappointed
when we didn't hit it off.

718
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:02,468
Yeah.

719
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:05,771
Uh, well, uh, we should
get going.

720
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:10,009
What? You're not leaving!
Your girls are still sleeping.

721
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:11,143
Yeah, we can't stay here.

722
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:13,078
- Sure, you can.
- I don't know.

723
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,749
I do. And I'm not letting you
drag them back to Astoria

724
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,318
in the middle of the night!

725
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,719
What is that, a $40 cab ride?

726
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:22,253
I was going to take the subway.

727
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:27,226
Come on. I'm going to get you
some blankets for the couch.

728
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:34,834
I can probably find you
some pajamas in here too.

729
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:40,239
Oh, no, that's okay. I can
just sleep in, uh, my clothes.

730
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:52,818
I see you've been doing
some reading?

731
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:56,288
Oh, yeah, I...

732
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,723
Felt bad after our...
Whatever it was.

733
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:02,327
And I thought I should at least
see what you were talking about.

734
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:06,598
- So, what did you think?
- I think that you were right.

735
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,201
Comic books are an under-appreciated
part of American literature.

736
00:45:10,203 --> 00:45:12,671
- Really?
- Yeah, I had no idea

737
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:13,638
what people were doing
in the form.

738
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,143
I mean there's some really complex,
emotionally-wrenching stuff

739
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:19,277
- going on there.
- What?

740
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:24,483
That's, that's amazing! I, I'm so
surprised to hear you say that.

741
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:29,322
Actually, I...
I need to thank you.

742
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:29,755
What for?

743
00:45:29,757 --> 00:45:34,227
Well, I have a new appreciation for
what Kat wants to do with her life.

744
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:38,699
I can't believe
I was being so dismissive.

745
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:42,069
I really am turning
into my mother.

746
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:43,837
Wow. That's wonderful.

747
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,944
Not that you were turning into your
mother, I mean that you would...

748
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:53,349
- You know what I mean.
- No, yeah, I do, I get it.

749
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,851
Uh, so, uh...

750
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,721
You still seeing that guy, the one
you weren't sure if you liked?

751
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:06,160
Oh, no, no, no, I...
Broke it off after our dinner.

752
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:10,064
- Since dinner, yeah.
- Oh.

753
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,265
So...

754
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:15,869
- Oh, I have your blankets.
- Oh, thanks.

755
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,505
Holding these.

756
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:25,880
Got you the soft ones that I had so
you can be comfortable out there.

757
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:29,750
These are really nice blankets.

758
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:31,951
It's no problem.

759
00:46:32,253 --> 00:46:36,388
Are you okay with me
standing this close?

760
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:39,658
Yeah, I like it actually.

761
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,599
- Is this okay here? -This is,
this is good, I like it here.

762
00:46:55,878 --> 00:47:00,580
- We probably shouldn't be doing this.
- No, we probably...

763
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:03,081
- Okay, let's stop.
- Okay, let's stop.

764
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,150
No, let's not.

765
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,686
- You want to stop, say it.
- Stop.

766
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:11,089
- Gee, you smell so good.
- Yes...

767
00:47:11,091 --> 00:47:16,128
Okay, listen, we have to be quiet.
I don't want to wake up the kids.

768
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,031
Yeah, okay,
I'm going to be so quiet.

769
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:21,399
Well, not too quiet,
I like to be affirmed.

770
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:26,104
Okay, I'll be whispering
affirmations at you.

771
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:28,506
Wait a minute.

772
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:31,943
- I have to tell you something.
- Something wrong?

773
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:36,114
No, I just...
I want to just say...

774
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:40,418
- No bullshit, okay?
- Oh, yeah... No.

775
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:43,086
I mean I, uh...

776
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,321
I'm a big girl and...

777
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:49,560
I don't need this to be anything
more than what it is, but just...

778
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,063
Don't bullshit me.

779
00:47:53,966 --> 00:47:58,768
Do you understand,
I've been through enough.

780
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:01,136
Yeah, I understand.

781
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:04,640
- I've been hurt, too.
- I know.

782
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:06,909
I could tell the minute we met.

783
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,810
It's actually one of the first
things I liked about you.

784
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:13,215
That's funny. Do you know one of the
first things I liked about you was?

785
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,482
- What?
- Your tits.

786
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:18,687
That's so nice.
Please touch them.

787
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,901
- Daddy?
- Oh, no, no...

788
00:48:32,937 --> 00:48:35,271
- You have to go get her.
- Daddy, are you there?

789
00:48:35,273 --> 00:48:36,973
No, no, no, no, no.

790
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:40,977
- Okay, I'm going to be right back.
- Okay.

791
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:43,780
I'll be here.

792
00:48:44,648 --> 00:48:45,914
Hey.

793
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:46,881
Where were you?

794
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:50,619
I was, uh, just getting some
blankets from Kat's mom.

795
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:54,389
She's invited us all to
have a sleep-over tonight.

796
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:55,890
Isn't that fun?

797
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:58,159
Where are the blankets?

798
00:48:59,696 --> 00:49:03,698
Let's go, let's, um, get
you back to bed.

799
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:25,522
- Where are you going?
- Just stretching.

800
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:10,908
Well, this is wildly
inappropriate.

801
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:17,047
Oh... Hey, Kat.

802
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:18,515
Hi, good morning.

803
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:19,783
Where have you been all night?

804
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:21,885
What? None of your business!

805
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:23,920
Is your, uh, is your mom up?

806
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,155
Actually, no, she just
left for work,

807
00:50:25,157 --> 00:50:28,191
but she did tell me
to tell you good-bye.

808
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,026
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

809
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,293
How did she say it?

810
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,794
"Tell him I said bye."

811
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,963
Do you know where my
children are?

812
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,997
Yeah, they're in the kitchen,
eating breakfast.

813
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:39,100
Okay, good. Good.

814
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,603
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

815
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,071
Yeah, no, it's fine.

816
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:47,376
Actually, I really like your kids.
They are very, very fun.

817
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,177
Yeah. Thank you.

818
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,180
Uh, I want to make it up to you.
How does $20 sound?

819
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,517
Sounds like you don't know
how much to pay a baby-sitter.

820
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,387
How much,
uh, how much would you like?

821
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,390
$350.

822
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:03,690
- $350?
- Yeah!

823
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:05,392
Could you give me a month?

824
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,995
Um, you know, you...

825
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,766
Do you think you can
just read this? Please?

826
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:14,068
- If you have time?
- What is this?

827
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,137
- It's like a story I've been working
on for like forever. -Uh-huh.

828
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:20,273
Um, I don't know actually,
it's pretty dumb,

829
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,141
it's not like,
really finished, so...

830
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:22,856
No, I'll read it. No,
I'd love to read it.

831
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:24,210
No that's fine, I'll take it.

832
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:25,244
I'd love to read it.

833
00:51:25,246 --> 00:51:28,548
- You would? -Sure, it
would be my pleasure.

834
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,283
Thank you.

835
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:32,753
Um, now get out of my room.

836
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,254
Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

837
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:38,358
And take the sheets
with you, please. Burn them.

838
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:42,528
Dad, why did we sleep
at Kat's last night?

839
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:46,198
Because, uh, you guys fell asleep
and I didn't want to wake you.

840
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,134
- Do you like her?
- Who, Kat? Of course I do.

841
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:52,838
- I like all my students.
- Are you going to marry her?

842
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,640
No! She's only 19!

843
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:59,978
I'm not
going to marry her.

844
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:04,048
Okay, have a great day, girls.

845
00:52:04,717 --> 00:52:06,250
Hey, what's wrong?

846
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:08,017
What did I do?

847
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:10,085
We don't want you to marry Kat.

848
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,854
I'm not going to marry Kat.

849
00:52:11,856 --> 00:52:15,391
- I miss Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

850
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:17,658
Come here.

851
00:52:19,229 --> 00:52:20,996
It's okay.

852
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,047
- Hi!
- Was it today?

853
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:41,584
- No, I'm in a fitting.
- Oh.

854
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:42,718
What are you doing here?

855
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,955
- Can we, can we talk?
- Yeah.

856
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:59,637
- Are you going to sit?
- I can't sit in this.

857
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:04,609
Okay, well...
You look really good.

858
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:08,579
Oh...
I don't know, I...

859
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:10,714
I'm gonna be showing
so much by this wedding.

860
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:12,415
I feel like I should
wear something that

861
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:15,987
reveals more leg, kind of
distract from the belly.

862
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:20,257
- So, you wanted to talk to me
about something? -Yeah, I...

863
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:23,460
I just think that the kids
are very confused.

864
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:24,962
Why? What have you been
doing to them?

865
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:26,897
I haven't been doing
anything to them.

866
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,233
They weren't confused when I
dropped them off at your place.

867
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,402
No, I'm not sure that's true.

868
00:53:32,404 --> 00:53:33,169
What do you mean?

869
00:53:33,171 --> 00:53:36,206
I just think the girls are
struggling with all of the changes

870
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,373
that are going on
at the moment.

871
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:41,910
- Which changes? -Like, you
know, like, all of the...

872
00:53:42,947 --> 00:53:44,413
Changes.

873
00:53:44,915 --> 00:53:47,917
- Are you seeing someone?
- What?

874
00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:51,220
Oh, my God,
you're seeing someone!

875
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:54,824
Oh, well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't
say we're seeing each other.

876
00:53:54,826 --> 00:53:59,529
Unbelievable! I can't believe you pick
the one week I give you the girls

877
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,663
to start seeing someone?

878
00:54:00,665 --> 00:54:02,197
I thought you
wanted me to date.

879
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:04,366
How old is she?
I hope she's not a student.

880
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:08,336
- She's not a student, she's
a student's mother. -Wow.

881
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,838
Where were the girls
when you were with her?

882
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,610
They were sleeping in her
daughter's bed, the student...

883
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,778
Oh, right, okay...

884
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:18,145
No wonder they're confused.

885
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:21,616
Well that... Yeah, that sounds
bad, but it's not like that.

886
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:25,720
No, it's, it's fine. I, I love
that you're seeing somebody.

887
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,290
- I think that's awesome.
- I'm not seeing...

888
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:30,259
Look, this isn't
about me or you.

889
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:31,627
I just want the kids
to be happy.

890
00:54:31,629 --> 00:54:34,129
I thought happiness was not
a sustainable condition?

891
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:35,730
You're absolutely correct,
it's not.

892
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:37,466
But I don't think they
need to live in chaos.

893
00:54:37,468 --> 00:54:41,369
There is nothing chaotic about the
world I provide for my girls.

894
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:44,106
You left their father
on their fifth birthday.

895
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:46,824
Now you're marrying the
guy who broke us up.

896
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,211
Their nanny left them.

897
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:49,212
- Have you told them?
- Okay.

898
00:54:49,214 --> 00:54:50,680
You haven't told them, have you?
Have you told them?

899
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:53,015
- Have you... You haven't
told them yet? -Stop!

900
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:54,282
You drop them off
at my place on a whim.

901
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:56,652
I think their lives
are pretty fucking chaotic!

902
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:57,353
- Here!
- What is this?

903
00:54:57,355 --> 00:54:59,420
The girls' schedules.
French, cello, tap.

904
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,955
Museum Mondays.
Alternate cooking play-dates

905
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:02,724
with the Sheldon girls
every Thursday afternoon.

906
00:55:02,726 --> 00:55:04,826
Oral storytelling workshop
for spring break.

907
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:05,827
Then there's breakfast
and dinner every day.

908
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:09,030
Cello practice every day. Reading
them to sleep for an hour every day.

909
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:11,132
Don't tell me their
lives are chaotic!

910
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:12,434
Well, I'm glad you
feed them regularly.

911
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:13,668
I'm not implying that
you're a bad mother.

912
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,704
- I'm a great fucking mother.
- I know you are.

913
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:17,606
Their lives have never been
chaotic with me.

914
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:20,576
It's my life that's been chaotic
because I was unhappy for years

915
00:55:20,578 --> 00:55:21,510
and didn't do
anything about it.

916
00:55:21,512 --> 00:55:25,146
Because first I was taking care of you,
and then I was taking care of them...

917
00:55:25,148 --> 00:55:26,947
And no one was
ever taking care of me!

918
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,084
Well, I'm sorry I didn't know you
wanted to take improv classes.

919
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:32,487
- Fuck you!
- Charlie...

920
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:33,855
I could be so much more
than what I am.

921
00:55:33,857 --> 00:55:36,657
What does that mean? I don't
even know what that means.

922
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,492
Of course you don't. God!

923
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:39,659
Of course you don't! God!

924
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:43,597
I can't believe you're dating
a student's mother!

925
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:47,467
We're not dating.

926
00:55:49,338 --> 00:55:50,870
Do you like her?

927
00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:53,706
I told you, I barely know her.

928
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:56,041
I think you like her.

929
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,705
Dad, who
are you texting?

930
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,507
- No one.
- Is it Kat?

931
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:56,743
No, it's not Kat.

932
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:02,982
Hmm.

933
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:05,485
This is a really
nice office.

934
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:08,288
Yeah, I thought
you would like it.

935
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:09,755
I do.

936
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:10,388
I actually do, I mean,

937
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,793
I'm not using it as a euphemism,
I do like your office, really.

938
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:19,665
You know I believed you, I
didn't receive it negatively.

939
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:24,769
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

940
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:29,207
What happened
with you and your...

941
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,444
My baby mama?

942
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:35,181
Please don't ever say
"baby mama" again.

943
00:57:35,183 --> 00:57:36,382
My baby mama...

944
00:57:36,384 --> 00:57:39,151
- Don't! You sound...
- She's my baby mama.

945
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:41,653
That's three times.

946
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:43,922
I don't know.

947
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:45,556
You don't know?

948
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:48,125
We were always very different.

949
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:51,295
And it was really
fun at first, and then,

950
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:56,199
gradually, less and less fun
as it went on.

951
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,035
Different how?

952
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:04,540
Lots of ways, she was outgoing.
I was quite.

953
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,777
- Hmm.
- She had money and I didn't.

954
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,780
Hmm, that's a big one.

955
00:58:09,782 --> 00:58:11,248
It wasn't that.

956
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,518
Charlie was always
generous with what she had.

957
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:20,591
She actually gave up everything so
that I could concentrate on my comics.

958
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:23,627
She had so much
confidence in me.

959
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,132
Probably more than I had
in myself at that time.

960
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,767
So, what went wrong?

961
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:33,771
I guess she just
she stopped talking.

962
00:58:33,773 --> 00:58:37,208
And I enjoyed
the silence too much.

963
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:44,014
What happened with you
and your ex?

964
00:58:44,016 --> 00:58:47,918
Oh, it's...
It's not that interesting.

965
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:52,188
He was just a fucking
asshole.

966
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:55,525
Mmm.

967
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:00,996
Who can tell me what this is?

968
00:59:00,998 --> 00:59:01,696
A pipe.

969
00:59:01,698 --> 00:59:05,768
Hasn't anyone here ever
taken an art history class?

970
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,103
All right, does anyone
speak French?

971
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:09,304
Is it a French pipe?

972
00:59:09,306 --> 00:59:10,972
<i>It's  The Treachery of
Images by Magritte.</i>

973
00:59:10,974 --> 00:59:14,376
Those words say, "This is
not a pipe" in French.

974
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:16,011
Correct.

975
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:21,850
That's confusing.

976
00:59:21,852 --> 00:59:23,818
Well, the truth is that
it's not a pipe.

977
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,520
- Then what is it? -It's
only a picture of a pipe.

978
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:29,223
Well, actually, it's a projection
of a picture of a pipe.

979
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,191
Okay, slow down, we don't
need to get that meta.

980
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:37,431
I'm just using it to get at the
relationship between words and images.

981
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:40,501
Sometimes the graphic
storyteller will use

982
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:42,503
words simply to describe
what we're seeing.

983
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:47,742
Other times, he will use them to say
the opposite of what we're seeing.

984
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,343
Is this a happy man?

985
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:52,546
If he's happy, why does
he look so miserable?

986
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:57,451
Maybe misery is inexorably
linked to happiness.

987
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:59,286
Is this what the writer
is trying to say?

988
00:59:59,288 --> 01:00:04,158
Who the hell knows? I just know
that I'm interested, I'm involved.

989
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,161
Is that you?
It looks like you.

990
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:09,062
Let's go back to this.

991
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,096
I'm really confused.

992
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:16,903
And yet, we're just starting to
explore the possibilities of this.

993
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,071
What, huh?

994
01:00:39,962 --> 01:00:40,594
<i>Hey.  .</i>

995
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,860
<i>I need you to get here now.</i>

996
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:44,363
<i>- Okay, calm down.
-  It's an emergency.</i>

997
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:45,431
Calm down.

998
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,063
<i>I need your help.</i>

999
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:48,733
Okay, I'm gonna
be right over, all right?

1000
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:50,102
Calm down.

1001
01:00:54,373 --> 01:00:55,605
Charlie?

1002
01:00:58,209 --> 01:00:59,809
You're here.

1003
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:00,609
What's the problem?

1004
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:03,111
The girls locked themselves
in the bathroom.

1005
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:05,279
What? Why?

1006
01:01:05,281 --> 01:01:07,182
Colette said she wanted
to live with you.

1007
01:01:07,184 --> 01:01:10,051
Just, Colette?
What about Clio? Did Clio?

1008
01:01:10,053 --> 01:01:12,453
Well, what did you,
what did you tell them?

1009
01:01:12,455 --> 01:01:14,289
I don't want the girls
to leave me,

1010
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,591
I put my whole life
into who they are!

1011
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:18,392
I don't even know
who I am without them

1012
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:21,262
and improv is really,
really hard.

1013
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:24,698
Maybe, they should stay
with you, I'm such a mess.

1014
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,100
Hey, it's okay.

1015
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:31,537
It's okay, the girls aren't
gonna leave either one of us.

1016
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,340
This is your fault.

1017
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,709
Uh, how's it my,
how's it my fault?

1018
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:37,843
You make them kites,
you take them camping,

1019
01:01:37,845 --> 01:01:41,380
you show more initiative now, than
you ever showed in our relationship.

1020
01:01:41,382 --> 01:01:45,016
I dunno, I guess I just got
comfortable with you taking the lead.

1021
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:48,687
Yeah well, I never wanted
to be the leader.

1022
01:01:50,257 --> 01:01:51,489
Sorry.

1023
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:52,523
You're sorry?

1024
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:55,392
Jesus, Charlie, what do you
want from me?

1025
01:01:55,394 --> 01:01:56,961
We made mistakes.

1026
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,930
You're getting married.

1027
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:00,263
He's...

1028
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,698
having doubts.

1029
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,900
Who, Gary? Why?

1030
01:02:04,168 --> 01:02:06,269
I mentioned your girlfriend.

1031
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:07,803
She's not...

1032
01:02:07,806 --> 01:02:10,605
What's it, what's she got
to do with anything?

1033
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:12,641
Gary thinks I'm jealous.

1034
01:02:12,643 --> 01:02:15,111
Of Diane? That's ridiculous.

1035
01:02:15,113 --> 01:02:17,880
He thinks
I have unresolved issues.

1036
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:19,948
Everyone's got
unresolved issues.

1037
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,619
He thinks I've got unresolved
issues with you.

1038
01:02:23,621 --> 01:02:25,954
And what did you tell him?

1039
01:02:25,956 --> 01:02:31,093
Maybe you're right. Maybe happiness
is not a sustainable condition.

1040
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:34,730
Maybe, I didn't know
what I had when I had it.

1041
01:02:34,732 --> 01:02:35,731
I don't know,

1042
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,533
I'm just feeling very confused.

1043
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:41,303
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1044
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:47,776
Everything is going to be okay.

1045
01:02:49,112 --> 01:02:50,278
How do you know?

1046
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,049
I don't, but it just helps
sometimes to say that.

1047
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:58,553
I think I miss you.

1048
01:02:58,555 --> 01:02:59,921
Oh, Charlie.

1049
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:03,391
Do you ever think about me?

1050
01:03:06,195 --> 01:03:08,129
All the time.

1051
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:18,006
Dad?

1052
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:21,710
What are you doing here?

1053
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:25,648
Who wants ice cream?

1054
01:03:27,185 --> 01:03:28,517
I do.

1055
01:03:29,087 --> 01:03:30,686
Can we have some sprinkles?

1056
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:33,022
You can get whatever you want.

1057
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:41,998
We should talk.

1058
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,666
Yeah.

1059
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:46,735
Oh, shit.

1060
01:03:48,405 --> 01:03:50,372
What's he doing here?

1061
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,340
Talk later?

1062
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:55,777
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- Okay.

1063
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:00,947
I thought you wanted ice-cream?

1064
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:02,783
I do want ice-cream.

1065
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,246
Who is it?

1066
01:04:59,248 --> 01:05:00,880
It's Will.

1067
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:11,825
Shh!

1068
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:14,561
We have to be quiet,
Kat fell asleep on the couch.

1069
01:05:14,563 --> 01:05:18,499
Where have you been, I've been trying
to get in touch with you all day.

1070
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:19,867
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1071
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:22,003
Something wrong
with your phone?

1072
01:05:22,705 --> 01:05:24,504
We need to talk.

1073
01:05:25,073 --> 01:05:26,306
Oh.

1074
01:05:27,075 --> 01:05:28,307
Shit.

1075
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,075
Yeah.

1076
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,144
What is it?

1077
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:35,612
I kissed Charlie.

1078
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,015
Oh.

1079
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:39,882
I'm sorry.
You said no bullshit.

1080
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:46,422
Yeah, I know. I meant like "Don't fuck me,
if you still have feelings for your ex,"

1081
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,190
but I appreciate your candor.

1082
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:52,295
I didn't plan
for any of this to happen.

1083
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:55,630
So you do
still have feelings for her.

1084
01:05:55,632 --> 01:05:59,368
I dunno, you've been through
all this before.

1085
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:01,635
Do they ever go away?

1086
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:05,173
Are you really asking me that?

1087
01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:06,773
I'm sorry.

1088
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:10,143
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, I can see that.

1089
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:13,947
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1090
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:15,882
No, I know. You're a good guy.

1091
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:17,384
- Don't say that.
- What do you want me to say?

1092
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:22,622
I don't know, shouldn't you get
mad, slap me or something.

1093
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,092
- Ow! Ow!
- You told me to do it.

1094
01:06:25,094 --> 01:06:27,195
But I said, "Or something."

1095
01:06:27,197 --> 01:06:29,229
I didn't hear that part.

1096
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,298
You want some ice?

1097
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:33,067
No.

1098
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,235
I'm gonna let it sting.

1099
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:40,740
They do go away, you know.

1100
01:06:41,642 --> 01:06:43,074
When?

1101
01:06:43,976 --> 01:06:45,608
Good luck, Will.

1102
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,811
It was nice while it lasted.

1103
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:51,815
Diane.

1104
01:06:54,286 --> 01:06:56,619
I really do like you.

1105
01:06:56,621 --> 01:07:00,891
You didn't even
get the chance to know me.

1106
01:07:06,098 --> 01:07:07,298
Oh!

1107
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,399
You're it!

1108
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,780
I'm gonna go talk to Daddy,
okay, girls?

1109
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:29,222
Thanks.

1110
01:07:31,992 --> 01:07:34,493
So, uh, I told Diane.

1111
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:38,497
The student's mum,
about our kiss.

1112
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:40,666
Really?

1113
01:07:40,668 --> 01:07:43,301
I thought you two
weren't even dating.

1114
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:45,404
We're definitely not now.

1115
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:47,204
I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:47,206 --> 01:07:49,740
Yeah, well. Whatever.

1117
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:52,243
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

1118
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:54,445
Yeah, did you talk to Gary?

1119
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,914
Yeah actually, I did.

1120
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:58,582
How'd that go?

1121
01:07:58,584 --> 01:08:04,188
Good, good, I think we were able to
work through most of his doubts.

1122
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:08,691
Hmm?

1123
01:08:09,995 --> 01:08:12,261
Did you tell him
about the kiss?

1124
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:13,262
I didn't tell him that.

1125
01:08:13,264 --> 01:08:15,464
- What?
- Why would I tell him that?

1126
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,500
Why not, why didn't you?

1127
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,671
It was just a kiss, Will.

1128
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:25,142
It was more than just a kiss.

1129
01:08:25,144 --> 01:08:29,012
Maybe, I'm still marrying Gary.

1130
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:29,779
I can't believe you.

1131
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:34,317
I just ended the first adult relationship
I've had in a year over that kiss.

1132
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,384
No one told you to do that.

1133
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:40,022
You're about to commit to this guy
for the rest of your life, possibly.

1134
01:08:40,024 --> 01:08:42,025
Don't you think
you should be honest with him?

1135
01:08:42,027 --> 01:08:45,094
Hey look, I'm sorry
your confused about our kiss.

1136
01:08:45,096 --> 01:08:46,762
I'm not confused.

1137
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:48,798
You're confused.

1138
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:53,201
Ok, you're right. I'm confused.

1139
01:08:53,203 --> 01:08:55,303
You see, I knew it.

1140
01:08:55,873 --> 01:08:58,206
I'm having his baby, Will.

1141
01:08:58,274 --> 01:09:00,275
What about our babies?

1142
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,144
They're not
babies anymore.

1143
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:08,782
You should tell Gary about our kiss.
He deserves to know.

1144
01:09:08,784 --> 01:09:10,651
Since when do you
care about Gary?

1145
01:09:10,653 --> 01:09:13,253
I don't, I care about you.

1146
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,821
Then let this go.

1147
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:17,755
Unbelievable.

1148
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:20,759
- Where are you going?
- What do you care?

1149
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:21,827
You're not gonna
tell him, are you?

1150
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:28,234
Oh yeah, we're best buddies, I'm gonna have
a sleepover with him in his apartment.

1151
01:12:10,491 --> 01:12:12,291
Kat, hey.

1152
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:14,326
What are you doing here?

1153
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:16,728
Uh, I came to visit you?

1154
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:19,563
How did you find out
where I was?

1155
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:20,730
Called your mother.

1156
01:12:20,732 --> 01:12:22,899
Oh, really?
I am surprised she answered.

1157
01:12:22,901 --> 01:12:28,070
Yeah, no, she didn't answer. She
refused my call and then texted me.

1158
01:12:28,072 --> 01:12:30,139
I texted back and she texted
me where you were.

1159
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:32,108
I know how texts work.

1160
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:35,377
I'm sorry.

1161
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,547
Yeah, no, it's fine,
things don't work out.

1162
01:12:38,548 --> 01:12:40,549
Happens all the time,
I already knew that.

1163
01:12:40,551 --> 01:12:44,686
I just thought that you would
be at least nice to her.

1164
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:46,188
At least.

1165
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:49,925
I read your book.

1166
01:12:50,092 --> 01:12:53,227
It's really great.
Is it about your mother?

1167
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:55,096
I thought this was
not a pipe, remember?

1168
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:58,232
Yeah, you're right,
it's not a pipe.

1169
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,600
It's a great story, though.

1170
01:13:00,602 --> 01:13:01,534
You think?

1171
01:13:01,536 --> 01:13:03,737
Yeah, I do, I really do.

1172
01:13:04,674 --> 01:13:05,105
Thank you.

1173
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:07,073
Have you shown
any of it to your mother?

1174
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:08,240
No, she wouldn't get it.

1175
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:09,541
I don't think you're
giving her enough credit.

1176
01:13:09,544 --> 01:13:13,379
No, she'd think I was exploiting all
of her terrible life decisions.

1177
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:16,116
Well uh, to be honest, her
character is a bit of a mess.

1178
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:20,987
But, it feels very real and
she's very lovingly portrayed.

1179
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:24,224
I think she'd be really proud
to see the book.

1180
01:13:24,226 --> 01:13:25,558
The pictures are beautiful.

1181
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,128
Why'd you have to turn out
to be such an asshole.

1182
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,697
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

1183
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:34,300
Yeah, so what are you gonna
get back with your ex?

1184
01:13:34,302 --> 01:13:36,269
I dunno what's going on.

1185
01:13:36,271 --> 01:13:39,273
Do you wanna know the best part
about my parents splitting up?

1186
01:13:39,275 --> 01:13:40,574
Yes, please tell me.

1187
01:13:40,576 --> 01:13:42,008
They split up.

1188
01:13:42,075 --> 01:13:43,475
That's a beautiful story.

1189
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:46,612
Thank you, it's my life, so...

1190
01:13:52,922 --> 01:13:53,587
What is this?

1191
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:57,391
It is a giant magical book
that takes you into

1192
01:13:57,393 --> 01:14:00,794
a slightly depressing
but hopefully amusing world.

1193
01:14:00,796 --> 01:14:02,763
You want me to read this?

1194
01:14:02,765 --> 01:14:04,264
Yeah.

1195
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,467
Holy crap,
are these original drawings?

1196
01:14:07,635 --> 01:14:10,135
Let me know what you think,
okay?

1197
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:13,404
Uh, yeah, okay.

1198
01:14:13,473 --> 01:14:15,105
See ya.

1199
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:02,055
I have some notes.

1200
01:15:02,057 --> 01:15:03,624
What do you mean "notes?"

1201
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:05,325
You need an ending.

1202
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,527
Hey, how do you know
where I live?

1203
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:08,560
What, dude! Come on, I'm 19.

1204
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:10,129
I know everything
about everything.

1205
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,498
So are you going to
let me in or what?

1206
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:20,106
So, what's this guy
going to do?

1207
01:15:20,108 --> 01:15:21,842
Which guy?

1208
01:15:23,212 --> 01:15:24,811
This guy.

1209
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:27,981
I don't... I don't know, what
do you think he should do?

1210
01:15:27,983 --> 01:15:29,515
Move on with his life?

1211
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:32,518
I think he is trying to.

1212
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,754
Is he? 'Cause he seems
kind of stuck.

1213
01:15:34,756 --> 01:15:35,889
Stuck in what?

1214
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:39,559
It's the middle of the day and
you're still wearing your pajamas.

1215
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:41,060
These are golf pants.

1216
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:43,228
- They're so ugly.
- I'm working.

1217
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,064
- Can I see?
- It's not really...

1218
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:46,198
Now, these are
just things that I

1219
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,734
painstakingly
drew out of anger.

1220
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:50,801
You've got to let her go.

1221
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:53,972
- Let who go?
- The person you keep drawing.

1222
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,708
I don't... I don't know
what we're talking about now.

1223
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,509
Yes, you do.

1224
01:15:58,744 --> 01:16:01,912
- So you don't like the book?
- No, I love the book.

1225
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:05,548
But I especially like
this character.

1226
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:07,683
A lot.

1227
01:16:07,685 --> 01:16:09,318
Yeah. Thank you.

1228
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,154
I like that character as well.

1229
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:13,388
Hmm.

1230
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,122
You know, I showed it to her?

1231
01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:17,024
- Why would you do that? -I live with her.
It's a big book.

1232
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:19,027
She has a few notes.
They're very good.

1233
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:21,030
Maybe you should call her up
and talk to her.

1234
01:16:21,032 --> 01:16:22,965
- I'm not going to call her.
- Why not?

1235
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:24,900
Because she told me
not to call her again.

1236
01:16:24,902 --> 01:16:25,634
Then call her anyway.

1237
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:27,837
- But she had only one rule...
- Don't call her.

1238
01:16:27,839 --> 01:16:30,940
Who cares? Just call her.
Or like, don't call her.

1239
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:32,075
Just do something... Anything!

1240
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:35,578
Otherwise, what is the whole
point of this thing?

1241
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:38,446
This place is gross.

1242
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:04,809
Please don't touch
the flowers, sir.

1243
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:05,909
Oh, no. I wasn't, I was just...

1244
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:08,779
The flowers are for looking,
not touching.

1245
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:09,880
Oh.

1246
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:11,414
This is a private event.

1247
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:12,915
Yeah, I'm invited.

1248
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:15,251
- Bride or groom?
- I'm neither.

1249
01:17:15,353 --> 01:17:17,687
Are you here
for the bride or groom?

1250
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:20,221
- Daddy!
- I'm with these guys.

1251
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:23,224
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

1252
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:24,425
Mama didn't think
you were coming.

1253
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:28,029
Do you know where Mama is?
I kind of need to talk to her.

1254
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:30,964
Is everything okay?

1255
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:41,142
Are we still going to have to
play the cello?

1256
01:17:41,144 --> 01:17:43,210
Hold that thought.

1257
01:17:58,862 --> 01:18:00,429
Oh.

1258
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:03,265
Hey, uh... It's you.

1259
01:18:03,368 --> 01:18:04,533
Hey, Gary.

1260
01:18:04,535 --> 01:18:06,735
I didn't think you were coming.

1261
01:18:07,538 --> 01:18:10,005
I need to...
I need to tell you something.

1262
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:12,240
Oh, boy. Yeah?

1263
01:18:13,008 --> 01:18:14,675
I, uh...

1264
01:18:18,646 --> 01:18:21,279
- I'm going to punch you.
- Oh?

1265
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:24,015
No, I, uh... I understand.

1266
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:26,217
I think you should.

1267
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:28,253
I don't care what you think.

1268
01:18:28,655 --> 01:18:31,423
- Stop nodding.
- Right, sorry. Oh.

1269
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:33,491
I just did it again. Um...

1270
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:34,992
What should I...
What should I do?

1271
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:38,329
You could either fight back,
or you could close your eyes.

1272
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:41,999
I... I think I'm...
I choose closing my eyes.

1273
01:18:45,337 --> 01:18:48,404
I'm just... Please don't
hit me in the face.

1274
01:18:48,406 --> 01:18:50,373
I'll punch you wherever I like.

1275
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,574
That's fair.

1276
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:53,176
Stop agreeing with me.

1277
01:18:53,178 --> 01:18:55,077
Sorry. You're right.

1278
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,480
Just whenever you're...

1279
01:18:59,984 --> 01:19:01,083
Jesus!

1280
01:19:01,085 --> 01:19:01,583
Ow! Ow!

1281
01:19:01,585 --> 01:19:04,285
- Are you... Are you okay, Gary?
- No, that was my ear, man!

1282
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:07,856
- I know, well, you said not the
face so I didn't know. -Goddamn it!

1283
01:19:07,858 --> 01:19:09,490
The ear is the face!

1284
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:11,124
I don't think of the ear
as the part of the face.

1285
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:12,059
The ear is part of the face.

1286
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:13,326
I don't think of it
as part of the face.

1287
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:15,495
Well, that's not true.
That's definitely not true.

1288
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:16,294
The ear is part of the face.

1289
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:17,996
I think the face
is this oval here.

1290
01:19:17,998 --> 01:19:19,797
That's what I teach
in drawing class.

1291
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:21,766
Okay, I... I don't think so.

1292
01:19:21,768 --> 01:19:24,068
That's not the way
I was taught, but...

1293
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,903
Shall we agree to disagree?

1294
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:28,005
Sure. Agree to disagree.

1295
01:19:29,241 --> 01:19:33,010
That was a...
That was a good hit, man.

1296
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:34,177
Thank you.

1297
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:36,246
My hand really hurts
from your ears,

1298
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:38,280
so if that's any consolation.

1299
01:19:38,282 --> 01:19:39,514
Well...

1300
01:19:40,885 --> 01:19:42,184
Do you know where she is?

1301
01:19:42,186 --> 01:19:44,453
Nobody... Nobody can find her,

1302
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:46,154
she's not answering her phone.

1303
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,622
Are you serious?

1304
01:19:47,624 --> 01:19:48,690
Why would I kid about that?

1305
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:50,358
Well, I don't know,
I don't know you.

1306
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,360
I don't know
your sense of humor.

1307
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:53,861
I'm not kidding.

1308
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:01,701
Hey, I love her, you know?

1309
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:06,105
Yeah.

1310
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,173
I know now.

1311
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:24,024
- You came.
- I came.

1312
01:20:24,026 --> 01:20:26,159
Your pants are too short.

1313
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:27,794
Yeah, I just got them.

1314
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,496
You look good.

1315
01:20:30,763 --> 01:20:32,864
There are people
looking for you.

1316
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:36,000
And only you know
where to find me.

1317
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:39,504
It kind of helped that you
texted me where you were.

1318
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:43,774
What are you doing?

1319
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,577
I'm afraid
I'm making another mistake.

1320
01:20:48,213 --> 01:20:51,113
I don't think of what we did
as a mistake.

1321
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,149
It didn't work out.

1322
01:20:53,451 --> 01:20:54,783
It did...

1323
01:20:54,785 --> 01:20:56,619
And then it didn't.

1324
01:20:57,387 --> 01:20:59,388
What does that mean?

1325
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:00,655
It means...

1326
01:21:00,657 --> 01:21:03,290
We can't predict
what's going to happen.

1327
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,693
Or how we're going to change.

1328
01:21:13,537 --> 01:21:15,470
I love you.

1329
01:21:16,908 --> 01:21:18,473
I love you, too.

1330
01:21:18,475 --> 01:21:22,244
But if you wait any longer, you're
going to miss your wedding.

1331
01:21:23,448 --> 01:21:25,114
Are we friends?

1332
01:21:25,216 --> 01:21:27,115
We're more than that.

1333
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,983
What are we?

1334
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:32,319
We're parents.

1335
01:21:49,774 --> 01:21:52,308
- Okay, you first.
- No.
