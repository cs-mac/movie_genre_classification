1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,932
<i>Jason.</i>

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,154
<i>It's like this.</i>

3
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,126
<i>We live in claustrophobia,</i>

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,064
<i>a land of steel and concrete
trapped by dark waters.</i>

5
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,932
<i>There is no escape, nor do we want it.</i>

6
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,867
<i>We've come to thrive on it
and each other.</i>

7
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,277
<i>You can't get the adrenaline pumping
without the terror, good people.</i>

8
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,206
<i>I love this town.</i>

9
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,619
<i>You've been listening to WGAZ,
the electricity of Manhattan.</i>

10
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,321
<i>This request is going
all the way out to Crystal Lake</i>

11
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,954
<i>and the senior class of Lakeview High.</i>

12
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,429
- That's us.
-All right.

13
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,934
<i>They'll be graduating
on the 13th of this month,</i>

14
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,972
<i>and we wish them
the best of luck and success</i>

15
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>when they come to visit
our seductive city.</i>

16
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,443
<i>Our lure is a great one,
young friends, but beware.</i>

17
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,576
<i>The city of lights
casts many shadows indeed.</i>

18
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,583
- I love you.
-I love you.

19
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,437
- Gotta throw the anchor over.
-Okay.

20
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,468
- Hey, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

21
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,108
Come on, Jimmy,
something's bothering you.

22
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,576
Just that we're right around
that summer camp

23
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,912
where all those murders took place.

24
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,913
- What murders?
-You don't wanna know about it.

25
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,854
- Tell me.
-Forget about it, Suzi.

26
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,253
The guy's dead now,

27
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,923
somewhere at the bottom of this lake
if you believe the stories.

28
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,157
What stories?

29
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,398
There was this boy
named Jason Voorhees

30
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,469
<i>who drowned in Crystal Lake
about 30 years ago.</i>

31
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,439
None of the counselors heard him.

32
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,707
Help!

33
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,276
<i>A bunch of years went by,
and everyone forgot about it.</i>

34
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,285
And that's when the murders
started to happen.

35
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,981
Jason did it?

36
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,157
His mother blamed the counselors
for her son's death,

37
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,555
and she tried to kill them all,

38
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,360
but she got her head chopped off
by one of them.

39
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,028
Legend has it that Jason
came back to get even,

40
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,732
vowing to kill every teenager in the area.

41
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,705
And every now and then,
the murders just start up.

42
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,448
Forget about it, Suzi.
They're just stories.

43
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,982
Did you hear that?

44
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,986
- Hear what?
-Come on, I'm serious.

45
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,866
All right. I'll go check it out.

46
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,619
Jim?

47
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,489
<i>Jimmy?</i>

48
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,176
Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it.

49
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,102
Got you good, Suzi.

50
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,020
All right, all right, so I'm a major ass.

51
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,951
- And you'll never do it again?
-And I'll never do it again.

52
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,258
- Come on, forgive me?
-No.

53
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,010
Jason?

54
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,732
No! No, please, no!

55
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,440
No. No. No, please, no!

56
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,677
No! No!

57
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,577
No! No!

58
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,573
No! No!

59
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,443
Well, Toby's been
awful quiet back there.

60
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,077
Yeah, I guess he's a little nervous
about the trip.

61
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,815
Here.

62
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,623
Go on, open it.

63
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,132
Stephen King supposedly
used it in high school.

64
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,442
I don't know what to say.

65
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,948
Rennie, you are the best student
I have ever had.

66
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,149
You have a real gift.

67
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,885
And if there's anybody that can
make use of that pen, it's you.

68
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,634
Hi!

69
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,686
- Hello, Charles.
-Colleen.

70
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,980
You know, this cruise was your idea,

71
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,958
so at the very least,
you could show up on time.

72
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,191
- Has everyone checked in?
-No.

73
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,756
Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson
never showed up,

74
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,893
and I'm more than a little concerned.

75
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,904
Well, don't be. They probably
decided to explore each other

76
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,997
rather than New York.

77
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,575
That's nice.
We're running five minutes late already.

78
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,313
There's someone else coming, too.

79
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,500
You never should have
brought her here.

80
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,600
It's up to Rennie to decide
what she wants to do.

81
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,271
She doesn't know what she wants.

82
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,940
She never had a stable life
till she came to live with me.

83
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,279
Well, she ceﬂainly doesn't
have one now, either.

84
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,343
I'm her legal guardian,
not you or anybody else,

85
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,051
and I know what's best for her.
End of discussion.

86
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,328
No, I think it's just the beginning.

87
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,034
Have you decided
on your departure protocol, Admiral?

88
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,266
Actually, I thought
I'd leave that honor to my son.

89
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,709
Dad, I don't...
I don't think that's necessary.

90
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,711
Relinquishing command
of the motor vessel Lazarus

91
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,838
to Captain Sean Robertson.

92
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:50,082
But before you take the helm, take this.

93
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,027
Something old and something new.

94
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,769
I used that sextant when I was your age.

95
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,136
Now they got those goddamn
computers that do all the work for you.

96
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,005
Have you decided
on a plan of departure, Captain?

97
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,684
Okay-

98
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,882
How about we start up the engines
and come around 180 degrees?

99
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,696
Aren't you forgetting something, mister?

100
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,108
Send out
the international maritime signal,

101
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,204
followed by a security broadcast

102
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,647
warning other ships
that we are underway.

103
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,043
This voyage is doomed.

104
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,512
Yeah, tell me about it.

105
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,584
Bye !

106
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,254
- Have fun in New York!
-Bye!

107
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,035
- Rennie.
-Hi, Sean.

108
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,745
I heard you weren't coming.

109
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,147
We changed our minds.

110
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,059
- I got you a present.
-But I didn't get you one.

111
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,858
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.

112
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,668
Sean, I love it.

113
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,070
You see, I thought when we got there,

114
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,876
maybe we could hike
to the top of the statue

115
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,746
if you felt like it.

116
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,779
It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.

117
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,654
That sounds wonderful.

118
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,528
Mr. Robertson,
your father was looking for you.

119
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,822
I guess I'll see you later.

120
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,575
What are you doing here?
We've already been through all of this.

121
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,541
I'm sorry, Uncle Charles.
Please don't be upset with me.

122
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,051
I'm not upset. I'm just concerned.

123
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,172
<i>Is this ax awesome or what?</i>

124
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,720
Too cool, J.J.
Your parents really came through.

125
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,722
No lie.

126
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,291
Hey, I hear there's
this big power room downstairs.

127
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,026
We can get supreme concert-hall echo.

128
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,467
So come on down and shoot
a basement tape on me, okay?

129
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,131
Yeah. But I gotta get some
shockumentary footage first.

130
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,273
Oh, man. Don't tell me
you're still trying to scam on Tamara.

131
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,548
How long have we known each other?

132
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,075
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne.

133
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,116
She's not interested in you,
only what you can do for her.

134
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,218
- She is a user.
-She's sexy.

135
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,186
So what? So is this guitar.

136
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,656
Yeah. Well, I'll talk to you later,
all right?

137
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,355
There's a big storm
predicted for tonight.

138
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,726
Rennie, you're making a big mistake.

139
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,356
<i>It's not too late to put you back on shore.</i>

140
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,762
If Miss Van Deusen
knew how afraid you were of...

141
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,066
She didn't push me into this.

142
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,406
Rennie, why are you doing this
to yourself?

143
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,474
I don't even know what I'm afraid of,
Uncle Charles.

144
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,584
I can't even remember when it started.

145
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,444
Don't you think it's time I found out
and got over it?

146
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,492
Facing your fear
doesn't always conquer it.

147
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,758
I'm staying.

148
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,033
Okay-

149
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,809
Man, this place is aching for a video!

150
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,938
Wayne, you're an asshole.

151
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:14,956
Help!

152
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,279
So, what do you think?

153
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,087
Time for some personal experiences
to fuel our minds?

154
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,060
I agree.

155
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,163
<i>Mommy?</i>

156
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,660
Help! Help me!

157
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,300
Help!

158
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,604
Toby!

159
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,411
- Come on!
-Yeah!

160
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,718
Come on.

161
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,423
Is that a muscular bod or what?

162
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,647
<i>One more, one more!</i>

163
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,264
He's undefeated, you know that?

164
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,592
Julius is the only senior
I'd even consider doing it with.

165
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,701
He is so good-looking.

166
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,773
Gorgeous guy at 10 o'clock.
Look sensual.

167
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,923
I think it's time
for some recreational activity, girl.

168
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,067
Have you seen my niece anywhere?

169
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,701
Yeah, I think she's motivating
downstairs, Mr. McCulloch.

170
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,938
What's the problem?

171
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,379
Well, senior predictions
staﬂed five minutes ago,

172
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,846
and she hasn't shown up yet.

173
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,609
Well, maybe some of us
don't want our futures predicted.

174
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,746
Well, in your case, I'm sure that's true.

175
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,394
Nighttime is the right time.

176
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,639
No, thanks.

177
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,767
Don't be a lightweight.
This is top-dollar toot.

178
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,207
It's not that. It's just, you know,

179
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,372
if we get caught, I could lose
my science scholarship and everything.

180
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,347
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva.

181
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,442
Do you really think
I'm gonna risk getting caught?

182
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,464
- Jesus!
-Have you guys seen my dog?

183
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,432
I think he came this way.

184
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,360
No, we haven't. Did you care for a hit?

185
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,505
No, thanks.

186
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,773
Real space cadet.
I wonder if she'll narc on us.

187
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,552
Here, boy!

188
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,920
Oh, yeah.
Ready to party and then some.

189
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,559
- What are you doing in here?
-Nothing.

190
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,005
Are you girls using drugs?

191
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,966
Do you think I would use drugs,
Mr. McCulloch?

192
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,406
We're just exploring the ship.

193
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,376
I'll be coming around to your stateroom
in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason,

194
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:14,290
so you better have your biology project
ready, or I'll be phoning your parents.

195
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,855
They're out of town.

196
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,797
Well, I'll make sure
that you remain on board

197
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,428
while your classmates
are out seeing the sights.

198
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,343
- Now what?
-Relax.

199
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,116
I've got McCulloch covered.

200
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,448
That narcing bitch niece of his
is a different matter.

201
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,159
Rumor has it she's a teensy bit
afraid of the water.

202
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,242
Nice fight, Julius. Guess I need
to work on my left-right-left combo.

203
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,648
Hey, listen.
No hard feelings, man, okay?

204
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,519
What do you say we track down
those babes later?

205
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,693
Julius?

206
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,822
- So are you having fun yet?
-Yeah, a lot.

207
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,896
Come on, level with me.

208
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,630
Hey, if you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

209
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,507
It was an accident, I swear.

210
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,019
Stay calm
and grab the life preserver, Rennie!

211
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,724
I've got you. Come on. I've got you.

212
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,358
- That was truly excellent.
-Yeah.

213
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,663
Come on. Time to check out the waiters.

214
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,001
Look, I think I'll pass, okay?

215
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,166
- What?
-I'll see you later.

216
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,544
Some friend you are.

217
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,777
- Come on, grab her hand!
-That was close.

218
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,618
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
Come here. Sit down. Sit down.

219
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,581
- Grab her some towels, okay?
-Okay.

220
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,528
She's fine. She's... Just go back to what
you were doing, okay, everybody?

221
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,233
Care to talk about it?

222
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,027
I can't swim.

223
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,397
No kidding.

224
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,105
You ever thought about taking lessons?

225
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,645
It's not that simple.

226
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,337
Good God!

227
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,115
- Take it easy, Charles. She's all right.
-I can see that.

228
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,087
You've done a wonderful job
of supervising the kids.

229
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,317
What the hell happened here?

230
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,451
- It wasn't her fault.
-Give me those towels.

231
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,460
You stay away from her. Both of you!

232
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,695
He's come back,
and you're all gonna die.

233
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,772
Just leave me alone.

234
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,413
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

235
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,925
The door's open.

236
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,002
I'm in no mood for any more
of your stall tactics, Miss Mason.

237
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,603
Where is your final project?

238
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,743
Wouldn't you like
a glass of champagne first, Charles?

239
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,640
Where did you get this?

240
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,087
Well, I packed it just for us.

241
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,649
Well, that's it.

242
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,350
You're not stepping off this ship
until we return home.

243
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,491
But I haven't even shown you
my biology project.

244
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,902
Hey...

245
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,142
What do you think you're doing?

246
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,846
I mean...

247
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,284
Now, you stop that!

248
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,183
I mean, really.

249
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,154
Take a closer look, Charles.

250
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,188
I wanna make sure I've labeled
all my organs correctly.

251
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,986
Get... Get off of me! I don't believe this.

252
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,384
What do you think you're...
I'm your teacher, young lady.

253
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,596
Well, now you've gone and done it.
Not only are you going home,

254
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,961
but I will... I will see to it personally

255
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:38,696
that you spend next year
back in a high school classroom.

256
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,670
What is going on here?

257
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,008
- Did you get anything good?
-Oh, yeah. Very kinky.

258
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,414
- Give me that tape. Give it to me!
-Come and get it.

259
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,614
You're going to be very, very sorry,
young lady.

260
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:02,457
And as for you, you can forget
about attending any film school.

261
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,322
Ever!

262
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,496
Relax, Wayne.
He's not gonna risk trying a thing.

263
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,574
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.

264
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,982
Listen, this is gonna sound
supremely lame and I know it,

265
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:30,614
<i>but I've had the major hots for you
since our sophomore year, Tamara.</i>

266
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,724
That's so sweet, Wayne.

267
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,231
And I really would love to stay and chat,

268
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,766
but I really am pressed for time.

269
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,431
So let's be sure to get together later.
Okey-doke?

270
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,736
- Yeah, I just thought...
-Yeah.

271
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,936
But I... Maybe we could...

272
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,315
Wayne, you're an asshole.

273
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,185
Oh, no! No!

274
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,882
No!

275
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,997
No! No, no!

276
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:17,281
Let's kick in the stabilizers, Mr. Carlson.
Keep the seas off the quarter.

277
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,789
Yes, sir.

278
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,688
These kids are
in for one hell of a storm.

279
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,919
Yeah.

280
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,376
- How old is your boy now, Carlson?
-Nineteen months.

281
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,940
Tremendous age.

282
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,852
Take some advice.
Don't push him too hard.

283
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,554
Yeah.

284
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,824
- Take the helm, would you, Jim?
-Certainly, sir.

285
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,270
I double-checked
those lifeboat stations, too.

286
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,799
Oh, my God!

287
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,765
Can he really take us home?

288
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,739
He can call
a Coast Guard cutter for you.

289
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,208
What about you? Are you staying here?

290
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,043
I'm never gonna be
what he wants me to be,

291
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,379
so I guess I'm going with you.

292
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,055
Oh, Jesus.

293
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,961
Dad?

294
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,566
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
-No.

295
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:02,317
<i>Attention, everybody. Attention.
This is Sean Robertson.</i>

296
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,753
Miles, have you seen J.J.?
She's supposed to be jamming

297
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,813
-down in the power room, but...
-Just...

298
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:12,352
<i>What I mean... This is an emergency.
I want you all to come to the bridge.</i>

299
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,090
What the fuck is this?

300
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,798
mayday-

301
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,732
mayday-

302
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,505
Mayday!

303
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,402
Shit.

304
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,769
This is the motor vessel Lazarus.

305
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,616
Sean, what's going on?

306
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,611
Jesus Christ.

307
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,379
Please, can anybody out there hear me?

308
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,921
<i>This is the Coast Guard cutter Dallas.</i>

309
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,926
<i>What's the nature
of your problem, Lazarus?</i>

310
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,393
Thank God.

311
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,830
Hello?

312
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:57,572
- Hello, are you there?
-I demand to know what is going on!

313
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,507
Christ.

314
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,449
Sean, I'm...

315
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,948
Where's the radio?

316
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,357
It's dead.

317
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,528
You're all gonna die.

318
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,198
You're the last ones.
He's come back for you.

319
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,371
- What the hell are you talking about?
-Jason Voorhees.

320
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,371
You're insane! Jason Voorhees
has been dead for years.

321
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,105
He came down the river,
and he's gotten on board.

322
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,914
He walks this ship here and now.

323
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:43,544
Yes, a killer walks this ship, all right.
And it's certainly none of us,

324
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,090
-you bastard!
-What are you... What are you doing?

325
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,386
You're the one who's insane.

326
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:56,389
That lunatic has been spouting off
about Jason ever since he came aboard,

327
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,367
and it's no coincidence.

328
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,529
But that doesn't prove that he's the one.

329
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,198
Walking corpses are not real.

330
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,006
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, these dead
bodies are sure enough real, all right?

331
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,247
Now, I say we regroup

332
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,946
and let's go find this motherfucker
before he finds us, huh?

333
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,580
- Are you with me?
-Watch your mouth, young man!

334
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,853
And you'll do no such thing.
I'm in charge here!

335
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,355
School is out, McCulloch. Okay?

336
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,104
Let's go.

337
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,472
You come back here!

338
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,249
Christ. Where's Rennie?

339
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,323
She's dropping the anchors.

340
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:53,653


341
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,325
You had me worried to death.

342
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,624
But Sean said
that we needed to drop the anchors.

343
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,098
I'm the one you should be listening to.

344
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,191
Do you think dropping an anchor
in the middle of a storm

345
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,600
makes any sense whatsoever?

346
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,137
Come on.

347
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,641
Tamara?

348
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,572
Tamara, did you hear
the announcement?

349
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,977
Help me!

350
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:48,658
I managed to scrounge this shit up
in the game rooms and the hallways.

351
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,023
All right, grab what you want.

352
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,195
- What are you taking, Julius?
-Nothing

353
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,933
but this gun.

354
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,951
J.J.?

355
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,518
J.J.?

356
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,455
Are you down here?

357
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,230
J.J.?

358
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,799
You got a major problem, Wayne.

359
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,039
Shit, I can't see a damn thing.

360
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,999
No.

361
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,274
No.

362
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,780
J.J.?

363
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,844
Did you find Rennie?

364
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,350
She's locked safely in her room,
no thanks to either of you.

365
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,183
Have you brought her
back on course yet?

366
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,484
He's doing the best he can.

367
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,350
He's the son of a captain,
for Christ's sakes.

368
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,952
He ought to be able
to operate this thing.

369
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,723
Well, do something.

370
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:50,326
<i>- It worked. We're back on course.
-Good.</i>

371
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,801
- What's that?
-The fire alarm.

372
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,480
We've already thought about that.

373
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,485
Nobody could possibly see
a flare gun in this storm.

374
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,749
There's only one person
who needs to see it.

375
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,055
I'm gonna find that deck hand.

376
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,183
But what about the fire?

377
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,526
- How do we know there really is one?
-What are you talking about?

378
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,462
USE some common SENSE.

379
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,829
Setting off a fire alarm causes panic,

380
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,528
the same kind of panic
caused by suggesting

381
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:30,130
that Jason Voorhees is alive
and aboard this ship.

382
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,971
Enough is enough.

383
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,963
<i>Help me;</i>

384
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,078
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

385
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,407
Rennie.

386
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,313
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

387
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,418
- What is that?
-The power room.

388
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,826
All right, listen, everybody.

389
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,300
I want you to stay here until I get 
back with the others, all right?

390
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,200
- You understand?
-Yes.

391
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,077
Water's gotten into the engines.

392
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,198
We have to get everybody off the ship!

393
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,261
Rennie! Hang on!

394
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,603
Sean!

395
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,331
Rennie! What the... Let go of her!

396
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,265
She never should have set foot
on this ship. It's all your fault!

397
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:03,863
This is Jason's fault.

398
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,840
Not another word about Jason,
do you hear me?

399
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,502
No, I don't!

400
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:12,482
It's time you listen to me
if you want off this ship alive.

401
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,350
Thank God. I just lowered the lifeboat.

402
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,381
We have to go.

403
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,657
Wait! I left the others in the restaurant.

404
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,119
There is no more restaurant.

405
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,097
Come on, honey.

406
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,409
Get back!

407
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,105
Son of a bitch!

408
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,686
Come on, Charles.

409
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,132
Here, grab my hand!

410
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,470
- Come on, now.
-Come on!

411
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,944
Hurry HP!

412
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,749
Watch it. Watch it. Hurry, now.

413
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,788
Come on. Come on. Come on.

414
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:31,725
- Sean! Careful.
-Come on.

415
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,563
Grab on to my arm. That's it.

416
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,362
- Stall rowing!
-Come on!

417
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,337
Come on! Come on!

418
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,254
Julius!

419
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,250
Pull him in.

420
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,403
Keep rowing!

421
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,313
I hope you can find shore soon, Captain.

422
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,585
We all don't wanna drown out here.

423
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,352
Do you have any idea
where we are, Sean?

424
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,100
Hey. Hey, Sean.

425
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,973
Come on, man. I made it. So can you.

426
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,407
All right, man.

427
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,919
Hey, man. Yo. Yo, wake up.

428
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:25,699
Shit! Check it out! Damn!
We're in New York!

429
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,265
You did it, man! You did it!

430
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,569
We are in New York. New York City!

431
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,508
Yeah!

432
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,841
I don't believe it. We made it!

433
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:45,548
<i>If I can make it there</i>

434
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:49,421
<i>I'll make it anywhere</i>

435
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:55,295
<i>It's up to you, New York, New York</i>

436
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,749
There must be a phone
around here somewhere.

437
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:19,413
Wonderful choice of places
to dock a boat, Mr. Robeﬂson.

438
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,556
Wonderful.

439
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,326
- I can't believe we made it.
-I can't believe we're still alive.

440
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,426
We are all very lucky.

441
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,007
Give me your money.

442
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,108
Everybody, shut up
and give him the money. Now!

443
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,885
Give me the money. Come on.

444
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,117
Here.

445
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,530
Got some good shit here, holmes.

446
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,430
You got that right.

447
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,267
Give me your wallet. Come on!

448
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,910
- Now, ain't that sweet?
-Bastard!

449
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,313
Go ahead, Superman, be a hero.

450
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:58,143
- Hey, come on, now...
-You got a problem, dad?

451
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,789
No!

452
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,996
- Please don't hull her.
-Hull this princess?

453
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,532
Would I do that?

454
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,270
You look like a real party girl, princess.

455
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,005
You wanna go on a date
with me and my friend?

456
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,049
If you're free, that is.

457
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,352
Follow us, we blow her fucking head off.

458
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,919
So, what, we just gonna stand here?
Let's go.

459
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,661
Julius! Calm down, will you?
You heard what he said. He'll kill her!

460
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,295
We have to find the police.

461
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,338
Now, look.

462
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:55,268
I think we'll be more productive
if we split up, okay?

463
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:00,577
- All right, but, Charles, suppose we...
-Colleen, no discussions now, please!

464
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,933
Help! Stop it! Help!

465
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,968
Somebody help me!

466
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,769
Shut the fuck up!

467
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,945
Welcome to the casbah, princess.

468
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,148
Please, don't hull me.

469
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:46,587
Loosen up, baby.
You'll feel way better if you're stoned.

470
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,440
Better slang us some more 'caine, JoJo.
We only got a half load here.

471
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,904
We're in for a long night.

472
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,049
It's your parade, princess.

473
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,288
It can be smooth. It can be rough.

474
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,390
It's your choice.

475
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,265
Come on, baby. Lay back and enjoy it.

476
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,546
I think I'm in love.

477
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,430
Forgot my money, holmes.

478
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,136
Who the fuck are you?

479
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,700
You're dead, fuckhead.

480
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:26,789
Shit!

481
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,874
Help!

482
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,403
Come on.

483
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:15,671
Operator, this is an emergency.
Give me the police.

484
01:10:56,151 --> 01:11:00,019
Use the combos, keep the feet light.
This is it.

485
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,413
Take your best shot,

486
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,214
motherfucker.

487
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:25,365
- Rennie? What did they do to you?
-He's here, Sean.

488
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,863
- Jason is here.
-Oh, God.

489
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,840
We have to find the others now.

490
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,189
- Freeze!
-it's okay. She's with me.

491
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,556
My apologies, miss. Are you all right?

492
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,324
Hey!

493
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,893
Rennie! Rennie. Rennie. Thank God.

494
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,897
Are you okay?

495
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,781
Mr. McCulloch,
Jason is here in New York.

496
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:20,219
- Rennie saw him.
-Just shut up about Jason, will you?

497
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,854
Is it true, Rennie?

498
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:34,166
You're right. I find it a tall tale indeed,
but you seem like honest folk,

499
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,466
so I'm inclined to believe
at least some of what you say.

500
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:40,168
Yeah, well, first order of business
is to find Julius.

501
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,911
I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough.
I'll call for backup.

502
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,075
Oh, Jesus!

503
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,521
Dispatch! Dispatch!

504
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,627
- Open the door!
-There aren't any handles.

505
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,165
No handles!

506
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:14,038
Hold it! Rennie, what are you doing?

507
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,949
For God's sake, Rennie, slow down!

508
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,910
Come on!

509
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,645
Rennie, quickly! Let's move!

510
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,686
Miss Van Deusen!

511
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:12,325
It's so pretty today.

512
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,425
Yeah.

513
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,957
Perfect day for swimming.

514
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,630
You know, young lady,
you've been coming out here

515
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,071
every summer for the last three years

516
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,110
and you still haven't learned
how to swim.

517
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:32,314
I'll take some lessons this time.
I promise.

518
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,444
Now, that's what you said last year.

519
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:42,956
I think the time has come
for your first swimming lesson.

520
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:48,561
You don't wanna end up drowning
like that Voorhees boy, do you?

521
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,894
He never learned how to swim, either.

522
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,427
And he's still in the bottom of this lake.

523
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,940
- He is not.
-Yes, indeed, he is.

524
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:04,944
And he's ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can't swim.

525
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,513
You're telling a lie.

526
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:11,251
Am I? Let's find out.

527
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:22,057
You better swim, Rennie,
before Jason pulls you down.

528
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,191
- I can't!
-Yes, you can, and you will!

529
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:28,093
Come on! Rennie, swim!

530
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,844
You pushed me into the lake.

531
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,055
Rennie, I...

532
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,387
I was only trying to teach you.

533
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,257
You almost killed me. I was drowning.

534
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,291
I pulled you out. I saved your life.

535
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,199
You son of a bitch.

536
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,465
He was down there.

537
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,504
Rennie!

538
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,072
Just keep away from her!

539
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,511
Rennie!

540
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,963
You. You.

541
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,528
It's... It's not possible.

542
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,743
Please! Wait!

543
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:55,047
I'm begging you! Please!

544
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:48,770
I was at school when they told me.

545
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,071
"Rennie, your parents died
in a car accident."

546
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:01,171
It just seems like everybody I care about,
I lose.

547
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,021
That's not gonna happen this time.

548
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,997
Help!

549
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,518
- What are you doing?
-What is this?

550
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,780
- This isn't my stop!
-Come on!

551
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,085
Get it moving!

552
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,173
It's over.

553
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,547
- Somebody please help us!
-Go!

554
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:23,365
You're dead meat, slimebag!

555
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,374
Yo, man. It's cool. It's cool, man.
It's cool.

556
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,091
Times Diner. Yeah.

557
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,155
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're open till 3:00 a.m. like always.

558
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:51,596
Look, you've got to call the police.

559
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,761
There's a pay phone in back.
But it's broke.

560
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:59,398
Look, you don't understand.
There is a maniac trying to kill us.

561
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:03,175
Welcome to New York.

562
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,584
Son of a bitch.

563
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:14,611
Come on!

564
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,490
Come on!

565
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,347
What the hell are you kids
doing down here?

566
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,016
Can you help us get out of here?

567
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,321
Sure can,
but we haven't got a minute to spare.

568
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:34,828
- What do you mean?
-Toxic waste, son.

569
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,823
The sewer floods out with the stuff
every night at midnight,

570
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,799
less than 10 minutes from now.

571
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:41,357
Come on, follow me.

572
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,650
You didn't get me in the lake,
and you're not gonna get me now.

573
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,316
Sean. Sean, get up!

574
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,757
Get up, Sean!

575
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,572
Go!

576
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,335
Climb!

577
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:42,215
<i>Mommy! Don't let me drown!</i>

578
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,919
<i>Mommy!</i>

579
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:30,329
<i>Help! Help!</i>

580
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:44,769
I hear there's a statue here
that's 22 stories tall.

581
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:18,799
Toby!
