1
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:25,464
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely kind of a guy...

2
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:28,597
who'd resigned himself
to the fact that love was blind.

3
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:32,234
''Now, if love is blind, ''
he thought to himself...

4
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,678
''How will it find me?

5
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,313
''lt honestly seems such a crime.

6
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,980
''For how many times
has love knocked on the door...

7
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:43,749
''when it should have been
knocking on mine?''

8
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:49,254
And so one day, he went off
in search of the aloof creature.

9
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:52,592
He soon happened upon
the cute and fuzzy bunny gang.

10
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,632
Perhaps they could help him.

11
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,629
''Pardon me, cute and fuzzy bunnies, ''
he said.

12
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,238
''l wonder if you could help me find love. ''

13
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,974
''Love would have nothing to do...

14
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:10,037
''with such a stupid-looking creature, ''
said the first cute and fuzzy bunny.

15
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:13,376
''With that nose. And those shoes. ''

16
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,047
''And that stomach. ''

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,417
''And those eyes. ''

18
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:18,115
''And those ears. ''

19
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:22,316
''Roses are red, violets are blue...

20
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:26,230
''but love will have
nothing to do with you! ''

21
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:29,599
They chanted and danced around him.

22
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,929
Naturally, our hero
was very saddened by this, so...

23
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:35,495
he....

24
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,301
Actually, he....

25
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,807
He reached into his suitcase...

26
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,279
and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun...

27
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:46,181
and he sawed those
cute, fuzzy bastards in half...

28
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,185
with hot lead!

29
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,821
lt was beautiful!

30
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:53,517
Wait, stop! No, no.

31
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,719
It's supposed to be a Iove story
not a Rambo bIoodbath.

32
00:01:57,496 --> 00:02:00,021
Forget it. It's not your fauIt. It's me.

33
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:09,273
Morty, how am I going to get this done?

34
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,033
What do you know?
You're not a man. You're a cat.

35
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,874
Go back to your feIine worId.
Get out of here.

36
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:23,110
You better move it, Hoops.
You'II miss graduation.

37
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:24,382
Okay, Mom.

38
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,990
Here's your cap and gown. AII cIean.

39
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:30,256
-What do you mean, ''AII cIean''?
-Hoops, these are rented.

40
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,421
Do you know
how many peopIe wear them?

41
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:33,794
I washed them.

42
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:34,830
Rita Segal.

43
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,835
Solomon Shapiro. Frank Stephens.

44
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:44,765
Shirley Strom.

45
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,508
I got to get out of Generic this summer.
I'm gonna Iose my mind.

46
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:52,277
Come to Nantucket with me.
We'II have a bIast.

47
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,410
-We'II scaIe the mermaids.
-I can't be a party monkey.

48
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:56,749
I got to buckIe down.

49
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:59,586
I've got two weeks to submit
my schoIarship assignment.

50
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,752
It's my onIy chance to get into
Rhode IsIand SchooI of Design.

51
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:05,490
It's summer.
We're high schooI graduates now.

52
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:10,291
It's time to reap the rewards of four years
of hard, grueIing, mind-expanding work.

53
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,399
-What's this word?
-Your Iast name.

54
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,232
Georgina Williams.

55
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,844
The assignment is supposed to be
an iIIustrated Iove story.

56
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,814
What do I know about Iove?
I've never been in Iove.

57
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:28,717
l would like to congratulate
the 1986 graduating class...

58
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,017
of Generic New York High School!

59
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:53,568
I think what you reaIIy need
is a break from your mom.

60
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,740
You're gonna end up
being a street cIeaner...

61
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,306
because you didn't get
your basketbaII schoIarship?

62
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:01,818
-I guess she's taking it hard.
-Of course she is.

63
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,583
It's Iike my mom saying
I'm an irresponsibIe Iouse.

64
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:07,352
I know that she knows
I'm not irresponsibIe.

65
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:12,930
Your mother stiII has faith in you, Hoops.

66
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,760
Just because you can't
pIay basketbaII worth a shit...

67
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,064
doesn't mean
you got no other option in Iife.

68
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:20,331
-I guess you're right.
-There you go.

69
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,896
Nothing proves that more
than being surprised...

70
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:25,033
with your brand-new graduation wheeIs.

71
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,069
That finaI, parentaI confirmation
that you're going somewhere in Iife.

72
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:32,043
And this is just the vehicIe
to take you there.

73
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,483
Nantucket. When can we Ieave?

74
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,449
Just got to pick up my sister.

75
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,188
And, Hoops, remember...

76
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,992
never say anything about her dog.

77
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,382
Bye-bye. Have a nice summer.

78
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,484
Squid, you and oId Boscoe
going to visit Grandma this summer?

79
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:19,325
Dog from Mars!

80
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,566
It's so ugIy. Someone put it to sIeep.

81
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:33,139
GirIs, if you make faces Iike that
and somebody sIaps you on the back...

82
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:36,075
you'II stay that way forever!

83
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:42,084
Stop that! Go on! Have a nice summer!

84
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:46,451
Dog from space!

85
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:21,154
There sure are some ugIy-Iooking kids
running around here.

86
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,801
Where's this pIace, anyway?

87
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,503
First stop's a IittIe pIace caIIed
Woods HoIe.

88
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,558
Okay, Cassandra...

89
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,858
aII I want is my money.

90
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,696
It's my money, and you know it!

91
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,205
No! It's definiteIy mine.

92
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,105
Trust me.

93
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,503
Excuse me, guys. Looking for this?

94
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:21,704
Get him!

95
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:23,710
George, get us out of here!

96
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,842
So Iong, sucker.

97
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,852
It's my money!

98
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:40,962
-Who are your friends?
-Maniacs! Get us out of here! Go!

99
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,027
Hurry up! They're gaining on us!

100
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:48,168
-Hi.
-Hi. Who are you?

101
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,231
-I'm Cassandra.
-George. The pIeasure's mine.

102
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,174
We're heading for the docks!

103
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,269
-We got to make the boat.
-What boat?

104
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:58,747
You think we're driving to Nantucket?
Come on, it's an isIand!

105
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:03,879
You never mentioned any boat.
I'm not getting on any boat.

106
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:05,320
I beg to differ.

107
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,525
What are you doing? It's aIready Ieft!

108
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,929
-We'II make it.
-We'II make it?

109
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,490
You might want
to brace yourseIves, though.

110
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:48,489
Get me out of here!

111
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,295
Now!

112
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,507
This is going to be a great summer.

113
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:04,977
I want you to die.

114
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:08,585
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely guy...

115
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,587
on a quest for love.

116
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:13,919
The cute, fuzzy bunnies
were quick to cooperate this time.

117
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:17,661
The path they sent him on
landed him on an ocean-going vessel.

118
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,130
Our hero hated boats,
but he was desperate on his quest...

119
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:25,229
and once again he fell victim
to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies.

120
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,533
And he was sucked
into the cold, dark sea...

121
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,596
and he never found love.

122
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:46,480
-Are you aII right?
-Me?

123
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:49,624
Yeah, great. ReaIIy good. Why?

124
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,863
I don't know,
you Iook pretty uncomfortabIe.

125
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,562
Are you afraid of water?

126
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:01,497
No, not reaIIy. Yeah.

127
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:05,738
ActuaIIy, I am afraid of the water.

128
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,109
But this is a big boat,
a Iot of safety equipment...

129
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,747
I can see the Iand.

130
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,849
CIean, fresh air....

131
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,514
ChiIidog.

132
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,279
Go away.

133
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,718
-You Iive on the isIand?
-Just for the summer.

134
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,731
-I'm heIping out my grandfather.
-What kind of heIp?

135
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,666
He's got a housefuI of friends
he's taking care of.

136
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,998
He's having money probIems.
I was working in a dive...

137
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,336
trying to heIp him out, but I got ripped off.

138
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:39,171
Is that what that was about,
the big scene back there?

139
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,372
-Wish I couId've heIped more.
-Come on, you were great.

140
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,709
You sure? Last bite.

141
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,045
WiII you get out of here with this?

142
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,521
You kids!

143
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,848
Come on! This is gonna be funny.

144
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,782
AII the eggs, they're broken!

145
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:29,287
CIay, if you don't stand on the right side...

146
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,385
you're defeating the entire purpose...

147
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:33,362
of buying them, you big mess!

148
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,799
Mess!

149
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:41,532
There they are. The Stork twins.

150
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,330
Those guys? They're twins?

151
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:45,342
CIay's a coupIe minutes oIder.

152
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:47,808
The Stork twins!

153
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:52,412
-This is Hoops.
-AIoha!

154
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,206
Hi, Hoops!

155
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,185
I'm gonna go get the car.

156
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:57,778
Hey, SquidIy!

157
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,291
This is going to be a great shot.

158
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,361
-Maybe we'II see each other.
-Hope so.

159
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,800
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you, too.

160
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:13,964
Hey, Stork guys!

161
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,972
Hi, Hoops. How do you do?

162
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,167
Hi. It's very, it's very....

163
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:21,177
Nice to meet you.

164
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:24,237
Yeah. Me, too. What's with the big fish?

165
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,682
They're shooting the sequeI
to that movie Foam.

166
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:32,553
About the giant doIphin with rabies
that terrorizes a smaII New EngIand town.

167
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:36,722
We're gonna work part-time
as security guards on the set.

168
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:39,695
Stork twins!

169
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,164
CIay!

170
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,601
You guys got the day off from the garage?

171
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,695
No, we're doing a job.

172
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,364
-We're picking up a boat.
-Whose boat is it?

173
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:54,934
His.

174
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:18,197
-You touched my car.
-What?

175
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,671
You touched my car!

176
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,639
Right! Let me get it cIean, then!

177
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,141
You touched it again!

178
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,677
Don't ever touch my car again, ever!

179
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,448
Don't touch my car ever again!

180
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,519
Teddy, honey,
can we go pick up your boat?

181
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,678
Ever!

182
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:40,155
Remember? Your new boat?

183
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,764
Ty, bring in the Stork twins!

184
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,035
Come here.

185
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,707
I wouId've come anyways.

186
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:05,574
-Now move that tow truck!
-Let's go! HustIe!

187
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,454
That is some tuna.

188
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,941
Grammy.
The high schooI graduates are here.

189
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:39,308
Look who it is.

190
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,882
My pride and joy.

191
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,423
There's my IittIe girI.

192
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,317
Look what Grammy bought for you.

193
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:57,460
WouId you Iike
some nice miIk and cookies?

194
00:15:57,602 --> 00:16:00,628
Come on, Grammy wiII show you
where we go.

195
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:02,665
Nice meeting you, too.

196
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,139
-She's nuts about me.
-Yeah.

197
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,775
You got to meet my UncIe Frank.

198
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,640
$1 million!

199
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,682
This is it. We guarantee it.

200
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,050
This is your summer to win!

201
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:20,352
Keep it here and listen for this jingle:

202
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:23,757
95.5 FM. Music-money time.

203
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:28,254
lf you, yes, you, are our fiftieth caller...

204
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,593
$1 million is all yours!

205
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,398
That's right. $1 million.

206
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,405
UncIe Frank.

207
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:38,905
Georgie, what the heII
are you doing in here?

208
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,404
StiII at it.

209
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,777
God, wouId you get out of here?
You think I'm pIaying games?

210
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,043
Just Ieave me aIone!

211
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,578
Every summer he sits there
trying to win that radio show.

212
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:52,850
Every summer he Ioses
a bit more of his mind.

213
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,222
Why don't they just Ieave me aIone
with my dream?

214
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,227
Okay. There.

215
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:09,832
BiIIy, take this in the back room.

216
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,397
FieId strip it.

217
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,873
CarefuI with that thing!

218
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,248
Boys, tourniquet!

219
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:26,347
-CaIamari.
-Mr. Raymond.

220
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,654
Thought you'd be in prison by now.

221
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,125
What can I do for you?

222
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,991
We're Iooking for Acky.

223
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,497
This is my friend, Hoops McCann.

224
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,499
Quit monkeying with that thing!

225
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,864
Sorry.

226
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,967
Another wasted summer, boys?

227
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,506
Why don't you go in with Acky?
Just think of it.

228
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:46,008
Death from above! Airborne!

229
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:50,172
Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir,
but Acky throws up on the ferris wheeI...

230
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,874
at the chiIdren's park.

231
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:54,247
You've got no coIIege acceptance.

232
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:57,515
You've got no direction with your Iives.
No pIan.

233
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:01,115
When there's no pIan, there's no attack.
No attack, no victory.

234
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:05,862
This! This is what makes men, men.

235
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,059
I'II have to pick one up.

236
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,199
Anyway, where's Acky?

237
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:13,566
He's out on a mission for his oId man.

238
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,402
A mission, sir?

239
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:17,837
He's on the beach coIIecting sheIIs.

240
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,472
That's a IittIe more Iike Acky's speed.

241
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,451
Acky, what are you doing?

242
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,752
George, take cover.

243
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,723
Your dad said you were coIIecting sheIIs.

244
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,130
SheIIs. 57 miIIimeter.

245
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:47,269
My dad gets $12 apiece for them.
They make great paperweights.

246
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:49,305
Hi, I'm Ack Ack.

247
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,704
-Let's get out of here.
-Over the top, boys!

248
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:57,136
Nobody Iives forever!

249
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,646
My God!

250
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,226
You couId have waited
tiII they were done bombing the beach.

251
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:16,495
When the man says go, you go.

252
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,501
You couId have been kiIIed.

253
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,960
My god!

254
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,176
Do you reaIize
for every Iost, mangIed doII...

255
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,881
there's a IittIe girI with a broken heart?

256
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,915
Sure you want to be a Marine, Acky?

257
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,023
I just don't see you
having the kiIIer instinct.

258
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:57,932
''He Ieadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

259
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:01,542
''Yea, though I waIk through the vaIIey
of the shadow of death....''

260
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,279
What's going on?

261
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,942
''Thou preparest a tabIe before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

262
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,008
''thou anointest my head with oiI.

263
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,017
''SureIy goodness and mercy
shaII foIIow me aII the days of my Iife.''

264
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,163
For God's sake.

265
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:22,597
Excuse me for just one....

266
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,740
Leave me.

267
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:58,190
OId man EIdridge finaIIy kicked, Ted?

268
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:01,261
Doing my Iaps, Dad.

269
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:07,342
I wouId Iike to have a word with you.

270
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:08,844
In a minute, Dad.

271
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,452
I'II try not to take up
too much of your time.

272
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,953
Okay.

273
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:22,117
Are you ready for the regatta, Ted?

274
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:25,094
Sure, I'm ready.
The new sIoop's a beauty. I can't Iose.

275
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:28,029
If you screw it up this year,
you and I are out....

276
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,456
Hi, Daddy.

277
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:33,493
-Hi, Grandpa.
-How are you?

278
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,172
Good.

279
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:41,177
If you screw it up this year,
that decaying oId man, your grandfather...

280
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,678
takes everything away.

281
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:44,373
Do you understand, Ted?

282
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:47,679
If you don't come home with that trophy,
we Iose it aII.

283
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,784
No more pooIs, no more Ferrari.

284
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:54,481
Do you know what happens then?

285
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,419
-Don't say it, Dad.
-That's right, Ted.

286
00:21:57,494 --> 00:21:59,325
You'II have to go to....

287
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,396
-No!
-Work, Teddy, work!

288
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,932
Don't say that word!

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,662
I'II win! Just don't say that word!

290
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:08,000
That's why I need this EIdridge Iand.

291
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,172
With this Iand, I can finaIIy start buiIding...

292
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:13,301
Beckerstead Estates.

293
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:14,674
And that crazy oId man....

294
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,882
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Grandpa!

295
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,473
Have a wonderfuI day.

296
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,981
That crazy oId man can't hoId
that race over my head every year.

297
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,424
What did you find out about this pIace?

298
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:34,029
Chong says he Ieft it to his granddaughter.

299
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:36,396
She's got one week
to pay the back mortgage.

300
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,958
I've seen this girI. She's a reaI hippie type.

301
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:40,970
She wears these braids.

302
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,566
What do they caII them, cornhusks?

303
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:46,936
If she don't get the money,
you get the house.

304
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,769
They're aIready doing the paperwork.

305
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,541
WonderfuI.

306
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,124
This wiII be...

307
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:04,524
my most beautifuI restaurant yet.

308
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,458
I used to come down here
with him aII the time.

309
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,595
Your grandfather sounds
Iike he was a reaIIy nice man.

310
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,397
I'm reaIIy sorry.

311
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,305
OId Mr. Peckerhead's been trying--

312
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:21,071
-Who?
-Beckerstead.

313
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:24,637
He's been trying to drive Grandpa
out of that house since I was a baby.

314
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,512
I guess he finaIIy got him.

315
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,813
So what's gonna happen to the house
and aII his friends?

316
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:32,886
The bank's given me one week...

317
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:35,448
to come up with
the back mortgage of $3,000.

318
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,460
It might as weII be $1 miIIion.

319
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,457
I can't Iet those peopIe
be thrown out on the streets.

320
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,795
I just wish I had more time.

321
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,623
I wish I couId heIp.

322
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,035
I'm not going to give up.

323
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:49,732
I figure I can seII some of the furniture...

324
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,798
and I'm going to do some cIubs.

325
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:54,901
-You sing?
-Yeah, I try.

326
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:57,647
CooI. I bet you're reaIIy great.

327
00:23:58,382 --> 00:23:59,542
Thanks.

328
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:04,047
I guess basketbaII is your thing,
with a name Iike Hoops.

329
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:08,417
It's kind of in the famiIy bIood.
My dad was reaIIy great.

330
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,221
But I want to do something
a IittIe more chaIIenging, a IittIe different.

331
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,663
I'm trying to get a schoIarship
to art schooI.

332
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,223
What do you draw?

333
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,603
Nothing, IateIy. I'm in kind of a rut.

334
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,097
Draw me something?

335
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:26,198
Okay.

336
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,242
What can I get for you?

337
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:31,543
I don't know.

338
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:35,081
How about a goriIIa? Or me, or....

339
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,489
-How about a goriIIa and me?
-You and a goriIIa.

340
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,780
Okay.

341
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:45,284
Okay.

342
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:57,740
Lose the nose. Fix that, and...

343
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,636
change the feet.

344
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,152
Best I couId do with short notice.

345
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:15,222
It's great.

346
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,752
If this is what you do second best,
I'd Iove to see you pIay basketbaII.

347
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,496
It's quite a sight, Iet me teII you.

348
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,190
Thanks for cheering me up.

349
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:28,136
My pIeasure.

350
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:31,201
I better go.

351
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:32,866
Yeah, me, too.

352
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:36,408
Thanks.

353
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:39,104
Thanks a Iot.

354
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,881
Maybe you can come by Iater.

355
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:47,783
Okay.

356
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:49,556
'Bye.

357
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,366
Cassandra!

358
00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:00,667
Cassandra, can you heIp me a minute?

359
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,968
CouId you heIp me out? I'm stuck.

360
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,741
$1 million.

361
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:14,648
lt could happen at any time, any day...

362
00:26:14,718 --> 00:26:17,448
any hour, any minute, any second!

363
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:21,112
We're giving away $1 million...

364
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:24,024
and it could happen now, right now!

365
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:27,222
But it's not going to happen yet...

366
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:29,663
so keep listening for this jingle:

367
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,223
95.5--

368
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:38,599
To win $1 million!

369
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,823
Hey, Egg!

370
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:02,298
ReaIIy smart.

371
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,057
What if that went in my eye?

372
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:06,996
Where's Hoops?

373
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,433
He went over there.

374
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:12,436
You guys better Iook after him.

375
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,967
He's got a tendency
to waIIow in his artistic miseries.

376
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:18,012
Yeah.

377
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,174
Egg, cut me some shade, wiII you?

378
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,448
Okay, thank you.

379
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,725
Excuse me.

380
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,761
LittIe boy, wiII you hoId this for me?

381
00:27:31,828 --> 00:27:33,090
Thank you very much.

382
00:27:34,464 --> 00:27:36,432
-Mommy!
-Sorry.

383
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:37,893
Jimmy?

384
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:42,401
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi.

385
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,574
Hoops, how about a brew?

386
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:47,667
Thanks, guys. That's good.

387
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:51,211
PIease, Mr. Dog, don't.

388
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,813
What are you doing?

389
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,585
Nothing much, guys.

390
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,916
Hoops, if you run out of things to draw...

391
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,423
you can draw us, you know.

392
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,422
Yeah, you couId draw us nude.

393
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:06,260
Yeah, bare naked with no cIothes on!

394
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,592
No, button up!

395
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:09,291
Thank you. I appreciate that.

396
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:10,856
I'II come up with something.

397
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:13,402
I offer you my body and...

398
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,802
and now I'm the jerk of the worId
or something.

399
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:17,203
It was a nice gesture.

400
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,671
Hi. I met you at the docks yesterday.

401
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:22,211
HeIIo. I'm Hoops.

402
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,041
Cookie.

403
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:24,746
-How's it going?
-Great.

404
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,082
These are the Stork twins.

405
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,048
Hi, Cookie.

406
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:30,248
Hi, Cookie. I'm Egg.

407
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:31,585
Gemini!

408
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,382
I know them. They work for my boyfriend.

409
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:36,923
What can I do for you?

410
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:38,460
We're gonna go saiIing...

411
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,519
and we were wondering if you guys...

412
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:42,656
couId heIp us get our boat in the water?

413
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,567
What do you say, feIIas?

414
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:47,502
Can we heIp these IoveIy Iadies
get their boats in the water?

415
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:50,433
No. It sounds Iike work.

416
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,141
Boats are heavy. I'II get a hernia.

417
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,241
Come on, Iet's do it. Just get up!

418
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,812
-Sure. Love to.
-Great.

419
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,881
Anything eIse we can do for you...

420
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,386
Iike shoveI your driveway?

421
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:06,517
You guys!

422
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,295
You guys!

423
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:19,494
You have anything heavier we couId carry?

424
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:20,467
Like a car?

425
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:26,709
Yeah, sure. Forsake me for eight chicks.

426
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:29,177
Come on, hey!

427
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,250
No! Mister, pIease!

428
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:35,376
PIease, sir!

429
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:38,948
You don't understand. I've had a bad day.

430
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:53,696
Do you want to come saiIing?
There's room for one more.

431
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,330
No. ReaIIy, I can't.

432
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't Iike boats.

433
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:59,642
You're not afraid, are you?

434
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,236
No, of course not.

435
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:03,974
I got a Iot to do on the beach.

436
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:06,180
How about a movie, then?

437
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,251
What about your boyfriend?

438
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:11,787
He's going to a reception.

439
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:13,321
I'II pick you up at 8:00.

440
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:32,805
Come on, have a heart, dude.

441
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:39,413
No, not those. No!

442
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:42,179
PIease, Your Enormousness,
anything but chiIi!

443
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:44,517
She reaIIy Iikes you!

444
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:46,987
Too bad George wasn't here to see that.

445
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:51,587
George!

446
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:54,157
Far out! Dead man on the beach!

447
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:06,007
ChiIi?

448
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:10,876
PhiI, do the CPR.

449
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:12,881
-You do it.
-No. I have seniority.

450
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:14,883
I want you to give him CPR.

451
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,578
PhiI, give him CPR!

452
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:18,883
George was alive, just barely.

453
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:21,181
Nobody wanted to perform CPR on him...

454
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:22,953
so it was a complete nightmare.

455
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:26,318
But enough about old George.

456
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,591
How's the doIIar count?
Get any more money?

457
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,929
So far so good. I soId some furniture...

458
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,902
and I have a gig tonight
at a cIub caIIed the Dew Drop Inn.

459
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,267
Maybe you can come by.

460
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:37,365
Yeah, sure.

461
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,264
I'II try.

462
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,377
I might have something to do tonight.

463
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,672
If you can.

464
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,414
It'd be nice to have a friend there.

465
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:48,576
I'II be there, at the first tabIe.

466
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:49,880
You can count on it.

467
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:53,154
I got to go.

468
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:55,190
George's grandma is making us supper.

469
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:57,818
You know how grandmas are
about that kind of thing.

470
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,361
It means the worId to them.

471
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:05,029
Are you sure you don't want
a IittIe bit more?

472
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,626
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
It was deIicious, though.

473
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:09,264
AII right, then.

474
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:19,378
I got it.

475
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:22,981
Keep it.

476
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,384
Thank you very much.

477
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,688
Yeah, it was reaIIy good.

478
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,417
So, why aren't you going out with Cookie?

479
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,392
You're here to write a Iove story, Hoops.

480
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:33,861
Cookie is a Iove story.

481
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,831
George, her boyfriend is Iike
Cro-Magnon teen.

482
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,266
No way. Besides, I said
I was heIping Cassandra.

483
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:40,894
I promised to go to her show.

484
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,166
Yeah, but Iike, Cookie asked you out first.

485
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:45,466
We were there.

486
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:48,940
Teddy's not even gonna be around tonight.

487
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:51,378
You know where Teddy's going to be?

488
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:54,548
At a IittIe reception
ceIebrating the rape of the Iand...

489
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,586
that Cassandra's house now stands on.

490
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,281
-The Stork brothers toId me.
-That's true!

491
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,921
Cookie seems Iike a reaI nice person.

492
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,983
Maybe she'd Iike to heIp Cassandra out.

493
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,620
I don't think she's interested.
You know what I mean?

494
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:13,300
Come on, Hoops.
Quit thinking about yourseIf aII the time.

495
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:17,630
Go out with Cookie,
and get her on your side.

496
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:19,708
Then go see Cassandra.

497
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:23,378
I'd rather keep the originaI bone structure
of my face.

498
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:26,209
-Do you want to heIp Cassandra?
-Of course.

499
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,412
The Stork twins are going
to the reception after work.

500
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,577
If Teddy does anything...

501
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:34,082
they'II caII me at the drive-in and...

502
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:36,158
the big guy'II be watching your back.

503
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:37,422
Trust me.

504
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:42,492
Once upon a time...

505
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:45,399
there was a happening guy,
who'd stumbled onto a girl...

506
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,436
who embodied all that love should be.

507
00:33:48,204 --> 00:33:49,364
All seemed well.

508
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,602
Those cute and fuzzy bunnies...

509
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,143
weren't so bad after all.

510
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,273
Until....

511
00:33:58,548 --> 00:33:59,947
Her boyfriend showed up...

512
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,883
and pounded him into something
that resembled a wet prune.

513
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:07,052
Ouch.

514
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,225
''Never! ''

515
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,263
I am going to die.

516
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:21,031
Forget about it.

517
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,399
Where're you going?

518
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:24,963
I'm going to see Cassandra.

519
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,105
Baby.

520
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:32,606
Are you ready for me, Hoops?

521
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,683
Wait. PuII over. I know her.

522
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:45,887
You need a ride?

523
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:53,100
That was a friend of mine.

524
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:54,726
I don't pick up hitchhikers.

525
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,841
The humanity!

526
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:07,712
Thank you very much for the ride.

527
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:10,412
I enjoyed it thoroughIy. CIay!

528
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,181
CIay! Hi.

529
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:16,225
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

530
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,488
I'm reIieving you because
Dad needs you pronto at the gas station.

531
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:24,865
Okay. But don't forget at 9:00...

532
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,799
you have to be at the Beckersteads'.

533
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:29,528
Watch Teddy.
If anything weird is going on...

534
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:31,767
caII George at the drive-in right away.

535
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,365
We can't Iet Hoops down.

536
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,070
Okay. No probIem.

537
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:40,338
Egg, don't forget. No matter what...

538
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,146
don't touch anything on this prop truck.

539
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,987
Like I'm reaIIy gonna!

540
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:09,907
Are you nervous about something?

541
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:10,604
Me?

542
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,072
Yeah.

543
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,575
No, I'm having a great time. Enjoy.

544
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,179
Are you sure?

545
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:23,991
Can I ask you something?

546
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,888
Yeah.

547
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,558
Aren't you going out with Teddy?

548
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:28,560
Yeah.

549
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,460
Why aren't you with him tonight?

550
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:34,198
Because he's got
some siIIy reception to go to...

551
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,101
and he's got his vang shoo cIasses.

552
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:38,499
What's vang shoo?

553
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:40,136
The martiaI art...

554
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,539
of disemboweIing...

555
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,376
another human being...

556
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:45,778
with a popsicIe stick.

557
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:47,943
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

558
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:49,450
I'II go get some treats.

559
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,747
Stay right here.

560
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,053
I'II get us some treats.

561
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,857
CouId you bring me some popcorn?

562
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:00,691
Popcorn.

563
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,691
Check it out. It's that McCann guy.

564
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,735
And he's with Cookie.

565
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:12,868
I Iike that one. I Iike that. I want a....

566
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,781
Now, that is a....
I couId wear that anywhere.

567
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:33,863
I'm going to Iook nice.

568
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:48,835
Michael?

569
00:37:52,782 --> 00:37:53,544
Michael?

570
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:56,746
Michael!

571
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:00,150
Michael!

572
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,186
Michael?

573
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:06,156
Michael?

574
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,734
Hoops. Good party, eh?

575
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:15,297
George, where're your friends, the twins?

576
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:17,066
Are they watching that monster?

577
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,301
Don't worry about it. They're very reIiabIe.

578
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:20,338
Trust me.

579
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:30,279
Thank you very much.

580
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:33,413
It feeIs good to be back here
at the CIub Tokyo.

581
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:34,751
Hi! How're you doing?

582
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:37,190
Where're you from?
What do you do for a Iiving?

583
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:40,256
9:00? Shit!

584
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,262
9:00!

585
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:44,124
Goddamn it!

586
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,705
Shit!

587
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,245
ReIax.

588
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:06,046
WouId you get over here,
you two stupid cIowns?

589
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:09,557
I can't wait aII night.

590
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:16,898
Look at this.

591
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:27,341
Damn. That Iooks Iike
one of those medicaI experiments...

592
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,468
that went astray.

593
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:30,842
LittIe girI, I'm gonna have nightmares...

594
00:39:30,914 --> 00:39:32,745
just knowing that dog exists.

595
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,976
Looks Iike it's been microwaved
or something.

596
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:38,213
Why, WiIbur, I beIieve that's a case...

597
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:39,812
for a mercy kiIIing.

598
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,616
What do you say, IittIe girI?

599
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:44,592
Want us to put it out of its misery?

600
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:46,390
I can't wait any Ionger.

601
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,339
Hi. How you doing?

602
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:02,509

603
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:43,814
Mary Ann?

604
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:57,730
Thank you.

605
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:03,497
In honor of our very speciaI guest...

606
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,040
Mr. Chong Freen...

607
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,335
of the Charter Bank of Nantucket...

608
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,277
who assures me...

609
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:12,280
that the Beckerstead Estates
are onIy weeks away...

610
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:14,282
from the start of construction...

611
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:16,885
I wiII aIIow Mr. Freen...

613
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:20,379
Thank you.

614
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:42,971
Did you bring me my popcorn?

615
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:56,986
Thank you very much.

616
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:58,754
I think I wiII have a cookie.

617
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:09,033
HeIIo.

618
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,100
Michael?

619
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:19,870
Hi. Cookie?

620
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,644
Teddy? Yeah, this is Ty.

621
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:23,242
Ty. What's up?

622
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:25,720
She's doing what?

623
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:27,816
Stay right there.

624
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,518
No, Ty, stay right there, you idiot!

625
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,246
ReaIIy nice party.

626
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:40,284
That's a hearty appetite.

627
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,530
Let's get out of here.

628
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:47,767
Let's go to the point
and watch the moon rise.

629
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:50,098
I don't know, Cookie, I was...

630
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:51,868
kind of enjoying this fine fiIm.

631
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:53,169
l never touched her!

632
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,272
-You touched my girlfriend, didn't you?
-No!

633
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,642
No!

634
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:01,182
l knew l'd find you at the drive-in.

635
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,616
No! No! Please!

636
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,749
I guess you don't get
to see the moon rise very often.

637
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,056
Egg.

638
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:14,287
Egg?

639
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:20,960
Egg, I'm about to teach you...

640
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,401
a very vaIuabIe Iesson.

641
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,309
In an emergency situation...

642
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,145
the victims cannot
and must not be aIIowed...

643
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:36,651
to think for themseIves.

644
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:41,117
The shock and the horror
of what just happened...

645
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,283
wiII sureIy impair their judgment.

646
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:46,489
You must do the thinking
in order to save them.

647
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,194
In this case...

648
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:51,700
a pIane has just crash-Ianded on this point.

649
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:55,470
Now, there are going to be
bodies everywhere...

650
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:58,065
just gushing bIood and...

651
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,270
their faces wiII be
puIIed off of their heads and...

652
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,445
armpits wiII be hanging from trees.

653
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:08,244
Their eyebaIIs wiII be
sticking out of their heads.

654
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:12,082
You'II have to push them back in
with a stick or something.

655
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,848
Now, remember...

656
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:16,350
you are the onIy thing...

657
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,450
that wiII stand between Iife and death.

658
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:21,556
Let's do it!

659
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:23,427
Come on, Iet's go! Hurry up!

660
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,828
Dad, I reaIIy wish we couId discuss this.

661
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:30,939
There's nothing to discuss, Ack Ack.

662
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,067
I want you out of the house by 0800 hours.

663
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:36,736
My home is not a den for cowards...

664
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:38,871
who wiII not serve in the armed forces.

665
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,480
Yes, sir.

666
00:45:54,597 --> 00:45:56,792
There's a beautifuI cIearing just up ahead.

667
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:59,390
Listen, Cookie,
I want to know if you can heIp me--

668
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,471
Save him!

669
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:08,900
Hoops, what are you doing?

670
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,276
Cookie, for God's sake, heIp me.

671
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:12,405
Save her!

672
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:19,150
I don't know, Teddy.

673
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:21,617
We foIIowed them up this far.

674
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,691
Goodness knows
what they came up here to do.

675
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,664
-Cookie, what are you doing here?
-They're chasing me!

676
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:37,364
Who?

677
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,032
McCann and his weird friends.

678
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:49,944
George! Stop!

679
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:50,986
Jesus!

680
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:53,544
Go, George, get out of here!

681
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,749
Save him!

682
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:05,224
It's just a costume! You IittIe jerks!

683
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:07,399
Get out of the way!

684
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,175
Great, we missed her.

685
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:18,907
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Ack.

686
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,183
Get me out of this!

687
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,455
Get me out!

688
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:33,721
We got to caII Hoops. Teddy Ieft the party.

689
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,129
Good work, buddy.

690
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:41,700
I'm going to kiII you, after I kiII this guy.

691
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:43,805
$100 says you don't.

692
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:49,601
What?

693
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:51,813
''$100 says you don't.''

694
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:54,539
What are you taIking about?

695
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:58,018
I'm sure that you can beat him up.
He's smaIIer than you.

696
00:47:58,354 --> 00:48:00,151
That never stood in my way before.

697
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:03,555
I'II bet you $100 that even though
he's smaIIer, he's a better athIete.

698
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:06,956
-Say at a sport Iike basketbaII?
-What are you doing?

699
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,564
This wimp? Give me a break.

700
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:12,930
-Are you in or out?
-PIease don't do this. I'm begging you.

701
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:15,195
-You must be high. Is she high?
-High.

702
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:16,936
In or out?

703
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,842
AII right, Iet's go.

704
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:25,812
Darn, no net. Can't pIay.

705
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:29,976
Maybe we can pIay water poIo.
I couId get some horses.

706
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,462
Make a hoop.

707
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:56,870
-AII right.
-Lucky shot!

708
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,490
Okay. Here you go.

709
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,223
Okay, Hoops, come on.

710
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:27,903
Come on.

711
00:49:48,264 --> 00:49:52,564
If you don't mind, I'd Iike to get back
to beating the shit out of these guys.

712
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:55,627
-I wouIdn't do that if I were you.
-Why? You know Karate?

713
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,035
No. I know Dow.

714
00:49:58,173 --> 00:49:59,663
What is Dow?

715
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,702
Dow is the chemicaI company
that makes Mace.

716
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:15,390
Cassandra, wait up a minute. Come on!

717
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,052
I'm reaIIy sorry about that.

718
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,724
Thanks for saving us.

719
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:24,793
It's no big deaI, McCann.
I guess we're even.

720
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,643
-Now?
-No, not yet. Be patient.

721
00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:38,368
Now?

722
00:50:39,715 --> 00:50:40,704
Okay.

723
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:45,148
Hello, ladies. l am here for your daughters.

724
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:53,151
So, you finaIIy toId the Fhrer no?

725
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:55,461
How'd it go?

726
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:57,456
He threw me out.

727
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,066
Don't worry about it, man.
You can stay at my grandmother's house.

728
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:04,571
She's got room and reasonabIe rates...

729
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:08,337
-if you're not in the famiIy.
-Thanks, George.

730
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:12,572
You can throw your stuff
in UncIe Frank's room. He'II never know.

731
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:18,977
Did you ever notice
peopIe die in aIphabeticaI order?

732
00:51:21,223 --> 00:51:23,088
Cheer up, McCann.

733
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:25,752
She's not the onIy girI on the isIand.

734
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:28,227
There's pIenty of them to be found.

735
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,794
-Like that one.
-Go for it, dude.

736
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:42,533
Excuse me, feIIas.

737
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:50,609
How you doing? Here you go.

738
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:52,546
-Hi.
-Hi, Hoops.

739
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:54,316
-How're you doing?
-Fine.

740
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:57,425
-Look, Cassandra...
-Hi. Here you go.

741
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:01,190
...I want to apoIogize. I shouIdn't have said
I was a basketbaII pIayer.

742
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:02,958
I shouIdn't have Iied. I'm sorry.

743
00:52:03,532 --> 00:52:07,969
I reaIIy am a decent artist. If I couId
heIp you, I'd Iike to make it up to you.

744
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:09,670
You reaIIy want to heIp?

745
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:11,797
-Yeah.
-Buy a ticket.

746
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:13,772
Hi. How you doing?

747
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:33,288
We are from the pIanet of the toes.
We bring you....

748
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:35,960
And we bring you produce.

749
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:38,528
-Hi, feIIas.
-Hi, Hoops.

750
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,999
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi, Hoops.

751
00:52:41,804 --> 00:52:43,772
A giant doIphin with rabies.

752
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:46,534
Turn it around. Open it up.

753
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:49,141
About as beIievabIe as Superman.

754
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,656
They sure can do incredibIe things
in movies nowadays.

755
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:03,283
Yeah.

756
00:53:07,629 --> 00:53:11,497
Good idea. I've got it. Up.
Stork twins, bring that camera.

757
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,596
No! No, pIease!

758
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:21,768
Guys, what about George?

759
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:25,545
George!

760
00:53:26,749 --> 00:53:28,944
I refuse to do this!

761
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:31,451
-Give him CPR.
-I am your superior!

762
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,753
These are satanic hemorrhoids from hell.
We must stop them before they kill again!

763
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:19,256
Doctor, no!

764
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:21,529
l must save the free world.

765
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:55,670
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you at the show.

766
00:55:39,681 --> 00:55:41,376
Weather for the Cape and the islands...

767
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,510
looks like we can expect some rain,
but nothing to worry about.

768
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,716
Nantucket's big news tonight
is Cassandra live at the Dew Drop lnn.

769
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,223
Come on, come on.

770
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:51,759
Good luck to her...

771
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:54,921
and good luck to you
in our $1 million summer.

772
00:55:54,997 --> 00:55:56,760
lt could happen at any minute.

773
00:55:56,832 --> 00:56:00,393
-You could win $1 million.
-Come on, come on.

774
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:02,827
Stand stiII, Teddy.

775
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,533
Dad, I got to do my Iaps.

776
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:08,201
I have not yet mastered this contraption.

777
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:11,110
When I have,
then you may continue your Iaps.

778
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:13,941
Damn it.

779
00:56:15,384 --> 00:56:17,318
Do you know who this is?

780
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:29,489
-No.
-That is troubIe.

781
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:34,091
That is the girI that just might ruin
my restaurant on the bIuff.

782
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:38,471
She's singing or something
tomorrow night.

783
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,003
If peopIe do actuaIIy show up to hear her...

784
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:44,907
she might make some money.

785
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:48,180
She might make enough
to pay back the bank.

786
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,647
What are we going to do about it?

787
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:54,213
Stop her from singing?

788
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,280
Good, Teddy. Good.

789
00:57:00,062 --> 00:57:01,256
Get it.

790
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:04,861
We're here to pick up your father's Jag.

791
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:08,296
He caIIed us. We wiII need the keys.

792
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:18,372
-Get rid of this.
-Okay.

793
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:23,411
Come on.

794
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:34,626
ln sports, we've got the Nantucket Regatta
coming up...

795
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:38,154
and Cape Cod's own Mr. Congeniality....

796
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:39,257
Hi, guys.

797
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,892
-Hi, Ack Ack.
-Hi, Ack.

798
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,527
How you doing?

799
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:46,231
That's the Iast of it.

800
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:48,736
I'm history.

801
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:52,543
I wish I couId make my father understand.

802
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,081
Hey, Ack...

803
00:57:58,253 --> 00:57:59,743
I understand.

804
00:58:00,122 --> 00:58:01,089
You do?

805
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:07,724
Let me teII you a story...

806
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,532
about a IittIe fat boy that nobody Ioved...

807
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:16,101
and aII the other kids,
they used to make fun of him...

808
00:58:17,773 --> 00:58:19,707
and they wouId pick on him...

809
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:23,802
and they used to say
that he taIked funny and stuff...

810
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,509
and he had a twin brother...

811
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,071
and everybody said...

812
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,608
that he didn't Iook
anything Iike his twin brother...

813
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,048
but he wanted to.

814
00:58:34,122 --> 00:58:35,419
Egg....

815
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:39,085
Were you the IittIe fat boy?

816
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:43,455
No. But I used to Iike to beat him up.

817
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:45,898
I'd go, ''Why are you so fat?''

818
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:48,435
And I'd beat the shit out of him.

819
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:51,831
Isn't that a great story?

820
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,102
Yeah, thanks.

821
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:00,979
Are you a IittIe nervous? No?

822
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,311
Nobody's going to show up.

823
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:07,619
Everybody's going to show up. It's been
the greatest media bIitz in Nantucket.

824
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:10,681
-I don't want to hear another word.
-What about Beckerstead?

825
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:14,217
-WiII he puII something?
-It's covered, I promise you.

826
00:59:14,296 --> 00:59:17,823
You just reIax and have a good time,
because you're going to be great.

827
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:19,557
Okay? Trust me.

828
00:59:21,036 --> 00:59:22,128
Hoops...

829
00:59:23,538 --> 00:59:25,972
I just want to teII you....

830
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,809
I guess I know what you mean.

831
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:38,011
Hoops?

832
00:59:38,086 --> 00:59:40,111
Yeah. Got to run. See you at the cIub.

833
00:59:50,165 --> 00:59:52,258
This one's for Cassandra.

834
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:25,025
Come on!

835
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:49,382
Teddy? Don't forget about tonight.

836
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,124
Dad, I'II go.

837
01:00:51,393 --> 01:00:53,486
I'II go after I do my Iaps!

838
01:00:54,462 --> 01:00:56,259
Thank you, Teddy.

839
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:19,543
Have a nice swim.

840
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:26,354
Come on in.

841
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:30,062
Come on in, Cookie wookie wookie.

842
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:41,006
-Cookie, heIp me!
-What's wrong?

843
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,008
Come here!

844
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:11,482
Two. Enjoy it.

845
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:02,737
What?

846
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:04,605
I'm sorry, Miss...

847
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:08,374
but aII the money in the worId
won't get you that house.

848
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:11,477
But it's my house,
and that's the money I owe you.

849
01:05:11,553 --> 01:05:12,986
I understand.

850
01:05:13,054 --> 01:05:16,251
Mr. Beckerstead bought the mortgage
from the bank.

851
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,423
He can forecIose when he wants.

852
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:21,629
You gave me untiI today.

853
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,161
I'm sorry.

854
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:26,492
The bank was Ienient
for as Iong as it couId be.

855
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:31,435
What about those peopIe? It's their home.
How couId you seII it to him?

856
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:34,741
Mr. Beckerstead is a Iot weaIthier
than you.

857
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:48,084
What's going on? What happened?

858
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,526
What does it matter? The house is theirs.

859
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:56,086
That's right.

860
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:58,462
And get this ugIy mutt...

861
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,160
off my property.

862
01:06:04,205 --> 01:06:05,399
Boscoe!

863
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:10,001
Dr. Balson to ER.

864
01:06:16,317 --> 01:06:19,514
Squid, it's okay.
Boscoe's going to be just fine.

865
01:06:19,687 --> 01:06:22,588
I don't know. They've been in there awhiIe.

866
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:24,648
I think I smeII gas, too.

867
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:29,128
Cassandra, wiII you reaIIy Ieave?

868
01:06:29,297 --> 01:06:32,630
Why shouId I stay?
There's nothing Ieft here for me.

869
01:06:34,335 --> 01:06:36,166
How can you say that?

870
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,672
What about the house
and aII those peopIe?

871
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:43,302
WiII we just give in to the Beckersteads?

872
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:46,313
We can't Iet them waIk away
with everything.

873
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:50,977
If we give in, we're giving in
to aII the cute, fuzzy bunnies in the worId.

874
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:55,583
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.

875
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,856
What I mean is, we can't give up.
We got to think of a pIan.

876
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:01,356
A pIan.

877
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:05,932
''Without a pIan, there's no attack.

878
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,264
''Without attack, no victory.''

879
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,428
Where have I heard that before?

880
01:07:10,505 --> 01:07:13,702
A pIan. Oh, boy, I've got a pIan.

881
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:16,710
-Acky's got a pIan! What is it?
-The regatta.

882
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:18,211
The regatta?

883
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,405
The regatta. The saiIing boat race.

884
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:25,585
The one-boat rowing, saiIing,
motoring regatta around Nantucket.

885
01:07:25,653 --> 01:07:27,621
Your pIan invoIves a boat?

886
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,247
But Teddy wiII win it.

887
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:31,451
He wins every year.
Everybody knows that.

888
01:07:31,526 --> 01:07:33,756
But what happens if he doesn't?

889
01:07:33,828 --> 01:07:37,628
His grandfather takes away everything
he and his father own...

890
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:40,167
making his Iife as dreary as ours.

891
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:41,866
Poor guys.

892
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:43,228
And?

893
01:07:43,304 --> 01:07:45,067
So we win the race.

894
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:50,035
He can't Iive without the trophy.
We can't Iive without the house.

895
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:52,138
We make a trade.

896
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:56,107
Great, Ack Ack.
There's just one thing missing.

897
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,547
The boat.

898
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:18,802
The boat.

899
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:23,536
She's reaIIy in good shape.

900
01:08:25,813 --> 01:08:28,475
Mind you, she couId use a IittIe heIp.

901
01:10:02,543 --> 01:10:03,737
George?

902
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:09,777
WeIcome, aII,
to the christening of the boat.

903
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:12,046
For this gaIa occasion, I got something...

904
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,850
my parents brought me back from France.

905
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:20,092
I've been saving it for a speciaI occasion.
I think this is it.

906
01:10:23,397 --> 01:10:25,126
That's reaIIy nice.

907
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,724
Cassandra, wouId you do the honors?

908
01:10:36,878 --> 01:10:38,243
To the boat.

909
01:10:38,312 --> 01:10:39,745
To the boat!

910
01:10:43,918 --> 01:10:46,853
-We'II patch that up.
-We'II fix that Iater.

911
01:10:46,954 --> 01:10:50,481
Listen, Hoops, here's a IittIe something...

912
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,256
from aII of us to aII of you.

913
01:10:53,394 --> 01:10:56,227
What, for me? What is it?

914
01:10:58,933 --> 01:11:01,595
Thank you. What is this for?

915
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:05,701
The captain has to have his captain hat.

916
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:12,709
I can't accept this.
Acky, you be captain. It was your idea.

917
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,908
It's decided, Hoops.
You're the man for the job.

918
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,185
I can't be captain.
I won't even be on the boat.

919
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:21,153
I'II be on Iand. Sorry, feIIows.

920
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,084
Hoops?

921
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,594
Let's have a Iook at that engine.

922
01:11:29,297 --> 01:11:31,197
-Yeah.
-Sure, that'II be great.

923
01:11:55,623 --> 01:11:57,113
What's wrong?

924
01:11:57,358 --> 01:11:58,620
Nothing.

925
01:11:59,627 --> 01:12:02,289
I just don't Iike boats. I hate boats.

926
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,192
Since I was a kid, I don't Iike boats.

927
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:09,729
Maybe you just haven't had
the right kind of experience on a boat.

928
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:13,636
Maybe you're right.

929
01:12:25,953 --> 01:12:27,580
That's it, boys.

930
01:12:29,156 --> 01:12:32,387
We got to have an engine
for part of this race.

931
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,493
I'II get it.

932
01:12:35,162 --> 01:12:38,529
Most of those guys
wiII have Evinrudes and Mercuries...

933
01:12:38,599 --> 01:12:40,032
heavy stuff.

934
01:12:40,701 --> 01:12:44,102
I don't think this puppy
is going to cut the mustard.

935
01:12:44,472 --> 01:12:46,906
WeII, that's the best my dad had.

936
01:12:54,348 --> 01:12:55,645
CIay!

937
01:12:56,017 --> 01:12:57,507
What happened?

938
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:01,316
Teddy brought his car in for a tune-up.

939
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:03,714
Did he hit you?

940
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:45,163
One, two, three, four.

941
01:14:04,952 --> 01:14:06,852
What the heII is that?

942
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:32,443
Hi, Ted.

943
01:14:33,347 --> 01:14:35,042
How you doing?

944
01:14:35,116 --> 01:14:36,344
McCann.

945
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,248
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

946
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:46,825
Welcome to the Nantucket Regatta.

947
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:50,395
The first part of the regatta...

948
01:14:51,232 --> 01:14:54,360
will test your strength and stamina.

949
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:57,135
From this line, you will row....

950
01:14:57,505 --> 01:14:58,529
You!

951
01:14:58,606 --> 01:15:00,574
You wiII not....

952
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:02,367
Get down! Come here.

953
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:03,909
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:15:06,213 --> 01:15:08,477
Come on, save it for the race.

955
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,744
There, you will drop your sails...

956
01:15:13,154 --> 01:15:15,179
and start your engines...

957
01:15:15,456 --> 01:15:17,447
for the final stretch...

958
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:20,360
back into Nantucket Harbor.

959
01:15:21,262 --> 01:15:22,456
Now....

960
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:25,091
lf everyone is ready....

961
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:45,547
Go! Go!

962
01:15:45,853 --> 01:15:47,480
-Hey, Egg.
-What?

963
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:51,191
Tito Ramirez is wrestIing
Mr. CongeniaIity...

964
01:15:51,492 --> 01:15:53,426
in a haIf-hour.

965
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:57,826
Teddy says Mr. CongeniaIity
doesn't have a chance.

966
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:08,374
Go! Come on!

967
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:11,402
Go!

968
01:16:55,823 --> 01:16:58,451
Come on, guys. They're gaining on us!

969
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:09,268
We'II take care of this right now.

970
01:17:09,837 --> 01:17:11,270
Dad? Shit.

971
01:17:11,405 --> 01:17:15,398
You just steer the boat,
you stupid, imbeciIic retard.

972
01:17:15,476 --> 01:17:19,139
You're not my son. I knew I couIdn't
trust you to do this without me.

973
01:17:19,413 --> 01:17:23,110
-What are you doing?
-First, we just take out that haIyard.

974
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:24,811
This race is yours.

975
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,752
-Come on, Dad, I can win--
-Shut your mouth, Teddy!

976
01:17:27,821 --> 01:17:29,448
That's an order.

977
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,528
Shit! What happened?

978
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,295
Now, you may proceed.

979
01:17:43,904 --> 01:17:47,305
-The haIyard snapped.
-It couIdn't have just snapped.

980
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:50,736
Look.

981
01:17:52,613 --> 01:17:54,103
You bastards!

982
01:17:57,184 --> 01:17:59,209
Fix that AustraIian boat.

983
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,945
WeII, there goes Cassandra's house.

984
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:03,489
That's that.

985
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,359
We can't quit!
We got to do something. Think!

986
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:10,556
We got to get the haIyard
back through its hoIder.

987
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:11,791
We can't do that out here.

988
01:18:14,034 --> 01:18:15,797
We're not dead yet.

989
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:21,132
Man, we're getting smoked.

990
01:18:21,475 --> 01:18:23,500
What are you doing, Hoops?

991
01:18:23,577 --> 01:18:25,238
Desperation move.

992
01:18:48,836 --> 01:18:50,201
Two points!

993
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:17,657
Ty, take out the main sheet!

994
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:21,295
Come on!

995
01:19:30,844 --> 01:19:32,675
-Man overboard!
-Jesus!

996
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:35,248
Drop the saiIs, feIIows.

997
01:19:37,017 --> 01:19:38,917
Acky. God.

998
01:19:40,988 --> 01:19:43,616
HoId on, buddy. We'II be there in a minute.

999
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:45,056
AII right!

1000
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:52,291
Acky!

1001
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:53,827
Go on!

1002
01:19:54,601 --> 01:19:55,795
I got him!

1003
01:19:55,869 --> 01:19:57,200
Are you sure?

1004
01:19:57,271 --> 01:19:59,068
I got him. Beat it!

1005
01:20:00,874 --> 01:20:02,307
Let's do it!

1006
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,035
Go get those scum, mates!

1007
01:20:07,147 --> 01:20:09,206
Come to me. HeIp me, boys!

1008
01:20:19,426 --> 01:20:20,984
Check this out.

1009
01:20:21,095 --> 01:20:22,756
I don't beIieve it.

1010
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,162
AIoha! We're back! How are you?

1011
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:28,233
Teddy, go faster.

1012
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:31,768
The wind's dying down.
We're aImost to the engine buoy.

1013
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:33,966
I'm not taking any chances.

1014
01:20:34,842 --> 01:20:37,811
Dad, damn it. Why don't you Iisten to me?
I can win!

1015
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:40,377
The onIy way to win, Theodore...

1016
01:20:40,614 --> 01:20:42,639
is to cheat. Remember.

1017
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:47,350
A IittIe hoIe in their huII
wiII sIow them down just enough.

1018
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:50,516
He's Iost his mind! Get down!

1019
01:20:55,963 --> 01:20:57,430
What the heII is that?

1020
01:20:57,498 --> 01:20:59,398
Teddy, come back here!

1021
01:20:59,867 --> 01:21:02,131
Come back here right now, boy!

1022
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:03,463
Teddy!

1023
01:21:03,537 --> 01:21:06,097
My god. A giant doIphin with rabies.

1024
01:21:06,306 --> 01:21:07,864
Come back here!

1025
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,007
Theodore!

1026
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:15,438
Come back here. HeIp me!

1027
01:21:25,392 --> 01:21:29,158
The wind's coming up.
Let's set saiI! Let's get out of here!

1028
01:21:29,296 --> 01:21:31,526
Boy, if I ever get out of this...

1029
01:21:31,598 --> 01:21:34,226
I'm going to make you into a stew!

1030
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:35,863
HeIp me!

1031
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,601
Somebody heIp me!

1032
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:57,347
AII right! There's the engine buoy!

1033
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:01,454
There's the buoy!

1034
01:22:05,632 --> 01:22:07,930
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

1035
01:22:08,202 --> 01:22:10,693
HustIe! Come on, move it, move it!

1036
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:13,864
Come on, Iadies! Let's go!

1037
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:19,942
Start up the engine.

1038
01:22:20,447 --> 01:22:24,042
Good Iuck trying to beat a Merc
with a Iawnmower engine!

1039
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,459
GentIemen, prepare to bIow the hatch!

1040
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:51,476
GentIemen, I am bIowing the hatch!

1041
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:19,199
Teddy, step on it.

1042
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:22,797
I've got her fuII throttIe.
She doesn't have any more.

1043
01:23:26,747 --> 01:23:29,341
What the heII they got in that thing?

1044
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:34,515
My car.

1045
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:40,384
Thank you very much.

1046
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,394
Bye-bye. See you Iater!

1047
01:24:07,588 --> 01:24:10,887
I'd Iike to thank everyone
that made this possibIe.

1048
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:20,799
Hey, Cookie.

1049
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:24,032
Why don't we quit
pIaying aII these games?

1050
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:34,542
Look what I caught!

1051
01:24:35,248 --> 01:24:36,943
How you doing? Are you hurt?

1052
01:24:38,085 --> 01:24:39,848
Squid! Look at that.

1053
01:24:41,355 --> 01:24:42,583
Boscoe!

1054
01:24:58,205 --> 01:25:00,765
-Thanks again, mate.
-You're weIcome.

1055
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:11,842
I heard what you did, Ack Ack.
It's aII over the isIand.

1056
01:25:12,386 --> 01:25:13,876
You're a hero.

1057
01:25:14,254 --> 01:25:16,119
I'm proud of you, Son.

1058
01:25:16,356 --> 01:25:17,721
Damn proud.

1059
01:25:21,028 --> 01:25:22,996
I want you to come home.

1060
01:25:25,098 --> 01:25:28,158
Does this mean
I have to give back the bazooka?

1061
01:25:30,237 --> 01:25:33,035
Let's taIk about it over a hot chocoIate.

1062
01:25:40,881 --> 01:25:42,075
Hey, Teddy.

1063
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:45,916
What if we make a deaI?

1064
01:25:45,986 --> 01:25:48,113
You need the trophy, we need the house.

1065
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:50,713
And everybody's happy. Come on, Ted.

1066
01:25:52,693 --> 01:25:53,785
Okay.

1067
01:25:54,695 --> 01:25:56,993
You're onIy haIf right, McCann.

1068
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:01,190
That house won't do you
or your father any good.

1069
01:26:01,268 --> 01:26:04,465
I'm not putting a dime
in the Beckerstead Estates.

1070
01:26:04,705 --> 01:26:07,765
This is the reaI investment, Teddy:
Friendship!

1071
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:10,375
Here's your house back.

1072
01:26:10,477 --> 01:26:12,172
Thank you so much.

1073
01:26:12,312 --> 01:26:14,746
The IittIe Iady has quite a voice.

1074
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:17,006
Come on, Teddy.

1075
01:26:39,072 --> 01:26:40,505
Once upon a time...

1076
01:26:40,574 --> 01:26:43,668
there was a happy guy
that love finally found...

1077
01:26:44,077 --> 01:26:46,773
and this time, love didn't pass him by.

1078
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,178
Old boy finally caught a break.

1079
01:26:49,483 --> 01:26:52,179
This love story lasted all summer long.

1080
01:26:52,519 --> 01:26:55,750
There was nothing
even the cute and fuzzy bunnies...

1081
01:26:55,822 --> 01:26:58,017
could do about it, thank you.

1082
01:27:24,818 --> 01:27:26,683
95.5 F.M...

1083
01:27:26,753 --> 01:27:28,516
music-money time.

1084
01:27:29,122 --> 01:27:32,216
This is it. We're looking
for caller number 50!

1085
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:33,690
Good luck.

1086
01:27:34,895 --> 01:27:36,556
You're on the air!

1087
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:38,120
-HeIIo?
-Hello!

1088
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:40,291
This the contest at the radio station?

1089
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:43,734
l hope you're sitting,
'cause you've won $1 million!

1090
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:46,564
-Jesus Christ, I won!
-lt's all yours!

1091
01:27:46,706 --> 01:27:49,106
This changes everything for me.

1092
01:27:49,176 --> 01:27:52,202
I deserve this. I've been sitting, waiting,
day after day...

1093
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:54,509
in this room waiting for your Iousy song...

1094
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:57,573
and I've gotten through!
I feeI so Iucky, so bIessed...

1095
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:59,050
so powerfuI!

1096
01:28:00,554 --> 01:28:02,522
-Congratulations!
-HeIIo?

1097
01:28:02,689 --> 01:28:03,849
Hello?

1098
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:07,153
We seem to be cut off.
Let's take another caller.

1099
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,921
You're on the air.

1100
01:28:09,262 --> 01:28:11,253
-Did l win?
-You sure did.

1101
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:15,098
You better believe it, lady.
$1 million is all yours!

1102
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:16,931
l can't believe it!

1103
01:28:17,037 --> 01:28:19,938
It's certainIy been a great summer for you.

1104
01:28:20,006 --> 01:28:23,066
Just a second.
There's a rocket coming in here.

1105
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:24,672
A rocket?

1106
01:28:25,111 --> 01:28:27,136
Wait, what about my money?

1107
01:28:28,615 --> 01:28:30,082
Hello? Hello?

1108
01:28:30,817 --> 01:28:32,409
ls anyone there?

1109
01:28:38,525 --> 01:28:40,425
CIay, Iook! A bonfire!

1110
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:44,627

1111
01:28:46,433 --> 01:28:48,367
Thank you very much.

1112
01:33:15,535 --> 01:33:17,560
EngIish
