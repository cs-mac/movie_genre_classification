1
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,252

and gentleman and welcome

to another edition of oral cinema.

3
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:33,677
A popular series of movies for the ears.

4
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:37,007
Well, we'll be going on
air live in just a couple

5
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,527
of minutes, so please,
may we first of all test

6
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,110
the applause level?

7
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,447
Excellent, thank you very much.

9
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,667
Well, tonight's cinema for sound features,

10
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,667
What about Dick?

11
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,167
An emotion picture for
radio which tells the story

12
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:58,227
of the decline and fall
of the British Empire as

13
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:01,147
seen through the eyes of a piano.

14
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:05,667
So, will you welcome please,
tonight's fantastic cast.

15
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,887

theater in downtown LA

♫ It's oral cinema ♫

23
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:56,867
Once upon a time there
were two sisters who lived

24
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,567
with their Aunt Maggie in
a rambling old Edwardian

25
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,992
Novel in Kensington.

26
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,441
Emma, the older, was an
emotionally repressed English

27
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:07,141
girl, who spent all day
staring out of the window,

28
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:09,861
dreaming of a submissive
role in a sick relationship

29
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,881
with an older sadomasochistic Englishmen.

30
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,141
Helena, her younger
sister, was a dark-haired

31
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,341
foxy minx, who stole
umbrellas to repress her

32
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,901
sexual urges.

33
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,561
- What's a minx, is it an Egyptian thing?

34
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,201
- No dear, that's a sphinx.

35
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,581
- Oh, I thought that was
the backside of something.

36
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,241
- No dear, that's the sphincter.

37
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,161
- Ah!

38
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,341
- Anyways, these two
sisters lived together

39
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:36,081
in a two-story Novel
with their Aunt Maggie,

40
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,801
an amateur dipsomaniac
who spent the afternoons

41
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,721
in Hampstead under a
young Austrian doctor.

42
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,541
- His name is Freud, Roger Freud.

43
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,121
He's licensed in Massage and colonics.

44
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,461
- And who exactly are you?

45
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,481
- I am the narrator of this tale.

46
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,121
Everyone in the story
has touched me and played

47
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:59,101
with me and run their
fingers over me until I

48
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,721
rang with joy.

49
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,691
For you see, I, am a piano.

50
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:07,621
- A piano narrating a story?

51
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,461
- Yes!

52
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:10,181
- Furniture doesn't narrate stories.

53
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,221
- I'm not furniture, I'm an instrument.

54
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,281
- Well, that's stupid.

55
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:15,741
Are we to have Macbeth
narrated by the bagpipes?

56
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:18,281
- Or Les Misérables by the french horn?

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,101
- Look, it's my fucking
play and I'll play a

58
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,301
piano if I want to.

59
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:26,004
Anyway, this is the story of a piano.

60
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:32,176
- Heavens, is that the time,
the 3rd of August, 1910?

61
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:35,199
- Evening Star and
Standard, read all about it!

62
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,457
Another English human found
half-eaten in Houndsditch.

63
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,617
- Oh dear, not the reaper again.

64
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,937
- No, this one's the
mutilator, apparently he eats

65
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,037
his victim.

66
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:46,837
- Ew, how disgusting!

67
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:49,597
Just then, the Reverend
Whoopsie walked into the door.

68
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:51,510
- Ouch!

69
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,373
- Walked into the doorway.

70
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,290
- Oh sorry!

71
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,328
Hello ladies, do I intrude?

72
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,709
- Not from this angle, Mr. Whoopsie.

73
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:13,523
- The Reverend Whoopsie
is a, well he's a--

74
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:16,363
- He's a single clergyman
who's kindly disposed

75
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:17,280
toward men.

76
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,963
- Especially working men,
who I adore above all and

77
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:24,963
put on a pedestal and
offer five shillings to.

78
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:28,843
- Your Christianity does
you credit, Whoopsie.

79
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,183
- Let us not forget
our Lord himself had 12

80
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:35,823
little male friends, all
sailors and nobody said a word.

81
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,023
Have you seen, Dick?

82
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:42,780
- Not for ages, Mr. Whoopsie.

83
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,343
Not since the coming out ball
turned unexpectedly fruity--

84
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,503
- No, I think he means your Nephew, dear.

85
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:53,723
- Oh, dear, yes. Oh, he's
coming down today from Oxford.

86
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:58,023
- I wondered if he'd like
to come camping with me.

87
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,273
I'd love a weekend of Dick.

88
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:06,043
- I've always found 20
minutes quite sufficient.

89
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:10,783
Helena, why don't you play something for

90
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,463
Mr. Whoopsie on your harp?

91
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,063
- I hate the harp, I'm sick of plucking.

92
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:17,183
- Well you should try a
mouth organ like Dick,

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,703
so you can suck and blow--

94
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,103
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, thank you, Emma.

95
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,343
Why don't you sing us
one of your Victorian

96
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:24,423
ballads?

97
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,256
- Righto.

98
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,243
♫ Blow me

99
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,963
♫ A kiss in the moonlight

100
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,123
♫ Blow me

101
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,206
♫ A kiss in the dawn

102
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,375
♫ Blow me down, I never knew I would dare

103
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,298
♫ Now must I swallow

104
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:59,738
♫ My pride while I'm there

105
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:02,338
♫ Heavens, he's coming

106
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:04,878
♫ Inside now

107
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:10,978
♫ He's coming to make me his own

108
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:14,688
♫ In these cold marble halls

109
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:19,379
♫ Where the men hold their balls

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,546
♫ Why must I always be all alone ♫

111
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,752
- Lovely dear, just lovely.

112
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,622
- At that moment they spotted Dick.

113
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:39,322
A young man with floppy
hair, bee-stung lips and

114
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:42,762
a strangely ambivalent sexuality.

115
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,162
One of those impossibly
pretty English boys

116
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:47,822
with ravish me bedroom
eyes and bathroom legs

117
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,482
and drawing room thighs--

118
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:52,382
- Yes, thank you piano
but I think we get it.

119
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:53,215
Dick!

120
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:54,102
- Hello everybody!

121
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,082
Hello Whoopsie!

122
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,502
Hello Emma, old sausage!

123
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,542
- Hello, Dick!

124
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,582
- What are you reading at Oxford, Dick?

125
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,982
- Beauty on the Mountain.

126
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:04,682
- That's Mutiny on the Bounty.

127
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:06,348
- Sorry.

128
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,420
How's the umbrella thing, Helena?

129
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,730
- Oh, Dick...

130
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,558
- Why does she take umbrellas?

131
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,158
- Well, it's just female hysteria, dear.

132
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,678
She needs a little rogering in Hampstead.

133
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:23,595
Ew, he has a new machine
called the Happy Trappy,

134
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:26,596
which relieves all my female tension.

135
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:27,429
- How does it work?

136
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,676
- Well, I lie down, he attaches it to me--

137
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:30,656
- Where?

138
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:32,676
- Well, in Hampstead.

139
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:35,936
- I say, Dick.

140
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:37,836
Do you fancy a weekend in Norfolk?

141
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,316
- Golly, it sounds a bit dull.

142
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:42,356
- Well, yes it is a bit dull,
but we can play Tiddlywinks.

143
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,216
- Oh yes, that's sounds spiffing.

144
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,356
- Splendid!

145
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,756
If you'll excuse me.

146
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,136
- Mind the umbrellas.

147
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:49,894
- Ouch!

148
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,334
- Good heavens, look it's
Mr. Hudson coming here

149
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,974
to this very house to meet
me for the very first time

150
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,974
and perhaps fall hopelessly
in love with me which

151
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,774
he will not be able to
express because he is

152
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,914
English and cannot
mention emotions and has

153
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,454
a beastly wife who cannot
satisfy his perfectly

154
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,294
normal manly urges which
would very easily be

155
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,374
satisfied with some
cold cream, a hand towel

156
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,194
and a copy of the
Guinness Book of Records.

157
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:15,971
Thank you, Aunt Maggie.

158
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,874
- I hope I don't disturb you ladies.

159
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,914
- Hey you, visitor, I'm not a lady.

160
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,786
- Oh, forgive me, it is your hairstyle.

161
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:29,032
My name is Hudson, I am in rubber.

162
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,952
- Oh really, are you wearing it?

163
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:33,192
- No, no, not wearing
it, it is my business.

164
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,892
- Well, of course it's your
business what you wear.

165
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:38,832
- No, no, no, it's my
business, my business.

166
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:41,552
- Mr. Hudson is the owner of
the Hudson Rubber Company.

167
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:45,072
- Oh, the manufacturer
of the Happy Trappy.

168
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:47,692
Well, I find it most
satisfactory, although

169
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,352
occasionally I do miss
the disappointment of a

170
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:51,652
real man.

171
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,732
- Mr. Hudson discovered
those gadgets in India.

172
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:59,092
He saw the future of
rubber and embraced it.

173
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,272
- How precisely this woman understands me.

174
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,432
And how perfectly lovely
she is with her warm eyes,

175
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:06,412
her rosy lips and her firm,
welcoming curtly, bouncy--

176
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,012
- I can hear you, Mr. Hudson.

177
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,352
- Very sorry, Miss Schlegel.

178
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,492
- Have you seen Dick, Mr. Hudson?

179
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,412
- Yes, quite a lot in India.

180
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:19,152
- No, no, this is Dick, he's at Oxford.

181
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,732
- Oh, well what is he reading?

182
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,815
- The Three Musty Queers.

183
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,890
- The Three Musketeers.

184
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:28,062
- Sorry, yes, no.

185
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:30,042
- I read French Philosophy,
trouble was it was

186
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:33,242
all in French, didn't get
a word of it.

187
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:36,482
- Mr. Hudson, you're such a card

188
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,145
- Yes, yes, well, well
we mustn't spend all day

189
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,062
doing that.

190
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,232
This isn't America.

191
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:09,312
- How very witty Mr. Hudson is and he has

192
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,772
such lovely eyes and such
manly thighs and such

193
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,012
eloquent hips and--

194
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,732
- I can hear you, Miss Schlegel.

195
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:16,352
- Oh, I'm sorry.

196
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:18,272
- Well, I must be off,
I need to lubricate a

197
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:21,872
new oiler for my jigger, I
have no idea how that sounded.

198
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:24,972
- It sounds so romantic.

199
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,572
♫ Dick, Dick, what about Dick

200
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,872
♫ Is there some dreadful mystery

201
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,872
♫ Hidden in his history

202
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:37,572
♫ Dick, Dick his light is short of gas

203
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:41,452
♫ I don't think he is playing
from a full deck of cards

204
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:43,412
♫ Everybody likes Dick

205
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:45,232
♫ Everybody wants Dick

206
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,892
♫ Though he seems to be a
sandwich short of a full picnic

207
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:52,252
♫ Dick, Dick's a cappuccino with no foam

208
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:56,812
♫ The lights are on but is
there really anybody home ♫

209
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,812
- Those boys in the pub
seemed to take a real

210
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,592
shine to you, Dick.

211
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:05,425
- Mm.

212
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:07,752
- Dick, has anyone ever told you about the

213
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,567
birds and the bees?

214
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,467
- I'm 26.

215
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,917
- Oh, but did
anybody ever tell you

216
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:19,363
about the birds and the birds?

217
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,503
- No!

218
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,863
- Well, Dick, remember
when we were very young in

219
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:30,303
the nursery with nanny,
being violently incontinent

220
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:34,343
and we were like Peter
Pan, we never wanted to

221
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,543
grow up?

222
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:36,403
- Yes.

223
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,363
- Well, when Peter comes
fluttering in through

224
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,883
the bedroom window, he
wants Wendy, but not

225
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,583
for a wife.

226
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,343
- He's looking for a
Mommy for the lost boys.

227
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:48,123
- You are one of the lost boys, Dick.

228
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,103
- Mm, because I have no mommy.

229
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:52,043
- Because you are different, Dick.

230
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:55,308
Lost boys are not so
much as lost as hiding.

231
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,983
- From whom?

232
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,756
- From the cruel world,
Dick, which frowns on

233
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:04,873
boys trying on Tigerlilie's
flimsy dresses or

234
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:08,167
borrowing makeup from
Tinkerbell, or going out

235
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,834
hunting for rough, male pirates.

236
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,347
Let me put it another
way, when Oscar Wilde

237
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:17,887
talks of a love that
dare not speak its name--

238
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,267
- What's that?

239
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:20,907
- Well, it's male love.

240
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,657
- No, no, not that,
that, there on the beach.

241
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,514
- Oh good heavens, it's a piano.

242
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,927
What's it doing on the beach.

243
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,667
- Sounds like Rat Maninoff.

244
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,047
- I'm going to give this
piano to the working

245
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,407
classes.

246
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,387
- Why?

247
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,447
- Because they need some new instruments.

248
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:43,627
- But I saw it first.

249
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,327
- Then we shall call it
the Dick piano for the

250
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,847
working classes.

251
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:51,967
- Hey Burt.

252
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:52,800
- Yes, Ken.

253
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,087
- See that piano?

254
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:54,920
- Yeah.

255
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,027
- What's it doing on the beach?

256
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,247
- Well perhaps it fell off
the back of the Titanic.

257
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,247
- Maybe its a symbol.

258
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,247
- Nah, it's definitely a piano.

259
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,747
- Hey you two idiots.

260
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,045
- Yes, Gov?

261
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,005
- What's your name?

262
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:09,877
- Burton Russell.

263
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,197
- The Philosopher?

264
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,897
- No Sir, Burton Russell
the furniture remover.

265
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,757
- Oh, well, I want you
to remove this piano to

266
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,197
London, I'm going to give
it to The Working Classes.

267
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,697
- Wow, I'm sure they'll be thrilled,

268
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,317
all 25 million of 'em.

269
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,837
You okay, Ken, you got a bit pale.

270
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:31,677
- There's something oddly
familiar about this piano, Burt.

271
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,510
- What?

272
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,417
- I've seen it before.

273
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,250
- Where?

274
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,297
- In India.

275
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:36,797
When I was in the regiment.

276
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:40,964
It was August 1898, a
stinking hot day in Shagistan.

277
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:44,977
- What's going on?

278
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,337
- He's having a flashback.

279
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:49,017
- Oh dear, can you stop him?

280
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:51,517
- Too late, Sir, it's started.

281
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,715
- I was in British India in Shagistan with

282
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,875
the Queen's Armed Gay Gordon's,

283
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,935
a cross-dressing British regiment sent to

284
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:01,695
raise morale on the Northwest Front Yard.

285
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,355
We were a hundred men under Lord Darling,

286
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,175
guarding the back passage to India.

287
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,275
One day, I came across a local man by the

288
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,795
name of Deepak Rushdie Obi Ben Kingsley.

289
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,375
He was making something rather special.

290
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,395
- There, that is it.

291
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,575
It is finished.

292
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,755
- What is it, Deepak?

293
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,335
- Well, what does it look like?

294
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:29,195
- Well, it looks like a dick.

295
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,855
- Exactly, in fact, it
is a dick, but a toy one

296
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:32,895
for the women.

297
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,095
- What kind of toy.

298
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,695
- A toy women can play with.

299
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:36,536
- Where?

300
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,524
- in their privates.

301
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,164
- Well, what will they do with it?

302
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,522
- Well, they could, sit on it.

303
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:45,042
- You mean--

304
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:45,875
- Yes.

305
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,742
- Good grief! You're a monster.

306
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:50,082
- No, that's just
shortsighted, women will enjoy

307
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:51,882
this little toy.

308
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,562
- But, I can't believe that any woman--

309
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:56,042
- Oh, yes, they will, you
will be shocked, Sergeant

310
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,522
but you're looking at the future.

311
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,742
Hitherto, these little
private toys have been

312
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,882
made only in merchant ivory but now,

313
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:06,222
look, you, rubber, much more flexible,

314
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,502
much more easily sat upon.

315
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:10,562
- Good God!

316
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:12,402
- You are very naïve, Sergeant, there is a

317
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:14,382
shining future for the
personal stimulator.

318
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:16,142
You see, I believe that
one day every woman will

319
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:17,922
have one of these things,
they'll have models

320
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:19,902
of all shapes and sizes,
they will make different

321
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,422
things and they will shake
and they will vibrate

322
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,942
and they will buzz.

323
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,182
They will be called
The American Happy Boy,

324
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,382
the Old Colonial Ghetto
Blaster, Slippery Sid,

325
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:30,842
Black Beauty, Ol' Calcutta,
and your dick will

326
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,042
be useful for a little
while yet, Sergeant but

327
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,982
when push comes to
shove, it will be nothing

328
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,229
better than one of these
little rubber things,

329
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,496
and that is the future then.

330
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:41,656
And then the Hudson Rubber Company will be

331
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,996
worth a fortune and I
will get a proper Indian

332
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:45,216
accent.

333
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:46,882
This...

334
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:49,843
Yes, this I believe.

335
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,156
Thank you.

336
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:02,116
- Morning, Colonel Darling.

337
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:03,536
- Morning, Sergeant.

338
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,636
How's drag night coming along?

339
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,296
- Well, I mean, I'm very
much looking forward

340
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,129
to it, Sir.

341
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,056
I've been up all night
sewing their frocks.

342
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,376
- Is there any finer
sight than a regiment of

343
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,956
young, British men in full drag?

344
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:19,396
By God, it must terrify the enemy.

345
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,558
- Scares the shit outta me, Sir.

346
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,452
Good grief!

347
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,792
- What is it, Sergeant?

348
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,872
- Over there, Sir, in the scruff.

349
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:28,352
- What is that?

350
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:29,792
- It looks like a piano, Sir.

351
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,772
- Beware, Sir, my Lord Darling, this piano

352
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,672
could very well bring
about the collapse of the

353
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,052
entire British Empire.

354
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:35,885
- What?

355
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,352
- Oh, don't mind Deepak, Sir.

356
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:38,992
He always predicting the future.

357
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,052
Last week he foresaw Sarah Palin.

358
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,632
- What's that?

359
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:47,632
- Some kind of British
comedian, I think, Sir.

360
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,032
And then only last night,
he foresaw the Kardashian's.

361
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:53,615
- Is that some kind of disease?

362
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,772
- Yes it is.

363
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,252
- And you should see his little dick.

364
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,952
- I beg your pardon.

365
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,592
- He's got a little rubber toy, Sir.

366
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:11,072
Apparently, women will put
it up their hoochie coo--

367
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,252
- That's quite enough of that.

368
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:15,732
Take this piano back to
camp, it will make its

369
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:19,992
debut tonight at the
regimental fancy dress ball.

370
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,972
- Oh no, Sir, I beg you,
the rivers will run with

371
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,372
blood, the wren will leave
its nest, the frogs will

372
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,572
fall from the sky and
lambs will give birth to

373
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:27,652
little tadpoles.

374
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,332
And the owl will hoot at night and--

375
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:31,752
- The owl always hoots at night.

376
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,712
- This one will hoot in French.

377
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,412
- Oh, shut up, Deepak!

378
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:37,432
And Sergeant?

379
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,292
- Sir?

380
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:41,252
- I want to see you in my
tent the minute we get back.

381
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:43,312
- It might be a few minutes after, Sir.

382
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,145
- Why?

383
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,732
- Well, I have to take a Donald.

384
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,712
- A what?

385
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,635
- A Donald Trump.

386
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,506
- Oh, a dump!

387
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,266
- So I was taken back to
camp by the piano warriors,

388
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:58,586
a small hill tribe used
by the Scot's Gays for

389
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,266
moving furniture.

390
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,966
While Sergeant Russell took
a Donald and hurried off

391
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,926
to meet Lord Darling.

392
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:07,583
It's a tent.

393
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,006
- Oh, sorry

394
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,166
- You wanted to see me, Sir.

395
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,266
- Ah, yes, Sergeant.

396
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,306
Come in!

397
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:17,146
The thing is, I wanted
a little talk with you,

398
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,146
because there's something
that I want to get off

399
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,226
my chest.

400
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,623
- That ugly picture of your wife, Sir?

401
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:26,123
- No, my own chest, not off the furniture.

402
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:30,155
- Perhaps it's just a bad angle, Sir.

403
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:31,988
- It's from the front.

404
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,263
- Exactly.

405
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:36,123
- Sergeant, I'm trying
to tell you something

406
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:38,823
personal, but you know
how we English people are

407
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,323
with emotions.

408
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:41,943
- We don't have any, Sir?

409
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:45,643
- No, we have some but
we don't share them.

410
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,023
We're not a touchy-feely race.

411
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,748
- Like the Nigerians.

412
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:51,681
- What?

413
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:57,109
Look, this may just be
sentimental tosh, but I

414
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:00,109
have been having feelings
about something, well

415
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,749
a little private.

416
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,582
- Any little private we know, Sir?

417
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,289
- It feels a bit awkward,
I mean, after all, we're

418
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,289
in the Army.

419
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,189
- It's fairly common in the Navy, Sir.

420
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,149
- It's just that if anything
should happen to me,

421
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,929
Sergeant, and this is
really important, I should

422
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,012
like you to--

423
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,487
- What, what did he say?

424
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:26,767
- That's just it, I can't remember.

425
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,147
- You can't remember.

426
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,807
- Just that it was very important.

427
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,067
- But, how could you possibly forget?

428
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,227
- It was that night,
when the piano appeared,

429
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:36,927
that the Regimental Transvestite Ball,

430
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,047
something terrible happened.

431
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,465
- Good evening, Major Dickhead.

432
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:42,798
- That's Dihard.

433
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,465
- What?

434
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:49,665
- It's spelled Dickhead but
it's pronounced Duh hard.

435
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:54,058
- Oh, sorry.

436
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:59,745
Splendid sight isn't it,
all these chaps in their

437
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:00,945
frocks.

438
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:02,112
- Stimulating!

439
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,465
- Fancy a stiff one?

440
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,145
- I already have one.

441
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,085
- Lovely gown.

442
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,165
- Thank you.

443
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,125
- Sorry to interrupt this gay banter, Sir,

444
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,205
but there's a bit of trouble in the camp.

445
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,585
- What sort of trouble?

446
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,405
- One of the civilians has been eaten.

447
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:18,238
- Beaten?

448
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:19,105
- No, Sir, eaten.

449
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,945
- Eton as in the public
school founded in 1440

450
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,773
by Henry the VI part three?

451
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:25,903
- No, Sir.

452
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,823
Eatin' as in tucked into a nice sandwich,

453
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,863
nibble, nibble, nibble part chewed.

454
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:32,663
- Good grief!

455
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:33,663
- Shall I cancel the ball?

456
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,623
- Good Lord, no need to do that.

457
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:38,503
The chaps have been up all
night sewing their dresses.

458
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,183
- Righto, Sir.

459
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,543
But I wish I had,

460
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,103
because shortly after the spot dance,

461
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,323
we cut right in to who
just won best frock for

462
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,383
a beautiful hand embroidered ballgown,

463
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,403
all hell broke loose.

464
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:50,683
- It should have been me.

465
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,516
- It was mine.

466
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,683
- My frock was much better than yours--

467
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:53,823
- No, mine had no holes in it--

468
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,943
- Look, yours is Bastille rubbish--

469
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:55,963
- I don't know what your--

470
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,783
- But this terrible
bickering was soon silenced.

471
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,543
by a deadly attack.

472
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:12,660
- What sort of enemy
attacks during drag night?

473
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:16,263
And I'll tell you one thing, Sergeant,

474
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:19,903
before I die, there is
a place far off in the

475
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,723
future where the wind
blows off of the mountains,

476
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,473
and people will be kind and good,

477
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:32,223
and respect one another
and be descent and fair.

478
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,683
- America, Sir?

479
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,263
- No, not America, Holland.

480
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,141
- But there aren't any
mountains in Holland.

481
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:43,974
- What?

482
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:45,601
- Well, there's canals,
and dykes and red light

483
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,181
districts with hookers
in the windows but no

484
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,121
mountains.

485
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:50,021
- The mountains are a metaphor.

486
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:51,801
- But Holland is known for being flat.

487
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:52,961
- It doesn't matter.

488
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,921
- Well, it matters
because if the metaphor is

489
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:56,661
to signify it, it must
be appropriate to the

490
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:57,494
comparison.

491
00:21:57,494 --> 00:21:59,881
- No, no, you see, a
metaphor is by definition

492
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,501
a comparison between two different things.

493
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:04,881
- That's a simile.

494
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,601
But the argument was never resolved.

495
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:15,261
Lord Darling took a terrible wound.

496
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:17,959
- I'm done for, Sergeant.

497
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,877
Don't forget your promise.

498
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:23,037
- Oh I won't, Sir.

499
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:23,870
But I did.

500
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,717
In the morning, there
were only three survivors,

501
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:28,884
me, Deepak and this piano.

502
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:35,557
- Look, there's Helena Schlegel
walking down Bond Street.

503
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:36,657
Helena!

504
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,117
- Hello, Reverend Whoopsie.

505
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,375
Is the flashback over?

506
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,058
- Yes, thank God!

507
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,011
- How was the weekend with Dick?

508
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:43,851
- Marvelous!

509
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:45,031
We played games.

510
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,151
- Who won?

511
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:47,611
- Dick came first.

512
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,571
- It was such fun, Helena.

513
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:51,991
I hardly knew I had it in me.

514
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,431
- Then Dick found this piano on the beach.

515
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,871
- Oh, it's a beauty.

516
00:22:58,871 --> 00:22:59,991
- Isn't it?

517
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,891
- We're giving it to the Workers.

518
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,611
- Oh, not to me, Dick?

519
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,011
- Mr. Whoopsie says The
Workers need some new

520
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:06,871
instruments.

521
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,111
- But such a beautiful
piano, you might have

522
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,091
thought of me.

523
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,191
- Whoopsie was very
insistent and apparently

524
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,791
has a young man in mind.

525
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,311
- Why don't you come
along and meet him tonight

526
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,471
at The Royal Working Men's Club.

527
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,496
- Oh, Dear God!

528
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,684
Oh, sweet Jesus!

529
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:31,351
Shit, Christ, hell,
fuck, will it never end.

530
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,544
- I am very pleased to
present The Dick Piano for the

531
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:39,144
Working Classes to Leonard the Bastard.

532
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:42,204
So what do you think, Helena?

533
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,304
- I think it's monstrous.

534
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,224
Why on earth did you choose him?

535
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,624
- Well, look at him.

536
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,084
He's beautiful.

537
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:50,584
- But he can't play the
piano to save his life.

538
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:52,264
- Congratulations, Lennie.

539
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,784
- Thank you very much, Reverend.

540
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:57,104
- Leonard, this is Helena Schlegel.

541
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,504
- Very nice to meet ya, Miss Schlegel.

542
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,384
- How much do you want for the piano?

543
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:03,184
- Oh no, I couldn't possibly part with it.

544
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:04,504
- I'll give you a hundred guineas.

545
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,824
- Heavens, that's more than
my wife makes in a year.

546
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:07,824
- You're married?

547
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,564
- Who's the clever little ducky wucky?

548
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:11,704
Come on, Lenny give us a smackening,

549
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,944
muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah.

550
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:16,304
- This is Enid.

551
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:17,244
- Who's Enid?

552
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:18,204
- I'm Enid.

553
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,444
- She's your mother?

554
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:20,984
- No, she's me wife.

555
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:24,264
- Oh, sorry,
it's the light in here.

556
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,944
- Don't worry Vicar, if it weren't for me,

557
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:29,284
Lennie would starve.

558
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,464
- Why, what is it you do, Mrs. Bastard?

559
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:32,784
- She has men over.

560
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,504
- And what does she do with them?

561
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:35,644
- None of your business.

562
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:36,824
I make them happy.

563
00:24:36,824 --> 00:24:39,024
You should try it sometime.

564
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:39,864
- Enid!

565
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:40,697
- What?

566
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:45,618
You're a stuck up git!

567
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:49,118
She's looking down her nose at us, Lennie.

568
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,998
- Golly, how awkward.

569
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,598
Well, I must be off to
play hunt the thimble,

570
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,838
with the Bishop of Thornton.

571
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:01,838
Enjoy the piano, Lennie.

572
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,738
- How are we ever going to
get that piano into our place?

573
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,018
- We'll manage somehow.

574
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:09,278
- Well, we'll have to get
a saw and cut it in half.

575
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:10,438
- 150 guineas.

576
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,758
- I cannot lie to you
miss but it's more than me

577
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:13,638
life's worth.

578
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,978
- Give me the address then.

579
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:16,798
- It's at the bottom of Glenn Close.

580
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,138
- I'll tell the Russell brothers.

581
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:19,998
- That's in Houndsditch, miss.

582
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:23,698
But you've probably never
won't have heard of it.

583
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:24,531
- Enid!

584
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,438
- What?

585
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:27,038
- She's only trying to help, girl.

586
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,638
- Well, I don't trust her, Lennie.

587
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,518
I don't like the way she's looking.

588
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:32,351
- At me?

589
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:33,934
- No, at the piano.

590
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:37,198
- Hey, you two idiots.

591
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,031
- Yes, miss.

592
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:40,518
- You're to take this piano
to Kensington Gardens.

593
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:41,351
- This what?

594
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:42,678
- I think she means the piano.

595
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:44,738
- Well, why didn't she
fucking well say so?

596
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,598
- Well, she's a toff
but she has very nice--

597
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:47,456
- Oh, she certainly does, yeah.

598
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:50,836
- Hurry up you two Working
Class wankers, to Kensington.

599
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:53,256
- Kensington, I thought it
was going to Houndsditch.

600
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:56,314
- No, it's written Houndsditch
but it's pronounced

601
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,147
Kensington.

602
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:00,546
- Oh see, that's why she's a toff and I'm

603
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,606
just a cunt--

604
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:02,867
- Tree boy.

605
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:07,946
Come on in, Warhorse.

606
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:10,407
- Look, Lennie, there's
a cart with our piano,

607
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,266
that's not the way to Houndsditch.

608
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,439
I knew it, they're heading for Kensington.

609
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,579
- Perhaps there's a mistake.

610
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,719
- Yeah, accepting pianos
from Whoopsie Dick 'cause

611
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,359
he's a mistake, quick after 'em.

612
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,299
- I'll call the police.

613
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:23,376
- No, no, no, no, not the police, Lennie.

614
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:25,417
Think of my work.

615
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,717
- What is it exactly that you do?

616
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,997
- I told you, Lennie.

617
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,237
It's a kind of therapy.

618
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:34,997
- But must they take their trousers off?

619
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,957
- We'll talk about that later, Lennie.

620
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,677
- No, I want to talk about it now.

621
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,260
- Alright, Leonard.

622
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,337
I'm an ass reader.

623
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,597
- You what?

624
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:50,457
- I tell peoples fortunes.

625
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:52,137
It's like palm reading.

626
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,137
Only I read their asses.

627
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,237
- Ass-trology.

628
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:01,577
- Exactly.

629
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:04,037
- But why do you work all the time?

630
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:04,870
- Because.

631
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:10,777
♫ I'm a simple girl from Houndsditch

632
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:13,717

Where can that neurotic girl be?

668
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:18,467
- Don't worry, Aunt Maggie.

669
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,027
Here's Helena now, on a cart.

670
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,647
- Hey, Emma, look what I've got.

671
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:22,967
- Not more umbrellas.

672
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:23,907
- She's got a piano.

673
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,427
- Where on earth did you get it?

674
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:26,927
- Dick found it and gave it to me.

675
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,687
- Out of breath, out of breath.

676
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:29,520
Excuse me.

677
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,183
- Yes?

678
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:33,243
- That's my piano.

679
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:34,076
- No it's not.

680
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,043
- Oh Helena don't tell me--

681
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:36,203
- It's mine, Emma.

682
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:38,483
- Give it back to me or
else she'll call the police.

683
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:40,863
- You tell her, Lennie.

684
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,203
- What exactly do you want?

685
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:44,903
- We want his piano miss hoity toity.

686
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:46,583
- Stand aside you ruffians.

687
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,943
- Why, Mr. Hudson--

688
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:49,683
- May I be of some assistance.

689
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,763
- This lady is Nickin' my piano.

690
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:54,683
- How dare you make scandalous
aspersions about a young

691
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,183
neurotic upper class woman.

692
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:58,363
I shall thrash you, Sir with my umbrella.

693
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,963
- Oh, I will take that, thank you.

694
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,083
- Please, Mr. Hudson, do not thrash him.

695
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,523
He is Working Class.

696
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:05,923
- No, no. He fucking ain't.

697
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:07,663
He ain't even working.

698
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,783
I mean, Leonard's
unemployed, everyone will be

699
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:12,383
forced to fetch the police,
so give me that piano back.

700
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:14,723
Stealing a piano in broad daylight.

701
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:17,323
Oh, why, I never heard the like of it,

702
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:20,983
oh so help me, I've never
did, in all of my born

703
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:24,863
days, oh blimey, Lord's
have mercy, cross me

704
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:26,423
heart and hope to die.

705
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:38,053
- What is she, some kind
of Dickens Festival?

706
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:41,126
- She's on crack cocaine.

707
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:44,883
Get this woman out of here.

708
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,966
- Eww, hello cuddle butt.

709
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:50,223
- Do you know her?

710
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,903
- Uh, no, absolutely not,
never seen her before

711
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:53,736
in my life.

712
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,204
- You know this man, Enid?

713
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,083
- Yeah, he's a regular,
Saturdays at eight.

714
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,283
- What is she talking about?

715
00:30:58,283 --> 00:30:59,116
- Woman's mad.

716
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,963
- Come on, Enid, let's fetch the coppers.

717
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,643
- You haven't heard the last of this.

718
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:05,283
See you Saturday as usual, dimple butt.

719
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:09,143
- Can I ask you a favor, Mr. Hudson?

720
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,383
That man Leonard that was just here,

721
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:11,563
would you go after him?

722
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:13,843
- Yeah, go after him and then
offer to beat his lights out?

723
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:15,143
- No, offer him a job.

724
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:16,143
- Oh, whatever for?

725
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:18,043
- The piano was his, Helena took it.

726
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,442
- Oh dear, that umbrella
thing is getting much worse.

727
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:22,561
- Yes and soon the police
will be here and there'll

728
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,442
be an awful scene.

729
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:24,521
- Where is this piano?

730
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,001
- Over there on the cart.

731
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:26,962
- Hey, you two idiots.

732
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,282
- Yes, Gov?

733
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:29,241
- What's your name?

734
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,182
- Ken Russell.

735
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,361
- Don't I know you?

736
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:32,542
- No idea, Gov.

737
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,542
- His memories gone, Sir,
he can't remember anything

738
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,322
since the Shagistan massacre.

739
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:37,155
- I see, right.

740
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,881
Well, I want you to
take this piano over to

741
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:40,962
Trevor Howard's End.

742
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:42,421
That is my country cottage at Norfolk.

743
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:44,121
The piano will be safe there.

744
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:44,954
- Alright, Gov.

745
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:46,714
Come on, warhorse.

746
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,680
- And now, Emma, I will
make my excuses and I

747
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,140
shall pursue Leonard
Bastard to offer him a job

748
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,280
in the Accounting Department.

749
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,338
- I don't know how to
thank you, Mr. Hudson.

750
00:31:58,338 --> 00:32:00,558
- You don't need to thank
me unless, perhaps, do

751
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:01,838
have a hairbrush?

752
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,138
- Yes, why?

753
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:05,058
- Oh, nothing.

754
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,438
She detains me with her eyes.

755
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:10,158
I have a strong compulsion towards her.

756
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:10,991
It's as if--

757
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:11,978
- It's as if I could read his thoughts.

758
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:13,178
- It's as if she could read my thoughts.

759
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,418
- That's because we are speaking out loud.

760
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:15,598
- Yes, I suppose so.

761
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:17,658
So here we are still--

762
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:18,491
- Exactly--

763
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,324
- It's not as if--

764
00:32:19,324 --> 00:32:20,157
- no, hardly at all--

765
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:21,218
- And just to think if something doesn't--

766
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:22,051
- No, of course it doesn't--

767
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:22,898
- What's the harm in that?

768
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:23,731
- Simply thinking.

769
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:24,564
- And fantasizing.

770
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:25,418
- Perfectly normal.

771
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:26,498
- You know what I'd like to do?

772
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:27,331
- I have and idea.

773
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:28,738
- I'd like to be a Butler.

774
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:32,678
- A Butler?

775
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:33,758
- In a great house.

776
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,433
- How odd, I too dream of serving.

777
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,676
- Of housekeeping?

778
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:39,136
- To serve alongside a
man who likes order and

779
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,376
discipline.

780
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,716
- Wearing a simple black
dress of silk maybe.

781
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,556
- Yes.

782
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:46,856
- With tightly laced
black corset underneath?

783
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:48,076
- Yes.

784
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,816
- Perhaps regulation black stockings.

785
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:50,958
- Oh, certainly.

786
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,874
- Forgive me, Miss
Schlegel, I must just go and

787
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,314
rearrange my furniture.

788
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,614
- Oh heavens.

789
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:04,874
- These are new trousers,
I'm just breaking them

790
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:05,834
in for a friend.

791
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:06,994
- So I see.

792
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:07,994
- Excuse me.

793
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,674
- Not so fast upper class, middling class,

794
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,174
poor n high class.

795
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:15,834
Allow me to introduce myself.

796
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,974
I'm a private dick by the
name of Inspector McGuffin

797
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:20,594
in New Scotland Yard,
missing furniture division,

798
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:23,494
including instruments, mouth
organs, banjos and other

799
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:26,594
such items lost from
time to time and reported

800
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:28,714
by the public to the police.

801
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:33,714
- Well, how do you do?

802
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,674
- I'll ask the fucking questions.

803
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:40,194
- Well, Inspector, I'm a
very busy man could you

804
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,934
possibly tell me what all this is about?

805
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:42,767
- Certainly.

806
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,554
A young man from The
Workers, Leonard the Bastard

807
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,214
was given a piano from
the Reverend Whoopsie.

808
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:48,334
- I'm sorry, what?

809
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:50,954
- A piano.

810
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:52,634
A young laddie for The Working
Class apparently playing

811
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:55,314
piano in the Royal
McMurkett Class Institute.

812
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:58,429
Young laddie with a great
bit hairstyle took a piano

813
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:01,679
country...

814
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,448
to the Kensington Gardens,

815
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:08,428
where a man identified later
to be Hudson Rubbery Company

816
00:34:08,428 --> 00:34:11,688
to, wish to take
away the piano in secret

817
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:15,048
and the same piano is far
away in a far distant place,

818
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:17,928
arousing the suspicions
of the Metropolitan Opera

819
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:20,948
and the police, namely Inspector McGuffin,

820
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:24,288
who's demanding the same of
Mr. Hudson return

821
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:27,948
information regarding
of the same piano.

822
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:38,595
- Could you just run that by me again?

823
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:41,968
- Mr. Hudson--

824
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,508
- Yes I got that bit.

825
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:46,308
- Do you or do you know
these have taken possession

826
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:49,408
of the same young man, Lenny
Bastard's piano

827
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:52,988
the same said piano for
the country to all uses and

828
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:55,368
practices for your own self abuse and your

829
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:58,228
, please?

830
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,788
- I can honestly assure
you Inspector, I have no

831
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,748
idea what you're talking about.

832
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:06,186
Oh yeah,

833
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:08,186
what I be talking about?

834
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:13,306
- Ah, are you offering
us a holiday in Scotland?

835
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,686
- I'm not offering you a
holiday in Scotland, you

836
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:17,886
daft tit.

837
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,646
Do you no understand any English?

838
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:21,486
Where's the fucking piano?

839
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:24,646
- What fucking piano?

840
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:27,346
- Don't with me, Sonny.

841
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,966
- I think he means piano.

842
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:30,986
- Oh thanks for the
translatoration you upper

843
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:33,626
tightly, upper classy
emotionally retarded twat.

844
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:39,684
- Well, do you honestly
see any piano, Inspector?

845
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:42,044
- Don't be so fucking clever
with Inspector McGuffin,

846
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:43,257
son.

847
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:44,507
From the loo...

848
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:48,794
From the loo, I'll trouble
you no further, but I'm

849
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:53,339
not through with you big
boy so cheerio the loo,

850
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,506
my kind speckled neighbor
and when the

851
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:02,153
bag of oatmeal, empty-handed,

852
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:06,320
the more you know the less the better.

853
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:10,654
Bebo bobbity,

854
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,363
- What an odd person.

855
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:28,333
Miss Schlegel are you hungry,
would you like some dinner?

856
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,774
- Oh gosh, yes, I'm starving.

857
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,415
- Well, let's eat tomorrow,
say at my country house

858
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,248
in Norfolk.

859
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:33,165
- Oh, okay.

860
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,632
- Next day while I was on
the cart, being driven up

861
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:40,972
to Norfolk, Emma took the
train to dine at Trevor

862
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:42,332
Howard's End.

863
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:48,772
- I'm just as excited as
a little girl, to be going

864
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:51,412
off alone to visit the man of my dreams

865
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,510
I was as giggly as a giddy
goose, to get away from my

866
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,110
family and friends, I was
feeling so very grown up

867
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,943
when--

868
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:00,110
- Hello, Emma.

869
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,310
- Reverend Whoopsie.

870
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,930
- Surprise!

871
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,650
- What are you doing on this train?

872
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,130
- Aunt Maggie wants to
make sure you were safe.

873
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,270
- Oh, I'll be perfectly
safe alone in a bedroom

874
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,910
in a country cottage with
an unhappily married man.

875
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:14,470
- Think of your reputation, dear.

876
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,070
- Aunt Maggie, you're here too?

877
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,530
- I love a train journey.
All the jiggling about,

878
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,250
it's like the Happy Boy.

879
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,030
- Is that you, Dick?

880
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,910
- Hello, Emma.

881
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,110
I bought me a mouth organ.

882
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,930
- And I can't wait to play my piano.

883
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,250
- Helena, you as well?

884
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,210
- I'm so excited, I've already found three

885
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,350
umbrellas on the train.

886
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,190
- Give them back.

887
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,210
- No, the owners got off
ages ago and we're here now.

888
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,970
- Spiggy Junction, Spiggy
Junction, all change for

889
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,248
Coupler's bottom, Wrigley
in the Watch, Colonel

890
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:48,415
Strummond Duprat, Lord Dee's
Forget, Butthole's Landing,

891
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:55,182
Downton Abbey, Upper Prostate,

892
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:59,601
Fingley Bongley, Lower Forking,

893
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:01,434
and Spunky Cumsnotoil.

894
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,141
- Emma, welcome to Trevor Howard's End.

895
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:08,421
- Mr. Hudson, how kind
of you to invite me.

896
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,254
- Ass!

897
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,087
- What?

898
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,461
- Hello.

899
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,401
- Hello, Mr. H.

900
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,521
- Hello there.

901
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:16,241
- Oh, I didn't expect the
bloody Spanish Inquisition.

902
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,929
- No, no, neither did I.

903
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,789
They insisted on chaperoning me.

904
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,789
- Well, good
grief, what did they thinks

905
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:35,622
gonna happen?

906
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:36,889
It's not as if we're gonna
run off into the woods and

907
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,449
start playing vicars and nurses.

908
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,389
- No, no, I hear the
woods can be really lovely

909
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,689
this time of year.

910
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:45,029
- Especially with a pig
leg and some extra virgin

911
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:46,389
olive oil.

912
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,169
Well, look, please, all
of you, why don't you

913
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:51,269
just go and play with the farm machinery.

914
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,729
I have to go and poison some rats.

915
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:56,329
- May I help you poison rats, Mr. Hudson?

916
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,289
- Very kind of you, Emma, but it's best

917
00:38:58,289 --> 00:38:59,869
left to a man, this job.

918
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,049
- What's more natural on
a Saturday afternoon than

919
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,089
a good game of poisoning rats?

920
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:05,229
Especially if you can't--

921
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:06,109
- Well, precisely, it's very--

922
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:06,942
- Healthy--

923
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:07,775
- Exactly, it takes my mind off--

924
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:08,608
- Other things--

925
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:10,109
- Quite, otherwise mind can get very--

926
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:10,942
- Whimsical--

927
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:11,949
- No, regular--

928
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,789
- Regime--

929
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,289
- It's hard for a man to--

930
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,429
- Fulfill himself--

931
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:16,262
- Quite.

932
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,929
- Mr. Hudson, may I help you finish

933
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,309
your sentences this weekend?

934
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,749
At the weekend dance, Miss
Schlegel, that would be

935
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:22,582
so very, very--

936
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,122
- Fuck.

937
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,835
- Whatever was that?

938
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:31,745
- It's just, it's my wife, she's dying.

939
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:32,578
- Oh dear.

940
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:35,525
- No need to worry, she
usually dies about this time

941
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:36,358
of day.

942
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:38,405
You can set your watch by it.

943
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:39,505
It's from wisteria.

944
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:40,338
- Hysteria?

945
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,045
- No, wisteria, she's allergic to it.

946
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,865
- She was touched incorrectly
in a cave in India.

947
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,125
Ever since then the
sight of wisteria makes

948
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,485
her wisterical.

949
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,685
- You do not trust your
emotions do you, Mr. Hudson?

950
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,805
- I believe emotions are
like rats, they should

951
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,445
be poisoned at birth.

952
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:00,665
- Mr. Hudson, do you know
what a hooded clitoris is?

953
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,665
- Yes, it's a kind of snake with a cap on.

954
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,825
- No, it is found in the vulva.

955
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,565
- Ah Argentina.

956
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,125
- Have you any idea what the vagina is?

957
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,445
- Well, that's a river
in the Belgian Congo.

958
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,245
- Oh, Mr. Hudson do not toy with me.

959
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,185
My gynecologist tells
me I may never be able

960
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:23,045
to have an emotion.

961
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,845
- Do not despair, Miss
Schlegel, these days we

962
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,825
can do wonderful things with the rubber.

963
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:30,465
And now if you'll excuse me, I have to hit

964
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,548
Tracey and...

965
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:36,381
But more to the point,
my wife is dying again.

966
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:38,821
I must go and give her sugar.

967
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:41,161
- What a strange man
he is but I believe he

968
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:43,501
understands me despite
his attempts to distract

969
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:46,241
me with interesting
discourse about rat poison.

970
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:47,121
- I can still hear you.

971
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:48,561
- Oh, sorry.

972
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:54,281
- Whoa there, look at that house, Ken.

973
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,561
- Blimey.

974
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:57,701
Anne fuckin' Hathaway's fucking cottage.

975
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,661
- The last time I saw so
much thatch it was on a

976
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:02,257
stripper in Belgium.

977
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,857
- Hey Burt, see that bloke
lurking in the window.

978
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:07,817
- The one watching us?

979
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:08,777
- Yeah, do I know him?

980
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:09,610
- Yes, Mr. Hudson.

981
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,457
- He looks familiar.

982
00:41:10,457 --> 00:41:11,997
- Yeah, you saw him
yesterday when he told us

983
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:12,937
to bring the piano here.

984
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:13,877
- Oh yeah.

985
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:15,077
- He thought he knew you.

986
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:15,910
- From where?

987
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,117
- He didn't say.

988
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:17,957
- Look, Dick.

989
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:19,157
My piano is here.

990
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,357
- You're jolly fond of
that piano aren't you?

991
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:22,577
- I love it, Dick.

992
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:23,777
Thank you ever so.

993
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:25,837
- Hey, you wouldn't marry me would ya?

994
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:26,797
- What?

995
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:28,797
- Become my awful wedded wife.

996
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:31,617
- That's lawful, Dick,
and it's not lawful,

997
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:32,717
we're cousins.

998
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,337
- Doesn't stop the Royal family.

999
00:41:34,337 --> 00:41:36,397
- Yes but they're all bonkers.

1000
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:39,137
- Dick, you are very beautiful
but you are a little bit--

1001
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:39,970
- Am I, am I?

1002
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,917
- Yes, yes, Dick, Just a tad.

1003
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,777
I'm so sorry, I don't
care for you in that way.

1004
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:45,997
I can't marry you.

1005
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:48,017
- Well, nevermind, I'm gay anyway.

1006
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,683
- What?

1007
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:52,100
- He's different, that's all.

1008
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:58,577
♫ He's different

1009
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:00,937
♫ So very different

1010
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:04,357
♫ Oh, very different

1011
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:07,397
♫ In every way

1012
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:10,877
♫ That's right, I'm different

1013
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:14,537
♫ So very different

1014
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:18,057
♫ Oh, very different

1015
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:20,224
♫ Not gay

1016
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:24,057
♫ He's not the same as other boys

1017
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:26,657
♫ He likes to play with different toys

1018
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:30,617
♫ I like to stay out late
and dress in fancy things

1019
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,537
♫ Of course you do

1020
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:34,937
♫ He's not the only one there's been

1021
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:38,697
♫ I'm not the first King who is a Queen

1022
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:40,777
♫ But it's illegal still

1023
00:42:40,777 --> 00:42:44,194
♫ So that is why we sing

1024
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:49,997
♫ That he is different

1025
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:52,997
♫ Oh very different

1026
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,397
♫ So very different

1027
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:03,387
♫ Not gay ♫

1028
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:11,957
- Helena played with me all afternoon

1029
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,297
tickling my ivories
with her lovely fingers.

1030
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:16,757
I must say, she has a lovely touch.

1031
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:18,697
Meanwhile, Whoopsie and Dick disappeared

1032
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,017
into the woods.

1033
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,377
Maggie and Emma went
for a walk amongst the

1034
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:25,577
bluebells, and Hudson
busied himself poisoning

1035
00:43:25,577 --> 00:43:28,737
rats until around three when...

1036
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:31,697
- I say, has anyone seen Dick?

1037
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:33,197
- What about Dick?

1038
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,397
- I've lost him.

1039
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:35,657
- What?

1040
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,937
- One minute we were
playing hide and seek,

1041
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:39,857
and the next he had gone.

1042
00:43:39,857 --> 00:43:41,837
- He's probably playing a game on you.

1043
00:43:41,837 --> 00:43:43,537
- Oh, yes, of course.

1044
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,737
I'm sure he'll be back for dinner.

1045
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:50,117
- It's a lovely dinner, Mr. Hudson.

1046
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,677
- The curry goat is delicious.

1047
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:54,037
- Yes, it's something my
wife picked up in India.

1048
00:43:54,037 --> 00:43:55,097
- How is your wife?

1049
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:56,737
- Oh, still off her tits.

1050
00:43:57,977 --> 00:44:00,277
- Still no sign of Dick,
it's very worrying.

1051
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:02,157
- Perhaps we should call the police.

1052
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:03,637
- Too late, we're here.

1053
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,343
- Oh shit.

1054
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:12,855
- My piano, um I'm sorry Inspector,

1055
00:44:12,855 --> 00:44:14,815
you can't come in here,
we're having dinner.

1056
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:16,855
- I'm warning ya's, all of
ya's, every single one of

1057
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,355
you toffee-nosed gits,
sittin' round with your chips,

1058
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:22,175
listening to your Chopin
and your Beethoven, after

1059
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,955
your suppers we have kippers
and lungs and requiche.

1060
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:28,635
Listen that
frame my lips and mouth and

1061
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:32,575
drop a little rain,
falling from the gland that

1062
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:36,555
softly quells the glistening
buns and rivulets and

1063
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:38,805
streams of Bonnie Scotland.

1064
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:44,195
- Is this something about a holiday?

1065
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,475
- You've not won a
holiday, you stupid gits,

1066
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,395
we're tickety boom, may I
ask who owns this piano?

1067
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,175
- Oh, that's mine.

1068
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:53,555
- Oh, is that right?

1069
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:54,975
It's your piano?

1070
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:56,755
- Been in the family for
years, matter of fact,

1071
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:57,595
belongs to my wife.

1072
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,195
- Your wife's as mad as a hatter, coo coo,

1073
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:00,415
bonkers.

1074
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:02,055
She hasn't got a piano.

1075
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:04,875
This piano was stolen
from Leonard Bastard.

1076
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,215
- No, no, Inspector,
you are mistaken, that's

1077
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:10,675
his Helena's piano, I give it her.

1078
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,555
- Leonard Bastard, what
are you doing here,

1079
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:16,055
just in time to confirm
a most unlikely story?

1080
00:45:16,055 --> 00:45:17,555
- I come here to thank
you for getting me the

1081
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:19,595
job with Mr. Hudson and
to give you the piano

1082
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:20,915
you love so much.

1083
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:22,215
- How on earth did you get here?

1084
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:23,155
- I walked.

1085
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,815
- All the way from Houndsditch?

1086
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:25,858
- Yes.

1087
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:26,983
- But that's a hundred miles.

1088
00:45:26,983 --> 00:45:27,816
- Yes.

1089
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:29,133
- Would you like a glass of water?

1090
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:31,033
- Seeing you is refreshment enough for me.

1091
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:33,293
- Oh golly gosh, blush, blush, blush.

1092
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:36,713
- So you see Inspector,
it is Helena's piano.

1093
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:41,015
- How very touching, it
reminds me of a wee ballad

1094
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:44,598
from my childhood,
called The Lonely Trout.

1095
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:52,773
♫ From the heelan hills
and rills o bonnie Scotland

1096
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:59,196
♫ Fra the bogs and fogs
and soggy lochs and braes

1097
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:05,976
♫ From the moontin tops where
lonely jocks drink whiskey

1098
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,236
♫ To the dingy pond wherein
the lone trout plays.

1099
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:19,316
♫ There was once a laddie
wandered wi his lassie

1100
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:26,296
♫ When she told him that
her love for him was dead.

1101
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,489
♫ As she left this lonely boy

1102
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,389
♫ Who’d now lost his only joy

1103
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:40,556
♫ The trout raised his head
and this is what he said

1104

1164
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:17,129
- I think that's quite
enough of that, Inspector.

1165
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:19,269
I said come on, off, off, come on, you.

1166
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:22,849
Off, off, off, take your boobs with you.

1167
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:25,989
And what about Dick?

1168
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,469
- I completely forgot about wee Dickie.

1169
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,049
- My nephew is missing.

1170
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:31,409
- No he's not.

1171
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,089
- Oh you found Dick.

1172
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:34,409
Oh thank heaven.

1173
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,649
- Oh, shut your dribble,
you big.

1174
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:39,869
You're a disgrace to the
We Free course frolicking

1175
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,036
about in pines with naked
laddies beneath.

1176
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:53,942
We have indeed found him
and he told me a joke.

1177
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:55,702
We found him in the woods.

1178
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:57,302
- In the woods, is he dead?

1179
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:00,261
- Not quite but severely blootered.

1180
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:02,542
He was attacked by some hungry vampire who

1181
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:05,362
tried to eat him all up
and do him like a dinner.

1182
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,942
- Great Scott!

1183
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:10,922
- Thank you.

1184
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,262
- But who would want to harm Dick?

1185
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:20,362
- Somebody who wanted to shut his face.

1186
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:23,262
- But Dick knows nothing about everything.

1187
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:27,179
- Do you know we have a
wee saying in Scotland,

1188
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:34,542
we men in the nuts.

1189
00:49:37,002 --> 00:49:40,822
- One can only imagine what that means.

1190
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:43,022
- Sometimes the things
we don't know are the

1191
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,722
unknown knowns that we
don't know we think we know

1192
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:47,481
but others think we do.

1193
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:53,062
- Well, that's easy for
you to say, Inspector.

1194
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:55,282
But it is idle to
speculate, since Dick can

1195
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:56,602
no longer speak.

1196
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,822
- I have an Indian
gentleman who specializes

1197
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:00,882
recovering memories by the name of

1198
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:03,549
Deepak Rushdie Obi Ben Kingsley.

1199
00:50:04,422 --> 00:50:06,502
Perhaps wee Dickie
might remember something

1200
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,222
when he comes out of his coma.

1201
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:09,682
- But when will he wake up?

1202
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:13,502
- Who knows, a few weeks,
a few months, a few

1203
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:15,682
years per chance.

1204
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,902
- Years, but whatever shall we do?

1205
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:20,735
- We must all go to Italy at once.

1206
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:25,038
♫ To Italy

1207
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:25,871
♫ To Italy

1208
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:27,558
♫ Oh yes, let's go to Italy

1209
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,278
♫ Where painters paint so prettily

1210
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,494
♫ On ceilings there

1211
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,074
♫ Where everyone talks wittily

1212
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:35,014
♫ And no one argues bitterly

1213
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:39,034
♫ And we'll free to really
have some feelings there

1214
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,814
♫ Let's leave the soggy English rain

1215
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:42,394
♫ And go to Italy by train

1216
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:46,194
♫ To visit Florence,
Venice and then Rome again

1217
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:48,174
♫ We'll wine and dine 'til we are sick

1218
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:50,334
♫ And we won't have to think of Dick

1219
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:53,614
♫ At least until we
finally come home again

1220
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:56,374
♫ Italia

1221
00:50:56,374 --> 00:51:00,541
♫ La, la la, la la, la
la, la la, la la, la

1222

♫ Ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya
ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya

1224
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,734
♫ No, I cannot stand Italians

1225
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,734
♫ They wear the gold medallions

1226
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:16,594
♫ And act like bloody stallions

1227
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:18,694
♫ All the waiters there

1228
00:51:18,694 --> 00:51:20,374
♫ Telly, telly, dirty telly

1229
00:51:20,374 --> 00:51:22,614
♫ It all gets on my nelly

1230
00:51:22,614 --> 00:51:24,074
♫ As far as I'm concerned

1231
00:51:24,074 --> 00:51:26,414
♫ They're pasterbators there

1232
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:29,014
♫ Italia

1233
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:33,181

1234

♫ Ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya
ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya

1236
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,494
♫ Italian men are gorgeous

1237
00:51:45,494 --> 00:51:47,414

1264
00:53:15,214 --> 00:53:16,994
- I was on the move again.

1265
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,254
This time to Italy where English people go

1266
00:53:19,254 --> 00:53:20,671
to have emotions.

1267
00:53:21,954 --> 00:53:24,474
Consequently, Emma remained behind.

1268
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:27,214
Meanwhile, the party arrived in Florence.

1269
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:34,334
The traveling party arrived in Florence.

1270
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:35,814
- Sorry.

1271
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:38,214
- What joy to be in
Italy with these friendly

1272
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,464
men and their encouragingly lax morals.

1273
00:53:42,574 --> 00:53:44,814
- Aunt Maggie, why is
that statue not wearing

1274
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:46,014
any underpants?

1275
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,294
- I suppose because it's
so terribly hot dear.

1276
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:50,234
- Amd what is that little thing?

1277
00:53:50,234 --> 00:53:53,134
- Well, it's an umbrella symbol.

1278
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:56,551
Oh, here we are, the Pensione Berlusconi.

1279
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:00,654
- Buon giorno, Signore.

1280
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,987
- Bunga bunga, Signor pederasty Inglesi.

1281
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:09,614
- Oh, Signor Berlusconi,
how nice to see you.

1282
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:12,374
- Ah, Signora De Clepa Inglesi.

1283
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,614
I have reserved for you and your niece,

1284
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:17,281
a room with no view.

1285
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,174
- Thank you so much, dear.

1286
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,507
Helena is allergic to views.

1287
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:26,554
- Particularly right wing views.

1288
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:30,374
- Well, welcome to
Pensione where emotionally

1289
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:32,874
repressed English people
can learn to enjoy

1290
00:54:32,874 --> 00:54:34,374
themselves.

1291
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:37,974
How to chew the pizza, how
to nibble on the pasta,

1292
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,414
how to swallow salami--

1293
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:44,014
- Yes, yes, I think that's quite enough

1294
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,174
single entendre's for now, Signor.

1295
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:49,794
Come on, Helena, let's
freshen up while they

1296
00:54:49,794 --> 00:54:51,377
unload our baggage.

1297
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:53,874
- Blimey!

1298
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,554
Look at that statue, Ken.

1299
00:54:55,554 --> 00:54:57,694
- That bloke's not wearing any underpants.

1300
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,454
- That's Michaelangelo's David.

1301
00:54:59,454 --> 00:55:01,194
- Michaelangelo's dick, more like.

1302
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:02,274
- Yeah.

1303
00:55:02,274 --> 00:55:04,194
Scusi, Signore.

1304
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:05,894
- Yeah, delivery's are around the back.

1305
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:06,734
- Oh, charming.

1306
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,674
- You bloody Italians,
should be ashamed of

1307
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:10,634
yourselves, all these naked statues.

1308
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:13,194
Have you Italians never
heard of underpants?

1309
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:50,654
- What's he saying?

1310
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:52,974
- He says you condescending
English bastards,

1311
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,174
I invite you to pull your
foreskin over your heads

1312
00:55:55,174 --> 00:55:58,974
and give yourself an
enema with a wine bottle.

1313
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:01,554
May you sleep in sheep shit
and your sphincter become

1314
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:04,094
a highway for Australian rugby players.

1315
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:09,954
- Blimey, I never knew you spoke Italian.

1316
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:13,094
- I learned it on the train.

1317
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:14,814
- What is it you two idiots want?

1318
00:56:14,814 --> 00:56:16,754
- Oy, don't you get lippy with us, mate.

1319
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:18,074
Who do you think you are?

1320
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,054
- You arrogant, English pigs.

1321
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:21,854
You come from a miserable island,

1322
00:56:21,854 --> 00:56:25,694
it rains every day where
the men are pederasts

1323
00:56:25,694 --> 00:56:28,554
and the women are frozen
from the waist down.

1324
00:56:28,554 --> 00:56:32,721
You have no cheese, you
have no wine, no olive oil,

1325
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:35,714
no garlic, you cannot
play football and your

1326
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:37,734
music is all poo.

1327
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:41,494
- Oh yeah, yeah well,
that's where you're wrong,

1328
00:56:41,494 --> 00:56:43,754
Mister, ice cream selling
bloody fascist wop.

1329
00:56:43,754 --> 00:56:46,774
Cause we have brought a piano
for Miss Helena to play.

1330
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:47,607
- What?

1331
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:49,834
The bella signorina with
the lovely swishy hair?

1332
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:50,954
- That's the one.

1333
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:55,394
- Well, oh, mi apologia,
I invite you to stay,

1334
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:58,014
for dinner and anal sex.

1335
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:11,007
- Ken?

1336
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:16,834
- Dinner would be nice.

1337
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:17,667
- Yeah.

1338
00:57:20,044 --> 00:57:21,734
- Oh, I am so very happy.

1339
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:24,067
At last I have my own piano.

1340
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:31,894
♫ One day some lovely fellas

1341
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:34,394
♫ Going too show me his umbrella

1342
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:36,074
♫ But until that day

1343
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:39,914
♫ Ill play upon my pi-an-o

1344
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,254
♫ If he's jealous

1345
00:57:41,254 --> 00:57:42,494
♫ Of the fellas

1346
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:44,914
♫ Who have shown me their umbrellas

1347
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:46,754
♫ He'll be happy when I let him

1348
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:50,054
♫ Touch my pi-an-o

1349
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:51,934
♫ My Pi-an-o

1350
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:54,174
♫ My pi-an-o

1351
00:57:54,174 --> 00:57:56,374
♫ It's such a lovely instrument

1352
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:58,574
♫ And I really love it so

1353
00:57:58,574 --> 00:58:00,894
♫ My pi-an-o

1354
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,454
♫ My pi-an-o

1355
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:04,974
♫ Who wouldn't like to play

1356
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:07,807
♫ Upon my pi-an-o

1357
00:58:09,454 --> 00:58:11,914
♫ From Florence down to Napoli

1358
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:14,314
♫ The men behave unhappily

1359
00:58:14,314 --> 00:58:19,034
♫ If they can't get a
glimpse of my sweet pi-an-o

1360
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,494
♫ The Frenchmen and the Dutchmen

1361
00:58:21,494 --> 00:58:23,154
♫ Always shout and yell

1362
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:24,314
♫ How much then

1363
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:26,274
♫ But I won't let them touch me

1364
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:29,734
♫ Like my pi-an-o

1365
00:58:29,734 --> 00:58:31,674
♫ My pi-an-o

1366
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,334
♫ My pi-an-o

1367
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:36,354
♫ Tickling the ivories

1368
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:38,674
♫ I really love it so

1369
00:58:38,674 --> 00:58:40,780
♫ My pi-an-o

1370
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,500
♫ I so adore

1371
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,760
♫ I'll play with it all night and day

1372
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,840
♫ Until I get too sore ♫

1373
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,920
♫ Her pi-an-o

1374
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,360
♫ Her pi-an-o

1375
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,060
♫ Who wouldn't like a go

1376
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,880
♫ Upon her piano

1377
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,880
♫ The British upper classes

1378
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,900
♫ Can all shove it up their asses

1379
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,080
♫ For the poor and struggling masses

1380
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,660
♫ Have no pi-an-o ♫

1381
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,960
- What a lucky, lucky old piano

1382
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,420
- Leonard Bastard.

1383
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,220
What on earth are you doing in Italy?

1384
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,053
- I walked.

1385
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:26,675
- But, that's almost 900 miles.

1386
00:59:26,675 --> 00:59:28,008
- 903, actually.

1387
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:30,578
- Is your wife here?

1388
00:59:30,578 --> 00:59:32,318
- No, she couldn't get away.

1389
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,318
- You tied her up.

1390
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:36,238
- No, she's helping McGuffin
with his Dick problem.

1391
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:37,098
- How?

1392
00:59:37,098 --> 00:59:39,178
- Well, she's a professional ass reader

1393
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:41,038
and she has some information that may be

1394
00:59:41,038 --> 00:59:42,378
helpful to the police.

1395
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,898
- Oh gosh, really?

1396
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:45,578
I have judged her too harshly as a

1397
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:47,178
worthless slut who trapped you into an

1398
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:48,238
unhappy marriage.

1399
00:59:48,238 --> 00:59:49,071
- No, no.

1400
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:50,638
She is a worthless slut who trapped me

1401
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:52,158
into an unhappy marriage but she is a very

1402
00:59:52,158 --> 00:59:53,998
fine ass reader.

1403
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:57,438
- Leonard, I have been less
than generous with you.

1404
00:59:57,438 --> 00:59:59,678
I want you to play with me.

1405
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:00,511
- What?

1406
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:01,344
- On the piano.

1407
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:02,177
- When?

1408
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:03,010
- Right now.

1409
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,318
- Let's go.

1410
01:00:10,038 --> 01:00:11,218
- Oh, good grief.

1411
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:12,658
Close your eyes Mr. Whoopsie.

1412
01:00:12,658 --> 01:00:13,818
You're a clergyman.

1413
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,298
- What is going on?

1414
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:17,138
- Helena is playing a piano in public with

1415
01:00:17,138 --> 01:00:19,498
a mad man of The Working Classes.

1416
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:21,223
- How shameful!

1417
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:23,056
Unprotected Beethoven.

1418
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:27,496
- Whatever are we to do?

1419
01:00:27,496 --> 01:00:30,536
- Russell brothers, pick up the piano.

1420
01:00:30,536 --> 01:00:32,716
We must all go home at once.

1421
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:35,296
- Who is it?

1422
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:39,792
- Open the door, Emma.

1423
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,752
I must see you at once.

1424
01:00:41,752 --> 01:00:43,552
- Hang on a minute.

1425
01:01:06,952 --> 01:01:08,732
Why, Mr. Hudson.

1426
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,012
- Thank God, you're here.

1427
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:12,654
- Mr. Hudson, you're in
a state of some emotion.

1428
01:01:12,654 --> 01:01:13,710
- I'm sorry, these are new trousers,

1429
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,690
just breaking them in for a friend.

1430
01:01:16,523 --> 01:01:18,130
- What are you doing in a house, alone,

1431
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,670
with a woman whose Aunt
and Sister have not

1432
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,690
yet returned from Italy
and with no one around to

1433
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,630
notice if you were to
accidentally slip upstairs

1434
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,530
with a hair brush?

1435
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,670
- No, I have something
terribly serious to tell you.

1436
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,010
My wife is dead.

1437
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,070
- For real?

1438
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:29,990
- Yeah.

1439
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,230
- How did she die?

1440
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,790
- An unfortunate brush with rat poison.

1441
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,630
She apparently mistook it for sugar.

1442
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,550
- It's easily done.

1443
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:39,470
- I blame myself.

1444
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,370
- Oh, it could happen to
anyone with an unwanted wife.

1445
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,510
- I wasn't there, you see.

1446
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,470
I was in Manchester.

1447
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,610
It was a rubber thing.

1448
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,070
- A perfectly reasonable alibis.

1449
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,930
- Yes, the police suspect foul play.

1450
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,850
They think the same man who had done it to

1451
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,630
Dick has gone and done it to her.

1452
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,510
I'm sorry, I seem to have lost control

1453
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,730
of my tongue.

1454
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,210
- Am I making you nervous?

1455
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,850
- Standing in the
doorway in a nightie with

1456
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:02,850
a light behind you, nervous
isn't quite the word.

1457
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,890
- I know what you'd like.

1458
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,723
- Really?

1459
01:02:04,723 --> 01:02:05,730
- A nice cup of tea.

1460
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:12,807
- Uh, it's close.

1461
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,750
- Oh I love the way he
stares at me when we're

1462
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,583
making tea.

1463
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,770
I know exactly what he's thinking.

1464
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,350
- I know exactly what I'm thinking.

1465
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,290
- He can read me like a book.

1466
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,250
- I can read her like a book.

1467
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,450
- The Big Boy's Book of Fairies.

1468
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,890
- 107 nasty positions to do it.

1469
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,870
- He seems to know exactly what I'd like.

1470
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,510
- I know exactly what she'd like.

1471
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,990
- I'd like to play tiddlywinks.

1472
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,130
- She wants to be shagged senseless.

1473
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,930
- Then supper at the Ritz
and afterwards, dancing.

1474
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,110
- Then up to the bathroom
for a good scrubbing.

1475
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:36,943
- What?

1476
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:38,470
- With a stiff Loofah
rag and scrubbing with

1477
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,710
a soapy tub of water til
she blushes naked all

1478
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,450
over with that pale, delicate skin.

1479
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,310
- Good heavens.

1480
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,637
- I wanna kiss your warm, soapy buttocks,

1481
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:45,470
- Oh!

1482
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,553
- probing deeper and deeper--

1483
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:47,386
- Oh!

1484
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:48,219
- Stroking and spanking
and kneading and plunging

1485
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:49,277
- and thrusting.
- Oh!

1486
01:02:49,277 --> 01:02:51,495
Turn you over then
plunging and thrusting you

1487
01:02:51,495 --> 01:02:52,328
- Oh!

1488
01:02:52,328 --> 01:02:55,180
- like a giant glob of
internal combustion engine

1489
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,013
- oh, oh.

1490
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:58,025
- buzzing haplessly like
a bee in a bottle and

1491
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:58,858
- Ohhhh!

1492
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,075
- screaming like a monkey on speed.

1493
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:01,481
- Ooooohhhhh!

1494
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:03,574
- Emma, dear!
- Oh!

1495
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:04,709
- We're back from Italy.
- Oh!

1496
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:05,729
- Emma, Emma!

1497
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:06,562
- Good grief!
- Ohhh!

1498
01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:07,509
- what's happening?
- Oooh ooooh!

1499
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:08,569
- Is she alright?

1500
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:10,009
- Oh, I'd say so.

1501
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:11,329
- Ohhhhhh!

1502
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,809
- What is happening to her?

1503
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:14,669
- Emma is having an emotion.

1504
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:21,429
Italy had worked it's gay magic.

1505
01:03:21,429 --> 01:03:24,929
And the English were now
all caring and sensitive.

1506
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:27,262
Dick was on everyone's lips.

1507
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:33,978
We shall skip World
War I, which was mainly

1508
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:37,228
about a horse and move on to August...

1509
01:03:39,252 --> 01:03:42,932
1929 when Aunt Maggie went to visit Dick.

1510
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:45,052
But when she arrived at the Royal Hospital

1511
01:03:45,052 --> 01:03:48,912
for the Extremely Mad,
she was in for a surprise.

1512
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,132
- You've a visitor, Dick.

1513
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:52,524
- Has there been any
change in his condition?

1514
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,424
- Alas, Madam, there is none.

1515
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:57,744
- Allow me to present Deepak
Rushdie Obi Ben Kingsley.

1516
01:03:57,744 --> 01:04:00,384
Visiting professor of psycho
babble at the University

1517
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:01,964
of Virginia Woolf.

1518
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,704
- Oh, I read about him
in the rubber ware news.

1519
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:07,044
It seems you are the
inventor of the American

1520
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,184
Happy Boy.

1521
01:04:08,184 --> 01:04:10,044
- That is I, myself, good lady.

1522
01:04:10,044 --> 01:04:12,624
- Oh, it has relieved many of my emotions.

1523
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:16,304
- Well, I am proud to
have had a hand in that.

1524
01:04:16,304 --> 01:04:18,144
- We're going to seek the assistance of a

1525
01:04:18,144 --> 01:04:19,504
professional ass reader.

1526
01:04:19,504 --> 01:04:21,558
But first, we have wee surprise.

1527
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,838
Mr. Russell, bring in the piano.

1528
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:25,618
- Here ya go.

1529
01:04:25,618 --> 01:04:27,898
- Good heavens, it is
the piano from Shagistan.

1530
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,998
- This piano has been
close to the scene of

1531
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,758
all these violent attacks.

1532
01:04:32,758 --> 01:04:34,398
- You suspect the piano?

1533
01:04:34,398 --> 01:04:36,358
- Of course I don't
fuckin' suspect the piano,

1534
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:39,118
you weird Indian psycho
babbling Chapati muncher.

1535
01:04:39,118 --> 01:04:40,978
I thought it may help to jog his memory.

1536
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,098
- If only this piano
could talk, Inspector.

1537
01:04:43,098 --> 01:04:46,716
- Piano's don't fucking talk,
you silly touchy-feely wanked

1538
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,714
out son of a bloody.

1539
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:53,154
You gobbledy shaky sloppy
sloppy touchy-feely bullocks.

1540
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:55,994
But since Dick found it
on the beach I thought it

1541
01:04:55,994 --> 01:04:58,994
might help him to remember a happier time.

1542
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:00,674
- This where you wanted the piano, Gov?

1543
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:02,349
- Just drop it right here.

1544
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:03,630
Thank you.

1545
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,630
The piano's at the heart of the mystery.

1546
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:06,610
- Will that be all, Sir?

1547
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,490
- Good heavens, is that you, Sergeant?

1548
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,410
- Do I kbow you, Sir?

1549
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:12,370
- Sergeant Ken Russell of
the 13th foot and mouth.

1550
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,510
Do you not remember me, I
am Deepak from Shagistan?

1551
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,730
- Alas Sir, he can
remember nothing since the

1552
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,310
massacre.

1553
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,430
- Well, Darling told
him something important

1554
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,630
but he's forgot it.

1555
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,870
- Do not worry, Inspector.

1556
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,250
I will put him in a trance.

1557
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,508
Now, Ken, listen to me,
you're going to relax,

1558
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,629
you're going into a deep sleep,

1559
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:31,469
not you, Inspector.

1560
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,949
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

1561
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,829
- Just relax, Ken, Kenneth.

1562
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:38,996
Now, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1563
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,469
You're gone.

1564
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:42,549
- Where am I?

1565
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:44,709
- You are in Shagistan, Sergeant.

1566
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:45,909
- Oh, yeah.

1567
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:46,889
Bloody hot, innit?

1568
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:48,309
- It's very hot, Ken.

1569
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:49,749
- Lord, these bloody flies.

1570
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:51,109
- Oh, these bloody flies.

1571
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:53,009
Now you're with Lord
Darling and he is talking

1572
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:53,842
to you.

1573
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,009
What is Lord Darling saying?

1574
01:05:55,009 --> 01:05:56,988
- He is telling me a very
disturbing tale, Sir.

1575
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:58,209
He's saying...

1576
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:00,669
- There are some things
I am not proud of in

1577
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:04,502
my life, Sergeant.

1578
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,949
There was a young governess
I met at a coming out

1579
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:12,116
ball , her name was Margaret.

1580
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:16,941
She was beautiful and
I couldn't help myself,

1581
01:06:16,941 --> 01:06:21,108
I plied her with Gin and
I took advantage of her.

1582
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:27,065
Too late I learned that nine
months later,

1583
01:06:27,065 --> 01:06:30,185
she had a child, but by
then, my regiment had

1584
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,885
shipped out.

1585
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:36,105
I still don't know the name of that child.

1586
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:38,045
- The child's name was Dick.

1587
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:39,525
- How could you know that?

1588
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:41,885
Because I was that Governess.

1589
01:06:41,885 --> 01:06:43,285
Margaret was me.

1590
01:06:43,285 --> 01:06:44,618
This is my Dick.

1591
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:47,425
- He's your son?

1592
01:06:47,425 --> 01:06:48,745
- Yes, Inspector.

1593
01:06:48,745 --> 01:06:51,445
- Oh, mommy, I'm coming out of my coma.

1594
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:54,005
- There, there, Dick, mommy's here.

1595
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:57,945
- Mommy, can I have a little
suck on your breast, please?

1596
01:06:57,945 --> 01:07:00,845
- Well, I suppose a little wouldn't hurt.

1597
01:07:00,845 --> 01:07:02,485
See if I can still lactate.

1598
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,405
Oh, yes I can.
- Sergeant.

1599
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:05,185
- Oh, yes, it's happening.

1600
01:07:05,185 --> 01:07:07,005
- Sergeant.
- Oh, Russell likes it, ew.

1601
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:09,645
- Sergeant, control,
control your energies.

1602
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:10,585
- Eww!

1603
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:13,365
- Sergeant, for fucks
sake, control the energies

1604
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:14,425
in your head.

1605
01:07:14,425 --> 01:07:16,165
- Very difficult, very difficult, Sir.

1606
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,225
- What else is Lord Darling saying to you?

1607
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:21,392
- It's all coming back to me now, Sir.

1608
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:26,421
It's a little bit misty
but it's coming back.

1609
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:27,481
He says--

1610
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:31,648
- Take this piano to my
son, Dick, at Darling Hall.

1611
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:37,077
- Very well, and so you have
done, your task is complete

1612
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:39,797
Sergeant, Dick has the
piano and he has a mommy.

1613
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:42,677
- But we still don't know
who attacked him and why?

1614
01:07:42,677 --> 01:07:44,397
- That is true, Inspector,
it is time for the

1615
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:46,057
ass reading, I think.

1616
01:07:48,017 --> 01:07:49,035
- Who is it?

1617
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:51,115
Oh, it's you, come on in, yeah,

1618
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:53,555
come to have your body
read again, have ya?

1619
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:55,315
- You're a right naughty boy ain't ya,

1620
01:07:55,315 --> 01:07:57,075
I saw it in your bum the other day.

1621
01:07:57,075 --> 01:07:59,035
I said to myself, I said there's violence

1622
01:07:59,035 --> 01:08:01,615
in that bottom, Enid my
love, those cheeks have

1623
01:08:01,615 --> 01:08:04,735
seen more than their
fair share of sorrow and

1624
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,295
a deep dark secret is
hidden in that derriere

1625
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:10,355
but I haven't told no
one, Gov, so help me,

1626
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:12,535
I wouldn't tell Inspector
McGuffin nothing,

1627
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:14,455
as long as you brought
me that little bit of

1628
01:08:14,455 --> 01:08:16,515
money you promised me.

1629
01:08:16,515 --> 01:08:18,575
Dear, dear, what's that?

1630
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:21,615
No, no, please, don't, stop!

1631
01:08:27,995 --> 01:08:30,375
- Houndsditch mutilator strikes again!

1632
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,458
Ass reader ass-assinated!

1633
01:08:35,815 --> 01:08:37,595
- Dammit, Deepak, we're too late.

1634
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:39,895
- Police working on the
theory that they have no idea

1635
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:41,335
what's going on!

1636
01:08:41,335 --> 01:08:42,895
- Watch to, you.

1637
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:44,215
- This is most unfortunate.

1638
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:46,175
I had high hopes that she
might see something useful

1639
01:08:46,175 --> 01:08:47,515
in Dick's behind.

1640
01:08:47,515 --> 01:08:49,415
- Who assassinates an ass reader and why?

1641
01:08:49,415 --> 01:08:53,498
- Maybe the King of Sweden
for shits and giggles.

1642
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:57,566
- What?

1643
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:06,367
- No, she knew something,
she knew the identity of

1644
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:07,527
the mutilator.

1645
01:09:07,527 --> 01:09:08,887
- Well, how could that be so>

1646
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:10,761
- She opened the door in her pajamas.

1647
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,428
- She had a door in her pajamas?

1648
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:18,537
- It has to be somebody she knows well.

1649
01:09:18,537 --> 01:09:20,158
Her husband has disappeared.

1650
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,897
We must find Leonard Bastard immediately.

1651
01:09:25,337 --> 01:09:26,337
- Who is it?

1652
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:27,417
- Open the door, Emma.

1653
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,097
I must see you at once.

1654
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:30,918
- Hang on a minute.

1655
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:45,477
- Emma, is there a window I can just--

1656
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:47,817
- Why, Mr. Hudson, I'm here all alone.

1657
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,217
- I have something to tell you.

1658
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:51,617
- I have a hair brush upstairs.

1659
01:09:51,617 --> 01:09:53,177
- Something terrible has happened.

1660
01:09:53,177 --> 01:09:54,637
- Leonard Bastard's
wife has been murdered.

1661
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:55,577
- No, worse than that.

1662
01:09:55,577 --> 01:09:56,998
- What could possibly be worse than that?

1663
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:58,678
- I am bankrupt.

1664
01:09:58,678 --> 01:09:59,617
- Oh dear!

1665
01:09:59,617 --> 01:10:01,017
- This afternoon the
Hudson Rubber Company just

1666
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:01,850
collapsed.

1667
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,683
- Into the Thames?

1668
01:10:02,683 --> 01:10:03,837
- Financially, you see.

1669
01:10:03,837 --> 01:10:06,538
Someone in the Accounts Department
was speculating huge sums

1670
01:10:06,538 --> 01:10:08,577
against the future price of rubber and now

1671
01:10:08,577 --> 01:10:09,857
I'm utterly ruined.

1672
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:11,017
- Oh, crikey!

1673
01:10:11,017 --> 01:10:12,717
Maybe the young man who
made these speculations

1674
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:14,717
was Leonard Bastard,
the very man you begged

1675
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:15,617
me to employ.

1676
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:16,457
- Oh!

1677
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:17,290
Oops!

1678
01:10:19,337 --> 01:10:21,557
- Well, oops doesn't quite
hack it actually, Emma.

1679
01:10:21,557 --> 01:10:25,617
So, because of this, I
have decided to accept the

1680
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:28,797
job of a Butler in the West country.

1681
01:10:28,797 --> 01:10:31,047
- Oh, well have a good one.

1682
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,478
- Yes, ta very much.

1683
01:10:35,675 --> 01:10:36,976
- No, wait.

1684
01:10:36,976 --> 01:10:38,955
I am an Englishwoman of a certain age.

1685
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:41,635
You are the only man who
ever gave me an emotion.

1686
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:43,995
I am going to do something
utterly improper.

1687
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:44,835
- Oh yes?

1688
01:10:44,835 --> 01:10:49,002
- I am going to pack some
hankies and come with you.

1689
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:55,810
- Darling Hall, doesn't it
look great in the rain, Butler?

1690
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,030
- Uh, yes, my lord.

1691
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:59,830
- Butler, what time is it?

1692
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,590
19:35, by the way.

1693
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,070
- Who is that woman in
the giant black dress?

1694
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,450
- That is the housekeeper,
Miss Schlegel, Sir.

1695
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,210
- Fine figure of a woman.

1696
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,590
- Yes, Sir, she does her job very well.

1697
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:14,350
- This weekend, I'm having
a Nazi party, the usual

1698
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:18,150
thing, you know, uniforms,
speeches, search lights,

1699
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,090
discipline, boots, bondage,
Vodka, and tight leather

1700
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,050
trousers.

1701
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:25,590
- Very good, my lord.

1702
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,990
- This will be the first
Nazi party ever held in

1703
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,910
England and here's the order of events.

1704
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:35,827
There'll be hi and hello,
getting to know you cocktails,

1705
01:11:35,827 --> 01:11:40,335
with a few introductory
remarks about the Third Reich,

1706
01:11:40,335 --> 01:11:44,168
what happened to the
other two reich's and why

1707
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:48,668
this one will last, ever so much longer.

1708
01:11:49,928 --> 01:11:51,628
- Very good, my lord.

1709
01:11:51,628 --> 01:11:53,728
- Mr. Hudson, might I
have a word with you?

1710
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:55,028
- Yes, of course, Miss Emma.

1711
01:11:55,028 --> 01:11:56,688
- There is to be a Nazi party here?

1712
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:57,928
- Just a very small one.

1713
01:11:57,928 --> 01:11:59,468
- And why have you been avoiding me?

1714
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,668
- Because I am a Butler
and you are a housekeeper

1715
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:03,528
and in this country,
any contact is not only

1716
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,908
immoral but it is also illegal contrary to

1717
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:07,888
the naughty behaviors Act with servants

1718
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:08,748
1932.

1719
01:12:08,748 --> 01:12:09,856
- But surely--
- No.

1720
01:12:09,856 --> 01:12:10,922
- Not even if--
- No.

1721
01:12:10,922 --> 01:12:12,579
- But suppose we were to--
- No.

1722
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,687
- On our own time--
- Impossible.

1723
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:14,794
- At weekends--
- No.

1724
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:15,627
- In the garage--
- Out of the question.

1725
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,146
This is England, we must

1726
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:18,486
have no more emotions.

1727
01:12:18,486 --> 01:12:20,506
- But I have brought this hairbrush.

1728
01:12:24,062 --> 01:12:24,895
- Shit.

1729
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,457
Come here, woman.

1730
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,240
Get on my springy thing.

1731
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,380
Come on.

1732
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,420
- What on earth is going on, Emma?

1733
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,240
- Aunt Maggie, Whoopsie, Helena and Dick.

1734
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,800
- What on earth are they
doing, mommy, I'm scared.

1735
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,580
- Miss Emma was merely
helping me clean the

1736
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,120
floor with her posterior.

1737
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,120
- No, Henry, no more lies,
I'm a fully grown woman

1738
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,720
and I am entitled to an
emotion now and again.

1739
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,800
- Good heavens, this isn't America.

1740
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,900
- What on earth is going on, Butler?

1741
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,800
Who are all these people?

1742
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,100
- Lord Darling, this is
your long lost brother,

1743
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,933
Dick.

1744
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:00,766
- Hello, Bro.

1745
01:13:01,599 --> 01:13:04,510
Want to see my mouth organ?

1746
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,257
- Good heavens, it's the Nazi's.

1747
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,210
- Hello, Darling.

1748
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:15,043
- Countess Von Kunst,
welcome to Darling Hall.

1749
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:18,030
- It's important that
you English understand

1750
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:22,023
when Nazi's have a
party, it's a fun thing.

1751
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,568
Mein über Butler?

1752
01:13:23,568 --> 01:13:24,728
- Yes, Countess?

1753
01:13:24,728 --> 01:13:26,128
- Do you have a piano?

1754
01:13:26,128 --> 01:13:28,328
- No, Countess, no piano at Darling Hall.

1755
01:13:28,328 --> 01:13:30,348
- Then what Is that?

1756
01:13:30,348 --> 01:13:34,766
- Good heavens, that is a piano.

1757
01:13:34,766 --> 01:13:37,466
- Good grief, it is the piano.

1758
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:40,666
- It is Lord Darling's, a
gift from his dead daddy.

1759
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,074
- Deepak, is that you?

1760
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:46,241
- Hello, Mr. Hudson, long time no see.

1761
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:50,940
- What on earth are you doing here?

1762
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,380
- Well, I'm just talking
to you at the moment.

1763
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:57,100
- Yes, I can see that, but why?

1764
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,940
- Because they think it's funny, Sir.

1765
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,328
- It is a bit confusing.

1766
01:14:03,328 --> 01:14:04,411
- Yes, it is.

1767
01:14:09,057 --> 01:14:13,089
- I would like to play
a song about the fuhrer,

1768
01:14:13,089 --> 01:14:17,006
but first I should warm
up with the diva scale.

1769
01:14:19,595 --> 01:14:23,762
♫ Do Re Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi ♫

1770
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:34,322
♫ Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi ♫

1771
01:14:36,955 --> 01:14:40,075
What is that, what is
wrong with this piano,

1772
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,175
it is like England, it doesn't work.

1773
01:14:42,175 --> 01:14:44,402
There's something trapped inside it.

1774
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:53,251
- What is a vibrator doing inside a piano?

1775
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:56,391
- That's a rather long story.

1776
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:04,541
- Who are you?

1777
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,958
- A rather long story teller.

1778
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,550
- This is Inspector McGuffin.

1779
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:14,230
- Not in fact so, madam,
I'm a private dick,

1780
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,750
my real name is Holmes.

1781
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,870
- Good heavens, Sherlock Holmes?

1782
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:20,210
- No, Shylock Holmes, his Jewish cousin.

1783
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:26,108
- Why is there a dildo
shtook in this piano?

1784
01:15:26,108 --> 01:15:27,908
- It was hidden there madam by someone in

1785
01:15:27,908 --> 01:15:29,148
this room

1786
01:15:29,148 --> 01:15:30,308
- What does it matter?

1787
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:32,288
- It matters because it
reveals the identity of a

1788
01:15:32,288 --> 01:15:34,508
murderer, Butler, I arrest
you for the murder of

1789
01:15:34,508 --> 01:15:36,048
Henry Hudson.

1790
01:15:36,048 --> 01:15:38,368
- But this is Henry Hudson, Inspector.

1791
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,468
- No, Sir.

1792
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,988
- This man is called Hopkins, who killed

1793
01:15:40,988 --> 01:15:42,888
the original Hudson to gain control of

1794
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:43,988
the rubber market.

1795
01:15:43,988 --> 01:15:45,828
He attacked little Dicky in the woods and

1796
01:15:45,828 --> 01:15:47,828
poisoned his wife for
seeing him attack Dick

1797
01:15:47,828 --> 01:15:48,748
from a window.

1798
01:15:48,748 --> 01:15:50,668
And he bludgeoned poor Enid to death

1799
01:15:50,668 --> 01:15:53,008
when she planned to reveal
that she read his backside

1800
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:56,488
that he is the Houndsditch mutilator.

1801
01:15:56,488 --> 01:15:59,688
Butler, I arrest you for
the murder of Henry Hudson.

1802
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,668
- Oh, Henry, they will hang you.

1803
01:16:01,668 --> 01:16:03,751
- I'm already hung, Emma.

1804
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:06,886
- I know that.

1805
01:16:06,886 --> 01:16:08,386
I'm bearing your child.

1806
01:16:08,386 --> 01:16:10,346
- Then leave this sorry island, England is

1807
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,226
finished, the future is Holland.

1808
01:16:12,226 --> 01:16:13,186
- America?

1809
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:15,186
- Yeah, in America, yeah.

1810
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:16,846
Where they have more
respect for a person of

1811
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:18,526
violence and they won't
stop short of having

1812
01:16:18,526 --> 01:16:20,906
automatic weapons just
because they're insane.

1813
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:25,346
So the Butler was arrested
and sentenced to be

1814
01:16:25,346 --> 01:16:28,306
hanged by the neck until
he wasn't at all well.

1815
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:31,526
Leonard Bastard married
Helena and together they

1816
01:16:31,526 --> 01:16:33,526
opened an umbrella shop.

1817
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:36,246
Reverend Whoopsie became
the Arch Bishop of

1818
01:16:36,246 --> 01:16:37,946
Canterbury.

1819
01:16:37,946 --> 01:16:40,446
Aunt Maggie moved to Holland
where she demonstrates

1820
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:42,726
personal vibrators.

1821
01:16:42,726 --> 01:16:46,086
And as for me, the piano, I was bought by

1822
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:47,003
Elton John.

1823
01:16:48,798 --> 01:16:53,284
And I'm currently starring
in Las Vegas where I

1824
01:16:53,284 --> 01:16:56,867
made this, one of Elton
John's finest hits.

1825
