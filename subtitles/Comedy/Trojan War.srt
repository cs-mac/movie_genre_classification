00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:07,365
<i>Once in a lifetime, a girl comes along
who's the center of your universe.</i>

7
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,836
<i>A girl who's everything and everyone.</i>

<i>A girl who can rock your world.</i>

9

<i>Well, Brooke Kingsley is all that and more.</i>

10
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,920
<i>And ever since I first laid eyes on her--</i>

11

<i>not a second has gone by--</i>

<i># With my hands #</i>

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,596
Take me, Brad. Take me now.

22
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,465
Take me now.

23
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,501
Brad--

24
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,670
Brad?

25
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,805
Brad.

26
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,841
Brad?

27
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,542
Brad?

28
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,744
Brad?

29
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,745
Brad!

30
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:32,751
Mr. Kimble,
would you stand up, please?

31
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,252
Uh--

32
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,922
I don't, uh--

33
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,691
Stand?

34
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,326
<i>Uh-oh. He's got to time the wood.</i>

35
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,163
You know, um, to be honest, my leg's asleep.

36
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,699
Actually, they're both asleep.

37
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,306
I don't remember having excused anyone.

38
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,574
Aw-- Aw-- Aw--

39
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,143
<i>I hate when he does that.</i>

40
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,479
The end of the school year's but a week away.

41
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:07,719
And that means that some of you
will finally be graduating high school.

42
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:16,961
And in honor of this momentous occasion,

43
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:16,961
the board of health has asked me
to give you a little going-away gift,

44
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:23,467
in the high hopes that most of you will not
litter this planet with your seed.

45
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,803
Hey, turn around.

46
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,371
- Kyle.
- Huh?

47
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,807
Take two.

48
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,811
Oh, hey, uh, no, thank you,
'cause, um, I'm already wearing one.

49
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,079
Dr. Brookie's orders.

50
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,787
Class dismissed.

51
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,958
I can't believe you just said that, you creep.

52
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,992
Scum!

53
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,130
<i>- Get a little line going on.
- Sex fiend.</i>

54
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,566
<i>- Hey, let go my Eggo!
- I was joking.</i>

55
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,512
Yeah, right.

56
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,783
So you going to Kenny’s big party this weekend?

57
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,851
Yeah.

58
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,585
Hola, mamacitas.

59
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,455
Uh, ¿dónde está casa le pepe?

60
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:20,125
<i>- Oh, God. Them again?
- Losers.</i>

61
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,962
No, okay, look, this is how it works, right?

62
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:26,965
You got to give them a little romance, a little mystery.

63
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:31,102
Give some of the myth before you dive in on the fluff.

64
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,303
Two f's.

65
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,504
Brad, seriously, get a life.

66
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,506
No, I'm telling you, Leah, you're wrong.

67
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,009
I mean, Brooke and I are meant for each other.

68
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,911
Brad, she's a wench, okay?

69
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,847
Don't you want someone who'll appreciate you
as a whole dialectical being?

70
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,916
Yeah, or at least somebody who maybe digs you.

71
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,051
Same diff, dork. Semantics aren't important here.

72
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,154
Yeah, maybe not, but fate is.

73
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,321
- I don't know.
- Listen to this.

74
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,026
My last name's Kimble.
Hers is Kingsley. K- I, K-I.

75
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,528
I mean, we've been seated right next
to each other in school since we were eight.

76
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,265
Okay, okay, fine. Give me this one.

77
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,167
Brooke and I would look great in family photos.

78
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,702
How do you know that? You two
have never shared a Kodak moment.

79
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,871
See, that's where you're wrong. Check this out.

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,606
Right here. Check it out.

81
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,342
- See Brooke cheering right here?
- So?

82
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,413
There I am. Bleachers. Row twenty-three.
"I Love Gumby" t-shirt.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,948
I rest my case.

84
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,684
Dude, you're very creepy.

85
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,718
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

86
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:23,421
- Yeah?
- Aah! What are you doing?

87
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:28,827
Hello. As your best friend, I need to warn you
that you're dangerously close to
becoming an obsessive freak show.

88
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,429
Brad, you're crushing on a girlie-girl
who doesn't even know your name.

89
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:38,436
- Uh, Rod?
- It's Brad.
- Right.

90
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:43,975
- Brad, listen, school's over next week,
and I'm so not passing biology.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:48,346
- So, you're supposed to be like a full-on genius.
- Uh-huh.

92
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,048
Will you tutor me, Brent?

93
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:53,684
- It's Brad, you mindless--
- You know, I would be honored.

94
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:57,188
Really? Great, um, okay.

95
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,025
My house, eight o’clock, Friday night. Dress casual.

96
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:04,229
And bring a big pencil.

97
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,998
Okay, see you later.

98
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,335
Wow.

99
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,938
You definitely just had a
conversation with the Brooke Kingsley.

100
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,541
Yeah, man, you didn't even piss your pants.
Right on, Kimble.

101
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,344
You know she totally goes all the way, right?

102
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,811
How would you know?

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,482
She's got the hair color. Big factor.
Invisible pantyline.

104
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,117
Trust me. I know.

105
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,053
Is it just you three, or is your
entire gender completely mental?

106
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,055
No, it's pretty much all of us.

107
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,993
This is it, guys. Fate.

108
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,267
You know, Bradley, when I was your age,
it was all I could think about.

109
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:46,271
Now, the first time is always the most important.

110
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,639
So you need to remember three things.

111
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:54,612
Number one, always treat her with respect.

112
00:06:54,679 --> 00:07:01,819
Two, never push her faster than she wants to go.

113
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,422
And most importantly,

114
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,259
always make sure that she's well lubricated.

115
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,596
She drinks a lot of oil.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,334
She's my pride and joy, Bradley.

117
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:21,339
And tonight, you get to experience all of her majesty.

118
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,323
- Leah, how are you?
- Rockin', Mrs. K.

119
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,759
- Uh, Brad is, uh--
- In his cave? Yeah, I know. Have fun.

120
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:46,564
- Ben, I couldn't find my ear--
- Shh. You look gorgeous.

121
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:49,233
Are you sure we shouldn't take the Jag tonight?

122
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,270
Oh, let's let the kid have a little fun, huh?

123
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,806
Amazing. All this existential hell over a cheerleader bimbo?

124
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,676
Hey. Okay, here we go.

125
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:06,117
- Well?
- Yeah, it'll do.
- Okay. All right.

126
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,152
Wait a minute.

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,787
What?

128
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,356
Let me see your hand, Brad.

129
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,723
- What?
- Your hand.

130
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,292
- My hand?
- Yes.

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,659
Other one.

132
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:16,995
It's--

133
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,130
God, it's been four days since she scribbled that.

134
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,332
- Don't you bathe? I mean--
- Yeah, I bathe. Plenty.

135
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,668
What do you do, Ziploc your digits every time you shower?

136
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,541
- Wow.
- What? What?

137
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,043
Check this, Valentino, okay?

138
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,812
Look, we've been best friends since, like, sperm.

139
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,151
And every time you get hurt, I have to be--
nice to you for a good two weeks, and--

140
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,454
I hate that. So let me school you
on what's gonna happen tonight.

141
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,791
- Sit. Okay, I'll be Brooke.
- You, be Brooke? Right.

142
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,628
Yeah. It's really quite simple to do.
Just think bobbing-head doll.

143
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:51,729
Ready?

144
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,365
Hi. I'm Brooke.

145
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,068
I'm a vapid, vacant, vacuous girlie-girl.

146
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,536
Tee-hee. Hee hee hee.

147
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:01,039
Yeah. Impressive. Uh, I think--

148
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,941
Come in, Brett. I've decorated my desk
extra special for you tonight.

149
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,310
- She doesn't have a desk.
- What?

150
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,112
A girl like Brooke is not gonna have a desk.

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,314
I mean, it would clash with her whole bedroom motif.

152
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,651
I mean, she'd have a, uh, vanity over here.

153
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:17,755
A, uh, little ribbony pillow
just filled with her magic Brooke scent.

154
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,891
Yeah, whatever. Anyways, now you
come in, and I'm sitting on the bed.

155
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,293
- Lying.
- Excuse me?

156
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,395
Come on, you'd be lying on the bed. Here we go.

157
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,898
- Look, I'm Brook, not Miss July, okay?
- Okay.

158
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,211
This is your big move?

159
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,588
- Do you remember Crayola crayons?
- Huh?

160
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,423
They have this one color. Uh--

161
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,759
What was it called? It was, um--

162
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:59,063
Oh, yeah. Blizzard Blue.

163
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,101
That was my favorite color in the world.

164
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:07,371
Until tonight, I didn't know why.

165
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,741
That's the very color of your eyes.

166
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,078
My eyes?

167
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:20,418
Yeah. You know, I-- I schedule my entire
day just to get a glimpse of you.

168
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:29,760
It could be the worst day ever, but seeing you--
makes everything okay.

169
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,465
Does it?

170
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,168
Yeah, it does.

171
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:48,346
I don't know why. And I want to know--
know you more.

172
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:53,651
I want to know you today, tomorrow--
forever.

173
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,991
Huh? That was pretty good, huh?

174
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,860
It took me six months to memorize that.

175
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,496
Yeah, and it'll take me six months to forget.

176
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,498
What? You didn't like it.

177
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,167
Christ, I think I'm gonna gag.

178
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:14,038
It's-- Aw.

179
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:29,320
Well, here we go now.

180
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,358
<i># When we played tag in grade school #</i>

181
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,860
<i># You wanted to be it #</i>

182
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,697
<i># But chasin' boys was just a fad #</i>

183
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,999
<i># You crossed your heart, and you quit #</i>

184
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,501
Okay.

185
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,636
No sweat stains.

186
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,738
No sweat stains. Okay. I smell good.

187
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,774
<i># Now, just like back in grade school #</i>

188
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,543
<i># You're doing the same old thing #</i>

189
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,184
<i># Darling, take it slow #</i>

190
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,352
Hi, Brad.

191
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,287
It's Rod.

192
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,291
I mean, I have a rod. I mean, you're Brad.

193
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,926
Uh, uh, hi.

194
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,761
Wow. You look like--

195
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,032
Kyle.

196
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,967
Who's the toe jammer?

197
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,069
Brad is helping us study.

198
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,304
Study?

199
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,908
I told you, Kenny Ashton’s having a rager at
his parents' house tonight. Kegs, lots of kegs.

200
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:29,280
So let's forget the virgin, and let's jet! Come on.

201
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,282
Put me down, Kyle.

202
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:37,855
First of all, I am not so much a chattel.

203
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:40,891
Uh, chattel-- slave, livestock, or any moveable item--

204
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,426
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

205
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:44,128
I knew that.

206
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,364
And "b," my brain is important to me.

207
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,567
So you are leaving, and
Brad is gonna help me study.

208
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,635
Come in, Brad.

209
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,804
What are you doing?

210
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,841
She did not just do that.

211
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,380
Brooke! Brooke, open the door.

212
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:06,216
Brooke, this is retarded. I'm-- Big
Papa is not waiting outside all night.

213
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,587
Listen, you're really pissing me off.

214
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:17,060
Come on, Brooke. Stop kidding around.

215
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:20,431
Okay, so let me get this straight.

216
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:25,670
Pollination is the transfer of pollen
from the male reproductive organ stamen

217
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:30,174
to the female reproductive organ, the pistil?

218
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:36,980
- That's it, right?
- Huh? Uh, yeah. That's about it.

219
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:41,251
Wow. I never knew biology was so sensual.

220
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,658
It's, um, it's just like that, um--
that fly you were telling me about. The, uh--

221
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,892
The Tsetse fly?

222
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,796
Yeah. Tsetse fly.

223
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:58,068
I mean, it hatches, finds its mate,
and then dies within 24 hours.

224
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,572
It's so romantic.

225
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,243
All those steamy glances and taunting kisses.

226
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:10,614
Smooth sensation of skin against skin.

227
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:13,617
Incredible mind-bending sex.

228
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,156
Tsetse fly, man-- so intense.

229
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:21,692
Way intense.

230
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,330
Ahem. Brooke--

231
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,599
do you remember Crayola crayons?

232
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,937
Why? Is that gonna be on the test?

233
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,041
Hello.

234
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,377
<i>You finished playing student yet?</i>

235
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,712
No, Kyle. We're still studying.

236
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,314
<i>Screw that, and let's party! Whoo-hoo!</i>

237
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,553
Kyle, how many times do I have to tell you?
I need to study.

238
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,722
<i>Why bother? You've already got everything you need.</i>

239
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,026
<i>A hot bod and your old man's money, so what time--</i>

240
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,699
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

241
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,868
Please don't cry. No.

242
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,002
What do you-- tissue.

243
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:06,270
Tissue, tissue. Over here? Over here?

244
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:07,605
Over on the, the vanity. Right.

245
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:08,906
Tissue, tissue, tissue.

246
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,641
Ohh!

247
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,009
Ohh!

248
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,010
Tissue.

249
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,648
Thank you.

250
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,022
Are all guys jerks?

251
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,189
Uh-huh.

252
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,897
You're sweet. And you listen to me.

253
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,698
Shh. Not so loud.

254
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,767
You'll give me a bad rep.

255
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,773
What's so hard to get?

256
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,609
All a girl wants is a little romance.

257
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,479
To be swept off her feet.

258
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,949
I mean, is that so much to ask?

259
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:58,789
You know, I don't know about other guys,
but if we were together--

260
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:05,896
I would treat you like a queen, a Goddess.

261
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:16,774
Brad, I know this is gonna sound corny,
but, um, will you give me a hug?

262
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,514
That feels better.

263
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,585
Thanks.

264
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,086
Do you want to--

265
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,324
Oh, God, it feels good to hug you.

266
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,759
Epic.

267
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:08,225
Brad, breathe.

268
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,430
Oh, God.

269
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,333
You don't know how many times
I've dreamed of this exact moment.

270
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,601
How many times? Tell me.

271
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,503
As many times as there are stars in the sky.

272
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,005
Right answer.

273
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,072
Tell me more.

274
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,242
- You, me, together as one.
- More.

275
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,278
- Running my hands through your golden hair.
- More.

276
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,548
- Touching your velvet lips.
- More.

277
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,750
God.

278
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,020
Caressing my supple breasts?

279
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,259
<i># We played a show, and no one came #</i>

280
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:46,630
<i># We played and played it just the same #</i>

281
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,300
Um, Brad, do you have anything?

282
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,169
Not a thing. I'm perfectly healthy.

283
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,772
You know, to be honest, I don't
really get out all that much.

284
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,174
No. Um, no, that's not what I meant.

285
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,377
I mean, do you have, you know, protection?

286
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,746
Ohh.

287
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,482
Yeah. Just give me a couple of seconds.

288
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,388
I'll be right back, in five minutes? Tops.

289
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,291
Big dog.

290
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,401
Hey, mister, mister, wash your windows?

291
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,502
No, thank you.

292
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,503
Wash your windows, two dollars.

293
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:27,972
Thank you very much, though.

294
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,908
You can't pass up a bargain like that.

295
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,010
You smell like-- I know that smell.

296
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,779
That's a 1972 XKE

297
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,114
It is a '72.

298
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,917
Oh, that's the last best year for these babies.

299
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,653
I would absolutely say go ahead and wash the windows--

300
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,456
Oh. Okay. Uh--

301
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:49,526
Please, go right ahead,
but if you could just--

302
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,962
I'll get this baby shining like a brand-new dime.

303
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,065
<i># I saw this girl, and she drove me wild #</i>

304
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,267
<i># She looked at me, and I looked and smiled #</i>

305
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,603
Come on. Condoms.

306
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,371
Condoms? Condoms?

307
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,473
Where the hell are the condoms?

308
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,542
<i># I have a date #</i>

309
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,945
<i># Yeah! #</i>

310
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,813
Condoms, condoms, condoms.

311
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,949
Cones, Papa-Stopper, Jimmy Hats,

312
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,485
Doggy bags, oven mitt, crash helmet, condoms!

313
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:18,889
Oh, where are they? Where are they?

314
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,660
Holy Sweet Mary, Mother of God.

315
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,863
Trojans.

316
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,167
<i># I have a date #</i>

317
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,803
Yup. Reservoir-tipped is always a good selection.

318
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:37,007
Got to use ribbed, kid.

319
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,211
The chicks will appreciate it.

320
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,565
Good evening. How we doing?

321
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,266
Much better now. Thank you.

322
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,617
Uh, Leon, could I get a price check on
a twelve-pack of Trojan prophylactics?

323
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,353
What's a propho-pactic?
Can I have one, too?

324
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:24,354
No.

325
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,257
I need a propho-pactic!
I have to have a propho-pactic!

326
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:28,959
Get me a propho-pactic!

327
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,995
<i>Grace, is that jumbo or peewee?</i>

328
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,098
- No, it's just--
- You know, actually,

329
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,734
why don't I just give you a twenty?
Buy something nice for your kids.

330
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:37,868
I don't have any kids.

331
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,136
There's a shocker.

332
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,338
Go out and buy yourself a couple of mags, okay?

333
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:42,405
Thank you.

334
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,544
Okay, I left my wallet in the car.
I'll be back in, like, one second.

335
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,389
Hey, Mike, come back!

336
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:08,565
I am so screwed.

337
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,600
Ohh. I mean really.

338
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:14,972
I mean, how many people even really want
a silver classic 1972 Jaguar XKE?

339
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,007
The only reason I ask, you know,

340
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,309
<i>it's just, like, my life</i>

341
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,978
we're discussing here!

342
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,846
Don't get your hopes up.

343
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,482
We suspect that gangs are making their way into the area.

344
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,518
Car's probably sawed in half and
on its way to South America by now.

345
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:32,689
My advice-- go home. Go to your girlfriend's.

346
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:34,892
Just try not to think about it.

347
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:39,863
Home.

348
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,732
Go to my girlfriend's.

349
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,569
Brooke.

350
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:51,508
I'm so dead.
Brooke's gonna kill me.

351
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,410
At least I have Brooke.

352
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,180
Wait a second.

353
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,015
What am I gonna say to her?

354
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,017
Little bit late here. No, you don't have a car.

355
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:03,020
All right, uh, let's see. You were--

356
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:06,523
delivering toys, to orphans--

357
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,525
and, and you had to--

358
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:11,028
save them from a burning building.

359
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,963
Excellent sympathy factor.

360
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,898
Aw.

361
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,399
Oh-- oh, no.

362
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,601
Smudged.

363
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:22,873
All right, all right, all right.

364
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,974
This is bad. This is real bad.

365
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,144
Odds are it's probably a-- seven.

366
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,913
Brooke?

367
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,748
<i>Hello, and welcome to Movie Phone.</i>

368
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:32,983
<i>If you know the name of the mov--</i>

369
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,985
Uh--

370
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,987
All right, it's not a seven.

371
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,090
Then it would be a--

372
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:44,527
Hello?

373
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:46,830
<i>Ugh. I just scarfed down two burritos.</i>

374
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,665
Oh, hey, Trish. What's up?

375
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,234
Think I have a problem.

376
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,436
<i>We're sorry. Your call cannot be comple--</i>

377
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:56,506
How do you guys think Brad's doing with old Brookie?

378
00:22:56,574 --> 00:23:00,443
Well, if he's attempting the old sexual-predator,
Kyle-monster thing, he's sunk.

379
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:03,180
But if he's doing a Brad,
he'll be just fine.

380
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,348
"Doing a Brad"?

381
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,515
Yeah, a Brad.

382
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:09,019
You know, Brad's a stand-up guy.
You know, Brad's your bud.

383
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,520
Brad's, uh, you know--

384
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:11,855
Your best friend.

385
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,023
Exactly. Brad's your best friend.

386
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,025
See, chicks totally dig that.

387
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,293
That and good wood.

388
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,794
Hmm. You really think so?

389
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,129
Good wood is very important.

390
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:21,798
Hello.

391
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,133
<i>Leah, need your help.</i>

392
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,269
Brad? What? What's wrong?

393
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,904
<i>Well, okay, I'm in a bit of a jam here.</i>

394
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,471
<i>I need you to come pick me up now.</i>

395
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:29,973
Pick you up? Where are you?

396
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,275
<i>Downtown.</i>

397
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,543
Downtown? How in the hell did you get there?

398
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,545
Leah, I don't really have time to explain this now!

399
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,880
If you could just come and pick me up,

400
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,648
<i>I mean, is that such a big thing to ask?!</i>

401
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,483
Uh, pop a stress tab, why don't ya?

402
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,719
I'm begging, okay? I'm here on my knees.

403
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,721
I am actually physically groveling.

404
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,323
Can you hear this?

405
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,492
Please! Come pick me up.

406
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,727
Fine, I'm on my way.

407
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:51,728
Thank you.

408
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:54,398
Okay, um--

409
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,499
I'm gonna hop on a bus. I'll meet you halfway.

410
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,302
Like the corner of Fifth and Reseda.

411
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,003
Is that okay? Okay?!

412
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,038
Uh, yeah.

413
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,006
Yeah, I heard you. I'll be there.

414
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,010
Oh, come on, man. You made them too big.
I can't even see her face.

415
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,878
You just don't get it, do you?

416
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:15,018
Ahh. Ohh, God. What a night.

417
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,624
Uh-- Uh, God. You know what?

418
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,460
Actually, I don't have any money.

419
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,496
Um, see, no, no, no. I had my wallet--

420
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,167
Can I just tell you something?

421
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:36,606
- Every single day, you kids make me stop.
- This is the first time that I--

422
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:41,144
- Then you hop on, and you stiff
me out of the fare, huh?
- See, I've never actually been on a--

423
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:46,516
What's that sign read, huh?
"Exact change only"! Sixty-five cents, right?

424
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,987
Uh, yeah, um--

425
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,294
Sixty-five cents, right?

426
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:02,132
Not sixty-four. Not sixty-six.
Sixty-five cents!

427
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,501
Do you see a sign anywhere that says,

428
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:07,371
"Come on, bro, hop on board,
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go"?

429
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,707
Well, I don't think so!

430
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:12,775
Yiii!

431
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:16,179
"Exact change only," right?
"Exact change only. "

432
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:21,251
See, you Gen-X, mocha-sipping,
chain-smoking slackers need to learn to listen!

433
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,419
Whoa!

434
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:27,457
Ohh! My balls.

435
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,927
Need to learn there's no such thing in life as free rides!

436
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,963
You know, I don't know why I do this.

437
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,266
He can't just expect me to take care of things all the time.

438
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,967
And all for a girlie-girl!

439
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,968
Ugh! God.

440
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,969
Leah!

441
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,104
Hey! Hey!

442
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,473
Leah to the rescue to hump with Brooke.

443
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,474
Ugh.

444
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,475
Hey, Leah!

445
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,543
It's Brad!

446
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:52,982
So who's gonna be at Kenny Ashton’s?

447
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,352
<i>Kegs. Lots of them.</i>

448
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,221
Well, I'm supposed to be studying, but--

449
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,991
<i>I think he's playing hard to get.</i>

450
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,760
<i>I wanna get off now!</i>

451
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,065
<i>Aah!</i>

452
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:16,540
Whoa!

453
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,581
Oh.

454
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:31,088
Next time, maybe you'll remember!
No free rides!

455
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,506
Oh, no. Aw, shit.

456
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,508
This is not good.

457
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,610
This is not good.

458
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,980
Oh, this is so not good. This just isn't right.

459
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:57,981
Just not--

460
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,050
<i>Bitch!</i>

461
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,053
Oh, this is really not good.

462
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,055
No.

463
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,574
Hi.

464
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,145
Hola.

465
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:30,947
Wow. What a great place you guys, uh, have here.

466
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:35,185
Uh, I was actually wondering
if there's a pay phone around somewhere.

467
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,188
Pop in a peso, reach out and touch someone.

468
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,023
Whoops. You dropped something there.

469
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,628
Uh, pay phone somewhere nearby I could use?

470
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,465
Wait a second! Wait a second!

471
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,700
Actually, I know how to say this sentence in Spanish.

472
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:55,872
What-- you like that? What are the chances-- hi.
What are the chances?

473
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,641
Um, it was, uh, ¿adónde dinero?

474
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:04,013
No, no, no. I got it! I got it!

475
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,589
What's the matter?
Did I mispronounce it?

476
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:28,871
Hola, chulo. ¿Como está, mmm?
Me gusta ese hombre.

477
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:33,210
Está Rico-- Suave.

478
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,916
My sister says that you look like
that guy in Baywatch.

479
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,719
- ¿Como se llama? Es--
- David Hasselhoff.

480
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:43,953
That's her favorite show, man.

481
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:44,954
Yeah? Me, too.

482
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:46,789
Ibaila conmigo, chulo!

483
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:50,059
My little sister says that she wants
to dance with you the salsa contest.

484
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,964
Hey, that is flattering.
It is, but now's not a great time.

485
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,966
See, there's a girl that I really gotta get back to.

486
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:57,967
This is her, and--

487
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,736
Get out of here!

488
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:00,737
Whoo!

489
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:01,938

One hundred dollars.

You won, Señor Hasselhoff.

521
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:27,023
Bésame.

Okay. Okay. Okay, quick inventory.

524

You just won a dance contest,

you're completely lost,

Huh?

Hey, that's a Jag!

00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,215
Stop! Stop!

Whoa! Oof.

539
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,995
I think you guys have my dad's car.

540
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:46,035
No, it ain't, pinche gringo.

541
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,967
This is my ride, fool.

542
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:46,035
Puto.

543
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:51,574
Well, um, I don't know who Pluto is, but, uh--

544
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:59,482
Okay. Okay, maybe, um--
May-- maybe this will clear everything up.

545
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:05,988
See, before I got my license
my mom totally freaked out on me,

546
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:10,493
'cause, you know, her only child
was out driving on the "mean streets."

547
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:14,931
So before I could drive an inch--
and this is gonna sound totally cheesy, but--

548
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:20,437
she bought me one of those little troll key chains
with the-- the spiky, orange hair.

549
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:23,473
And I don't know what trolls have to do with good luck,

550
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:28,144
but, uh, you know, it's--
it's right here in the glove box.

551
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:30,513
If you just let me, um--

552
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:47,163
See?

553
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:54,504
- Hey, your mom got you one of those, too?
- Yeah.

554
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,841
Right, you and me, caro, we got a lot in common.
You know what I'm saying?

555
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,709
So let's kick it, homey.

556
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,480
Come on. Come chill with the Vatos.

557
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,460
So where do you guys go to school?

558
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,462
Toro Reformatory.

559
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,264
Bet they have a pretty good football team.

560
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:26,268
Ours kinda sucks
at Dewey Weber. Rah rah.

561
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:29,939
Dewey? Ah, man, I know that place.

562
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,008
We tagged it up a couple months ago.

563
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:35,044
Wait. Behind the gym? That was you guys?

564
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:37,480
That was some really excellent work.

565
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:43,452
Bold lettering. The choice of fluorescent colors.
It was so jejune.

566
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,955
Yeah, well, art runs in the family, homes.

567
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,958
It's my, uh, it's my passion.

568
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,995
It's a shame the janitor washed it off.

569
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,465
They what?

570
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:03,172
You-- your-- your graff-- your artwork.
It's-- it's gone.

571
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:15,852
Chicks, man. I don't get it.

572
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,423
Soon as you think you're giving it to them enough,
they tell you you're giving it to them too much.

573
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,826
Why can't they just be happy
you're giving it to them at all?

574
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:26,930
I don't know, Kyle. You're pretty
in touch with your feelings, man.

575
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,998
That's 'cause I'm sensitive, ass-wipe.

576
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,937
Well, you must be. I mean, you're letting
Brooke fin-slap that Urkel.

577
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:50,453
Huh? Hey, isn't that the--

578
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,955
Naw. No way.

579
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,556
Hmm.

580
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:11,975
Hey, Brad! What you think, homes?
Pretty dope, eh?

581
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,577
Bet you never peeped a honey this fine, homes.

582
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,414
You know, actually, there is this one girl
that-- that I kinda, you know--

583
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:19,916
Hey, hey.

584
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:25,688
I saved the final touch for you. Right here.

585
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,259
Go ahead, homes, pop her cherries on.

586
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:34,130
Oh-- I don't-- you know.
I don't think I could--

587
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:35,832
Come on, you sissy la-la.

588
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:46,142
Eh, don't worry, ese.
It's on the down-low.

589
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,436
<i>Don't be shy there, homes. Not mosquito bites.</i>

590
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:59,856
Silver dollars, homes. Silver dollars!

591
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,325
All right, ese.

592
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:05,862
You've got some real talent, you know?

593
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:09,431
Thank you. You guys aren't so bad yourselves.

594
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:12,035
Think you should've made these bigger, though.

595
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,906
Oh, wait. Dripping here.
I hate that. Drippy nipples.

596
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:25,815
Wait a sec. Guys!
Guys, that's my dad's car! Hey!

597
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,417
Guys, give me a ride!

598
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:36,325
Hey! We're chillin' on the down-low! Aw.

599
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,067
What did I do to deserve this?

600
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:47,937
I mean, all I wanted was one lousy condom! Just one!

601
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,939
Is that really that much to ask?

602
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:56,813
Just one lousy condom and five minutes!
Just five minutes with Brooke!

603
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,473
I take it all back.

604
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,545
Aah!

605
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,160
Aw, you're kidding.

606
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,940
Mmm.

607
00:37:58,008 --> 00:37:59,441
I, uh, ha.

608
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:03,079
I knew it. I knew they'd be back.

609
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,815
Goddamned taggers.

610
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,450
Oh, this is so great.

611
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:09,786

I make a mess out of you, fool!</i>

616

Scumbag!

617
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,108
I knew you filthy maggots would be back.

618
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:37,180
Only this time, I'm flushing you out.

619
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,381
Oh! Oh, ho!

620
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,488
<i>Aah!</i>

621
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,759
Aah ha ha!

622
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,894
Whoa!

623
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,435
What the hell was that?

624
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:04,006
<i>Stinky asshole! Come here, you fool!</i>

625

Ahh.

626
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:15,251
Maggot!

627
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,119
Oh.

628
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:30,032
Maggots think you can destroy taxpayer's
property? Well, think again, pal!

629
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,200
I just wanna get laid.

630
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,269
Hyah!

631
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:40,910
Shouldn't have messed with Mr. Clean, maggot!

632
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,411
Hyah!

633
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,747
Aah! Aah!

634
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:50,920
Nowhere. I just could not get anywhere.

635
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,324
Ah-choo!

636
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,926
Ah-choo!

637
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:57,927
Oh.

What happened to you? Where have you been?

659
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,994
Oh, I've been just about everywhere.

660
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,998
Oh, it's so good to see you.

00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,508
- Have you been eating Mexican?
- Now!

664
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:24,180
<i>- Imi amor!
- Mr. Hasselhoff! Hey!</i>

665
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,751
Brad, where's your dad's car?

666
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,955
You know, Leah, at some point in the future
we can have this discussion.

667
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,459
But now is really not the time, so if you could
please just get me back to Brooke's.

668
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:38,627
Fine. Whatever.

669
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,467
So I guess you guys will probably be studying,

670
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:46,969
you know, too late to be going to Kenny Ashton’s party.

671
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,638
Yeah, gonna be studying real late.

672
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,976
Well, I-- I was thinking about going.

673
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,812
Really? That's great!

674
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,481
You know, you should get out.

675
00:41:58,548 --> 00:42:01,317
Uh, don't be a sissy la-la, you know?

676
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,485
Yeah.

677
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:08,991
Yeah, well-- kinda thought, um,
maybe we could go together.

678
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,661
Oh. Leah, I can't go anywhere.

679
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:16,165
I mean, I'm this close to finding true love.

680
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:25,441
You guys got it on? I can't believe it.

681
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,443
Why? Why can't you believe it?

682
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,578
You can't believe that, what, maybe she found me attractive?

683
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,847
- No.
- What can't you believe?

684
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:34,150
Just how could you? How cou--

685
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,951
You just don't get it, do you?

686
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,953
You know what? I don't get it.

687
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,955
I don't get how my usually intelligent best friend

688
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,957
could actually think he's in love

689
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:43,759
with a caricature of every shallow male fantasy--

690
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:46,828
Whatever. Just drive me there.

691
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,314
Hey, uh, thanks, Leah.

692
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,051
Listen, about what I said back there,
I really-- I-- I really want--

693

695
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:16,092

00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,163
Aah! Oh!

806
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:07,275
Hey!

807
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:09,511
You still owe me two dollars.

808
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,215
<i>Oh! That sucks. No.</i>

809
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:17,319
Maybe it's some sort of--
hormonal imbalance.

810
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:19,187
Maybe she's possessed.

811
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,659
Know what I think it is?

812
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:27,162
I think we are witnessing the dreaded PMS beast.

813
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,163
Whoa.

814
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,932
Yeah.

815
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:31,333
So?

816
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,170
Well, how's it look?

817
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,674
Dude, you have breasts.

818
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,409
Ohh! Your stupid male observations do not apply to me!

819
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,446
- Okay. Leah, let him live.
- Don't touch me!

820
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,684
I'm sorry. It's just that we're not used to
seeing you with, uh-- that way.

821
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:51,019
- What way?!
- Well, in girlie clothes.

822
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:54,690
You say the word "girlie" one more time,
I will not hesitate to kick your ass!

823
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:56,692
You sissy la-las are coming to
Kenny Ashton’s party with me.

824
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:59,928
Uh-uh. No way.
Josh here is still in training.

825
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:03,465
He's not yet had the full benefit
of my expert tutelage and guidance.

826
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,201
- He--
- Don't say it.

827
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:11,137
You think I could just have my old clothes back?
Brooke's not really into vinyl.

828
00:50:11,204 --> 00:50:12,639
Uh, who's Brooke?

829
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:15,374
Only the greatest girl ever to walk the face of the earth.

830
00:50:15,443 --> 00:50:16,876
Oh, one of those?

831
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:20,313
No, not one of those. Brooke's--
she's different, you know?

832
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,784
She's the girl of my dreams.

833
00:50:24,852 --> 00:50:27,286
Oh, dreams. Dreams and love.

834
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:28,721
Dreams and love.

835
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:30,222
Funny thing about dreams.

836
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,560
When you're dreaming,
your eyes are closed.

837
00:50:33,627 --> 00:50:36,963
So close your eyes. Dream.

838
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:46,506
Ow! You dick!

839
00:50:46,574 --> 00:50:48,341
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

840
00:50:48,408 --> 00:50:51,210
You gotta look at this world
with eyes wide open.

841
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:53,913
Wide open.

842
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:58,117
Now, the advice was free, but the clothes--
the clothes are gonna cost you.

843
00:50:58,185 --> 00:51:02,421
Now, that's sixty-five,
eighty-five for the shirt and the jacket.

844
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,991
It's eight and a half percent street tax.

845
00:51:05,058 --> 00:51:06,626
Now, that's ninety-nine eighteen.

846
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:09,963
- Ninety-nine dollars for this?
- I'll take it back.

847
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,931
No, no, no. You don't have to take it back.

848
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,933
Hang on. Hang on one second.

849
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:23,209
Huh? I was dancing in a salsa con-- I--
It's not important.

850
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:27,446
Now you got a transaction.

851
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,655
You! I thought I told you no free rides!

852
00:51:35,723 --> 00:51:37,356
Wait, wait, wait. I got the money.

853
00:51:37,424 --> 00:51:40,092
Hey! Hey!

854
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,664
Let me in, psychopath! Let me in!

855
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:47,166
No! No free rides! I told you! No!

856
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:48,200
Walk places!

857
00:51:48,268 --> 00:51:50,803
- Open the door!
- No!

858
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:52,038
Huh?

859
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,409
Stop the bus!

860
00:51:57,411 --> 00:51:58,344
You scumbag.

861
00:51:58,412 --> 00:52:01,814
You almost got me killed
for sixty-five lousy cents!

862
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:06,419
Hey, looky here, pal!
I got your sixty-five cents.

863
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:08,855
I don't want your stinking free ride, buddy!

864
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:12,425
Believe me, Mr. Man,
I had to work my slacker butt

865
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:14,360
a damn-sight harder to earn this money

866
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:16,362
than just sit behind a steering wheel

867
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,330
on my lazy,

868
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:19,432
psychotic

869
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:21,034
ass!

870
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:31,778
Oh. That's all I wanted.
Please take a seat.

871
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:10,917
Hey, thank you for conserving fuel
and riding public transportation.

872
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:11,985
Enjoy your evening.

873
00:53:22,062 --> 00:53:23,329
Okay.

874
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:24,330
Nothing's changed.

875
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,832
Brooke still wants you.

876
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,834
I mean, uh, all I really need is--

877
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,740
Ohh.

878
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:50,422
Hey.

879
00:53:51,558 --> 00:53:52,959
Four seventy-five.

880
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:56,929
Uh, gosh, you know what?
I'm, uh, a little short.

881
00:53:57,998 --> 00:54:01,367
No! I mean, I don't have any money.

882
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:08,875
Okay, um-- If you could just try
to put yourself in my situation.

883
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:11,377
Just-- just for a second, please.

884
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:13,813
Haven't you ever been in love?

885
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:16,315
I mean-- I mean, so in love

886
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:18,818
that-- that just the thought of being with that someone

887
00:54:18,886 --> 00:54:20,787
was enough to get you through the day.

888
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:23,322
Mmm.

889
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:35,267
Then what if those--  those stupid, stupid things--
could make all of your hopes and dreams come true?

890
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:40,339
Come on. Haven't you ever dreamed?

891
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:48,347
Four seventy-five.

892
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,591
Say, do you remember Crayola crayons?

893
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,694
All right, nobody move!

894
00:55:03,463 --> 00:55:05,297
Brad, is that you?

895
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:09,468
Yo, homeys! Hey, check it out.

896
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:11,070
What's up, Brad?

897
00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:12,304
Brad, man. Hey.

898
00:55:12,372 --> 00:55:14,240
Scoring some jimmies, or what, homes?

899
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:17,309
Trying. I'm really trying.

900
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,311
But frankly, she's not helping.

901
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:21,380
Hey, give me the jimmies with the money.

902
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:24,050
- They're four seventy-five.
- I got three fifty-seven.

903
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:26,485
It's on us, homey.

904
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:29,188
<i>All right, Vatos--</i>

905
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:30,757
Aw, man!

906
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:32,358
The pigs, homes!

907
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:33,860
There's a shocker.

908
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:36,328
You're surrounded. Come out with your hands up.

909
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:38,231
Make it easy on yourselves.

910
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:40,066
<i>I have your ass, you scum.</i>

911
00:55:42,236 --> 00:55:48,074
You know, Brad, don't take this the wrong way,
'cause you and me, we're solid, homes.

912
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:50,743
But I gotta take you hostage.

913
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:57,850
- Brad.
- Yeah?

914
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:00,419
I never really did this before, you know?

915
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,856
You think you could help out?

916
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:09,962
Yeah. I mean, um--
I'll see what I can do.

917
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,132
Please don't shoot! Please!

918
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,302
They're lunatics, every last one of them!

919
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:18,771
Your firearms are useless against them!

920
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,640
Please! I just wanna live!

921
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,742
Hold your fire!

922
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:24,944
<i>Aw. Damn.</i>

923
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:26,813
Hey, that's pretty good, homes.

924
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,815
Thanks. Drama club, sophomore year.

925
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,917
Tell my mom I love her.

926
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:37,389
<i>We interrupt this program
with a special news bulletin.</i>

927
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:39,692
Ben, come in here.

928
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:41,360
<i>--Suspected gang members</i>

929
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:44,063

930

<i>God, that's terrible.</i>

God, we are so lucky to be so far away from all this.

933
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:55,541
Goddamn kids.

934
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:03,816
Here you go, Brad. Your jimmies, homes.

935
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:06,252
Oh, yeah, thanks, man.

936
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:14,793
Yo, Brad, you know, I was wondering.

937
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:14,793
You think maybe if me and the boys
could hang with you at your party, you know.

938
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:16,528
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:18,697
The party. Good idea, good idea. Let's go there.

940
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:21,100
Just please get me back to Brooke, okay?

941
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:26,005
- Mi casa es su casa. Just get there.
- Right on, Brad.

942
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:55,968
Look, I know you're waiting for Brad,
so I'm only going to say this once.

943
00:57:56,036 --> 00:58:00,639
Brad is not just a good guy.
He's a great guy.

944
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:04,176
He's smart, and he's funny.

945
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:06,913
He's my best friend in the whole world.

946
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:13,419
And for some stupid reason
he's head-over-feet for you.

947
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:15,721
I don't get it, but--

948
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:18,724
he's my friend, and you're the one that he wants.

949
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:21,760
So treat him right, okay?

950
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:24,030
Mm-hmm.

951
00:58:25,565 --> 00:58:28,500
Because if you don't, I'll ox-ecute you, your friends,

952
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:31,804
and your fashion accessories, you tacky bourgeois bitch!

953
00:58:34,408 --> 00:58:35,674
Charming.

954
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:41,613
Hey, I'm vacating this ritualized, adolescent
display of hedonistic amorality.

955
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:43,782
- Huh?
- What?

956
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,252
I'm leaving. You guys staying or going?

957
00:58:49,256 --> 00:58:50,489
- Stayin'.
- Stayin'.

958
00:58:50,557 --> 00:58:51,557
Yeah.

959
00:58:54,894 --> 00:58:56,395
Okay, okay.

960
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:59,365
Here's how it is. You go for girl, twelve o'clock.

961
00:58:59,433 --> 00:59:01,434
- You're gonna get her.
- Yes.

962
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:05,604
- Trust me.
- Yeah.

963
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:11,110
So--

964
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,112
When does your centerfold come out?

965
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,180
Creep.

966
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:27,826
Brooke, come here.

967
00:59:27,894 --> 00:59:29,561
Oh, joy. The future wife-beater.

968
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:33,466
No, listen. Are you banging the study hall turd?

969
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:36,135
Kyle, what are you talking about?

970
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:37,836
You and the little--

971
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:40,839
That's Brooke! Brooke!

972
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,008
Brooke!

973
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:44,477
Brooke! It's Brad!

974
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:50,416
Hey! Aah! She's talking to Kyle.

975
00:59:50,484 --> 00:59:51,984
<i>Seven-Mary-Three,</i>

976
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:55,921
<i>suspects are currently headed
northbound on green hill drive,</i>

977
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,991
<i>approximately three hundred yards from your position.</i>

978
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:01,793
<i>We do have a beam.
Holding for a green light.</i>

979
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:03,929
Take 'em.

980
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,935
Aah! Aah! Aah!

981
01:00:17,677 --> 01:00:22,614
Aah! Aah! Aah!

982
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:30,822
<i>Yo, Brad. You got insurance?</i>

983
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,828
<i>There is this girl.</i>

984
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:41,733
This is a girl who's everything and everyone.

985
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:46,705
This is a girl who can just rock your world.

986
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:49,542
Man, this girl--

987
01:00:51,078 --> 01:00:52,978
I look like David Hasselhoff.

988
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:55,747
And I'm doing this crazy lambada song.

989
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:57,683
Janitor man!

990
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,152
One night-- Hit me dead center in the chest.

991
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,154
One night-- Knocks me--

992
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:03,889
Scary, scary.

993
01:01:03,957 --> 01:01:05,424
This guy has got the I.Q. of a cheeseburger.

994
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:09,328
That's before you guys decide to use it for target practice.

995
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:12,764
That's all I wanted. I wanted one night,
with my one true love.

996
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:15,734
I didn't know I'd almost have to die for it!

997
01:01:24,677 --> 01:01:26,112
Love sucks!

998
01:01:27,147 --> 01:01:28,647
It's a four-letter word.

999
01:01:28,715 --> 01:01:33,586
It's some bullshit, capitalist conspiracy
made up by greedy florists.

1000
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:42,528
You know what "love" backwards is?

1001
01:01:42,596 --> 01:01:45,097
It's e-v-o-l.

1002
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:47,733
Evil! Pure evil!

1003
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,569
Granted, it's spelled differently, but it's the same thing.

1004
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:09,588
Well, you're either telling the truth,

1005
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:09,588
or you ought to be locked up
for telling the biggest goddamn lie ever.

1006
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:15,528
Number one-- clean up, change,
'cause vice will just drag your ass back in here.

1007
01:02:15,595 --> 01:02:17,630
Number two-- your belongings.

1008
01:02:18,765 --> 01:02:20,266
And what's left of your daddy's car.

1009
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,539
- Is that it?
- No, it isn't.

1010
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:28,807
Let me tell you something, son.

1011
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,576
Love is hard to find.

1012
01:02:30,644 --> 01:02:34,547
True love is even harder, damn near impossible.

1013
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:42,421
It took me twenty-two years, one thousand,
four-hundred and ninety-two blind dates from hell.

1014
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:47,626
So you ask yourself, haven't you
come too far just to give up?

1015
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,533
Yes.

1016
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:58,770
I'm still not one damn step closer to getting what I need.

1017
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:07,246
You get one phone call, son,
then you get out of here.

1018
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:13,519
Hey, kid.

1019
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:27,933
Make her day.

1020
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:43,616
<i># I believe in #</i>

1021
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:46,518
<i># I believe in love #</i>

1022
01:03:46,586 --> 01:03:48,186
<i># I believe in #</i>

1023
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:52,625
You look great.
Is that a new outfit or something?

1024
01:03:52,692 --> 01:03:54,893
You all dressed up for the party?

1025
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,762
I don't need to impress high school boys.

1026
01:03:56,829 --> 01:04:00,299
Then again, maybe I should.
Maybe you'd take heed.

1027
01:04:01,668 --> 01:04:05,070
Take heed? Of what?

1028
01:04:05,138 --> 01:04:06,305
You know, I swear to God, Leah.

1029
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:08,540
Sometimes I think you and I know each other

1030
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:11,843
better than any other two people
on the face of the earth.

1031
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:13,879
This is us, you know?

1032
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:18,384
And other times, I just don't understand
what the hell you're saying.

1033
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,186
There's nothing to understand.

1034
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:31,062
Has anybody seen my jacket?

1035
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,832
<i>Look, I don't get it. Are you listening to me?</i>

1036
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:39,104
You kick me out for dweeb boy? Why?

1037
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:42,174
Do you hear someone talking?
I could swear I hear someone talking.

1038
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:43,642
You are banging him, aren't you?

1039
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,211
I knew it. I knew it.

1040
01:04:47,213 --> 01:04:49,948
Oh, Kyle. I wouldn't worry.

1041
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:53,485
All you're going to need to get by
in this life are your muscles

1042
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:56,988
and your teeny-weeny,

1043
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:58,890
little--

1044
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,492
brain.

1045
01:05:01,795 --> 01:05:04,896
I'm going to kill that little rat turd.

1046
01:05:04,964 --> 01:05:07,966
I'm going to kill him big-time!

1047
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:11,503
<i># He can't get a cab #</i>

1048

1049
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,906
Oh. Ooh, baby.

1050
01:05:14,974 --> 01:05:16,775
Yeah.

1051
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:18,811
Ha ha. All right?

1052
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:21,913
All right. Let's go get her.

1053
01:05:21,981 --> 01:05:24,182
I don't-- I don't want to.

1054
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,652
Oh. Trust me. I know.

1055
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Let's go. Come on.

1056
01:05:27,787 --> 01:05:30,422
<i># Uh-oh, we're in trouble #</i>

1057
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,490
All right.

1058
01:05:32,692 --> 01:05:34,092
So, uh--

1059
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:37,295
That's a lovely dress you have on.

1060
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:39,565
Yeah, it matches perfectly with my bedspread.

1061
01:05:44,537 --> 01:05:48,006
- Ow.
- Ow.

1062
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,477
She must be color blind.

1063
01:05:59,118 --> 01:06:01,152
Are you sure you don't want to
just come in for a sec?

1064
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,255
No, thanks. Not my scene.

1065
01:06:06,158 --> 01:06:09,828
- Hey, Leah, thanks. No, really, for everything.
- Yeah.

1066
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:17,002
Okay.

1067
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,344
- Hey, B?
- Yeah?

1068
01:06:28,815 --> 01:06:34,920
When you kissed her-- I just want to know.
What was it like?

1069
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:38,990
Was it everything you dreamed of?

1070
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:42,528
Close enough.

1071
01:06:42,595 --> 01:06:45,330
- Brad?
- Yeah.

1072
01:06:45,398 --> 01:06:50,669
Look, I don't really know the best way to
say this, so I'm just going to say it.

1073
01:06:51,905 --> 01:06:53,004
I--

1074
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:58,677
hope you get everything you want.

1075
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,514
I hope she makes you really happy.

Ah. I know Latin women.

Good.

- Sí, way.
- Me, too.

Hey. Hey, and you, you know,
she's right. You do look like Chandler.

Take me, Brett.

01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:39,564
Wait. What?

1128
01:10:39,632 --> 01:10:40,565
Take me.

1129
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:44,602
No, that part was good,
but you called me Brett.

1130
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:48,106
My name's Brad.

1131
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:52,544
Not important. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

No.

1133

No, no, wait. No.

1134
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,991
Do you want to tell everybody
we're, you know, together?

1135
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:11,262
But I'm going out with Kyle.

1136
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,831
Kyle?

1137
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:15,500
Well--

1138
01:11:15,568 --> 01:11:21,306
What about-- you and I--
What is this?

1139
01:11:21,373 --> 01:11:24,275
Oh. This.

1140
01:11:24,343 --> 01:11:29,247
You see, this is your lucky night.

1141
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,430
What?

1142
01:11:49,401 --> 01:11:54,005
- You don't know me.
- So? It's just sex.

1143
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:55,140
It's not just sex.

1144
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:59,577
I mean, what about the steamy glances,
the taunting kisses?

1145
01:11:59,645 --> 01:12:02,881
Hello. I was talking about a fly.

1146
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:16,228
You know, when I finally do this,
I want it to be absolutely perfect.

1147
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:22,567
I want it to be with someone who knows me.

1148
01:12:22,635 --> 01:12:24,736
Somebody who's, like, your best
friend in the world, you know?

1149
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:25,871
Somebody like--

She just b-bailed.

Not now, Kyle.

1171
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:29,667
No. See, first, you're up in the bedroom.

01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:30,902
Oh, yeah.

1173
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,939
And then, you're scoring jimmies at the A&P.

1174
01:13:34,006 --> 01:13:36,208
- Now--
- You guys are such jerks.

1175
01:13:37,844 --> 01:13:38,844
Pssh.

<i>Oh!</i>

1177
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:49,821
I'm going to kick your ass all over this party.

Good doggy.

1181
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:18,750
Leah! Leah! Wait!

1182
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:19,918
Finished with Brooke already?

1183
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:21,219
Oh, come on, Leah, please--

1184
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:24,389
No, sorry, stud, but if you're looking for help

1185
01:14:22,788 --> 01:14:24,389
in the self-control department,
I can't help you there.

1186
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:26,457
Leah, Leah, nothing happened.

1187
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:32,797
I couldn't.

1188
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:40,171
I mean, you know, I could have.
She was right there on the counter.

1189
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,907
Leah, Leah, please. I know you're upset.

1190
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:43,875
No, I am not upset, Brad.

1191
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,610
I'm tired.

1192
01:14:45,677 --> 01:14:48,713
I'm tired of listening to your childish fantasies.

1193
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:52,850
So please save your fate and Crayola crap for someone else.

1194
01:14:52,919 --> 01:14:55,887
Because all you're looking for is heartache and pain.

1195
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:57,455
Trust me, I know.

1196
01:14:57,523 --> 01:14:58,456
Leah, Leah.

1197
01:14:58,524 --> 01:15:00,158
Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

1198
01:15:00,226 --> 01:15:03,228
Please, please. Just listen to me.

1199
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:07,232
I have been looking for something all night long.

1200
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:14,705
And it has caused me nothing but heartache and pain.

1201
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:20,412
But that's only because I was looking for the wrong thing.

1202
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:28,853
You see, I realized that this whole time,

1203
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:34,592
I should've been looking right in front of me.

1204
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:37,528
What?

1205
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:44,669
I should've been looking for you.

1206
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:46,938
What?

1207
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:51,609
Listen. Even I don't know the
best way to say this.

1208
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:58,950
- So I'm just going to say it. Okay?
- Okay.

1209
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,185
Was it everything you dreamed of?

1210
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,621
