1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,820
So, here's the deal.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,740
We are in the garden, right?

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,580
And everything is great.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,900
And there's this tree.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,540
And the man says,
"Ooh, see that tree?

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,460
"Don't eat the fruit
of that tree.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,700
"That apple you do not eat."

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,620
He goes inside,
names some animals...

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,140
maybe takes a dump.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,500
Anyway, what does she do?

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,020
She eats the apple!

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,740
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,620
He says, "Don't eat it!"
She eats it!

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,300
Unbelievable!

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,420
Since then, men, women...
I don't know.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,780
It's all going wrong!

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,460
So inviting

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,580
So exciting

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,060
Whenever you're near

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,220
I hear a symphony

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,940
A tender melody

22
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,340
Pulling me closer

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,860
Closer to your arms

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,140
Then suddenly

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,820
Your lips are touching mine

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,020
A feeling so divine

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,820
Till I leave the past behind

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm lost in a world

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,500
Of make-believe

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,060
Whenever you're near

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,580
I hear a symphony...

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,300
Divorce.

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,020
Miserable marriage.

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,860
Wedding canceled.

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,340
Remarried.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,460
Divorced again.

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,580
Ahh!

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,380
Irreconcilable
sexual disharmony!

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,700
Dysfunctional marriage!

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,820
Divorce! Divorce!

41
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,900
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,420
Well?

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,620
Talk to me.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,140
We had a bad run.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,380
Things have changed down there.

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,460
Men and women
aren't like they used to be.

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,540
Well, things are
changing up here as well.

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,860
I'm getting pressure
from above...

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,980
if you know what I mean,
for results!

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,060
For men and women to be bonded
in eternal bliss.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,100
In the meantime, I've been
instructed to introduce...

52
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,500
new incentive schemes
for our leading operatives.

53
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,980
Leading operatives, huh?

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,100
That's you.

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,140
Skip the flattery,
Gabriel. Where's the beef?

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,540
It's a hard case to crack.

57
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
I have full confidence
you can do it.

58
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,900
If you don't...

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,140
you don't come back.

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,060
What?

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,460
No way.

62
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,660
That's the new incentive scheme.

63
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,700
Your mission
is to unite man and woman...

64
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,180
blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,780
When you're done...

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,140
you come back.

67
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,620
If youfail...

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,620
you stay down there forever.

69
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,540
You are not serious.

70
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,860
Liberatum mani.

71
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,060
It's out of my hands.

72
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,860
No ordinary sin

73
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,420
This perfect working order

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I'd rather sink than swim

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,900
If I can't walk on water

76
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,100
Let the scandal in

77
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,380
This perfect world disorder

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,100
I'd rather drown than swim

79
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,820
I can't walk on water

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,420
This taste of dilution

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,260
Velvet divorce

82
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,140
I get bored

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,620
Velvet divorce

84
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,020
I get bored

85
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,180
Velvet divorce

86
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,620
Velvet divorce

87
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,380
I get bored

88
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,540
She's the secret daughter...

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,420
of Marilyn Monroe
and John F. Kennedy, right?

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,700
I mean, that's why Marilyn
was murdered.

91
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,580
So, the young girl
grows up in an orphanage...

92
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,820
unaware of
her incredible parentage.

93
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,100
Years go by.

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,300
She's beautiful.

95
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,860
She's smart.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,540
She's successful, OK?

97
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,540
Then what?

98
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,940
Well, then...

99
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,940
Then she gets sent to London
as U.S. ambassador.

100
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,860
Where she discovers
who she is...

101
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,780
and also unravels
the secret of the Nazi gold...

102
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,020
hidden underneath the embassy.

103
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Uh, yeah.

104
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,260
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

105
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Of course it's obvious, guys.
It's a trash novel.

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,340
You buy it in the airport,
you take it on holiday.

107
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,340
Oh, Ms. Gesteten.

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,820
Nice to see you down here.

109
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,860
I'd love to stay and talk,
but, um, you know how things...

110
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,580
Nice trick, Celine.

111
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,220
- Want to try your luck?
- With the gun?

112
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,580
With the fruit.

113
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,900
I don't have time for games.

114
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,820
If you're afraid,
why don't you just say so?

115
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Celine, last night,
we discussed a certain proposal.

116
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,500
And I said no,
because you cheat, Elliot.

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,660
OK.

118
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,460
So I'm flirtatious.

119
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,700
It's in my nature.

120
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,500
But I want you to think again.

121
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,500
Do you know how difficult
it is for a woman to find...

122
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,460
a good husband in this town?

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,420
Let alone a good dentist.

124
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,420
Celine...

125
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm serious.

126
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,820
Robots?

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,980
You're telling us we're gonna be
replaced by robots?

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,260
That robots will get down on
their robot hands and knees...

129
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,060
and clean the dust out of
every office in this building?

130
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,780
I think not, Ms. Gesteten.

131
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,380
At least the robot won't spend
its time writing a trash novel.

132
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,060
Not even a very good
trash novel, as I understand it.

133
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,100
Oh, I see. This is personal.

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,300
This has nothing to do with me,
Robert.

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,060
This comes right from the top...
from Mr. Naville himself.

136
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,060
Perhaps it's time
I spoke to this Mr. Naville guy.

137
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,340
It's too late.

138
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,980
You're fired.

139
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
You ready?

140
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,420
Mm-hmm.

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,820
Now, if you move...

142
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,660
the offer's canceled.

143
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,940
OK.

144
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,620
Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
- Wait, Celine...
- Don't speak.

146
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,940
Do you think this is wise?

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,260
Puts me off.

148
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,180
Ha.

149
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,980
Ha.

150
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,740
Stop!

151
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,980
Aah! Aah! Aah!

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,100
Mayhew...

153
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,620
Would you call a doctor?

154
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,380
It would be a pleasure, madam.

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,540
What are you doing here
this time of day?

156
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,660
Hi, Lily.

157
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,580
Well? Answer me.

158
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,140
Lily, I... I got fired.

159
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,940
They replaced me with a robot.

160
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,300
I know how they feel.

161
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,500
Hmm?

162
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,420
Look, I've been meaning
to tell you this...

163
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,940
for a while now, and...

164
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,460
seems like a good a time as any.

165
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,780
Robert...

166
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm leaving you.

167
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,460
You're leaving?
What are you talking about?

168
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,820
His name is Ryan.
He teaches aerobics.

169
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,100
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.

170
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,980
How can you do this?
At a time like this!

171
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,660
I want a man, not a dreamer.

172
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,900
I don't know what to say.
We could talk about this.

173
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,860
I'll get another job.
We'll sort everything out.

174
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,380
Sorry...

175
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,180
but as of tonight...

176
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,860
you're going home alone.

177
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,380
Uh...

178
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,900
Lily!

179
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,740
I'm leaving you.

180
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,580
You're fired.

181
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,500
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

182
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,220
He teaches aerobics.

183
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,580
We're in love.

184
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,420
We're moving to Miami.

185
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,100
Oh.

186
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,420
Lily?

187
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,540
Lily?

188
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,540
Mr. Robert Lewis?

189
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,020
Yeah, that's me.

190
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,300
My name is Jackson.

191
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,220
This is my associate
Ms. O'Reilly.

192
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,220
We're from the Firm But Fair
Eviction & Collection Agency.

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,860
I have a list of certain items
we're empowered to collect...

194
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,580
under federal and state law...

195
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,980
in lieu of unpaid debts.

196
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,660
Furthermore, we are contracted
to serve upon you...

197
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,180
notice of eviction from these
here premises, uh, forthwith.

198
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,740
I beg your pardon?

199
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,300
We can do this
with violence or without.

200
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,580
It's up to you.

201
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,340
The client pays our
medical bills, but not yours.

202
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,460
Well?

203
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,980
Oh, without, please.

204
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,540
Good choice.

205
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,820
OK, let's go.

206
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100
All right.

207
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,540
Cannot believe this.

208
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,060
Do you have any idea...

209
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,380
how difficult it is to find
a good husband in this town?

210
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,540
Hmm?!

211
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,420
Or a good dentist, come to that?

212
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,540
Playing this sort of game...

213
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,900
you have disgraced yourself
once again.

214
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,220
You caught him
through the frontal lobe...

215
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,100
so apparently he'll live.

216
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,980
But he'll never practice
orthodontics again...

217
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,100
that's for sure.

218
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,340
Mr. Schneider,
call extension 487.

219
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,980
Mr. Schneider,487.

220
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,900
My main fear is you're going
to end up like your mother...

221
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,100
who long ago found her own
natural level in society.

222
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,020
That is to say
she scuttles along the bottom.

223
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,300
Her biggest problem
was marrying a man like you...

224
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,940
a mistake I have taken
great care to avoid.

225
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,180
You...

226
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
are gonna go to work, my girl.

227
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,340
What?

228
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,180
You have spent
a quarter of a century...

229
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,700
watching the tide
go in and out...

230
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,820
but from tomorrow,
you are going to work...

231
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
here, under my supervision.

232
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,100
You're gonna learn
the essence of business...

233
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,340
about money and how it flows
relentlessly back...

234
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,300
towards he who owns it.

235
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,780
How to generate
a profit from a loss...

236
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,940
a loss from a profit.
You are gonna work.

237
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,500
This may not strike you
as very palatable.

238
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,620
Seven...

239
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,620
It may make you want to vomit.

240
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,220
But you will get used
to the taste.

241
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,820
And pretty soon,
you'll be spooning it down...

242
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,900
and asking for more
like all the other kids.

243
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,180
Eleven...

244
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,820
Mr. Naville, I presume?

245
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,260
Eleven...

246
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,140
You think you can
replace me with a robot?

247
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,580
Eleven...

248
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,420
Well, get this!

249
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,740
Eleven...

250
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,860
Aah!

251
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,420
Twelve...

252
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,380
thirteen...

253
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,500
Fuck.

254
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,980
Fourteen...

255
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,500
Ohh!

256
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,260
Nobody fucking move!

257
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,700
Nobody fucking move!

258
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,420
Aah! Aah!

259
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,900
Aah! Aah!

260
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,220
Everyone on the floor!

261
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,380
Everyone!

262
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,900
Everyone!

263
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,900
Four, five...

264
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,180
six...

265
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,660
seven...

266
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,980
Now, I want my job back!

267
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,580
I want what I had before,
Mr. Naville!

268
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm gonna count to five.

269
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,460
If you don't oblige me,
I'm gonna kill you.

270
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
One!

271
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,340
Two!

272
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,460
Three!

273
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,940
Four!

274
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,260
Five!

275
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,300
Ow!

276
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,460
- Ow!
- Ow!

277
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,780
- What did you say that for?
- Five comes directly after four.

278
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,940
I know that!

279
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,300
I thought you had a problem.

280
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,740
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

281
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,740
Without access
to a proper education...

282
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,780
- Shut up!
- I was just trying to help.

283
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,620
I don't need any help.

284
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,660
You'll die for this,
I swear to God.

285
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,260
- I'm sorry. No.
- You could shoot him again.

286
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,660
In the head this time.
I'll count to five.

287
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,540
Shut up!

288
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,940
Who are you, anyway?

289
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,100
Nobody!

290
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,380
I'm his daughter.

291
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,020
Aah!

292
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,660
This kid's got a gun.

293
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,020
Hey, cool it.

294
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,780
Take it easy, pal.
Chill out.

295
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,300
Drive!

296
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,140
Will you just drive?!

297
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
I can't.

298
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,460
- What?
- I don't know how.

299
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
- You don't know how to drive?
- I never learned.

300
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,780
- Why not?!
- I didn't need to!

301
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,980
Well, you do now!

302
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,940
This one makes it go faster,
that one slower.

303
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,060
This is forwards,
that's backwards.

304
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,540
The rest you can pick up
as we go along.

305
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,860
Drive!

306
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,140
Where are we going?

307
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Never mind that.
Just drive more carefully.

308
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,700
He cut in on me.

309
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,860
Mirror, signal, maneuver.

310
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,460
You say nothing, OK?

311
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,740
Afternoon, ma'am.
Afternoon, sir.

312
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,980
My name's Walt.

313
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm here to help you any way
I can during your visit...

314
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,660
be it short or long...

315
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
and whether it is purely
for refueling purposes...

316
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,420
or for the use of our extensive
washroom and retail facilities.

317
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,060
- Is this a gas station, Walt?
- It sure is, sir.

318
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,340
Then fill it up with gas
and cut the crap.

319
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,780
The guy was just doing his job.

320
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,180
You know, he was just trying
to be helpful.

321
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,980
You're in a lot of trouble,
you know?

322
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,020
My father's
gonna have you killed.

323
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,620
Do you realize that?

324
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,580
Tortured first, naturally.

325
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,860
Then he's gonna have you killed.

326
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,300
And what if I let you go?

327
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,260
I don't know. What do you think?

328
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,180
Think he's just gonna
forgive you?

329
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,900
Wait a minute.

330
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,860
Why would I ask him
to forgive me?

331
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,620
Your father treated me
like a piece of shit...

332
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,020
like I was nobody...

333
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,540
just because I was a cleaner...
like I was disposable.

334
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,980
Ahem.

335
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,500
Well, that's the tank full, sir.

336
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,740
Thank you, Walt.

337
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,220
That's for you, Walt.

338
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,580
You're a man, Walt.

339
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,820
Not a slave, not a machine.

340
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,500
Don't let anyone
ever treat you otherwise.

341
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Go on.

342
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,460
It's empty.

343
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,180
Let's get this clear.

344
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,140
I'm not gonna hurt you...

345
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,100
but I am the kidnapper,
and you are the...

346
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,260
Victim.

347
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,620
That's just the way it is.

348
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,180
It's OK.
I've been through this before.

349
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,060
Kidnapped before?

350
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,180
Yeah. I was twelve.

351
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,860
- God, that's terrible.
- It was a long time ago.

352
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,500
So... so how am I doing?

353
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,500
In the kidnap?

354
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,660
Yeah.

355
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,860
So far,
you're not doing too bad.

356
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,180
Thank you.

357
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,980
Anyway, I'm just tying you up so
you can't escape in the night.

358
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,100
I know that.

359
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,460
Because, of course, you would.

360
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,380
Are you gonna try
to have sex with me?

361
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,860
No.

362
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,900
Isn't that what
you brought me up here for?

363
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,340
No, it's not.

364
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,940
It didn't even cross your mind?

365
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,340
No. Well... No.

366
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,980
Do you have a problem with sex?

367
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,460
No.

368
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,140
So you're just frightened of it?

369
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,260
No.

370
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,580
- Nervous, then?
- I'm not nervous.

371
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,340
- Then calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.

372
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,220
I'm just trying to explain...

373
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,380
that there's no sexual motives
for my actions.

374
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,980
I'm glad we got that cleared up.

375
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,900
So, what did they do next?

376
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,180
They put a needle in my arm
and took a pint of blood...

377
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,140
and sent it to my father.

378
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,860
The next week
they did the same...

379
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,980
and the same the next week
till he paid up.

380
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,620
He waited six weeks.

381
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,740
That's what happens
to the victim.

382
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,500
Around our way

383
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,980
The sun shines bright

384
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,020
Around our way

385
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,220
The birds sing for ya

386
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,340
'Cause they already know ya

387
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,260
Enjoying the book?

388
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,580
No.

389
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,780
What's it about?

390
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,460
It's a romance.

391
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,220
This girl meets this guy.

392
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,660
They fall in love.

393
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,860
It's bullshit.

394
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,980
I'm writing a novel myself.

395
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,140
A lot of people say that,
but in my case, it's true.

396
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm not interested...

397
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,220
in you or your novel...

398
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,100
or any other pathetic ambition
you have...

399
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,420
to change your miserable,
mundane existence.

400
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,300
Do you want some exercise?

401
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,420
No.

402
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,180
You can't say no. It's
not part of the arrangement.

403
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,460
- I want to read my book.
- You said it was bullshit.

404
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,700
Doesn't mean
I'm not enjoying it.

405
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,620
- You just said you weren't!
- A girl can change her mind.

406
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,580
" She heard
his breathing become shallow...

407
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,420
"and a flicker of a smile
chased across her lips...

408
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,660
"as she meditated on the power
she now held over him.

409
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,260
"'Are you sure you want
to catch that flight? '

410
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,620
"she asked."

411
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,980
Do you think
they're in love yet?

412
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,420
No.

413
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,340
If they are in love,
we can go home.

414
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,620
Tonight, you're mine

415
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
I hate it down here.

416
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,500
I hate the air
and I hate the food...

417
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,980
and I hate the plumbing.

418
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
" She pulled him
closer, unable to stop."

419
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,220
I ache... all over.

420
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,340
"This, indeed,
was perfect love."

421
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,820
I sweat in the heat
and ache in the cold.

422
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,020
But will you love me tomorrow?

423
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,460
Why can't we stay
someplace decent?

424
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,180
Budget doesn't cover that.

425
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,380
Exactly. Why not?

426
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,940
You know those mysterious ways
you keep hearing about, Jackson?

427
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
Well, this is one of them.

428
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,980
"...cold, gloating gaze,
she let her hand droop down...

429
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,540
"towards the bulge
of his passion."

430
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,420
I remember the good old days.

431
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,380
" She heard
his breathing become shallow."

432
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,860
All you had to do
was introduce a man and a woman.

433
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,020
Nature did the rest.

434
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,140
"She gasped..."

435
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,260
Aah! Fuck!

436
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,060
"with surprise and delight."

437
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,820
Doesn't work like that anymore.

438
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,700
" All of her soul
erupted between her thighs...

439
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
"as she sensed the firm,
exploratory pressure...

440
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,860
"of his warm flesh."

441
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Men and women...
it's all gone to shit.

442
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,300
Sure has.

443
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,260
"In the hidden recess
of her pelvis...

444
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,540
"their bodies fused
into one writhing mass...

445
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,420
of torrid, torrid sexual..."

446
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,980
When the night

447
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,420
Meets the morning sun

448
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,060
I'd like to know

449
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,060
That your love

450
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,940
Is a love I can

451
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,340
Be sure of

452
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,260
So tell me now

453
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,380
Mmm.

454
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,300
And I won't ask again

455
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,180
Mmm.

456
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,700
Will you still love me tomorrow?

457
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,820
Mmm.

458
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,100
Aren't you hungry?

459
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,860
I don't eat red meat.

460
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,140
Well, you could eat
the vegetables.

461
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,020
They're on the same plate.

462
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,900
So?

463
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,620
I'm not gonna eat this.

464
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Do you eat fish and poultry?

465
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,620
Yes.

466
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,300
But not red meat?

467
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,500
No. Or eggs, unless I know
they're free-range.

468
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,420
Then why didn't you tell me
you don't like meat?

469
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,100
Because you didn't ask!

470
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,620
And I do like meat.
I just don't eat it.

471
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,060
Moral reasons, if you must know.

472
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,620
If you had taken the time
to inquire...

473
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,540
Why are you such a pain
to be with?

474
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,220
Because you tied me to a chair
all night!

475
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,900
Because I am the victim...

476
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,660
and you are the kidnapper,
apparently!

477
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,780
Meaning exactly what?

478
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,220
"Kidnap For Beginners"...
chapter one...

479
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,500
have you even asked
for a ransom yet?

480
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,620
Don't say a word
until I tell you.

481
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,820
Hello. Mr. Naville?

482
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,260
lt... it's me.

483
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,700
Now, I want my...

484
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,220
Me.

485
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
The kidnapper!

486
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,540
Right. Now, what I want...

487
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,100
It's not like that.

488
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,300
That's unfair now. I would not...

489
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,020
What are you doing?

490
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,940
No, what are you doing?

491
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm negotiating
with your father.

492
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,460
- Did you get very far?
- Well, he kept interrupting.

493
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,380
- Right.
- Wouldn't let me finish.

494
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,980
Remember
what they didn't teach you...

495
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,380
at Harvard Business School, OK?

496
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,020
I didn't go
to Harvard Business School.

497
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,180
It's a figure of speech, Robert.

498
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,500
Oh.

499
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,620
Sorry.

500
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,940
Negotiation is a weakness.

501
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,380
You are the kidnapper.

502
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,620
You demand, and he complies.

503
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,300
You go in hard,
and you go in fast.

504
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,580
- Hard and fast.
- Right.

505
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm you.

506
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,340
You grasp that?

507
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,340
OK.

508
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,180
Pretend it's ringing.
You psych yourself up.

509
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,540
Go to your dark side.

510
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,380
OK. He answers.

511
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,180
All right, you motherfucker,
I've got your daughter here.

512
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,860
I'm sending her back in pieces
if I don't get what I want.

513
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,220
I'm gonna pull her fingers out
with pliers...

514
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,900
and then I'm gonna fry them up
for breakfast, understand?

515
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,220
And so on and so on
like that, OK?

516
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,620
For no longer than
thirty seconds.

517
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,020
What?

518
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,740
Hello there. Mr. Naville?
Now...

519
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,620
Right, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

520
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,020
and I'm gonna cut her up...

521
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,580
and post her home to you
in boxes! Small boxes!

522
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,940
Right, daughter,
I've got your asshole here...

523
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,260
and I'm gonna send...

524
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,100
Right! Right!

525
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,180
No, I can't speak to anyone!
I need to speak to him!

526
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,380
Hello?

527
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,180
Yeah, I can hold.

528
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,900
Right, listen, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

529
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
and I'm gonna send her back
in pieces unless...

530
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,260
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.

531
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,220
No, I must've dialed
the wrong number.

532
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,100
No, I haven't got
your daughter here.

533
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,460
I have someone else's.

534
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,340
No, we're not married.

535
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
Yes, I've read the same thing.

536
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,540
It's very hard to find
suitable young men these days.

537
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,780
Well, I'm sure
your daughter's very nice.

538
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,900
In principle, I've got
no objections to meeting her...

539
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,820
What is the problem?

540
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,420
I think you should
just send a letter.

541
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,740
Done this kind of work before?

542
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,180
We do everything.

543
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,060
Eviction and debt collection
are our daily bread...

544
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,300
but personal retrieval,
bounty hunting...

545
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
you name it, we do it.

546
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,060
How much?

547
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,980
Our fee for the recovery
of your daughter is...

548
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,860
one hundred thousand dollars.

549
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,380
That's a lot of money.

550
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,060
Five thousand advance.

551
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,420
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.

552
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Naturally,
we operate a sliding scale...

553
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,140
whereby if we only bring back
part of your daughter...

554
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,260
we only get part of the money.

555
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,380
That's enough, Jackson.

556
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,660
If he's cut her ears off,
and we can't find them...

557
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,060
we'll knock a couple thousand
off the tariff.

558
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,580
More for a limb, obviously.

559
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,900
Jackson.

560
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,020
Sorry.

561
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,340
Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.

562
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,300
My partner is simply envisaging
a worst-case scenario.

563
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,860
What about the kidnapper?

564
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,540
You want him, too?

565
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,220
That's extra.

566
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,740
What if he gets in the way?

567
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,980
We'll deal with that situation
if it arises.

568
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,980
What if I want him
to get in the way?

569
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,140
Let us speak plainly,
Mr. Naville.

570
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,380
You want we should kill him?

571
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,900
Yes.

572
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,020
Uh...

573
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,380
Sir, I must say...

574
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,220
No one's asking you, Mayhew.

575
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,460
Very good, sir.

576
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,420
I am not gonna kill anyone.

577
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,500
If we don't get this job,
someone else will.

578
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,620
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Including expenses?

579
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,660
Including all expenses...

580
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,260
except medical costs...

581
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,780
for which you accept full
and unlimited responsibility.

582
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,620
Only for the duration
of the contract.

583
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,580
- Naturally.
- It's a deal.

584
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,660
Good afternoon.

585
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,580
Hi.

586
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,420
I'm Tod Johnson.

587
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,100
I live up the hill.

588
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,380
That's nice.

589
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,220
I see most things from up there.

590
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,820
Saw you arrive.

591
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,140
Big car, middle of the night.

592
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,260
Right.

593
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Wondered "Who's that?"

594
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,500
Perfectly natural question.

595
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,940
So I asked Felix.

596
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,060
Felix?

597
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,380
Felix is my friend.

598
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,460
He hasn't been the same
since the war.

599
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
Of course.

600
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,540
I asked him.
I said, " Felix, tell me...

601
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,460
"are they good,
or are they evil?"

602
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,220
One bark for good, two for evil.

603
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,980
Felix is a dog?

604
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,100
Do you think
that I would talk to a dog?

605
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Do you think
I would ask a dog...

606
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,900
whether or not
you're good or evil?

607
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,300
What do you think I am...

608
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,180
some kind
of a crazy backwoods lunatic...

609
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,140
with a barn
full of human skulls...

610
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,900
and a scythe
that I sharpen every day...

611
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,500
in readiness for Armageddon?

612
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,620
No.
I'm sure you're a regular guy.

613
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,780
Right! I'm regular!
I am a regular man.

614
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,700
I want...

615
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,580
That's not the point!
The point is, who are you?!

616
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,820
Who are you?!

617
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,780
Well, I'm...

618
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,820
We're newlyweds.

619
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,980
Are you coming back to bed
soon, darling?

620
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,340
This is Mr. Johnson, dear.

621
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,820
Hello.

622
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

623
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,700
You can call me Lucille.

624
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,740
My pleasure, Lucille.

625
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,140
You're not
from the newspapers, are you?

626
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,380
I live up the hill.

627
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,980
Oh, good. You can't tell
the newspapers we're here.

628
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,860
They never leave us alone,
on account of Ritchie.

629
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,340
Ritchie?

630
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,620
You recognize Ritchie,
don't you?

631
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,220
Ritchie Vanderlow?

632
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Six gold albums...

633
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,300
three platinum.

634
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,860
Fourteen consecutive
top-ten singles.

635
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,020
Largest-selling artist
worldwide...

636
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,380
for the last twelve months?

637
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,140
Ritchie Vanderlow!

638
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,540
You have got to understand,
ma'am...

639
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,540
I watch mainly
the biblical channels.

640
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,340
It's OK.

641
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,260
We were married in secret...

642
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,820
in a castle in Scotland.

643
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,060
That's in England.

644
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,700
Near Paris?

645
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,860
Paris.

646
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,380
Right.

647
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,180
It was so romantic.

648
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,380
We stayed there
for our honeymoon...

649
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,500
but it wasn't long enough...

650
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,140
so we came here for the sake
of a little privacy.

651
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,980
Mmm. I see.

652
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Would you like to come in...

653
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,340
Mr. Johnson?

654
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,700
No, I better be on my way.

655
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,780
I have to feed Felix.

656
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,380
OK.

657
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,860
Well...

658
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,020
it was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.

659
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,980
See you around.

660
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,340
I'll catch you later then,
Mr. Johnson.

661
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,220
Take care, Ritchie.

662
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,100
Thanks.

663
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,540
This?

664
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,020
The ransom note.

665
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,180
- Right. Anonymous.
- Yeah.

666
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,900
Robert...

667
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,580
my father knows who you are.

668
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,140
Oh, I never thought of that.

669
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,980
You are the worst kidnapper
I've ever met.

670
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,580
Oh, and that's all I am
to you, isn't it?

671
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,020
The latest kidnapper!

672
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,700
A lifestyle accessory.

673
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,220
And if it doesn't work,
it doesn't matter...

674
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,900
'cause you can always
get another one.

675
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,260
Quit being so melodramatic.

676
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,020
I'm trying to do my best here...

677
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,620
under really difficult
circumstances!

678
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,380
It's not made any easier...

679
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,620
by you criticizing
everything I do!

680
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,420
- How much you asking for?
- Half a million.

681
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,180
- Dollars?
- Yes.

682
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,140
- U.S. Dollars?
- Is there a problem?

683
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,580
Half a million dollars
isn't a lot of money for me!

684
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,140
It's not meant
to reflect you as an individual.

685
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,420
If word got out I was liberated
for half a million...

686
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,500
I could never show my face
in polite society again.

687
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,100
Diamonds have no value except
that which is placed upon them.

688
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,220
It's more complicated
than I thought!

689
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,020
OK, don't worry...

690
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,460
all right?

691
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,180
You're trying hard.

692
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,580
You're keen to learn.
That's important.

693
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,660
Let's just not
lose sight of the fact...

694
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,140
that we have the opportunity...

695
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,980
to make
millions of dollars here.

696
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,340
We?

697
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,300
Yes, Robert.

698
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,620
You and me.

699
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,660
Is that not a little irregular?

700
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,940
Yes, it is.

701
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
Millions?

702
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,620
Please, dad,
just give him the money!

703
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,540
He's gonna kill me, daddy!

704
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,540
Please! Just put it
in the trunk of the car...

705
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,220
two miles south of Palmer,
please, daddy!

706
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,380
Daddy!

707
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,380
OK, OK, OK.

708
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,620
OK, OK.

709
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,900
Nice shooting.

710
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,420
Thanks.

711
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,260
Shit.

712
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Aah!

713
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,660
No problem.

714
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,340
Exactly as you predicted.

715
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,940
"Quick, drive my car."

716
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,940
Here's forty dollars.

717
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,540
If you don't mind me asking...

718
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,100
how did you know
he'd react like that?

719
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,780
It's our job
to know things like that.

720
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,660
You done
this sort of thing before?

721
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,220
Let's go!

722
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,700
You can take the car,
but remember, it's stolen.

723
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,540
Look,
they weren't trying to kill you.

724
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,500
They were trying to confuse you
and scare you.

725
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,340
Yeah, before they killed me.

726
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,260
And I lost the car,
and I didn't get any money.

727
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,660
You can't expect to get
everything right the first time.

728
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,060
Look, you are going to be fine.

729
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,980
You are going to be...

730
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,420
a success.

731
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,020
Do you think so?

732
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,020
You didn't get caught, right?

733
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,580
No.

734
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,540
No, I didn't get caught.

735
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,020
I fooled them.

736
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,460
I got away.

737
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,020
Maybe we should go out.

738
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,300
Out where?

739
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,300
For a drink.

740
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,260
What, like on a date?

741
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,420
Yeah, like a date.

742
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,620
I wouldn't call it
a bad relationship.

743
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,380
No, Lily and I, we just...

744
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,460
You know,
we just grew apart as people.

745
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,900
There was no bitterness
on either side.

746
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,020
She left you?

747
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,180
No, no, no, no. No!

748
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,500
Yes, she left me.

749
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,940
Mmm.

750
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,660
The aerobics instructor.

751
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,620
How did you know?

752
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,740
You have the demeanor...

753
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,100
of a man who's been left
for an aerobics instructor.

754
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,540
- I do?
- Yeah.

755
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,420
But be honest.
It was inevitable.

756
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,340
You two weren't suited
for one another.

757
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,340
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.

758
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,980
Hence, the gymnast.
Am I right?

759
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,100
Well, yeah.

760
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,060
Yeah. It's a common scenario.

761
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,980
Can I tell you about
this dream I have? You're in it.

762
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,140
I'm in your dream?

763
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,420
Now I feel violated.

764
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,420
- Oh, it's not like that.
- I don't wanna hear it.

765
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,340
Perhaps this is
a good opportunity...

766
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,900
to tell you about my novel.

767
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,500
Look, I'm not interested
in your novel.

768
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,940
It's 1962, right?

769
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,500
And Marilyn Monroe...

770
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,780
is giving birth to a baby girl.

771
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,380
She's on the phone
to Jack Kennedy...

772
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,100
saying, " Jack, it's yours.
It's yours, Jack."

773
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,740
So the orphan grows up...

774
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,660
And she solves
some great mystery, right?

775
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,500
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

776
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,780
Let's play a game.

777
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,100
If I win...

778
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,260
I go free.

779
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,140
Look, you are free.
The kidnap's over.

780
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,580
You're more a kidnapper
than I am Ritchie Vanderlow.

781
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,860
Indulge me, Robert.

782
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,020
Well, if it's what you want.

783
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,540
It's all I ever want.

784
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,820
OK.

785
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,100
You're free.

786
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,420
That's right.

787
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,900
Aren't you gonna leave?

788
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,340
We haven't got our money yet.

789
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,220
Don't take your love to town

790
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,140
Oh, Ruby

791
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,140
For God's sakes, turn around

792
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,340
Big hand! Big hand!

793
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,220
Big hand for local boy
Scottie Sherman.

794
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,300
We are privileged
to have here tonight...

795
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,940
a very special guest...

796
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,580
who is a close personal friend
of mine...

797
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,780
and I'm gonna ask him
to come up here and sing a song.

798
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,140
He is the best-selling artist
in the world...

799
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,260
with twelve gold albums...

800
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,860
sixteen platinum albums...

801
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,060
and thirty-two
number-one hit singles!

802
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,460
Mr. Ritchie Vanderclaw!

803
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,180
Thank you very much.

804
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,100
My name is Rob...
Ritchie Vanderlow...

805
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,060
and, um...

806
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,340
I'd like to sing this song
for my beautiful wife...

807
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,740
Aww.

808
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,820
Lucille.

809
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,620
Uh...

810
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,860
Oh, and this is
a very special song for us.

811
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,060
Somewhere

812
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,580
Beyond the sea

813
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,860
Somewhere

814
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,780
Waiting for me

815
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,700
My lover stands

816
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,580
On golden sands

817
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,620
And watches the ships

818
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,340
That go sailing

819
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,220
Somewhere

820
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
Beyond the sea

821
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,540
She's there

822
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,740
Watching for me

823
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,460
And if I could fly

824
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,500
Like birds on high

825
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,620
Then straight to her arms

826
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,140
I'd go sailing

827
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,380
It's far

828
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,740
Beyond the stars

829
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,500
It's near

830
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,940
Beyond the moon

831
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,060
I know

832
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,820
Beyond a doubt

833
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,740
My heart

834
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,420
Will lead me there

835
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,940
Soon

836
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,580
We'll meet

837
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,060
Beyond the shore

838
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,340
We'll kiss

839
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,220
Just like before

840
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,140
And happy we'll be

841
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,100
Beyond the sea

842
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,100
And never again

843
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,580
I'll go sailing

844
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,980
I know

845
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,660
I know

846
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,660
Beyond a doubt

847
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,180
My heart

848
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,100
Will lead me there

849
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,700
Soon

850
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,340
We'll meet

851
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,580
Touches my heart
to see two young people in love.

852
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,700
Happy we'll be

853
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,740
Beyond the sea

854
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,740
And never again

855
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,540
I'll go sailing

856
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,380
Hmm.

857
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,420
Oh, my God. What happened?

858
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,740
You were great.

859
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,580
I was?

860
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,700
Mm-hmm.

861
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,780
I remember drinking tequila.

862
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,380
Certainly was a feature
of the evening.

863
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,140
Then I had
an incredible dream.

864
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,100
This dream, I've had it before.

865
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,900
You're definitely in it now.

866
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,580
I don't want to hear it.

867
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,940
We were on this
game show called Perfect Love.

868
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,620
Never heard of it.

869
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,060
Well, it's just a dream.

870
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
I don't think the fact
that it's a game show...

871
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,380
has any relevance.

872
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,820
It merely indicates
my cultural origins.

873
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,180
I mean, were I a tribesman
in the Kalahari, for instance...

874
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,540
the location would undoubtedly
have been different.

875
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,740
But I think
the theme is universal.

876
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,260
We're on this game show
called Perfect Love.

877
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,660
My life was in danger.

878
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,100
Are you ready?

879
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,020
Am I ready for what?

880
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,500
To write a letter.

881
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,940
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.

882
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,380
We had it analyzed.

883
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,500
It's his handwriting
and her blood.

884
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,260
Without our help,
Mr. Naville...

885
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,860
that could be the last trace
of your daughter you ever see.

886
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,260
He wants a straight
switch with no delays.

887
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,780
- I want her back.
- Don't worry. We'll get her.

888
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,900
And I want him dead.

889
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,300
That's understood, Mr. Naville.

890
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,740
Good.

891
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,500
And when this is over,
I want this back.

892
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,500
Bradley was nice, you know?

893
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,460
Extremely wealthy.

894
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,620
Honorable, amusing.

895
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,540
And?

896
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,940
Well, eighty-seven years old.

897
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,260
- Ha ha. Pity.
- Yeah.

898
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,700
Then there was Jake.

899
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,140
He was nice.

900
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,900
Very rich.

901
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,500
Just so conventional.

902
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,340
You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.

903
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,460
It's a problem.

904
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,780
Then there was Angelo.

905
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,420
Twenty-five years old...

906
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,940
handsome, healthy...

907
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,700
exciting...

908
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,620
sophisticated.

909
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,780
Considerate.

910
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,460
So?

911
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,420
Well, I think
that we just sort of, um...

912
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,060
grew apart as people.

913
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,260
The aerobics instructor?

914
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,660
Like I said...

915
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,060
it's a common scenario.

916
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,700
So who was next?

917
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Then I started getting
problems with my teeth.

918
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,420
With your teeth?

919
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,340
Yeah, my teeth.

920
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,460
Hey, want a ride?

921
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,340
Hi, thanks for stopping, guys.

922
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,100
Uh, we're not stealing it,
we're just borrowing it.

923
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,980
Had that dream again last night.

924
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,700
What dream?

925
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,940
We were
on that game show Perfect Love.

926
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,380
- Mmm. Fascinating.
- And my life was in danger.

927
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,460
On a game show?

928
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,220
I know.
It's difficult to explain.

929
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,700
Strange things were happening.

930
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,620
Mmm. So it would appear.

931
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,540
But my life was in danger...

932
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,460
and you saved it.

933
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,860
My heart was beating so fast...

934
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,420
and then it stopped.

935
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,660
And I was just about to die...

936
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,140
and you saved it.

937
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,060
You saved my life.

938
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,980
Well, what are we waiting for?

939
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,740
You want to get on with this
or not?

940
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,300
Sure!

941
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,540
You send the girl over.

942
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,740
Ha ha. First the money.
That was the deal.

943
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,580
Are you OK, Miss Naville?

944
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,380
Yes, I'm OK.

945
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,900
I'm just a little frightened.

946
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,660
Now, don't you worry, miss.

947
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,140
Everything'll be all right.

948
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,620
Well?

949
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,260
Whew. It's here.

950
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,820
OK? Send the girl over.

951
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,700
OK, go on.

952
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,020
Ohh, damn.

953
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,060
Aah! Aah!

954
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,340
Aah! Aah! Help!

955
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,740
Get down! Get down!

956
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,220
Yes.

957
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,420
They tied me up! Ohh!

958
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Ha ha!

959
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,740
Don't move a fucking muscle.

960
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,700
Mmm.

961
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,100
What took you?

962
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,660
He shot up the car!

963
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,460
You shot up our car.

964
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,980
Now, what did you do that for?

965
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,140
I was trying to make a getaway.

966
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,420
You were trying
to make a getaway?

967
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,980
How is she?

968
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,460
I don't know.

969
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,700
But I don't think it's worked.

970
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,660
They're not... you know?

971
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,340
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy, Jackson...

972
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,780
always works.

973
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,660
OK.

974
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,820
This is far enough.

975
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,300
Are you... are you going
to kill me?

976
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,420
Yeah.

977
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,500
Well, then I don't see
why I should dig.

978
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,580
If you dig...

979
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,020
I promise you
when the time comes...

980
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,180
I'll shoot you through the head.

981
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,100
Now, look, you don't like that?

982
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,580
I can just shoot you through
the testicles right now.

983
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,980
You can bleed to death.
I'll dig the grave.

984
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,700
It's up to you.

985
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,900
Can you cut me free?

986
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,860
Please?

987
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,260
It's sore.

988
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,140
What's he going to do with him?

989
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,300
Shoot him in the back
of the head.

990
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,420
Right.

991
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,740
Would that be a problem for you?

992
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,660
Ever felt like
you're not in control of events?

993
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,860
Yes.

994
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,060
No, I mean...

995
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,740
something is...

996
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,420
destined to happen...

997
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,580
and it doesn't?

998
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,500
Like, what happens
when the forces of destiny...

999
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,900
are no longer in control?

1000
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,140
I don't know.

1001
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,100
The truth is...

1002
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,940
I don't think even he knows
what's going on down here...

1003
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,060
the chaos, the...

1004
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,340
This hatred, this violence.

1005
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,500
Who...

1006
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,220
Who are you talking about?

1007
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,260
Jeopardy, Jackson...

1008
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,740
always works.

1009
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,060
Dig.

1010
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,940
What are they doing in there?

1011
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,900
Should've shot him myself.

1012
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,380
Yeah, well, you can't
trust them to do anything.

1013
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,260
I take it you're not
in a love situation.

1014
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,420
What?

1015
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,460
I mean you're not in love.

1016
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,180
What's it to you?

1017
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,980
Nothing.

1018
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,220
Just asking.

1019
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,780
I like it like that

1020
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,860
And I know it

1021
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,300
That's OK. You can stop now.

1022
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,260
No.

1023
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,500
I've waited long enough.

1024
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,300
No.

1025
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,220
Give me that. Lie down.

1026
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,140
No, no. No!

1027
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,060
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1028
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,180
Please!

1029
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,500
- Please.
- Shh.

1030
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,660
Aah!

1031
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,540
Leave it all behind

1032
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,660
I commit you to his mercy.

1033
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,660
Please. Please. Please.

1034
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,580
Aah!

1035
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,940
Aah! Aah!

1036
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,220
Aah!

1037
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,860
Aah!

1038
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,340
No! No!

1039
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,660
Get up!

1040
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,140
Robert, get off!

1041
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,060
Who are they?

1042
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,580
Come on!

1043
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,180
That's what keeps me

1044
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,220
That's what keeps me

1045
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,700
That's what keeps me down

1046
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,740
Aah!

1047
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,260
Ohh.

1048
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,220
Just for a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.

1049
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,140
I told you don't get caught.

1050
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,900
Don't get out of the car.

1051
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,820
Don't ever go into the woods
with a stranger.

1052
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,900
- I know. You're right.
- I'm always right, OK?

1053
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
You might like to remember that.

1054
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,100
Have you got the money?

1055
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,980
- Aah!
- Aah!

1056
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,060
No! Jesus!

1057
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,580
I'm going to get you.

1058
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,300
Aah!

1059
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,100
Ohh!

1060
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,380
Shit.

1061
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,700
- Oh, shit.
- Where is she?

1062
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,180
Oh, shit.

1063
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,940
Drive!

1064
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,460
Ohh!

1065
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,380
Ohh!

1066
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,540
Jesus!

1067
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,180
- Jump!
- What?

1068
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,420
Jump!

1069
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,260
Aah!

1070
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,420
Aah!

1071
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,580
Aah!

1072
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,460
Aah!

1073
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,620
If the card's no good,
I'm authorized to destroy it.

1074
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,300
It's my card, lady.
Listen, you don't understand.

1075
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,340
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry about this, ma'am.

1076
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,900
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1077
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,220
I've got some cash, OK?

1078
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,380
Thirty dollars, sir.

1079
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,460
Thank you.

1080
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
How could he
do a thing like that?

1081
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,980
Stay calm, OK?

1082
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,340
My own father.
He canceled my credit card.

1083
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,220
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

1084
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,140
- I know exactly how you feel.
- You couldn't possibly know.

1085
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,900
Only the exceptionally rich
can know how I feel right now.

1086
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,020
Don't take it personally.

1087
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,860
Is he trying to say
I'll find my own natural level?

1088
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,820
Sink to the bottom like her?

1089
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,540
Like who?
Who are you talking about?

1090
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,140
Pull over.

1091
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,820
Oh, no.

1092
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,300
Oh, no, no, no.

1093
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,420
Live a little.

1094
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,900
This is insane.

1095
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,420
Stop worrying so much.
It'll be my first time, too.

1096
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,700
That's what I'm worrying about.

1097
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,580
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1098
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,740
Next.

1099
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,100
Hello.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

1100
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,980
I thought we agreed...
no clichs.

1101
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,740
Fill the bag.

1102
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,180
Oh, my God, she's got a gun!

1103
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,020
Leave my daughter alone.
Please, leave her alone!

1104
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,180
- Don't be silly.
- She's going to kill her!

1105
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,380
She's not going to kill
your daughter.

1106
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,660
- Yes, I am.
- What?

1107
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,580
Shut up.

1108
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,660
Christ, no!

1109
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,780
Everybody calm down...,

1110
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,820
or this girl's brains
will splatter the wall.

1111
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,620
- Fill the bag!
- Celine!

1112
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,220
You shut up especially.

1113
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,860
You can't hold the girl hostage.

1114
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,220
What?

1115
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,340
Oh, no!

1116
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,780
You didn't find it difficult.

1117
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,740
- That was different.
- Was it?

1118
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,340
Didn't feel different.
It felt just like this.

1119
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,660
Now do you understand
how it felt, Robert?

1120
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,340
But you, unlike me,
couldn't pull the trigger.

1121
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,620
- Oh, no.
- Good-bye, Robert.

1122
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,540
OK, kill me,
but don't touch the girl!

1123
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,580
Extremely amusing!

1124
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,900
" Kill me,
but don't touch the girl."

1125
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,500
Robert,
you should be on television.

1126
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,460
- Very funny.
- What's wrong?

1127
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,220
What's wrong? I thought
you were going to shoot me!

1128
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,340
That's what's wrong!

1129
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,340
Shoot you? I wouldn't do that.

1130
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,900
- Oh, no?
- No! I'm having a great time!

1131
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,420
- Oh, good!
- Yeah, certainly is!

1132
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,980
What's wrong?

1133
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,500
Celine, it's over.

1134
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,580
Aah!

1135
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,860
I'm dying, Celine.

1136
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,460
I think I'm dying,
and I don't want to die.

1137
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,140
You're not going to die.

1138
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,620
I don't want to die.

1139
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,700
Are you taking me to a hospital?

1140
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,740
Because I don't want to die
in a hospital.

1141
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,260
I'm not going
to take you to a hospital.

1142
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,860
What do you mean, you're not
taking me to a hospital?

1143
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,900
Take me to a hospital!
Where are you taking me?

1144
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,700
Very nice.

1145
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,940
Very nice, indeed.

1146
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,500
You could have a perfect smile.

1147
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,300
For two thousand dollars,
you could change your life.

1148
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,420
No, thanks.

1149
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,660
Do you think a perfect smile
just happens?

1150
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,260
Is that what you think? Huh?

1151
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,340
Do you think that Celine's smile
is her own?

1152
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,500
No, it's not.

1153
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,060
It's mine.

1154
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,540
I gave it to her...

1155
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,540
just like I can give you one.

1156
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,860
I'll fix your teeth
for twelve thousand dollars.

1157
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,420
I didn't get shot in the teeth.

1158
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,620
Well, let me tell you something.

1159
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,460
It wouldn't have made
too much difference if you had.

1160
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,580
I don't want to say anything.

1161
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,780
It's your teeth,
but if you wait another year...

1162
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,940
you'll have fifty grand worth
of major reconstruction, so...

1163
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,740
If you wait another year...

1164
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,900
he'll be dead.

1165
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,620
Sorry. Just a little
free consultation.

1166
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,540
You know,
they wanted me to take a break.

1167
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,700
Take a break.

1168
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,660
Go get counseling, you know?

1169
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,780
Fuck them. What do they know?

1170
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,980
They wanted me to stay
in the hospital.

1171
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,860
I discharged myself
this afternoon.

1172
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,060
Lucky for you that I did, huh?

1173
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,420
OK.

1174
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,100
Have you, um, done this before?

1175
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,340
The principles of surgery...

1176
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,820
are the same
above and below the neck.

1177
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,940
Aah! Aah!

1178
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,460
Aren't you going
to anesthetize me?

1179
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,940
I'm sure you'll pass out
as the pain gets worse.

1180
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,420
Aah!

1181
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,900
Aah!

1182
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,460
Give me another one.

1183
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,820
Here we go, baby.

1184
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,980
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yaah!

1185
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,980
Give it to me hot.
You look lovely.

1186
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,260
Thank you.

1187
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,980
Give me the Bambi, baby.

1188
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,460
That's it.

1189
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,780
God!

1190
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,780
OK, turn over. Turn over.

1191
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,380
- What?
- Turn over, darling.

1192
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,140
Turn...

1193
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,380
There you go.

1194
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,380
Flash me the tush.

1195
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,260
One heel.

1196
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,580
Excellent.

1197
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,820
Mmm.

1198
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,780
Robbie!

1199
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,740
Hey, how are you? Come on.

1200
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,100
Join the party.

1201
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,220
Come on.

1202
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,540
Do you want some champagne?

1203
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,380
How rude of me. Excuse me, love.

1204
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,140
Oh, wait.

1205
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,300
Here you go.

1206
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,740
Here. Look at that.

1207
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,540
So, I understand that you're...
Here, please.

1208
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:48,380
I understand that
you're something of a fugitive.

1209
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,380
Don't be shocked.

1210
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,540
We go back a long way.

1211
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,620
Oh, I see. You're her dentist.

1212
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,340
Yup. That's right.

1213
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,100
We met over that particularly
fine set of ivories.

1214
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,460
In fact...

1215
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,020
I gave her her first filling.

1216
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,700
Ohh!

1217
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,820
Fuck.

1218
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,220
Oh, I wish
you hadn't done that.

1219
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,780
Now I have to hurt you...

1220
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:16,980
which is inconvenient
and undignified.

1221
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,540
Ohh!

1222
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,500
Fucker.

1223
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,780
Get up!

1224
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,900
Leave him alone, Elliot.

1225
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,380
Why don't you
stay out of this?

1226
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,260
Are you all right?

1227
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,500
Uhh!

1228
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,580
Gaah!

1229
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,580
Uhh! Aah!

1230
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,220
You want to explain to me...

1231
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,500
exactly what you were trying
to achieve back there?

1232
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,860
How about you
do some explaining to me?

1233
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,780
I didn't want you
bleeding to death...

1234
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,940
and I think I saved your life.

1235
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,380
I'd rather have died
than have witnessed that.

1236
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,700
Witnessed what, exactly?

1237
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,300
You and Elliot in
an advanced state of foreplay.

1238
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,540
He would've passed out
drunk in five minutes...

1239
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,820
if you hadn't come along.

1240
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,980
Yeah, sure.

1241
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,380
Even if we were
about to get physical...

1242
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,100
what's it got to do with you
anyway?

1243
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,660
Aah.

1244
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,660
You thought we had something?

1245
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,020
It's possible.

1246
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,180
But why?

1247
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,380
Why do we
have to have something?

1248
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,540
We were getting along just fine.

1249
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,420
Having something
ruins everything.

1250
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:59,140
What will you do now,
ask me to marry you?

1251
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,580
Of course I'm not.

1252
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,740
- You thought about it.
- Don't be absurd.

1253
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,220
It never even occurred to you?

1254
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,420
Well, it wouldn't be so bad.

1255
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,540
You see what I mean?
Just forget it.

1256
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,100
Consider it forgotten.

1257
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,580
Where do you want to go?

1258
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,780
Don't care.

1259
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,380
Do you want to get out
of the car?

1260
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,620
- Are you asking me to get out?
- No. I'm asking if you want to.

1261
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,820
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

1262
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,580
One is a request,
the other is a question.

1263
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,100
Fine. If that's what
you want, then I'll get out.

1264
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,140
If that's what you want,
go right ahead.

1265
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,700
And don't even ask
where I'm going!

1266
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,460
Don't even imagine that I care.

1267
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,700
Exactly the problem!

1268
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,860
Where's the love gone to?

1269
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,580
Don't leave

1270
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:41,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1271
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,260
You got me hurtin'

1272
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,580
Don't leave

1273
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,580
Yeah, yeah

1274
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,820
Yeah, yeah

1275
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,580
You know it's never been easy

1276
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,100
To love someone like me

1277
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,700
Oh, oh

1278
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,100
Don't leave

1279
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,940
Yeah, yeah

1280
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,100
Fuck.

1281
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,500
Where did all the love go?

1282
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,700
Where's the love gone to?

1283
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:17,500
Stop hovering over me.
I can't concentrate.

1284
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,460
Have you written anything yet?

1285
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,940
I... I...

1286
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,700
What am I supposed to write?

1287
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,100
Love letters, Jackson,
deal with the subject of love.

1288
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:31,060
I need time to think.

1289
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,660
We don't have time.

1290
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,860
Every day they spend apart...

1291
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,700
the more difficult
it's going to be.

1292
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:40,180
And if Naville finds our boy...

1293
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,980
he's just meat.

1294
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:47,540
Maybe I didn't treat you...

1295
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,340
So, think, Jackson...

1296
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,660
have you ever done this before?

1297
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,100
Back when I was alive,
there was a girl.

1298
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,060
You wrote to some girl?

1299
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,900
A long time ago.

1300
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,980
You never told me about this.

1301
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,620
It never came to nothing.

1302
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,660
Her father
did not approve our match.

1303
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,580
It was just young love,
but I wrote...

1304
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,260
many times...

1305
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,980
with passion...

1306
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,260
and despair.

1307
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,620
You were always on my mind

1308
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,260
Maybe I didn't hold you

1309
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,740
I never knew
you had a romantic soul.

1310
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,740
All those lonely, lonely nights

1311
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:38,380
I often wonder
what became of that girl...

1312
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,620
sweet Eliza.

1313
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,020
Eliza...

1314
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,140
Gray.

1315
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,140
Her father was a colonel.

1316
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,100
Jackson, you're qualified.

1317
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,340
You can write this letter.

1318
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,980
That's the problem, see?

1319
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,860
I wrote to her, sure,
but I didn't write letters.

1320
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,140
Well, what, then?

1321
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,500
As a matter of fact...

1322
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,700
I...

1323
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,340
wrote...

1324
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,820
love poems.

1325
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,500
Tell me that your sweet love

1326
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:13,940
Tell me that your sweet love

1327
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,900
Hasn't died

1328
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,220
Give me

1329
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,900
Give me one more chance

1330
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,260
To keep you satisfied

1331
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,860
Remember, my dear...

1332
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,700
they only want one thing.

1333
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:31,060
Maybe they want it
more than once...

1334
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,340
but it's still
only one thing.

1335
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,900
Little things

1336
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,260
I should have said

1337
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,660
And done

1338
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,580
I just never took the time

1339
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,500
You were always on my mind

1340
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,780
You were always on my mind

1341
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:59,220
You were always on my mind

1342
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,660
I wish
you had let me read that poem.

1343
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,300
A poem...

1344
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,140
is a very personal document.

1345
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,300
I hope it was a good one.

1346
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,900
That's all I'm saying.

1347
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,660
Because if she don't like it,
she won't come.

1348
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,220
And if she don't come,
we're stuck.

1349
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,820
It's her.

1350
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,060
- I got your poem.
- Sorry?

1351
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,140
Your poem...
the one you wrote me.

1352
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,500
Poem?

1353
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,540
"Oh, desert me,
wretched loneliness...

1354
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,180
"and bring me back my love...

1355
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,060
"for she and I have parted...

1356
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,260
"and the sky is up above."

1357
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,420
It worked.

1358
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,740
She loves it.

1359
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,820
" Your limbs
so svelte and slender..."

1360
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,820
"Your touch...

1361
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,380
"so soft and tender."

1362
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,980
"But the bits
that I like best...

1363
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,140
"are the bits that..."

1364
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,380
I'm not going to read that line.

1365
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,900
Jackson, Jackson,
what the hell did you write?

1366
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,020
It was a...

1367
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,140
Yeah?

1368
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,340
A simple poetic reference...

1369
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,940
uh, to...

1370
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,340
Celine.

1371
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,540
Please.

1372
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:49,740
Last verse.

1373
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,300
"Just as the flowers blossom...

1374
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,300
"in the gaze
of the shining sun..."

1375
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,820
"I would be most honored..."

1376
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,860
"if you would bear my son."

1377
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,140
Robert, no one has ever
written me a poem before.

1378
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,580
All those guys I dated,
they didn't care about me.

1379
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,220
They just wanted to own this.

1380
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,660
Huh?

1381
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,860
I would never open
my heart to any of those guys.

1382
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,420
And before I met you...

1383
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,940
I never believed
that there was any alternative.

1384
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,380
Oh!

1385
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,860
I knew it!

1386
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,700
But when you
stopped that bullet...

1387
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,900
Ha ha ha ha!

1388
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,820
and got the wrong idea
about Elliot...

1389
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,580
I knew it!

1390
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,340
I should've understood.

1391
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,460
- Celine...
- No. Let me finish.

1392
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,380
This is difficult for me
to say...

1393
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,500
but I feel I can trust you.

1394
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,860
I didn't write the poem.

1395
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,860
What?

1396
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,220
I didn't write it.

1397
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,780
I've never written a poem
in my life.

1398
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,900
How can anybody
be that honest?

1399
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,900
It's his handwriting.
Tell him it's his handwriting.

1400
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,100
But it's your handwriting.

1401
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,700
It... it has this address.

1402
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,820
It even has some sort of cheap
aftershave on the paper.

1403
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,340
I didn't write the poem, OK?

1404
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,180
Oh, my God.

1405
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,580
Celine, no need to...

1406
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,660
Human fucking beings.

1407
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,180
What do you have to do?

1408
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,780
We did everything for them!

1409
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,460
Brought them together.
Put them in jeopardy.

1410
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,420
We damn near killed them both!

1411
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,260
We gave them every opportunity.

1412
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,940
All they had to do
was fall in love...

1413
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,300
and we could've gone home.

1414
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,980
Maybe we failed, Jackson...

1415
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,980
but we don't have to live
like this.

1416
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,020
Is she gone?

1417
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,180
Yeah.

1418
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,780
Nice-looking woman.

1419
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,420
She isn't my type.

1420
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,660
What are you talking about?

1421
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,380
Look at yourself.

1422
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,020
You're nobody.

1423
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,540
You're nothing.

1424
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:15,820
You're wanted in connection
with a violent crime.

1425
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,300
You're cleaning the floor
of a diner.

1426
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:23,380
She is an intelligent,
passionate...

1427
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,340
beautiful rich woman.

1428
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,420
The issue of whether or not
she's your type...

1429
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,460
is not one
that you are likely...

1430
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,820
to have to resolve
in this world.

1431
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,420
She's there watching for me

1432
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,340
Or indeed the next, since she
will be going to some heaven...

1433
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,100
for glamorous pussy...

1434
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,780
and you will be cleaning
the floor of a diner...

1435
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,700
in hell.

1436
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,580
I guess so.

1437
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,260
So why are you even
thinking about it?

1438
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,700
I don't know.

1439
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,260
Stupid...

1440
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,340
Come on.

1441
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,420
Finish the floor.

1442
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,900
What the fuck?

1443
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,580
Aah!

1444
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,220
Shut up!

1445
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,220
Where's my beautiful poem?

1446
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:55,780
Your father's not home yet.

1447
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,100
I don't expect he'll pay
our ransom straight off.

1448
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,700
Not till we send a few fingers
through the mail.

1449
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,020
Ooh.

1450
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,540
Sixteen.

1451
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,580
I'm gonna stick right there.

1452
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,500
Say, how about you?

1453
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,700
You want a hit?

1454
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,620
No.

1455
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,100
Mmm, stay.

1456
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:23,020
- Uh-huh?
- No.

1457
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,380
- Hit?
- No!

1458
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,260
Now, Miss Naville...

1459
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,500
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

1460
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,980
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

1461
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,660
You can stick right there...

1462
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,300
and you got
four thousand dollars.

1463
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,420
Mm-hmm.

1464
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,980
But you want another hit? OK.

1465
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,100
No, no!

1466
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,100
- What is that?
- Answer it, Jackson.

1467
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:43,140
I can't do that.
I'm playing blackjack.

1468
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,660
She might cheat
while I'm out of the room.

1469
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,420
All right.

1470
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,660
I'll answer the door.

1471
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,740
You play blackjack
with the hostage.

1472
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,940
You sure you want
to increase your bet...

1473
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,580
before you take another hit?

1474
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,340
No!

1475
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,540
No!

1476
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,300
OK.

1477
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,460
No!

1478
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,100
And...

1479
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,460
No!

1480
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,620
Aah!

1481
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,900
Well...

1482
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,780
There.

1483
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,820
It's just as well
we're not playing for real.

1484
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,340
Come on!

1485
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,900
All right, now cut her free.

1486
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,020
Aah!

1487
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,460
What the hell did you do to her?

1488
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,860
I punched her in the face.

1489
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,860
Oh! Ow!

1490
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,820
Oh, you punched her in the face.

1491
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:55,980
She's half your size,
and you punch her?

1492
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,980
- She had a gun!
- Oh, she had a gun?

1493
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,340
So that makes
everything all right, does it?

1494
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,380
I'm not saying
it makes everything all right.

1495
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,660
I'm just trying to explain
that for all I knew...

1496
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,900
she could have been
a karate expert or something.

1497
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,060
With a broken arm?

1498
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,820
With a broken arm?!

1499
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,940
OK. I'm sorry.

1500
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,820
Now just cut her free!

1501
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,580
You son of a bitch!

1502
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,860
- Celine?
- What do you want?

1503
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,900
I'm just trying to explain.

1504
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,020
Aah!

1505
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,860
Despite your crummy poem...

1506
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,300
I came to visit
and all you could do...

1507
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,460
was humiliate me
and turn me away.

1508
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,500
I thought you were decent.

1509
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,620
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

1510
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,060
You're just a lying, cheating
son of a bitch...

1511
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,380
just like all the rest!

1512
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,340
Celine,
I never meant to hurt you!

1513
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,780
I don't know
who wrote that poem...

1514
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,900
but I'll tell you,
those are my feelings.

1515
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,220
Oh, sure.

1516
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,860
Not so easy now, huh?

1517
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,540
Celine, Celine!

1518
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,140
When you left the diner
last night...

1519
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,980
I realized
I'd turned away the woman...

1520
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,380
whom I'd spent the happiest...

1521
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,340
most exciting times
of my life with...

1522
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,060
who I care for
more than anyone on the earth!

1523
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,500
Listen, listen!

1524
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,060
Do you remember
that dream I had?

1525
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,940
I dreamed that my life
was in danger...

1526
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,340
that my heart stopped.

1527
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,980
But you saved my life...

1528
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,860
when you pierced my heart
with an arrow of your love.

1529
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,860
And that's the truth.

1530
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:30,460
Celine, what I'm saying
is that I love you.

1531
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,700
What? What did you say?

1532
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,420
What I was trying to say
was that I...

1533
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,460
Oh, shit.

1534
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,140
What?

1535
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,180
Who is that?

1536
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,780
Don't worry, Miss Celine.

1537
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:47,060
Everything's going to be
just fine.

1538
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,740
Aah!

1539
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:13,820
Well, we're not just gonna
leave them here, are we?

1540
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,340
No, sir.

1541
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,580
Come in.

1542
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,780
Yes, there is a

1543
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,380
Deeper river

1544
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:43,580
That will bring you

1545
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,820
Home again

1546
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,660
Oh, there is a

1547
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:54,780
Deeper river

1548
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,940
Flowing under

1549
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,060
I don't think
they're coming back.

1550
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,260
Isn't there anything you can do?

1551
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,020
I don't have the authority
to intervene.

1552
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,580
Deeper river

1553
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,540
I don't have the authority
to intervene!

1554
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,620
That will bring you

1555
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,380
Home again

1556
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,300
Let me out of this trunk now!

1557
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,460
Robert, he's gonna kill you!

1558
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,580
Just run.
He doesn't want the money, OK?

1559
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,380
He's gonna kill you!

1560
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,060
Just run, Robert, run!

1561
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,500
It's probably
in the canoe, Mr. Naville.

1562
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,660
That's probably where it is.

1563
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,900
It's not in the canoe, sir...

1564
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:43,260
but I think it's, uh, upstairs.

1565
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,420
I think it's upstairs.
Might've put it there.

1566
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,660
They probably left it
under the bed.

1567
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,980
That would be a good place.

1568
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,340
Tsk tsk tsk.

1569
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,980
I don't think he has it...

1570
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,100
Mr. Naville.

1571
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,380
No. I...

1572
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,900
that's it!

1573
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,620
That's where it is!

1574
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,820
That's where it was.

1575
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,780
I put it under that board.

1576
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:06,380
I'll have your money back to you
in a minute, Mr. Naville, sir.

1577
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,100
Board up, and then
we'll get it back to you.

1578
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:13,780
We're just gonna have
to face the truth, Robert.

1579
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,620
You don't have my money.

1580
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,420
Yeah, it's down here,
all right, Mr. Naville, sir.

1581
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,620
Just where I left it.

1582
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,620
And frankly, I don't care.

1583
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,260
It's just a detail.

1584
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,780
You'll have your money
back in a second, sir.

1585
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,540
Long as you understand
that it isn't the money.

1586
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,860
It's the principle.

1587
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,420
Somebody please
just let me out of here!

1588
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,980
Mayhew, not with the ax.

1589
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,420
This is Gabriel.

1590
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,580
Get me God.

1591
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,660
Let's go. Come on!

1592
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,900
Come on, come on!

1593
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,780
Robert, what happened was
you shot them, and then you...

1594
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:07,100
Did he just move?

1595
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,660
No, sir.

1596
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:12,020
In all respect, sir, how could
anything be beyond your control?

1597
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,340
Anyway, you shot them...

1598
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,420
then you shot...

1599
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,660
You sure he didn't move?

1600
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,780
I'm quite sure, sir.

1601
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,260
Yes, sir.

1602
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,620
No, sir.

1603
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:34,900
Sir?

1604
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,020
Please.

1605
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,180
Yeah, quite.

1606
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,380
Yeah, right.

1607
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,460
Mayhew, she's moved.

1608
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,260
She's moved.

1609
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,820
I saw it with my own eyes.

1610
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,100
Yes, sir.

1611
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,540
Thank you, sir.

1612
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,380
They are both dead, sir.

1613
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,180
I shot them myself.

1614
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,780
I won't disturb you again.

1615
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,380
Yahoo!

1616
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,060
Who's that?

1617
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,780
Robert?

1618
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,020
You shot them...

1619
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,900
and then you shot yourself,
and then...

1620
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,740
you set fire to this cabin.

1621
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,860
Didn't you?

1622
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:20,820
Not yet, he didn't.

1623
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,860
Celine.

1624
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,380
Why...

1625
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:30,980
Why don't you just
put that gun down, hmm?

1626
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:33,020
Do not get in my way, father.

1627
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,980
Celine...

1628
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,220
you're not responsible
for your actions.

1629
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,340
You're unhinged.

1630
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,020
You need the best
psychiatric treatment...

1631
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,340
that money can buy...

1632
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,820
just like your mother.

1633
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,260
So why don't you just...

1634
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,500
Why don't you just
give me the gun?

1635
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:59,820
Because as he dreamt...

1636
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:03,540
I shall save his life
with an arrow...

1637
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,060
an arrow of my love for him.

1638
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,420
Kill him, Mayhew.

1639
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,100
Ezekiel!

1640
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,380
He's alive, Mayhew.

1641
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,260
They're all alive.

1642
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,660
If I were your woman

1643
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:10,860
And you were my man

1644
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,260
You'd have no other woman

1645
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:17,060
You'd be weak as a lamb

1646
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,820
If you had the strength

1647
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,940
To walk out that door

1648
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,900
My love would overrule my sense

1649
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,020
And I'd call you back for more

1650
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,260
If I were your woman

1651
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,420
So you're telling me
that successful relationships...

1652
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,620
are made in heaven?

1653
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,380
Not founded
on the daily practicality...

1654
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,420
of two people being prepared...

1655
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,220
to tolerate the imperfections
of one another?

1656
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,940
It's not successful
relationships, Celine.

1657
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,300
It's love. And it comes from
a strange and wonderful place...

1658
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,820
that we don't know about.

1659
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,620
So you also reject the idea...

1660
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,540
that love is merely
an emotional adaptation...

1661
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,420
to a physical necessity?

1662
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,580
Completely.

1663
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,260
Are you serious?

1664
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,620
Fate intervenes
in people's lives.

1665
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,180
In ours, for instance.

1666
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,900
Fate brought us together.

1667
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,300
It kept us together.

1668
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,900
We were destined
for one another.

1669
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,540
Fate had a pretty strange way
of making its point.

1670
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,580
But that's
part of the beauty of it.

1671
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,820
It's inexplicable,
unpredictable...

1672
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,780
and absolutely beyond control
or understanding.

1673
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,820
But you nearly got killed.

1674
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,620
But I didn't...

1675
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,740
and here we are.

1676
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,460
Do you have any substantial
evidence to back all this?

1677
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,580
None at all.

1678
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:34,260
And you realize
that it's absurd and irrational?

1679
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,740
I know that.

1680
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:38,140
Then why do you believe it?

1681
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,700
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.

1682
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:46,140
Well, I guess
that makes two of us.

1683
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,380
Are you ready?

1684
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,540
As I'll ever be.

1685
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:54,980
Then let's go.

1686
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,700
But I'm too afraid to show it

1687
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,300
If I were your woman

1688
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:01,580
If you were my woman

1689
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:03,420
If I were your woman

1690
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,700
If you were my woman

1691
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,180
If I were your woman

1692
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,220
If you were my woman

1693
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,740
Never, no, no, no

1694
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,860
Stop loving you

1695
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,860
Oh, yeah

1696
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:23,260
If I were your woman

1697
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:27,020
Do you know what I'd do?

1698
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:31,100
I'd never, never, never
stop loving you

1699
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,420
If I were your woman

1700
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,140
Your sweet loving woman

1701
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,660
If you were my woman

1702
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,420
If I were your woman

1703
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,860
If you were my woman

1704
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,500
I'd be your only woman

1705
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,660
If you were my woman

1706
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:46,180
If I were your woman

1707
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,660
If you were my woman

1708
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,060
You'd need no other woman

1709
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,260
You'd need no other woman

1710
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,020
All clear.

1711
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:11,300
So, how was it?

1712
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:13,100
Believe me, Gabriel.

1713
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,780
You don't want to know.

1714
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,580
- But it worked.
- Yeah.

1715
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,540
Love...

1716
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,620
worked.

1717
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:25,820
Ameratus pathum laborium.

1718
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,780
Are we going home now?

1719
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,940
We're going home.

1720
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,740
At last.

1721
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,900
Ohh!

1722
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:02,900
The paper boy
is looking before he goes

1723
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,100
Lying to the teacher
who knows he knows

1724
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,340
He didn't, and he should've
brought his lines in yesterday

1725
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,180
Ernie bangs the sound
as the day begins

1726
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,220
The letterbox is open,
and your cash falls in

1727
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,740
Aah!

1728
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:24,300
I'll meet you at the office
just before the staff clock in

1729
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,860
Round our way

1730
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,820
The birds are singing

1731
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,940
Round our way

1732
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,220
The sun shines bright

1733
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,140
Aah!

1734
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,180
Round our way

1735
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,780
The birds sing for you

1736
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:48,740
'Cause they already know you

1737
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,020
Yeah, they already know you

1738
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,740
The game is kicking off
in around the park

1739
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,740
It's twenty-five a side,
and before it's dark

1740
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,260
There's gonna be a loser

1741
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,460
And you know the next goal wins

1742
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,460
Cab it to the front

1743
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,580
As it's called a draw

1744
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,660
Everybody's knocking
at yours once more

1745
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,660
Ernie bangs the sound

1746
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:27,220
And no one's spoken
since half past four

1747
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,020
La la la la la la la

1748
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,420
Round our way
the birds are singing

1749
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:41,780
Round our way
the sun shines bright

1750
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:48,500
Round our way
the birds sing for you

1751
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,860
'Cause they already know you

1752
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:56,660
Yeah, they already know you

1753
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,460
On the highway

1754
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,060
Unpaved

1755
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,740
Going my way

1756
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,020
You're so alone today

1757
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,940
Like a ghost town

1758
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,020
I found there's no relief

1759
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,180
No soul to mercy

1760
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,460
Is it true what they say?

1761
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,380
You can't behave

1762
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,300
You gamble your soul away

1763
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,700
Measuring your dreams

1764
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,500
Oh, this life seems

1765
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,020
Like the gristle of loneliness

1766
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,900
Do do do do

1767
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:36,860
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1768
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,700
Do do do do do

1769
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:45,100
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1770
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,500
Like an ice age

1771
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,540
Nice days on your way

1772
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:06,220
Sipping the golden dregs

1773
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,860
On a riptide

1774
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,300
Freaks ride

1775
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,940
Sleep inside

1776
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:13,820
A parasite's appetite

1777
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,580
Oh, say, can't you see

1778
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,260
The chemistry?

1779
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,260
The parasites, the cleanup fee

1780
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,700
Death metal hands

1781
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,660
Recycled cans

1782
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:30,700
Get well cards
to the hostage vans

1783
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:36,140
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1784
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,700
Do do do do do

1785
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:43,980
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

1786
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,780
I got a magical ray

1787
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,900
That reads you
like a book, yeah

1788
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:55,540
You got a mystic pen
that sends me the message

1789
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,100
Tests of my strength

1790
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,900
Are pretty much all I know

1791
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:03,620
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

1792
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:07,700
Climbing

1793
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:10,980
Climbing

1794
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,540
Somewhere

1795
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,820
Somewhere

1796
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,820
And I have no fear

1797
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,660
I have no fear

1798
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:31,020
'Cause love is here

1799
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:35,300
Love is here

1800
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:39,420
Love is here

1801
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,260
Love is here

1802
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,500
Love is...

1803
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,500
Did you know
that I'm looking at you now

1804
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:48,740
With a daisy in my hair

1805
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,940
Roses in my hand

1806
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,620
And broken rhythms in disrepair

1807
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,740
I hear

1808
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,260
A danger in the air

1809
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,260
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

1810
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:03,820
Climbing

1811
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,700
Climbing

1812
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,340
Somewhere

1813
01:39:15,341 --> 01:39:16,341
