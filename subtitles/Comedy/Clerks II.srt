(flames crackling)

7
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,281
Yeah, I got a fire
at the Quick Stop.

8
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,531
Yeah.

Terrorists?

14
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,569
I left the coffee pot
on again, didn't I?

15
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,855
Shit!

16
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,778
Now where am I gonna
bring chicks to fuck

17
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,299
when my mom's home?

18

# So beautiful... #

26
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,550
So, ready for your big last day?

27
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,663
I am.

28
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,394
When do you and your old lady
head down to Florida?

29
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,544
Tomorrow morning.

30
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:07,663
Car's all packed up.

31
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:08,630
You gonna do anything crazy

32
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,671
before you leave
New Jersey forever?

33
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,638
How long have you known me?

34
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,264
If I were you,
I'd spray-paint "eat pussy"

35
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,506
across the side of the building
in huge letters.

36
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,266
Why?

37
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:18,960
Let 'em know
you were there, man.

38
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,621
I'd rather let them know
I'm not an asshole.

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,090
Too late for that.

40
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,752
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,934
# Hey #

42
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,500
# Once there were parking lots #

43
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,828
# Now it's a peaceful oasis #

44
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,837
# You've got it, you've got it #

45
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,372
# This was a Pizza Hut #

46
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:39,504
# Now it's all covered
with daisies #

47

# I miss the honky-tonks,
Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens #

49

# You've got it, you've got it #

50
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,515
# And as things fell apart #

51
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,322
# Nobody paid much attention #

52
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:56,395
# You've got it, you've got it #

53
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,049
# Years ago #

54
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,594
# I was an angry young man... #

55
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,520
I can't believe they haven't
done anything with it yet.

56
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:15,625
The Lord did
something with it.

57
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,033
He smited that hellhole.

58
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,276
Listen to you.

59
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,239
Do you mean to tell me

60
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:21,712
you don't miss
that place at all?

61
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,305
(scoffs):
God, no.

62
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,101
Do you?

63
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,232
Of course not.

64
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:32,712
# I wish I had a lawnmower #

# #

# I dream of cherry pies #

# Candy bars
and chocolate chip cookies #

# You've got it, you've got it #

72
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:49,218
# Don't leave me stranded here #

73
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:53,731
# I can't get used
to this lifestyle. #

76
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,325
# Grandma, what was it like #

77
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:11,013
# To be on that holiday site? #

78
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,904
Get the fuck out of here!

79

# Grandma said, "Do come in,
my little friend." #

80
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,008
You know, sometimes I wish
I did a little more with my life

81
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:22,049
instead of hanging out in front
of places selling weed and shit.

82
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,730
Like, maybe be an animal doctor.

83
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,174
Why not me?

84
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:29,444
I like seals and shit.

85
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,774
Or maybe an astronaut.

86
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,464
Yeah.

87
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:37,186
Like, be the first motherfucker
to see a new galaxy

88
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:41,446
or find
a new alien life-form...

89
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,821
and fuck it.

90
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:46,912
And people'd be like,
"There he goes.

91
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,527
Homeboy fucked a Martian once."

92
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,539
Holy shit.

93
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,141
Our first customer
since our triumphant return.

94
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,109
Act cool.

95
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,181
Hold on.

96
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:01,667
Yeah, you guys holdir?

97
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,416
Shit, everything but coke,
heroin and your cock.

98
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,110
What?

99
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,358
How about a nickel bag, man?

100
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,784
(sing-songy):
Oh, 15 bucks, little man.

101
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,684
Put that shit in my hand.

102

104
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,619
So, uh, I haven't seen
you guys in a while, man.

105
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,707
Where you been all this time?

106
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,503
Me and Silent Bob
finally bought a car,

107
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,946
we're cruising down
to the Boardwalk...

108
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,670
fucking Middletown cop
pulls us over

109
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,234
for Suspicion of Mischief.

110
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,487
What the fuck does that mean?

111
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:34,424
We were driving around
with a deployed airbag.

112
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,841
The cops pull us over.

113
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,012
They find two pounds
of Jamaican lambswool.

114
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,838
Prosecutor wants
to put us away for a dime,

115
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:42,044
but the judge gives us
rehab instead.

116
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,008
Shit, rehab?

117
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,739
Yup-yup.

118
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:44,824
How long were you in?

119
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,793
JAY:
Six months, sir.

120
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,680
We got six months
and two days on the wagon

121
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,240
as a good friend of Bill W.'s.

122
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:51,169
Check it out.

123
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,087
Just got it two days ago,
before we got out.

124
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:54,679
Yeah, but if you're holding
all the time,

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,925
aren't you gonna be tempted
to get high?

126
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,221
Oh, not with the power
of Christ on my side, sir.

127
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:03,326
Is that a fuckir Bible?

128
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,727
Hey, hey,
the Holy fuckir Bible, son!

129
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,866
What the fuck kind
of songbird Jesus-freak dealer

130
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,148
did you bring me to?

131
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,071
(laughs): I like them, man.
They're funny.

132
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,794
They're fuckir stupid.

133
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:14,109
You should read your Bible,
sirs.

134
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,011
You'll find all types
of weird shit in there.

135
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:19,323
Like, did you know
Jesus was a Jew?

136
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,846
Yeah.

137
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,308
(chuckles)

138
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,161
I need two Egga-Mooby Muffins,

139
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,407
and we're almost out
of hash browns.

140
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:29,492
Hold on.

141
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:31,892
Now, Randal!

142
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,788
(chuckling)

143
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,506
What are you writing
over there, anyway,

144
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,477
your memoirs?

145
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:41,785
I'm battling

146
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,091
this jackass
on his blog's message board.

147
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,072
About what?

148
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:47,418
On how he's got
too much free time and no life.

149
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,209
So does the guy who's
flaming him on his Web site.

150
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,133
I can't help it.
The guy pisses me off.

151
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,507
It's this fuck in a wheelchair

152
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,297
that's always preying
on everyone's sympathies,

153
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:57,429
writing these long diatribes
about how he'll never walk again

154
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,670
and how walkers should
appreciate the blessings

155
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,397
of their functioning legs.

156
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:02,546
That diatribe, as you call it,

157
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:03,667
sounds like
some poor crippled guy

158
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,300
pouring out his heart
and feelings.

159
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,550
Oh, fuck him, man.

160
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,147
Trying to guilt me
into walking around more

161
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,748
because he's all gimped out?

162
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:11,380
What kind of mind-fuck
is that shit?

163
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,042
So I've been getting
into it with him,

164
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:15,896
throwing it back
in his stupid crippy-boy face

165
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,425
about how I love
to just sit around

166
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:20,728
and how I'd rather drive to
the end of the block than walk.

167
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,388
The guy's in a wheelchair.

168
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,182
Yeah. That's why
I called him crippy-boy.

169
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,680
Have a good one.

170
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:28,057
You fuckir freak.

171
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,576
(door buzzer moos)

172
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:33,138
I'm not even gonna point out
the irony here.

173
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:34,584
What's the matter with you?

174
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:35,697
What'd I do now?

175
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:36,817
There's a crippled guy
who found a way

176
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,896
to reach out to a world
he feels isolated from,

177
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,977
and you somehow found a
way to take issue with him.

178
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:42,576
Sure, take his side.

179
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,696
Have you become so embittered

180
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:46,255
that you now feel the need
to attack the handicapped?

181
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:47,375
What handicap?

182
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:48,823
The guy's
just in a wheelchair.

183
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:51,059
It's not like
he's Anne Frank or something.

184
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:52,656
Anne Frank?

185
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,583
Yeah, Anne Frank,
the chick that was all...

186
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:55,543
(moaning)

187
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,137
...till the miracle worker
showed up

188
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,768
and knocked
some smarts into her.

189
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,735
(snickers):
You're talking

190
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,011
about Helen Keller.

191
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,291
No, I'm not.
I'm talking about Anne Frank.

192
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,406
She was deaf, dumb and blind.

193
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,374
No, she wasrt.

194
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,447
Helen Keller was
deaf, dumb and blind.

195
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,567
Are you sure?

196
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,686
Yup.

197
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,766
Then who the fuck's Anne Frank?

198
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:12,213
Anne Frank's
the little Jewish girl

199
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,654
who hid from the Nazis

200
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,245
in a secret room
with her family.

201
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,214
She wrote a diary.

202
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:17,228
Oh, yeah.

203
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,244
Well, then, I guess
this guy is like Anne Frank,

204
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,653
what with the diary, you know?

205
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:25,481
No, he's like Helen Keller
with the handicap, you jerk!

206
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,452
(computer beeping)

207
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:27,979
You always got to be right,
don't you?

208
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:29,744
You Nazi douche bag.

209
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,341
What? What do you want?

210
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,227
No, we don't serve Cow Tippers
in the morning.

211
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,226
Freedom Toast is a possibility.

212
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,898
# #

213
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,843
Oh, we totally do.

214
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:55,731
(scoffs)

215
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,226
All right, that'll be $12.64.

216
00:10:57,268 --> 00:11:00,169
(door moos electronically)

217
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,157
(gasps)

218
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,024
(sighs)

219
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,429
Avert your eyes, you perv.

220
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,539
That's not very hygienic.

221
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,366
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

222
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,596
(door moos electronically)

223
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:24,712
Emma, are you like this

224
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,728
'cause you have an
unnaturally large clit?

225
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,557
(sighs)

226
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,798
You just had to tell him,
didn't you?

227
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,076
It kind of came out one day.

228
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:33,159
He says it's so big,

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,312
it's almost like
a little cock...

230
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,393
which says all kinds
of weird things about him

231
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,894
that I don't even want
to think about.

232
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:38,950
You wouldn't want
to be with a girl

233
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,136
with an oversized clit?

234
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,372
No, 'cause the next stop is
a guy with an undersized dick.

235
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:50,824
(door moos electronically)

236
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,579
# #

237
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,571
You're a little hard.

238
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,881
'Cause you're
a little close to me.

239
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,291
I can pull back, if you want.

240
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:12,292
Can we pull back into our
own apartment in Florida again?

241
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,155
Really? Goddamn it, Dante.

242
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,268
How many times
are we gonna have

243
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,968
this fucking conversation?

244
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:19,525
There is no point
in getting an apartment anymore.

245
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,125
My mother has
pretty much told us

246
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:23,051
that she's gonna get us
a house as a wedding gift.

247
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:24,491
Your parents' generosity

248
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,629
just makes me
a little uncomfortable, Em.

249
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,097
They're giving us a house.

250
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,506
Your dad's giving me
one of his car washes to run.

251
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,784
It just feels weird.

252
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,568
Babe, it just feels weird
because you're so used

253
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,391
to life shitting
on you all the time.

254
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,336
What the fuck does that mean?

255
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:40,003
All I'm saying is that suddenly,

256
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,601
you have a woman that loves you,

257
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,497
a new job opportunity

258
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,213
and a fantastic life
to look forward to, right?

259
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,861
You got to face it, tiger:
You hit the jackpot.

260
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,277
RANDAL:
What's up?

261
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,216
Something wrong?

262
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,186
RANDAL:
Nope.

263
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,646
Just saw you guys talking.

264
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,184
Thought I'd come out here
and join you.

265
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:06,153
God, it must be
nice to have a job

266
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,680
with so much downtime.

267
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,246
Downtime's important.

268
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,231
If I had to deal with all
the fucking mouth-breathers

269
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,702
nonstop, without a break,

270
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,151
I'd put my head
in the deep fryer.

271
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,412
Balls, too.

272
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,374
Do you really want

273
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,446
to sit here and watch me
and my fiance make out?

274
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:22,080
- Are you that much of a loser?
- Not really.

275
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,907
I was actually gonna ask
you two to knock it off

276
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,536
while I was out here.

277
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:26,785
I don't fucking understand
why you can't be happy

278
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,231
for your best friend.

279
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,019
He finally found a woman
who loves him.

280
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:30,982
(titters)

281
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:32,542
Like you even register
as a chick to me.

282
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,176
You might as well be a dude.

283
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,589
Really?

284
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,377
Yeah. You're
my best friend's girlfriend.

285
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:39,267
You became
persona non-nookie to me

286
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:41,636
the moment he started diddling
your pooter.

287
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,132
So thinking of me
in terms of being a girl

288
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,483
kind of creeps you out,
does it?

289
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,907
Sweetheart, I don't think
of you in terms of being a girl.

290
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,667
I don't think of you
in any way...

291
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,930
Oh, that was just wrong.

292
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,306
If you don't get
the fuck out of here

293
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,546
so that I can spend
some quality time with my man,

294
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,370
next, I'm gonna show you
my pooter.

295
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,740
Why would you want
to do something like that?

296
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:03,161
All right, all right,
I'm leaving!

297
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:04,152
Jesus!

298
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,311
What'd you do that for?

299
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,202
You realize he just
thinks you're trying

300
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:13,211
to get him into a three-way
with us now, don't you?

301
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,943
EMMA: Yeah, right.
With Graves?

302
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,433
That mars a total fucking
Lloyd, like most Jersey guys.

303
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:18,587
Hey!

304
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,482
You talk tough, but when
we're crossing the state line,

305
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,921
I bet you get all sentimental
for Jersey

306
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,362
and squirt a few tears.

307
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,824
Yeah, tears of joy, maybe.

308
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:25,850
Jersey sucks,

309
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,232
and we are surrounded by morons.

310
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,437
On that note, I'm gonna go.

311
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're leaving?

312
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,605
EMMA:
Yeah, I've got
a ton of stuff to do

313
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,300
before we leave in the morning,
but I love you.

314
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,639
I love you, too.

315
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,429
(whispering):
Bye.

316
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,357
Dude, I'm pretty sure
your old lady wants

317
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:50,326
to get you and me together
in a three-way.

318
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:55,034
(whistling lackadaisically)

319
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,353
(whistling continues)

320
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,117
(scoffs)

321
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,117
(whistling continues)

322
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,199
(door moos electronically)

323
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,167
Ow.

324
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,444
Dude, how old are you?

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,723
(laughs)

326
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,647
You know I'm 19, Randal.

327
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,200
You wouldn't work for me
last week, remember?

328
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,442
'Cause you said working
on my birthday

329
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,518
would help me build character.

330
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,963
(sighs)

331
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,364
Well, at least you spelled
"cock" right this time.

332
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,285
Why the fuck are you
still getting rides

333
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,878
from your mother?

334
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:34,997
And even worse,

335
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,924
what the fuck are you
kissing her good-bye for?

336
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:38,998
What is she,
your fuckir prom date?

337
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,597
You're not gonna bother me
today, Randal.

338
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:41,717
I'm in too good a mood.

339
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,644
Because your mom
slipped you the tongue?

340
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,800
No, because I just read online
that there's gonna be

341
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:49,812
a live-action
Transformers movie.

342
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:50,932
And?

343
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:53,492
Well... I mean, as you know,

344
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,420
my online handle
is Optimus Prime.

345
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,339
I know that.
I wish I didn't.

346
00:15:57,371 --> 00:16:00,688
Well, so not only is it awesome

347
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,895
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,

348
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,932
but I'm, like,
positioned or whatever

349
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:11,574
with the best possible
Net handle and e-mail address

350
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,170
for when the movie comes out.

351
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,209
Oh, you're gonna be rolling
in the pussy, man.

352
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,876
Don't be gross.

353
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,255
Says the guy
who was just playing

354
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,113
tonsil hockey with his mother.

355
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,389
Mr. Dante!

356
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,654
Leave Elias alone, Randal!

357
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:29,013
Don't look at his wee-wee.

358
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,988
Dude, the Transformers sucked.

359
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,170
Oh, no, they didn't.

360
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,518
They were more
than meets the eye.

361
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:35,731
(scoffs)

362
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,656
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

363
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,665
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right

364
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:41,077
- about that or not.
- Ow.

365
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:43,414
I thought you werert even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

366
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,172
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.

367
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,379
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks

368
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,107
that turn into...

369
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:53,006
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,

370
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,934
because my pastor says

371
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,552
that machines can turn
into other machines,

372
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:00,208
and it's not a sleight
against God.

373
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:01,871
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,

374
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:04,462
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son

375
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,924
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,

376
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,111
and all we did to pay him back

377
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,150
was make terrible fucking
can'toons like the Transformers.

378
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,873
Nice shot.

379
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,513
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

380
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,794
I mean, I don't know,

381
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,829
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...

382
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,917
Well, okay...

383
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,168
Bible camp?!

384
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,153
Since God created...

385
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:29,262
Since God created man,

386
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,463
and man created
the Transformers...

387
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:36,426
...the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

388
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:39,150
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.

389
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,293
They are an unoly curse

390
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,185
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.

391
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,594
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.

392
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,088
The first of the fallen,

393
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,407
the spoiler of virgins,

394
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,581
the master of abortions!

395
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,309
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

396
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:52,721
(in high-pitched voice):
# Let me help you #

397
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,511
# Out of your chair, Grandma! #

398
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,718
# Grandma, what was it like #

399
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:59,754
# To be on that holiday site? #

400
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,215
# Late that night,
I awoke from my sleep #

401
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,714
# Hearing unknown voices #

402
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:05,898
JAY/RANDAL:
# Laughing insane... #

403
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:07,661
(screaming)

404
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,672
(gasps)

405
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,396
(groaning):
Oh...

406
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,362
# #

407
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,661
Oh, what the fuck was that?

408
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,624
What?

409
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:33,581
That wave.

410
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,338
I saw Becky, so I waved.

411
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,414
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.

412
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:38,383
And?

413
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,429
And you've got to greet her

414
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,674
before she gets in here,
you fuckir ass-kiss?

415
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:42,638
What's that all about?

416
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,047
It's called friendship.

417
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,006
She's your boss.

418
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,315
You can't be friends
with your boss.

419
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,238
No, you can't be friends
with your boss.

420
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,515
I like my boss.

421
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,437
I think there's
something going on

422
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:52,549
between you two.

423
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,518
You're crazy.

424
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,437
You spend an awful lot
of time talking to her.

425
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,674
I spend an awful lot of time
talking to you, too.

426
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,789
And I've always maintained

427
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,513
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

428
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:02,660
We're just friends.

429
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,109
That's what I keep telling you.

430
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,028
No, you idiot, me and Becks.

431
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,467
"Becks"?

432
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,428
I knew it.

433
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,827
You're fucking
around with the boss.

434
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,176
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancee.

435
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,301
Why would you want
to fuck around

436
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,866
with a chick your own age, man?

437
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,795
If you've got to sow
some of your wild oats,

438
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,422
there's all
these fine young chicks

439
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,085
that stop in here after school.

440
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:25,472
First off, I'm not cheating
on my fiancee.

441
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,971
Secondly, if I was cheating
on my fiancee,

442
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,833
it wouldn't be with a teenager.

443
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,848
Why not?

444
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:32,201
The best part of this job

445
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,601
is all the barely-legal pussy
that comes in here.

446
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:35,943
And they all look up to me,

447
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,637
'cause I've got
a driver's license.

448
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,227
It's awesome.
You're 33.

449
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,989
You show me one
33-year-old chick

450
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,369
who's as buck-wild in bed

451
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,061
as her 17-year-old
counterpart.

452
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,788
17-year-olds
nowadays are crazy.

453
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,167
They're up for anything.

454
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,405
They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.

455
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,599
Oh... my... God.

456
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,568
What?

457
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,648
Are you serious?

458
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:57,958
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.

459
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:59,422
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.

460
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,742
It's never my idea.

461
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,686
These young girls today
get all horned up,

462
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,451
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.

463
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:05,918
You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!

464
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,203
You sound like my mom.

465
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,669
Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?

466
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,085
You never go ass to mouth.

467
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,712
You've never gone ass to mouth?

468
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,126
You never go ass to mouth.

469
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,621
I've never gone ass to mouth.

470
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:15,808
Not even once?

471
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,190
Not even ever.

472
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:18,500
You're both so repressed.

473
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:19,551
All right, look,

474
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,502
I know you've given
a blow job, right?

475
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,431
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.

476
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:24,545
That's a yes.

477
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,654
And I know you've
gone down on chicks.

478
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:27,938
What's your point?

479
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:28,922
Well,

480
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:31,038
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts

481
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,571
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?

482
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,174
That's just like going
ass to mouth.

483
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:37,083
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.

484
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,304
(chuckles):
And?

485
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:41,092
Have you restocked
all the napkin holders yet?

486
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:43,012
That's an Elias job.

487
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,313
That comparison
of pink and brown eyes

488
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,942
just made it a Randal job.

489
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:47,994
ELIAS:
Zing!

490
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,043
Shut the fuck up, GoBot.

491
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,642
I could probably sue
this whole corporation right now

492
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,885
for sexual harassment.

493
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,997
You're just making me
restock the napkin holders

494
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,411
because of my firmly held
beliefs

495
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,331
on the subject of ass to mouth.

496
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,989
You never go ass to mouth!

497
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,264
Would you grow up?

498
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,738
(quietly): All right,
I'm gonna tell you this

499
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,461
'cause we're friends...

500
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:17,247
but sometimes,
in the heat of the moment,

501
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,617
it's forgivable
to go ass to mouth.

502
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:21,210
(Randal chuckles)

503
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,005
I knew it.

504
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,377
(disgusted groan)

505
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm fuckir bored, man!

506
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:33,558
And boredom's the first step
on the road to relapse.

507
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,024
("Goodbye Horses"playing)

508
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:49,656
Oh!

509
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,924
# #

510
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:01,117
Would you fuck me?

511
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:04,823
I'd fuck me.

512
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:08,278
I'd fuck me hard.

513
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:14,681
# Ooh, ooh... ooh, ooh... #

514
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:22,650
(long sigh)

515
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:28,882
("Goodbye Horses"plays
faintly from outside)

516
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:30,836
Shit.

517
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:34,107
Well, hello, Miss Scott.

518
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:37,435
Well, here he is,
the escape artist.

519
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,897
I'm not gone yet.

520
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,078
Please. You've been
gone for the last month.

521
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:42,359
When do you guys leave?

522
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,535
Well, we start driving
tomorrow morning.

523
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,394
Oh, uh, I left you
the forwarding address

524
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,250
for my last check
on the calendar there.

525
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,651
So you did.

526
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:53,204
That's her parents's house,
right?

527
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:56,788
Yes, but only until the wedding.

528
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,419
And then, from what I hear,

529
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,726
her parents
are giving us a house.

530
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,672
Nice!

531
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,919
So I guess dowries
are making a comeback.

532
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:06,002
Oh, yeah.

533
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,952
Her dad sweetened the pot
with two fatted calves

534
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,203
and a goat.
(laughs)

535
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,761
I'm gonna miss you, Hicks.

536
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,680
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

537
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:15,761
I still can't believe

538
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:18,291
you're just gonna leave
me alone in this place...

539
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,988
with Randal Graves,
of all people.

540
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,073
Quit.

541
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,127
Move to Florida.

542
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,762
You could work
at the car wash with me.

543
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,971
Wow, you make it
sound so tempting.

544
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,765
How can I say no?

545
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,767
Oh, yeah... 'cause it's a
fucking car wash in Florida.

546
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,401
Like it's any worse
than this place.

547
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,382
Hurl the insults
all you want, buddy man.

548
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,311
As soon as my uncle's
on his feet again,

549
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:38,253
it's not like I'm
gonna be staying here.

550
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,150
- Hey, how's he doing?
- A lot better.

551
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:42,158
It only took two years
and a shitload of chemo,

552
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,435
but... his red cell count's
almost back to normal.

553
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:45,648
That's great.

554
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,094
Yeah, it's great for me, too.

555
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,819
Couple of weeks
in this crap shack

556
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,441
turned into a couple of
years a little too quickly.

557
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,886
But, Hicks, we can sit here

558
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,926
making small talk
about your last day

559
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,171
and what it is I'm going
to do once you're gone,

560
00:23:57,206 --> 00:24:01,746
or we can treat this
like any other workday.

561
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:02,994
Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

562
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,341
(chuckling)

563
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,345
Randal.

564
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:19,306
One ring to rule them all.

565
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:23,146
And you wonder why no chick'll
let you stick your cock in her.

566
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:25,229
I never wondered that.

567
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,609
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted
the fact

568
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,532
that you'll never get a chick
a long time ago.

569
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:30,002
I could get a chick if I wanted.

570
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,411
(laughs):
Who are you kidding?

571
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,004
You can't get a chick, you mook.

572
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,385
You're too weird and sad.

573
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:40,720
I turn down chicks
left and right.

574
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:43,624
Your chicks are
your "left" and "right."

575
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,607
Yeah, right.
What do you know?

576
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,496
Uh, I know
you're a huge fuckir nerd

577
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,213
of Potsie-like proportions,
and no chicks dig nerds,

578
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,902
especially nerds that are
into Lord of the Rings.

579
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,366
(laughs quietly)

580
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:57,101
Chicks dig Lord of the Rings,
Randal.

581
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:58,250
Yeah. The kind of chicks

582
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,012
that are into swords
and elves and shit,

583
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,286
and I wouldn't fuck them
with the Torch of Gondor.

584
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:03,980
Oh, you're so gross!

585
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,023
(door moos electronically)

586
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,439
Hey, man.

587
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:15,628
Welcome to Mooby's.
May I take your order?

588
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,711
Yeah, um...

589
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:17,963
let's see.

590
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,935
Give me one Udderly
Delicious Moo-ilk Shake,

591
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:23,975
Skinny Calf and an order
of onion rings. Thanks.

592
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,634
(register beeping)

593
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:29,389
"One ring to rule them all."

594
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:30,852
(register beeping)

595
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,420
"One ring to find them."

596
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:33,673
Oh, Jesus.

597
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,751
"One ring to bring them all."

598
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,377
"And in the darkness bind them."

599
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,875
Yes! Dude!

600
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,195
How many times?

601
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:42,376
Well, um, three
for Fellowship,

602
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,339
two for Towers,

603
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,445
four for Return.

604
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:46,663
Five for Return.

605
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:47,629
Dude!

606
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:48,676
All right, look,

607
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,659
there's only one Return, okay,

608
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:53,352
and it ain't of the king...
it's of the Jedi.

609
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,179
Oh, Star Wars geek.

610
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:56,293
Oh, I'm the geek?

611
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,341
Look at you two,
whipping out your preciouses.

612
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,756
You'll have to excuse him.

613
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,511
He's not "down"
with the trilogy.

614
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:03,938
Oh, what the fuck happened
to this world?

615
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,257
There's only one trilogy,

616
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,950
you fucking morons.

617
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:08,418
You know what?

618
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,151
Maybe we should start
calling your friend Padme,

619
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:11,978
because he loves
Mannequin Skywalker

620
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:13,256
so much, right?

621
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:14,853
(robotic monotone):
"Danger, danger.

622
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,136
"My name is Anakin.

623
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:19,105
My shitty acting
is ruining saga."

624
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,350
(chuckles): Yeah.
Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.

625
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,564
Oh, I'm crazy?

626
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:25,090
Those fucking hobbit movies
were boring as hell.

627
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,334
All it was
was a bunch of people walking.

628
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:30,153
Three movies of people walking
to a fuckir volcano.

629
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:31,714
Here's the first movie.

630
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,659
And here's the second movie.

631
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,890
He is way off. Loser.

632
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:47,391
You ready for the third movie?

633
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:48,895
(sighs)

634
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,822
Fuckir A.

635
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,961
Even the fuckir trees walked
in those movies.

636
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,927
You know what?

637
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:03,104
I've had enough of you.

638
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:06,241
Your simplistic analysis
of the trilogy aside,

639
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,386
The Lord of the Rings
was a massive achievement that

640
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:09,438
even the Academy recognized

641
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,065
when they gave Peter Jackson
the Best Directing Oscar...

642
00:27:12,104 --> 00:27:15,452
an award your little friend
George "Toy Boy" Lucas has never

643
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,088
and will never win.

644
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:18,371
Bones.

645
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:19,521
Oh, sick burn.

646
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,867
Let me tell you something.

647
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,041
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away

648
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,892
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

649
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:27,333
on the logical closure point,

650
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:29,669
not the 25 endings
that followed.

651
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,109
What's the logical
closure point?

652
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,255
Yeah, friend,

653
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,572
enlighten us.

654
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:36,324
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

655
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,976
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

656
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,419
and Sam leans in the doorway

657
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,241
and gives him
that very fuckir gay look.

658
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,649
ELIAS:
Not the Rings, Randal.

659
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:45,114
Say what you will about Jesus,

660
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,814
but leave the Rings out of this.

661
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,154
I am gonna kick your ass
back to the Shire

662
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,465
if you don't
shut your fuckir mouth.

663
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,836
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

664
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,393
the little hobbits
to take a walk

665
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:55,963
so he could saunter
over to Frodo

666
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:57,247
and suck his fuckir cock.

667
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:59,803
Now, that would've been
an Academy Award-won'thy ending.

668
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:03,292
Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.

669
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:05,818
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

670
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,584
right before the credits roll,

671
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,140
Sam fucking flat-out bricks
in Frodo's mouth.

672
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,480
I swear...

673
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:13,659
Fuck you!

674
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,270
(laughs): I made fun of
Lord of the Rings so hard,

675
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:20,576
it made some super-geek puke
all over the counter.

676
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,072
Where do we keep
the mop and bucket

677
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,455
so I can have
Elias clean it up?

678
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,661
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.

679
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:28,992
We have cleaning products?

680
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:32,091
(light jazz playing
over radio)

681
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,233
Why does it smell so weird
in here?

682
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,647
Buh-bye.

683
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm on to you.

684
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,159
You know he's not
gonna make it here long

685
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,851
once you're not here to protect
him anymore, don't you?

686
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:48,158
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,

687
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,079
advocating ass to mouth.

688
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,861
I wasrt advocating it,
you big prude.

689
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,936
I just said it was fine
once in a while.

690
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,863
Like you wouldn't do it
if Emma told you to.

691
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:58,324
(scoffs):
Christ, no!

692
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:00,506
Oh, I thought love
knew no bounds.

693
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:03,932
Ew. That came off
kind of catty, didn't it?

694
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:05,824
A little daytime soapish, yeah.

695
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:06,934
I'm sorry.

696
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,567
I don't know why I said that.

697
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:10,231
I actually kind of like Emma.

698
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,285
So do I.

699
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:13,333
So that's why
you're getting married!

700
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:15,227
I can't wait until
you get engaged,

701
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:17,683
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.

702
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:19,995
You're going to be waiting
a long time, sir.

703
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,404
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

704
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:23,542
You're the cold-hearted
ice princess

705
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:25,436
that doesn't believe
in marriage.

706
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,574
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,

707
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:28,725
but, yes, I do think

708
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,066
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.

709
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,180
To be loved?

710
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,707
To fuck as much as possible...

711
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:38,326
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.

712
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:40,371
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies

713
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,973
and greeting cards
is just propaganda

714
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,501
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

715
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,905
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.

716
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:48,280
You're such a sappy girl.

717
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:50,322
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

718
00:29:50,362 --> 00:29:52,020
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?

719
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,303
In romantic love,

720
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,549
no.

721
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,627
Like, I love my parents.

722
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,155
I love my car.
I love you.

723
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,714
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,

724
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:04,437
"There's only one person
out there for me"?

725
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:07,059
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

726
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,438
Odds are there's always going

727
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,384
to be someone who's
a better match for you

728
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:12,051
than the person
you end up marrying.

729
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,203
So based on your theory,

730
00:30:13,242 --> 00:30:15,543
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

731
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:18,294
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.

732
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,703
Wait a second.

733
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,363
You don't think
I really love her?

734
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,472
(sighs):
I think...

735
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,585
you love what she represents.

736
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,966
Which is...?

737
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:29,105
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

738
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:30,574
the time of day
back in high school.

739
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,405
And years later,
after she's played the field

740
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,057
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

741
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:37,167
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...

742
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:38,418
Oh, my God,

743
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,146
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?

744
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:41,199
Unconventional!

745
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,416
Ah, nice backpedal.

746
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,081
Thank you.
(laughs)

747
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,712
It took her a few years

748
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:46,995
to finally figure out
that thing

749
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:49,005
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

750
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,322
but she has to learn on her own,

751
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:52,595
and that's that guys
that look like you

752
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:54,572
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always

753
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:56,075
try harder than the pretty boy.

754
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,769
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?

755
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,621
(laughs):
No, you're a catch... kind of.

756
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,923
And Emma's a catch, too.

757
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,866
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...

758
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,330
she'll make all your decisions
for you.

759
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,089
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible

760
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,914
at making decisions.

761
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,806
So my last day
is all about you telling me

762
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,494
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?

763
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:17,581
(laughs)

764
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,376
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop

765
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:20,906
for, like, a decade,

766
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,078
and you've been here
for a year almost,

767
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,537
and since day one at both jobs,

768
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,205
all you've ever said
is how you needed

769
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,552
to get out
and start your life.

770
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,726
And it wasrt until Emma walked
through the door and was,

771
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,290
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,

772
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:34,608
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

773
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,783
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"

774
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,890
that you actually went
and did something about it.

775
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:40,271
And I get it... it's...

776
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:43,208
she's your golden ticket, dude.

777
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,625
So, uh...

778
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:46,961
...what's that make you?

779
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:53,388
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

780
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:56,107
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.

781
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,280
(whispers):
That's me.

782
00:31:58,385 --> 00:31:59,813
(laughing)

783
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,509
DJ:
That's something for
the lovers out there.

784
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:08,585
J-RAM Radio.
Right around high noon...

785
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,788
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?

786
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:16,327
What is there to say?

787
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,155
Do you regret it?

788
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,850
Do you?

789
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:22,735
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.

790
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:24,459
Yeah, you regret it...
you werert the one

791
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:25,673
who got mayo in your cooch.

792
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,296
(both laughing)

793
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,998
What do you want me to say?

794
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,949
We were drunk, you know?

795
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,813
It just kind of happened.

796
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:43,049
You're just lucky

797
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:45,539
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

798
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:48,614
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

799
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,792
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.

800
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:02,986
Dude, your old lady's out here
looking for you.

801
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,068
(door creaks)

802
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:08,869
(whispers):
Yeah.

803
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:16,769
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.

804
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:29,153
That's my surprise?

805
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,654
No.

806
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:35,076
# Goodbye, horses... #

807
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:42,499
Hey.

808
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,343
Oh.

809
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:47,359
So, um...

810
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,887
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?

811
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,830
Because at CarsToBots. Com,

812
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:55,523
you can get an avatar

813
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:59,554
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.

814
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:00,999
Come on, man.

815
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,691
You know I only surf
Transformers sites

816
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:05,990
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

817
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:09,957
So what are you doing then?

818
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:13,285
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

819
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,366
Really?

820
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:17,756
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?

821
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:19,587
What?

822
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:22,273
Uh...

823
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,181
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.

824
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:29,826
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.

825
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:33,791
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?

826
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,520
A donkey show.

827
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,572
What's that?

828
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,947
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?

829
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,639
(screeching):
Oh, no...!

830
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,652
Shh...!

831
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,001
Jesus!

832
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,338
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.

833
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:48,282
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

834
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:49,917
(muffled):
Yes.

835
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:50,882
God.

836
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,053
That's bestiality, Randal.

837
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,065
At its finest, I hope.

838
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:56,994
Who'd want to see
something like that?

839
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:59,394
Me, Dante, you.

840
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,954
I don't want to see
something like that.

841
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,783
Why would you want to see
something like that?

842
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,314
Because it's fucked up.

843
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,466
And I want to see

844
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,962
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

845
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,311
All right, here we go.

846
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:11,648
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

847
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:14,071
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,

848
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,938
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

849
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,337
Taking it in the ass, that is."

850
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:21,405
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

851
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:23,001
Do they show pictures?

852
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,758
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

853
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:26,721
Really?

854
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,279
Ow.

855
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,729
Let me borrow your cell phone.

856
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,709
Whoa.

857
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,577
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it

858
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,615
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.

859
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:35,737
This is an emergency.

860
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:37,532
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,

861
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,349
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.

862
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:43,066
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

863
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,313
In a non-gay way.

864
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,692
Then give me your phone.

865
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,735
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.

866
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:50,164
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

867
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,412
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

868
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:53,876
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing

869
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,642
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.

870
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,954
Hello.

871
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,924
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

872
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,818
Tonight.

873
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:03,415
Okay.

874
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,015
I'm on hold.

875
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:07,957
Fingers crossed.

876
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,260
We should probably
cross dicks, too.

877
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,221
No.

878
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,163
BECKY:
Work, work, work.

879
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,865
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.

880
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:16,698
Hey, Becks.

881
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:18,390
Hey, Emma.

882
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,397
Great shirt.

883
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:22,812
Isn't it?
I love it.

884
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:25,048
What I love even more are these.

885
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,032
These came in early,

886
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,149
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.

887
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,943
And give you yours, of course.

888
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,282
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.

889
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,975
What is it?

890
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:35,354
Look, I know it's
three months away,

891
00:36:35,388 --> 00:36:38,104
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

892
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,507
Well... yeah.

893
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:43,194
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

894
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:45,399
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

895
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,679
before we picked a date.

896
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:48,503
Oh, him is so cute.

897
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,881
Him thinking again, huh?

898
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:52,789
If we left anything
up to these jackals,

899
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:54,453
nothing would ever
get done, would it?

900
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:57,615
I'm just teasing.

901
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,439
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

902
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:12,784
All right, I've got it.

903
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:13,773
I will see you then.

904
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,308
Thank you.

905
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,075
My friend, tonight,

906
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,534
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.

907
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:20,853
(door moos electronically)

908
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,383
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.

909
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,334
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?

910
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,229
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?

911
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:27,638
Strangely, no.

912
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:30,128
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

913
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,238
you've seen them all.

914
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:33,871
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics

915
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:35,570
of anything like that?

916
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,713
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.

917
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,857
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

918
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:42,229
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

919
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,173
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?

920
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:54,028
Ho-ly shit.

921
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,549
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

922
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,996
You're a virgin, aren't you?

923
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,753
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.

924
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,651
Oh, yeah.

925
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:02,830
What's her name again?

926
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,756
Myra Hodgkiss.

927
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:06,480
You made her up, didn't you?

928
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,143
That name sounds so made-up.

929
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:10,547
No.

930
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,817
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?

931
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:15,122
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.

932
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:16,105
Come on!

933
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:18,482
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.

934
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:19,759
I let you smell my fingers

935
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,389
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister

936
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:22,988
in the office
that one time, didn't I?

937
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:25,483
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.

938
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,226
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.

939
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,989
Maybe you're all about the cock.

940
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:33,166
No, no, I like the pussy.

941
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:34,249
So come on.

942
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,558
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?

943
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:39,277
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

944
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,428
but she can't.

945
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,873
Why?

946
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,423
Jesus, Elias, come on.

947
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,345
You got to start
trusting me more.

948
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,840
Because once Dante's gone,

949
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:50,407
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

950
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,154
No, I'm not.

951
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:56,265
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?

952
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:57,767
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

953
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,758
So come on.

954
00:38:58,801 --> 00:38:59,915
You got to start
trusting me more.

955
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:02,058
Open up and tell me shit.

956
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,644
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?

957
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,174
(sighs)

958
00:39:08,784 --> 00:39:12,361
Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.

959
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,342
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

960
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:18,311
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.

961
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,703
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

962
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,149
Duh.

963
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,623
You know
how every girl's parents

964
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:39,971
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

965
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:42,883
to keep them from having
premarital sex?

966
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,154
Sure.

967
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:49,418
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.

968
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:53,959
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

969
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:58,535
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,

970
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:00,677
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

971
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,954
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants

972
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:09,738
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday

973
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:12,553
before we can have sex.

974
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:15,074
And Myra told you this?

975
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:16,130
Boyfriends and girlfriends

976
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:18,626
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.

977
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,673
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.

978
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:23,650
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?

979
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,015
We would have already,
if it wasrt for Lister Fiend.

980
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,336
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?

981
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,222
Women.

982
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,128
I'll be right back.

983
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:43,808
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

984
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,894
Look who it is, Randal.

985
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,741
Randal Graves.

986
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,214
You work here, too?

987
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:52,224
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

988
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,191
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...

989
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:55,264
Pickle Fucker.

990
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:57,345
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.

991
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:58,626
Nothing's changed.

992
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,573
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,

993
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:01,760
when you two aren't fighting

994
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:04,449
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,

995
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,397
you can still muster up
enough energy

996
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,579
to make fun of other people.

997
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,686
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,

998
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,384
so we can make fun of you.

999
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:14,180
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position

1000
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:16,102
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.

1001
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:18,752
32 and you're
flipping burgers?

1002
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,698
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop

1003
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:22,716
for, what, like, ten years?

1004
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:25,824
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.

1005
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:28,223
Who's an Internet millionaire?

1006
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:30,018
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

1007
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,330
We went to high school together.

1008
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,608
A few years ago,

1009
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:34,979
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

1010
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:37,467
of merchandise
you can buy online.

1011
00:41:37,509 --> 00:41:39,843
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts. Com.

1012
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:42,048
Didrt that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

1013
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,513
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before

1014
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:46,426
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

1015
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:47,777
You see, freshman year,

1016
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,787
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

1017
00:41:49,828 --> 00:41:51,389
what they called initiations.

1018
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,672
They'd stuff us into lockers

1019
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,649
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.

1020
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,415
But Lance here
got the worst of it.

1021
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,393
The seniors yanked
down his pants,

1022
00:41:58,435 --> 00:41:59,897
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

1023
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,216
and made him walk ten feet.

1024
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,119
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

1025
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:09,115
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

1026
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,464
Ew...

1027
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,602
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.

1028
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,746
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged

1029
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,280
after only four bites.

1030
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:18,076
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world

1031
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:19,673
who still remembers that,
Graves.

1032
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:22,394
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...

1033
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:23,360
Pickle Fucker.

1034
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:24,571
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest

1035
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,748
in building
the ultimate fan site

1036
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:30,015
for both The Lord of the Rings
and The Transformers?

1037
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,990
Because I'd moderate it
for free.

1038
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,011
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

1039
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:36,633
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

1040
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:37,654
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1041
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,624
Don't insult the guy.

1042
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,525
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.

1043
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:44,025
Thank you!

1044
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:47,198
I keep telling them that.

1045
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,955
Here, here's my e-mail address.

1046
00:42:48,992 --> 00:42:51,892
Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.

1047
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:52,882
Cool.

1048
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:00,949
LANCE:
Okay, let's see.

1049
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,061
What do I want?

1050
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:06,899
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

1051
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:09,526
I'll get your order.

1052
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:16,339
Here you go.

1053
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:18,615
Well, that was fast.

1054
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:19,995
And fresh.

1055
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,938
Thanks. Come again.

1056
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:24,883
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

1057
00:43:24,957 --> 00:43:26,070
You know what?

1058
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:27,057
Take mine.

1059
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:30,201
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?

1060
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:33,265
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

1061
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,663
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!

1062
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,640
You know,
I don't eat fast food.

1063
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,960
It's not good for you.

1064
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:43,737
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

1065
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,843
well, I just had
to see it for myself.

1066
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,566
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.

1067
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:50,970
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know

1068
00:43:51,002 --> 00:43:54,036
that some things never change.

1069
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,377
Take care, clerks.

1070
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,213
(imitates gunshots)

1071
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,006
Ooh, sick burn.

1072
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,503
(chuckles)

1073
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:08,658
(door moos electronically)

1074
00:44:08,697 --> 00:44:10,388
Fuck this.

1075
00:44:10,425 --> 00:44:11,570
Let me borrow your car.

1076
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:12,622
You're supposed to be working.

1077
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,736
I got to get out of here
for a few minutes.

1078
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:16,083
Let me borrow your car.

1079
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,192
Elias, tell Becky
we'll be right back.

1080
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:20,118
(door moos electronically)

1081
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:22,870
(Elias shouting anxiously
in distance)

1082
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:24,814
Where we going?

1083
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,589
You know, this tastes like
piss and flies, don't it?

1084
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:38,733
Sure you want to do this?

1085
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:39,853
RANDAL:
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:41,903
This will make me feel better.

1087
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:50,480
# Raindrops keep falling
on my head #

1088
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:55,667
# And just like the guy who's
feet are too big for his bed #

1089
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:58,898
# Nothing seems to fit,
those #

1090
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:01,679
# Raindrops
are falling on my head #

1091
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:02,960
# They keep falling #

1092
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:09,226
# But there's one thing I know #

1093
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:12,781
# The blues
they send to meet me #

1094
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,820
# Wort defeat me #

1095
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:18,162
# It won't be long #

1096
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:22,537
# Till happiness
steps up to greet me #

1097
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:30,827
# Raindrops keep falling
on my head #

1098
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:35,690
# But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turning red #

1099
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,241
# Crying's not for me,
'cause #

1100
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,439
# I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complaining #

1101
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:48,207
# Because I'm free #

1102
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:51,437
# Nothing's worrying... #

1103
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:54,507
# Me. #

1104
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,550
DANTE:
Here's what I don't
understand about you.

1105
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:59,439
You have a license, you
can drive a grown-up car.

1106
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:00,846
But when you ride the go-can'ts,

1107
00:46:00,881 --> 00:46:03,019
you somehow feel
better about yourself.

1108
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:04,998
Look, it just centers me,
all right?

1109
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,461
Kind of the way jerking off
at work centers you.

1110
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,642
I only did it that one time.

1111
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,956
And it wasrt to center me.

1112
00:46:10,992 --> 00:46:12,552
Yeah, it was to come.

1113
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:14,959
Well, I don't know about you,
but coming centers me.

1114
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:16,398
Then why did we
have to leave work,

1115
00:46:16,432 --> 00:46:18,220
so we can ride the go-can'ts
to clear your head?

1116
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:20,360
Well, I don't want to jerk off
in the Mooby's bathroom.

1117
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:21,739
What if a customer comes in

1118
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:24,740
and my jerking off gets him
all sex nuts and retard strong?

1119
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:25,829
Suddenly, I'm fighting him off

1120
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,812
as he tries to jam
my dick in his mouth.

1121
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,676
The most likeliest of scenarios.

1122
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,823
(scoffs)

1123
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:34,211
Man, that shit Lance said
must have really bothered you.

1124
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:35,234
Oh, fuck him.

1125
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:36,684
He's an asshole.
He always was.

1126
00:46:37,773 --> 00:46:40,489
I'm sorry I let him bug me
even for a second.

1127
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:42,630
At least I got a go-can't trip
out of it.

1128
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:46,017
Why do the go-can'ts help?

1129
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,555
I don't know.

1130
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,118
They just remind me
of a better time in my life.

1131
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,043
Like when?

1132
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,107
Like when we were young and the
world was still in front of us.

1133
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,610
We're not that old.

1134
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:57,699
Yeah.

1135
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:59,017
But sometimes I get the feeling

1136
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:01,671
the world kind of left us behind
a long time ago.

1137
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:02,635
You know...

1138
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:05,057
you can do something about that.

1139
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,261
I told you, I don't want to jerk
off in the bathroom at work.

1140
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:11,048
No, I mean you can
get out of Mooby's, too,

1141
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:13,025
completely change
your situation in life.

1142
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:16,710
What'd be the point? Besides,
why do you give a shit?

1143
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:17,728
You're leaving.

1144
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,272
(door moos electronically)

1145
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:31,654
Thanks, you guys, thanks.

1146
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:32,617
Come on!

1147
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,078
Oh, I'm sorry.

1148
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,169
Was that a number two
you wanted?

1149
00:47:35,274 --> 00:47:36,735
Yeah, and bovine-size it.

1150
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:37,704
$13.84.

1151
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:39,710
I need two Surlies
and a Cow Tipper.

1152
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:40,681
I'm on it.

1153
00:47:40,713 --> 00:47:41,640
How we set for fries?

1154
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:43,079
I don't think
these look right.

1155
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:46,627
Jesus! Step away from the fryer
before you burn us all alive.

1156
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,768
It's not my fault
you abandoned your post!

1157
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:50,749
RANDAL:
Was it too much to ask
that you handle the fries?

1158
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,199
The machine does all the work.

1159
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:53,791
What's a machine
got to transform

1160
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:56,798
into some giant fucking robot
before you'll take it seriously?

1161
00:47:56,838 --> 00:47:57,886
Go home.

1162
00:47:57,928 --> 00:47:59,487
Will you just make
some fries already?

1163
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:00,955
Look, I don't have all night.

1164
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:01,927
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1165
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:03,618
They need to get
some Mexicans working in here.

1166
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:04,582
They'd be...
(imitates laser)

1167
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:05,541
They don't play around.

1168
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:08,705
I know it.
Mexican made me lose my job.

1169
00:48:08,743 --> 00:48:10,913
That motherfucker
put a roof up in 30 seconds.

1170
00:48:10,948 --> 00:48:12,193
Where the fuck did you guys go?

1171
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,342
You don't want to know.

1172
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:14,397
Well, I know it's
your last day and all,

1173
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:15,484
but while you're
still on the clock,

1174
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:17,280
can't you kind of pretend
like you still give a shit?

1175
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:18,266
RANDAL:
Don't blame this guy.

1176
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,285
Some cock stain that we went
to high school with

1177
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,179
showed up to remind us
that we're fucking failures,

1178
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:23,741
so I wanted to get out of here

1179
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:25,539
and blow off some steam,
if you must know.

1180
00:48:25,575 --> 00:48:27,394
Did he say "cock stain"?

1181
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,316
What the fuck is cock stain?

1182
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,104
I don't know... that's
some white freaky stuff.

1183
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,659
White boys get the white women
to do everything.

1184
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,010
You want to do a cock stain?

1185
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:37,019
Do you know how often
I've had people come in here

1186
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:38,205
that I went to school with?

1187
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:40,252
Fuck, I had to take
a fucking order off of a guy

1188
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,404
I blew after junior prom once.

1189
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:43,266
Yeah, I've waited on
your brother, too... h'noop!

1190
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,281
I can't believe you.

1191
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:45,793
The smartest of smart asses
got rattled

1192
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,169
by some fucking loser
coming in here

1193
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:48,674
giving you shit
about your McJob.

1194
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:49,951
Oh, fuck him, okay?

1195
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:52,059
Sooner or later,
I'll do something with myself

1196
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,310
and make my mark.

1197
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,446
But until then, whatever I do
is not a waste of time,

1198
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:57,913
it's all building
toward something.

1199
00:48:57,956 --> 00:49:00,507
How about you build towards
making some fuckir fries?

1200
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:01,494
They're coming!

1201
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,425
Remember, you saved.

1202
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,635
You don't use
that kind of language.

1203
00:49:04,674 --> 00:49:06,201
Ain't nobody
from my church in here.

1204
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:07,616
I don't mind people snickering

1205
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,341
at the stupid uniform
I've got to wear.

1206
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:10,907
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

1207
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,216
some self-righteous,
lucky turd come in here

1208
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,493
and treat me and Dante

1209
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,439
like we're a couple
of fucking porch monkeys.

1210
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:17,789
DANTE:
Randal!

1211
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:19,002
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. He...

1212
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,335
He didn't really just say
what I think he said.

1213
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:24,090
- What? Porch monkeys?
- Randal!

1214
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,502
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1215
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,424
I want my money back right now.

1216
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:28,601
Of course.
Um, you know what?

1217
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,916
Here, take this on us.

1218
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:31,128
Oh, no, no, no.

1219
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,182
I'm not eating something that

1220
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:34,263
was cooked by some
cracker-ass hate-monger.

1221
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:35,285
I will.

1222
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:36,734
Baby, you can't taste racism.

1223
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,590
What racism? Porch monkeys?!

1224
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:40,412
- You little mother...
- Calm down, champ.

1225
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:41,375
It ain't won'th it.

1226
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:42,389
You're lucky my husband doesn't

1227
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,668
jump across this counter
and knock your teeth in.

1228
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,906
- Why?
- Yeah, baby, why?

1229
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,404
I mean, ain't like
he called us porch monkeys.

1230
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:49,428
Hey, hey!

1231
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,267
Baby, stop hitting on me!

1232
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:51,415
See, the judge told you
about that.

1233
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:52,916
You got to stop
putting your hands on people.

1234
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,421
Here, take this.
This is your money.

1235
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:55,674
Please, take the food on us.

1236
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:56,637
- We're sorry.
- Oh, uh-uh.

1237
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,684
I'm gonna write
to the paper about this,

1238
00:49:57,726 --> 00:49:59,155
and all y'all getting
fired up in here.

1239
00:49:59,198 --> 00:50:00,244
Jesus!

1240
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:01,463
I'm gonna take the food.

1241
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:04,217
Thank you very much.

1242
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:07,768
Damn!

1243
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:08,731
Fuckir porch monkey...

1244
00:50:08,764 --> 00:50:10,325
Thanks. Come again.

1245
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:12,088
Don't leave me, baby!

1246
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,783
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

1247
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,098
What?! What's the big deal?

1248
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:17,500
Since when is it a crime
to say "porch monkey"?

1249
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:19,287
Oh, I don't know...
since forever!

1250
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:20,785
- Why?
- Because "porch monkey"

1251
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:22,584
is a racial slur
against black people.

1252
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,627
No, it's not. "Nigger" is.

1253
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,649
Randal!

1254
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:27,928
Did Randal just call
Mr. Dante a nigger?

1255
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:29,209
Shut up, Elias!

1256
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:31,415
I didn't just call
Dante a nigger.

1257
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:33,689
I just said that "nigger"
is a racial slur.

1258
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:34,967
So is "porch monkey"!

1259
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:36,377
Oh, it is not.

1260
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:39,956
Coon, spook, spade,
moolie, jiggaboo, nignug...

1261
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:41,008
those are racial slurs.

1262
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,227
"Porch monkey" is not.

1263
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:43,989
I am going to pretend
like this conversation

1264
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:45,433
didn't happen.

1265
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:46,775
Elias, go pick up
that fucking mess,

1266
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:48,337
and you are this close
to getting shit-canned!

1267
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,588
(scoffs)

1268
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,568
Fuckir shoot me now.

1269
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,267
(grunts angrily)

1270
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:54,452
What are you doing?!

1271
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,797
Are you trying to get fired?

1272
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,899
Since when did "porch monkey"
suddenly become a racial slur?

1273
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:01,325
When ignorant racists started
saying it 100 years ago.

1274
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:02,515
Oh, bullshit.

1275
00:51:02,554 --> 00:51:04,942
My grandmother used to call me
a porch monkey all the time

1276
00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:06,872
when I was a kid,
because I'd sit on the porch

1277
00:51:06,904 --> 00:51:07,919
and stare at my neighbors.

1278
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,888
DANTE:
Despite the fact

1279
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:10,545
that your grandmother
might have used it

1280
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:11,927
as a term
of endearment for you,

1281
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,422
it's still a racial slur.

1282
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:15,766
It'd be like your grandmother
calling you a little kike.

1283
00:51:15,832 --> 00:51:16,726
Oh, it is not.

1284
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,904
Plus, my grandmother had

1285
00:51:17,944 --> 00:51:20,562
nothing but the utmost respect
for the Jewish community.

1286
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,226
When I was a kid,
she told me to always treat

1287
00:51:22,264 --> 00:51:25,078
the Jewish kids well, or they'd
put the sheeny curse on me.

1288
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:26,703
What the fuck, man?!

1289
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:27,473
What?!

1290
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:29,104
"Sheeny" is a racial slur, too!

1291
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:30,124
Oh, it is not.

1292
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,345
Yes, it is!

1293
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:33,040
Well, she never called
any Jews sheeny.

1294
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:34,801
She just used to say
"sheeny curse" a lot.

1295
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:35,765
(chuckling):
It was cute.

1296
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:37,772
It wasrt cute! It was racist!

1297
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:38,797
I disagree, man.

1298
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:39,981
She was just an old-timer.

1299
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:41,680
That's the way people talked
back then.

1300
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:44,465
Didrt mean they were racists.

1301
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,437
But my grandmother did refer
to a broken beer bottle once

1302
00:51:47,543 --> 00:51:48,786
as a nigger knife.

1303
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,662
You know, come to think of it,

1304
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:53,458
my grandmother was
kind of a racist.

1305
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:54,637
You think?!

1306
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:56,139
Well, l-I still don't think

1307
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,385
"porch monkey" should be
considered a racial term.

1308
00:51:58,421 --> 00:52:00,559
I mean, I've always used it
to describe lazy people,

1309
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:01,775
not lazy black people.

1310
00:52:01,814 --> 00:52:03,057
I think if we really tried,

1311
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:05,231
we could reclaim "porch monkey"
and save it.

1312
00:52:05,268 --> 00:52:06,477
DANTE:
It can't be saved, Randal.

1313
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:08,076
The sole purpose
for its creation,

1314
00:52:08,116 --> 00:52:09,873
the only reason it exists
in the first place,

1315
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,760
is to disparage an entire race.

1316
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:13,038
And even if it could be saved,

1317
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:15,082
you can't save it,
because you're not black!

1318
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,551
Well, listen to you.

1319
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:19,629
Telling me I can't do something
because of the color of my skin?

1320
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:20,976
You're the racist.

1321
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,278
(grunts)

1322
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,682
I'm taking it back. You watch.

1323
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,600
(door moos electronically)

1324
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:29,039
(chuckling):
Hey.

1325
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:31,757
What can I get for you,
you little porch monkey?

1326
00:52:31,793 --> 00:52:34,127
It's cool.
I'm taking it back.

1327
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:36,589
(sighs)

1328
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:40,903
(sighs)

1329
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:51,722
(sighs)

1330
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:01,040
# #

1331
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,429
# #

1332
00:53:12,558 --> 00:53:13,703
Hey.

1333
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:14,756
Hey.

1334
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:17,418
So, are you scared
about getting married at all?

1335
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:21,667
Um...

1336
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:24,197
were we in the middle
of a conversation

1337
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:25,350
I don't remember leaving?

1338
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,685
I was just thinking about it,
and I was thinking

1339
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:31,084
that maybe you were waiting
for some friend

1340
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:32,066
to try and stop you

1341
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:33,450
from going through
with the wedding

1342
00:53:33,484 --> 00:53:36,069
by asking if you're even ready
to go and get married.

1343
00:53:36,108 --> 00:53:37,996
So I'm asking.

1344
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:39,720
Are you scared
about getting married?

1345
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,513
Well, kind of.

1346
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,785
I mean, I'm not scared
of getting married, you know...

1347
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,154
l-I always wanted
to get married one day...

1348
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:48,522
but I am scared
of the wedding.

1349
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,465
Why?

1350
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,246
I don't know how to dance.

1351
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:57,063
You're kidding.

1352
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,344
I wish I was.

1353
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,354
You're about to tie
your life to someone,

1354
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:01,443
someone who doesn't
even really get you

1355
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:02,498
as well as your friends do,

1356
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,638
and what you're sweating
is dancing at your reception?

1357
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:07,715
Well, l-I figure
she'll eventually get me.

1358
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:09,478
I mean, you're married
to someone long enough,

1359
00:54:09,514 --> 00:54:10,889
they got to get you
eventually, right?

1360
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:11,850
Are you kidding?

1361
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:14,752
My parents have been married
for 35 years,

1362
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:16,354
and they still don't get
each other.

1363
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:20,354
Emma's pretty,
smart, happy, a good person...

1364
00:54:20,393 --> 00:54:22,760
and for some strange reason,
she loves me.

1365
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,719
I mean, what am
I supposed to do,

1366
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:24,833
pass up on that because I have

1367
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:26,301
a few stupid doubts
and some jitters?

1368
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:29,128
Besides, dancing
at the receptiors

1369
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,110
the more imperative concern
at this point,

1370
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:31,232
because I only get,

1371
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:34,055
well, presumably, one chance
to dance at my wedding.

1372
00:54:35,754 --> 00:54:36,680
(sighs)

1373
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:38,306
So, what, you can't slow dance?

1374
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:40,798
No. Anybody can slow dance,

1375
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,109
but this is one of the only
times I've ever gonna meet

1376
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:45,031
most of Emma's extended family,

1377
00:54:45,063 --> 00:54:46,788
and I'd like to be able
to show some flair

1378
00:54:46,824 --> 00:54:48,198
on the dance floor, you know?

1379
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:51,047
Like, make an impression
so that maybe they'll see

1380
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,542
whatever it is
that Emma sees in me

1381
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:55,518
instead of all feeling like
I'm some burger-peddling loser

1382
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,804
who couldn't even bust a move.

1383
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:00,449
What?

1384
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:02,558
(laughs):
You're serious?

1385
00:55:08,326 --> 00:55:09,308
Come on.

1386
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:14,718
Hey, 12-step!

1387
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,273
Jay!

1388
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,147
Lord?

1389
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:23,707
Up here, jackass.

1390
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,190
What the fuck are you doing
up there?!

1391
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:29,243
Yo, if you're gonna jump,

1392
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,073
let me get a crack
at that pussy first.

1393
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:32,451
Let me find out.

1394
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:34,624
You still got your boom box?

1395
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,426
Play something,
and turn it way up.

1396
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:43,486
Something danceable.

1397
00:55:45,507 --> 00:55:48,060
Up here?

1398
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:50,749
Are you serious?

1399
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:52,761
You're gonna teach me
to dance up here?

1400
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:55,322
What? You want I should do it
in front of all the customers?

1401
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:56,288
What customers?

1402
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,177
Shut up.
Come over here.

1403
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,959
Okay, get ready for the music.

1404
00:56:00,993 --> 00:56:04,092
You feel it... here.

1405
00:56:05,058 --> 00:56:07,643
Here it comes.

1406
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:10,945
# Grandma, what was it like #

1407
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:15,450
# To be on the holiday site? #

1408
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,976
Something a little
less demonic, please!

1409
00:56:18,015 --> 00:56:20,700
# But with them by my side
in the twilight... #

1410
00:56:20,737 --> 00:56:22,167
Thank you.

1411

(Jackson Five's "ABC"
playing)

1412
00:56:31,232 --> 00:56:32,757
Yes! Okay, okay, um,
just-just follow

1413
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:33,879
whatever it is I'm doing, okay?

1414
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,846
- Step forward...
- All right.

1415

- # You went to school... #
- Step back.

1416
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:36,927

00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,366
# Things you never,
never knew before... #

1418
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,610
To your left.

1419
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:40,573
Turn to the right.

1420
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,851
# Like "l" before "E"
except after "C" #

1421
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:43,348
# And why two plus two
makes four #

1422
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,396
# Now, now, now,
I'm gonna teach you #

1423
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:46,682
# Teach you, teach you #

1424
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:47,798
# All about love, girl #

1425
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,016
# All about love #

1426
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:50,135
# Sit yourself down... #

1427
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,733
Okay, you really do suck.
Sit down.

1428
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,018
Told you.

1429
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:53,981
Just watch me, all right?

1430
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,957
# A, B, C #

1431
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,972
# Easy as one, two, three #

1432
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,988
# As simple as do, re, mi #

1433
00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:02,297
# A, B, C, one, two, three #

1434
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:03,959
# Baby, you and me, girl #

# Let me show you
what it's all about #

1444
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:24,955
# Reading, writing, arithmetic #

1445
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,191
# Are the branches
of the learning tree #

1446
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:30,162
# But without the roots
of love every day, girl #

# How to get an "A" #

(gasps, grunts)

00:59:04,885 --> 00:59:05,833
Oh!

1494
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:09,458
(door creaking)

1495
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,400
(door bangs shut)

1496
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,152
I'm having second thoughts.

1497
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,055
About your sexuality?

1498
00:59:26,098 --> 00:59:27,472
About going to Florida.

1499
00:59:30,642 --> 00:59:31,722
Yeah, right.

1500
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:33,616
Why now, all of a sudden?

1501
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,089
Becky's pregnant.

1502
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,259
She is?

1503
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:44,205
Huh.

1504
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:46,379
So, what, are you afraid you're
gonna miss the baby shower?

1505
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,824
I'm the father.

1506
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:52,362
This sucks, man.

1507
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,367
I have pelvic piss syndrome
like a motherfucker,

1508
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:58,092
so be really fucking quiet.

1509
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:00,943
Ew, dude, don't try
looking at my dick.

1510
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:04,139
- JAY: What the fuck?
- RANDAL: What?

1511
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:05,483
Should we have
left that guy in there?

1512
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,274
Oh, fuck him! How the fuck
did you father a child

1513
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,969
with a chick
that's not your fiance?!

1514
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:10,599
Holy shit!

1515
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:11,849
She got pregnant
off the toilet seat

1516
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:13,029
you jerked off onto!

1517
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,150
I fucking knew it!

1518
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,524
No, we had sex one night
after work, a few weeks ago.

1519
01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:17,452
What?! Where?!

1520
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:19,274
Here, on the prep station table.

1521
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,390
Ew! That's my prep table.

1522
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,357
I don't know what to do.

1523
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:22,316
What did Beck say?

1524
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:23,364
She says she wants to have it.

1525
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,030
Oh, my God, so she wants
you to break it off

1526
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:26,248
- with Emma and marry her?
- No.

1527
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:27,691
She's gonna tell Emma?

1528
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:28,653
No!

1529
01:00:28,686 --> 01:00:30,595
Wait a second...
then what's the problem?

1530
01:00:30,637 --> 01:00:32,710
- Are you that dense?
- I'm serious.

1531
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,311
If Becks isn't busting
your balls about it,

1532
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,275
what's the big deal?

1533
01:00:35,308 --> 01:00:36,236
You could still
go down to Florida

1534
01:00:36,268 --> 01:00:37,513
and live happily ever after.

1535
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:40,103
Knowing I have a love child
up in Jersey?!

1536
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,068
How the fuck do you always have,

1537
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,043
like, two good-Iooking
girls who want you?

1538
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:44,993
You're the most
hideous fucking CHUD

1539
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:46,441
I've ever met,
and you always have

1540
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,036
a pair of girls
fighting over you.

1541
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:49,963
Listen, you can never tell
anybody about this.

1542
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:51,109
Who am I gonna tell?

1543
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,673
I'm serious, Randal!
And not just for me.

1544
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,275
Becky says she doesn't want
anybody to know.

1545
01:00:54,315 --> 01:00:55,243
Then what'd you tell me for?

1546
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,283
Look, you've fucked me over
in the past,

1547
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:58,435
but this is huge.

1548
01:00:58,474 --> 01:00:59,554
This is serious!

1549
01:00:59,594 --> 01:01:01,798
Promise me that you'll
keep your mouth shut,

1550
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,079
because if you fuck me over
this time,

1551
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:05,481
I swear to God, I will beat
the shit out of you.

1552
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:07,270
(laughs):
You and what army?

1553
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:08,235
I'm serious!

1554
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:10,121
I'm serious, too.
You and what army?

1555
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:11,300
Promise me!

1556
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:13,507
All right!
Get off of me, you nut!

1557
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:15,846
JAY:
What the fuck?!

1558
01:01:20,616 --> 01:01:22,243
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1559
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,906
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh, we were just...

1560
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:25,920
May your first child
be a masculine child.

1561
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,906
(huffs)

1562
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:32,837
Becky!

1563
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,951
Randal!

1564
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,420
She was sweating me.
It just came out.

1565
01:01:35,463 --> 01:01:36,837
Ow! Shit!

1566
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,048
You swung at me!

1567
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:40,128
- You ducked!
- Because you swung at me!

1568
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:41,597
Damn it!

1569
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,444
Where's Becky?

1570
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,407
She just left.

1571
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,519
I need help here, Mr. Dante.

1572
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,762
I can't wrap good,
and Randal ate the last pickles.

1573
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:51,358
You fucking snitch.

1574
01:01:51,398 --> 01:01:52,960
I'm sorry, Randal.
I'm sorry.

1575
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:55,552
Becky!

1576
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,871
Maybe she went to get
a home pregnancy test

1577
01:02:03,911 --> 01:02:04,837
just to be sure.

1578
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,739
How the fuck
could this day get any worse?

1579
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:12,665
Well, what the fuck
are you doing, man?!

1580
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,636
Follow her!

1581
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:14,596
You-you think?

1582
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:15,557
You're darn right, I do.

1583
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:16,832
You two have got
to work this out.

1584
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:17,949
Follow her, talk
to her for an hour,

1585
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:18,916
then come back here.

1586
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:19,875
An hour?!

1587
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:21,566
L-I've found that any
more time than that,

1588
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:23,393
you run the risk of saying
the wrong thing again.

1589
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:24,988
Follow her,
talk to her for an hour,

1590
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:26,403
then come back here
and help me close up.

1591
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:27,645
You can't close up by yourself?

1592
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:29,626
Fucking A, man,
you're about to become a father!

1593
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,555
Time to start acting
responsibly!

1594
01:02:31,588 --> 01:02:34,369
Be back here in an hour.
Go!

1595
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:36,858
(engine starts)

1596
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,087
(tires screech)

1597
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,684
Hello.

1598
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,608
I assume
you're with Kinky Kelly.

1599
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,975
Good guess. You Randal?

1600
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,156
I am.

1601
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,436
How long is it gonna take you
to set up?

1602
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:03,001
Got to hook up the boom box,

1603
01:03:03,043 --> 01:03:04,634
hang a few curtains
and some lights.

1604
01:03:04,673 --> 01:03:07,061
I've got a small smoke machine
for ambiance. Yeah.

1605
01:03:07,104 --> 01:03:09,209
Well, you might as
well start setting up.

1606
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:10,176
We got about an hour

1607
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,670
before the guest of honor
gets back.

1608
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:15,160
So, do I, uh, get to meet Kelly
before the show or what?

1609
01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:15,963
Nah.

1610
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,723
Kelly likes privacy
before show time.

1611
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,189
But after the show, if you want,

1612
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:21,404
for an extra $500,
you can fuck Kelly.

1613
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:23,294
Really? Sweet.

1614
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:25,498
Yeah. So, where
we doing this thing?

1615
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,673
Oh, right inside the restaurant.

1616
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:29,750
You're kidding.

1617
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,896
Not spacious enough?

1618
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,725
No, it's plenty spacious.

1619
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:35,418
Just kind of weird, isn't it?

1620
01:03:35,455 --> 01:03:36,382
Kind of weird?

1621
01:03:36,415 --> 01:03:38,618
You're in the bestiality
business, dude.

1622
01:03:38,655 --> 01:03:40,060
Hey, fucko...

1623
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,660
...we like to call it

1624
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,449
inter-species erotica.

1625
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:45,209
Intriguing.

1626
01:03:45,245 --> 01:03:49,074
(Smashing Pumpkins "1979"
playing)

1627
01:03:56,317 --> 01:04:00,822
# Shakedown 1979 #

1628
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:08,023
# Cool kids never have
the time #

1629
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:15,185
# On a live wire
right up off the street #

1630
01:04:15,228 --> 01:04:19,221
# You and I should meet #

1631
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:26,423
# Junebug skipping
like a stone #

1632
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:33,398
# Headlights pointed
at the dawn #

1633
01:04:35,803 --> 01:04:42,359
# We were sure we'd never see
an end to it all #

1634
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:47,956
# And I don't even care #

1635
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:51,473
# To shake these zipper blues #

1636
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:55,158
# And we don't know #

1637
01:04:55,194 --> 01:04:58,837
# Just where our bones
will rest #

1638
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:02,352
# To dust, I guess #

1639
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:05,871
# Lamented and assured #

1640
01:05:05,912 --> 01:05:07,188
# To the lights #

1641
01:05:07,288 --> 01:05:11,828
# And towns below #

1642
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:15,572
# Faster than #

1643
01:05:15,606 --> 01:05:19,348
# The speed of sound #

1644
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,349
# Faster than #

1645
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:26,036
# We thought we'd go #

1646
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:29,683
# Beneath the sound #

1647
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:31,476
# Of hope #

1648
01:05:34,229 --> 01:05:38,003
# The street heats
the urgency of now #

1649
01:05:41,622 --> 01:05:46,891
# As you see,
there's no one around. #

1650
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:50,060
Oh, no.

1651
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:51,028
Not again.

1652
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,946
(speed-dial beeping)

1653
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:54,540
Yeah, I have a fire
at the Mooby's

1654
01:05:54,578 --> 01:05:56,302
on Memorial Parkway
and Leonardo.

1655
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,877
(door moos electronically,
Dante coughs)

1656
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:06,797
(hissing)

1657
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:09,388
(slow, sensual,
rhythmic melody playing)

1658
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:10,988
What?

1659
01:06:12,146 --> 01:06:14,514
(funky riff kicks in)

1660
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:17,099
What the fuck is going on?

1661
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:18,600
It's your going-away party.

1662
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:21,162
Whoo! Whoo!

1663
01:06:21,202 --> 01:06:25,065
We's all gonna get drunk
and get laid!

1664
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,529
Oh, my God, is Elias hammered?

1665
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:28,496
Isn't it awesome?

1666
01:06:28,529 --> 01:06:30,317
My man smoked two blunts
full of skunk.

1667
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:32,464
Fuck Pillow Pants!

1668
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:34,536
Honk if you love
a tight pussy...

1669
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:36,943
Yo, we love pussy.

1670
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,537
Tonight, before
you leave me forever,

1671
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,464
we are gonna peep something
we've been talking about

1672
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:41,904
since we saw "Bachelor Party"

1673
01:06:41,936 --> 01:06:44,141
at your parents' house
on Beta, when we were 12.

1674
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:46,216
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1675
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:47,817
I'm gonna miss you, man.

1676
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:51,171
I'm gonna miss you, too,
but this is a little much.

1677
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,872
Yeah? Just wait.

1678
01:06:52,911 --> 01:06:53,860
(chuckling)

1679
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:02,951
Show time!

1680
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:03,919
(laughs)

1681
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:05,577
Ladies and gentlemen...

1682
01:07:05,616 --> 01:07:06,543
and you, Elias,

1683
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:08,428
straight from the debauchery

1684
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:11,461
capital of the world,
Tijuana, Mexico...

1685
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:12,712
Oh, God, no.

1686
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,571
Oh, God, yes.

1687
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,387
Get ready for some
hard-core bestiality.

1688
01:07:17,422 --> 01:07:19,876
DRIVER:
Inter-species erotica, fucko!

1689
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:20,844
(laughs)

1690
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:23,267
Inter-species erotica
at its finest,

1691
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,716
straight from TJ,

1692
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,578
I give you Kinky Kelly
and the Sexy Stud!

1693
01:07:30,732 --> 01:07:31,681
# Maybe #

1694
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,123
- # Just maybe... #
- Whoo!

1695
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:38,118
# Naughty girls
need love, too... #

1696
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:48,198
Don't worry.
Chick's coming.

1697
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:59,041
# I've been told
time and time again #

1698
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:02,082
# That you can't treat love
like a game... #

1699
01:08:02,122 --> 01:08:03,877
Any second,
the chick's coming.

1700
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:07,045
# But I play rough
with hearts that never mend #

1701
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:11,304
# 'Cause some guys like you
do the same #

1702
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,468
# Love was
just a four-letter word #

1703
01:08:14,506 --> 01:08:16,447
# Never heard, how absurd... #

1704
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,278
Any minute now.

1705
01:08:18,314 --> 01:08:19,940
# How could it be? #

1706
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,521
# But now I can't believe
this is real #

1707
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:25,667
# How I feel, now you steal #

1708
01:08:25,705 --> 01:08:28,191
# My heart away from me #

1709
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:30,501
# Used to be so good
and so bad #

1710
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,916
# Sex was something
I just had... #

1711
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:36,809
Wow, that guy's being awfully
forward with that donkey.

1712
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:38,180
Uh, Randal...?!

1713
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:41,410
Where the fuck's the chick?

1714
01:08:44,197 --> 01:08:48,475
# Baby, don't let me
be misunderstood #

1715
01:08:48,518 --> 01:08:49,925
# Temporary love's so bad... #

1716
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:52,576
Yo, Freddie fucking Mercury,
where's Kelly?

1717
01:08:52,615 --> 01:08:53,696
# Then along came you... #

1718
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:54,661
Right here.

1719
01:08:54,694 --> 01:08:55,643
# Now I know it's true... #

1720
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:58,338
I thought that's the sexy stud.

1721
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,505
I'm the sexy stud.

1722
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,778
# Then came you... #

1723
01:09:03,813 --> 01:09:05,634
But this donkey's a dude.

1724
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:08,768
Kelly can be
a guy's name, too. Hey!

1725
01:09:08,805 --> 01:09:09,886
# Yes, it's true #

1726
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,005
# I'm in love with you #

1727
01:09:11,045 --> 01:09:13,763
# And believe it, baby #

1728
01:09:13,797 --> 01:09:16,447
# This time,
your love won't get away... #

1729
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:17,411
(groans)

1730
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,331
Due to some
nomenclature confusion,

1731
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,046
there's not gonna be any chick.

1732
01:09:22,082 --> 01:09:24,472
Well, who the fuck's
gonna blow the donkey?

1733
01:09:24,516 --> 01:09:27,810
# Ooh, it's only you I adore #

1734
01:09:27,843 --> 01:09:31,618
# So much more
than my body was asking for... #

1735
01:09:31,652 --> 01:09:32,829
Oh!

1736
01:09:32,932 --> 01:09:34,841
# Yes, your love
is breaking my chill... #

1737
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:38,810
I have a huge boner right now.

1738
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:40,923
# In my heart... #

1739
01:09:40,962 --> 01:09:42,337
Oh, my God!

1740
01:09:42,371 --> 01:09:44,607
Becky!

1741
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:45,722
Where did you go?

1742
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:47,803
What the fuck is going on here?

1743
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:50,045
Uh, inter-species erotica.

1744
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:51,740
Are you okay?

1745
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:55,423
I'm disgusted and repulsed
and...

1746
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:57,345
and I can't look away.

1747
01:09:57,378 --> 01:09:59,418
# Baby, don't let me
be misunderstood... #

1748
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:01,367
It's huge!

1749
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:02,456
# Temporary love's so bad... #

1750
01:10:02,497 --> 01:10:03,610
- (donkey brays)
- # But it feels so good #

1751
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,503
# Then along came you... #

1752
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:06,811
We need to talk.

1753
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,856
Did you see the size
of that cock...

1754
01:10:08,897 --> 01:10:09,758
I love you.

1755
01:10:11,265 --> 01:10:13,086
And-and I think
you love me, too.

1756
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:17,659
Uh, of-of course.
I...

1757
01:10:17,697 --> 01:10:18,808
I mean, we're friends.

1758
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,986
L-I think you love me
as more than a friend.

1759
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:24,918
It's okay.
You can say it.

1760
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,894
But l-I don't believe
in romantic love.

1761
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:29,462
I think you do.

1762
01:10:30,463 --> 01:10:32,567
Do you really want
to do this right now?

1763
01:10:32,606 --> 01:10:34,297
# But it feels so good #

1764
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:36,373
- (sighs)
- # Then along came you... #

1765
01:10:36,415 --> 01:10:39,284
Well, I guess the show's over.

1766
01:10:39,326 --> 01:10:40,732
I don't think so, sir.

1767
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:42,839
# Naughty girls
need love... too... #

1768
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,315
If he's gonna jerk off,

1769
01:10:52,347 --> 01:10:53,875
I'm gonna jerk off, too.

1770
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,022
I don't think
he's gonna jerk off.

1771
01:10:58,716 --> 01:11:00,604
# So moving like you're 40 #

1772
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,905
# This groove
is much too naughty #

1773
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:03,987
# Can't you see? #

1774
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:05,653
# I want you just for me #

1775
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:07,254
- # Boys, make some noise... #
- (brays)

1776
01:11:08,253 --> 01:11:09,592
Yo, you guys
are gonna miss this shit!

1777
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:13,906
The big guy's gonna cornole
that ass... with his wiener!

1778
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:15,507
Hold that thought.

1779
01:11:15,546 --> 01:11:20,761
# Freeze, freeze,
freeze, freeze... #

1780
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:23,512
(moaning)

1781
01:11:24,892 --> 01:11:28,436
I hope that donkey doesn't have
a heinie troll.

1782
01:11:28,475 --> 01:11:30,361
# Temporary love's so bad... #

1783
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:32,084
All right, I do.

1784
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,910
Do what?

1785
01:11:33,945 --> 01:11:36,727
# Then along came you... #

1786
01:11:36,762 --> 01:11:38,224
I do love you.

1787
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:47,447
# Temporary, temporary... #

1788
01:11:50,104 --> 01:11:52,494
What kind of sick
fuck gets turned on

1789
01:11:52,537 --> 01:11:54,423
watching a guy fuck a donkey?

1790
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,659
# Naughty girls need love #

1791
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:59,281
# Baby, baby #

1792
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,662
(sobbing)

1793
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,063
I'm sorry, Jesus.

1794
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:04,209
(moaning)

1795
01:12:05,304 --> 01:12:08,467
# Then along came you... #

1796
01:12:13,557 --> 01:12:14,506
Dante?

1797
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:26,960
What's going on?

1798
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:28,589
Ooh, cake.

1799
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:30,036
(moans)

1800
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:32,719
Yo, I was outside taking a piss
when I heard the news.

1801
01:12:32,756 --> 01:12:33,704
Congrats!

1802
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:37,204
You're having a baby, right?

1803
01:12:39,381 --> 01:12:42,448
No. Who said that?

1804
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:46,796
Some asshole.

1805
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,662
# Temporary, temporary... #

1806
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,036
I'm sorry.

1807
01:12:57,107 --> 01:13:00,521
# Naughty girls need love... #

1808
01:13:00,562 --> 01:13:01,936
You fuck!

1809
01:13:01,969 --> 01:13:03,246
(thud, Dante groans)

1810
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:06,503
Quick, hit that
two-timing fuck with this!

1811
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:12,201
Hey, want to go out sometime?

1812
01:13:17,457 --> 01:13:19,497
Emma, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

1813
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:22,800
Take him, you fucking whore.

1814
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:24,743
(ring jingles as it bounces
across floor)

1815
01:13:27,346 --> 01:13:28,295
Emma!

1816
01:13:30,643 --> 01:13:32,103
(sirens blaring)

1817
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:34,217
Oh, no.

1818
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:36,112
# Don't let me #

1819
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:37,672
# Baby #

1820
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,088
# Temporary love's so bad #

1821
01:13:39,121 --> 01:13:41,738
# Temporary love's
so bad #

1822
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:42,757
# Then along came you... #

1823
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,669
Oh, shit, not again.
Got to finish.

1824
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:46,638
(moans)

1825
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:48,874
Yo, cops are outside,
we're holding,

1826
01:13:48,942 --> 01:13:51,560
and I'm still on probation.

1827
01:13:53,104 --> 01:13:56,616
- (sighs)
- # Temporary, temporary... #

1828
01:13:56,655 --> 01:13:58,565
What the fuck?

1829
01:13:58,607 --> 01:13:59,435
(brays)

1830
01:14:02,478 --> 01:14:03,907
Porch monkey?!

1831
01:14:03,951 --> 01:14:05,412
Oh, no, no, it's cool.

1832
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:06,664
I'm taking it back.

1833
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:07,978
(whooping)

1834
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:11,462
I love pussy and beer!

1835
01:14:11,503 --> 01:14:12,452
Whoo-hoo!

1836
01:14:16,525 --> 01:14:18,980
(groans)

1837
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:25,926
Deja fucking vu, right?

1838
01:14:36,012 --> 01:14:39,306
Jail cell design hasn't changed
much in centuries, has it?

1839
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:42,431
Maybe it's time they brought in
the laser bars or something.

1840
01:14:42,474 --> 01:14:43,850
Or they can make

1841
01:14:43,883 --> 01:14:47,364
a hard plastic cage
like Magneto's in X-Men 2.

1842
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:48,711
No, come on, dude,

1843
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:50,603
let's keep it in the real world,
all right?

1844
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,160
But you know
what wouldn't be a bad idea?

1845
01:14:53,194 --> 01:14:54,339
Carbonite.

1846
01:14:57,419 --> 01:14:58,596
What do you think, Dante?

1847
01:14:59,915 --> 01:15:00,864
I think I'm gonna kill you!

1848
01:15:00,907 --> 01:15:02,335
Get off of me!

1849
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:04,266
What up?! Steel cage match!

1850
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:05,378
You ruined my life!

1851
01:15:05,419 --> 01:15:06,825
Your life was already ruined!

1852
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:09,282
Jesus!

1853
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,464
What were you thinking?

1854
01:15:10,504 --> 01:15:11,715
A fucking donkey show?!

1855
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:13,312
It was your going-away present!

1856
01:15:13,352 --> 01:15:14,302
DANTE:
It sure was.

1857
01:15:14,345 --> 01:15:15,751
I just never thought
I'd be going away to prison.

1858
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,442
SEXY STUD:
Hey, boys.

1859
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,750
You can't be imprisoned

1860
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:21,856
for watching
an inter-species sex act.

1861
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,553
You guys'll walk.

1862
01:15:23,593 --> 01:15:25,829
The most I'll get'll be a fine
for animal abuse

1863
01:15:25,864 --> 01:15:29,028
and a lot of disgusted looks
from asswipe conservatives

1864
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:31,431
who can't appreciate
sexual exploration.

1865
01:15:31,464 --> 01:15:32,608
Hey!

1866
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:33,695
(chuckles)

1867
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:36,419
(sighs)

1868
01:15:36,456 --> 01:15:39,270
I miss my donkey.

1869
01:15:40,262 --> 01:15:41,757
I can't believe you.

1870
01:15:41,799 --> 01:15:43,457
I finally get my shit together.

1871
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:44,902
I'm hours
from getting out of here

1872
01:15:44,935 --> 01:15:47,619
and really starting my life,
and you somehow figure out a way

1873
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,042
to obliterate all that
and reduce me to a convict.

1874
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:52,420
Oh, yeah, it's my fault
your life's fucked up.

1875
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:54,658
I'm the engaged guy
who knocked up my boss.

1876
01:15:55,653 --> 01:15:58,817
You knocked up the guy
who owns Mooby's? Ew.

1877
01:15:58,853 --> 01:15:59,899
(chuckling):
What?

1878
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,703
Would you shut up?

1879
01:16:01,733 --> 01:16:02,846
(chuckling)

1880
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:04,380
You're chaos incarnate, man.

1881
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:05,533
Our whole lives,

1882
01:16:05,573 --> 01:16:07,963
you've been getting me into
trouble and holding me back.

1883
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:09,378
Oh, I'm holding you back, right?

1884
01:16:09,412 --> 01:16:10,875
I remember, like, ten years ago,

1885
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:12,671
the night we went
to Julie Dwyer's funeral,

1886
01:16:12,771 --> 01:16:15,193
you were all like, "I need
to shit or get off the pot."

1887
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:17,275
You said, "Shit
or get off the pot," not me.

1888
01:16:17,316 --> 01:16:19,772
You got all fired up about
taking charge of your life,

1889
01:16:19,812 --> 01:16:20,892
and what'd you do?

1890
01:16:20,932 --> 01:16:23,234
You worked at the store
till the place burned down.

1891
01:16:23,331 --> 01:16:24,674
I took courses at Brookdale.

1892
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,602
And dropped out.

1893
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:27,012
Because you stopped going.

1894
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:29,726
Because we were just killing
time with those classes.

1895
01:16:29,763 --> 01:16:30,908
One semester,

1896
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:32,572
we took Criminology,
for Christ's sake.

1897
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:34,715
What the fuck were we training
to be, Batman?

1898
01:16:34,753 --> 01:16:36,958
DANTE:
At least we were
doing something

1899
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:39,546
instead of wasting our lives in
some fucking convenience store!

1900
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:40,894
RANDAL:
You know what?

1901
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,779
You can badmouth Quick Stop all
you want, but I miss that place.

1902
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:44,889
I loved working there.

1903
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:47,296
I look back on that period
as the best time in my life.

1904
01:16:48,288 --> 01:16:49,696
Now I know you're fuckir nuts.

1905
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:52,729
Why? Because I enjoyed
what I did?

1906
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,231
I got to watch movies,

1907
01:16:54,273 --> 01:16:56,574
fuck with assholes,
and hang out with my best friend

1908
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:57,690
all day.

1909
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:58,974
Can you think of a better way
to make a living?

1910
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:00,896
Yeah, maybe it's not
what everyone does,

1911
01:17:00,929 --> 01:17:02,520
but it was pretty fucking good.

1912
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,489
(laughs)

1913
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:05,047
Man, that's you all over.

1914
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:06,615
Scrape by with the bare minimum.

1915
01:17:06,657 --> 01:17:08,958
Well, I'm tired of that, Randal.

1916
01:17:08,993 --> 01:17:10,486
I'm not in high school anymore.

1917
01:17:10,528 --> 01:17:12,731
Shit, I'm not
even in my twenties anymore.

1918
01:17:12,768 --> 01:17:14,492
I don't want to sit around
and rag on customers

1919
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,607
while eating free food.

1920
01:17:15,648 --> 01:17:16,759
That's what you want to do.

1921
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,620
That's what you've
always wanted to do.

1922
01:17:18,654 --> 01:17:20,727
Well, if that's all you want out
of life, man, then God bless,

1923
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,484
but I refuse to let your shit
taint the rest of mine.

1924
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:26,486
No. I'm gonna smooth
things over with Emma,

1925
01:17:26,527 --> 01:17:27,835
go to Florida

1926
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:30,804
and start
my Randal Graves-free existence.

1927
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:36,730
And try to forget these last
33 years ever happened.

1928
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:45,626
So that's the way you see all
this time we've spent together?

1929
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:49,560
That's weird, man.

1930
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:51,484
I thought you were
the only guy in the world

1931
01:17:51,582 --> 01:17:53,369
who got me and had my back...

1932
01:17:53,405 --> 01:17:56,275
the only person
who'd take a bullet for me,

1933
01:17:56,382 --> 01:17:57,788
'cause I assumed
you felt about me

1934
01:17:57,821 --> 01:18:00,536
the same way I feel about you.

1935
01:18:00,572 --> 01:18:02,940
Then, all of a sudden, one day,
you're like, "I'm moving. Bye."

1936
01:18:02,972 --> 01:18:05,970
Do you know
what that's been like for me?

1937
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:08,756
I'm looking at a future
that just sucks,

1938
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:10,682
because you're
not gonna be in it anymore.

1939
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,186
And you're not
even throwing me over

1940
01:18:12,219 --> 01:18:13,943
for a life
that means something to you.

1941
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:15,866
It's just a stupid,
hollow existence

1942
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:16,827
you think you should embrace

1943
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,168
because you're getting old
or something,

1944
01:18:18,203 --> 01:18:23,058
because it's the kind of life
everyone else goes after.

1945
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,618
You're a fucking drone, dude.

1946
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:26,584
DANTE:
Fine.

1947
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,179
Then the next friend
whose life you ruin

1948
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:30,041
can be a totally free spirit.

1949
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,122
How's that?

1950
01:18:31,162 --> 01:18:34,675
You think I want to start
making friends at my age?

1951
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:36,602
Christ.

1952
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:38,542
Who would want me
as their friend?

1953
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,020
I hate everyone, and everything
seems stupid to me...

1954
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:48,438
...but you were always
the counterbalance to that...

1955
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:52,596
the guy who was the yin
to my yang.

1956
01:18:52,632 --> 01:18:55,981
But now what the fuck am I gonna
do for the rest of my life?

1957
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:00,081
I mean, shit, I really wish

1958
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:01,493
you would've told me this
when I first met you

1959
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,803
that one day,
you were gonna bail

1960
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:04,084
on our friendship,

1961
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,006
because if I had known
you were just gonna flake on me

1962
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:09,520
a few decades later...

1963
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:11,085
I wouldn't have even bothered
with your ass

1964
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:13,298
in the first place.

1965
01:19:15,926 --> 01:19:17,037
Jesus, why don't you two

1966
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:19,151
just fuck and get it
over with already?

1967
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:22,094
(muttering):
Faggots.

1968
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:25,809
Why can't you ever say
something useful for a change?

1969
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:28,015
Well, what the fuck
you waiting for?

1970
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:30,289
That's your cue, man.

1971
01:19:40,532 --> 01:19:42,125
I got nothing.

1972
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:45,133
Jesus fucking Christ,
what good are you,

1973
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:46,251
you mute fuck?!

1974
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:47,721
You know what?
That hurts.

1975
01:19:47,764 --> 01:19:50,185
Like, what do you ever add
to the fucking proceedings?

1976
01:19:50,227 --> 01:19:52,910
You got, like, one answer
for everything: "Pussy, man."

1977
01:19:52,946 --> 01:19:55,368
Oh, then, man, you must love
this fuckir guy,

1978
01:19:55,411 --> 01:19:57,266
'cause he's the biggest pussy
I ever met.

1979
01:19:57,299 --> 01:19:58,727
The dude who lives his life

1980
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,949
according
to everyone else's standards.

1981
01:19:59,987 --> 01:20:01,710
"I got to go to Florida

1982
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:04,016
and get married, 'cause that's
what's expected of me."

1983
01:20:04,052 --> 01:20:06,571
And the fuckir insane part is,
he ain't even that crazy

1984
01:20:06,611 --> 01:20:08,782
about the chick he's marrying
or Florida,

1985
01:20:08,818 --> 01:20:09,930
never mind the fact
that he's got

1986
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:10,899
a perfectly good chick

1987
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,416
right here in Jersey
who he's nuts about,

1988
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:16,489
and even Anne fuckir Frank
could see she's nuts about him.

1989
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,088
God knows why.

1990
01:20:18,128 --> 01:20:20,136
And she likes you
for who you are, man.

1991
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:21,933
She ain't trying
to stuff you into a box

1992
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:23,375
you'll never fit into.

1993
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:24,904
Not to mention the fact
that she's carrying

1994
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,538
your hideous fucking CHUD
of a kid.

1995
01:20:27,794 --> 01:20:29,222
Jesus, if you had any sense
whatsoever,

1996
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:30,508
you'd fuckir stop trying

1997
01:20:30,543 --> 01:20:32,103
to bray it up
with the rest of the sheep

1998
01:20:32,144 --> 01:20:34,827
and live your life
the way it makes sense for you,

1999
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:36,173
you fuckir ass!

2000
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,095
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

2001
01:20:38,128 --> 01:20:39,274
You obviously have
such a great handle

2002
01:20:39,378 --> 01:20:40,586
on your life.

2003
01:20:40,624 --> 01:20:42,152
Tell me what you would do
if you were in my position...

2004
01:20:42,224 --> 01:20:44,396
or even what you'd do
in your own position?

2005
01:20:44,432 --> 01:20:46,819
Swing that judgmental pendulum
back the other way

2006
01:20:46,862 --> 01:20:48,554
and tell me how you'd solve
all your problems, asshole.

2007
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:50,567
What the fuck would the
great Randal Graves do

2008
01:20:50,606 --> 01:20:51,947
if he were half the
master of his destiny

2009
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:53,357
that I'm supposed to be?!

2010
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:57,383
I'd buy the Quick Stop
and reopen it myself!

2011
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:01,036
That's what I'd do.

2012
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:03,556
That's what we should do.

2013
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:05,964
Yeah, right.

2014
01:21:05,998 --> 01:21:08,549
Who-who are we, Lance Dowds?

2015
01:21:08,588 --> 01:21:10,279
Do you know
how much it would cost

2016
01:21:10,317 --> 01:21:11,245
to buy the Quick Stop?

2017
01:21:11,277 --> 01:21:12,871
Like, 50 grand, easy.

2018
01:21:12,942 --> 01:21:16,291
And neither one of us have
that type of money.

2019
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,046
(sighs)

2020
01:21:23,085 --> 01:21:25,473
JAY:
We do.

2021
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:31,815
That's right.

2022
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:35,371
You guys would be willing
to lend us some of that money

2023
01:21:35,404 --> 01:21:36,864
so we can reopen the stores?

2024
01:21:40,043 --> 01:21:42,563
Sure, on two conditions.

2025
01:21:42,603 --> 01:21:44,643
One: We can hang out
in front of the store

2026
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,374
anytime we want, and
you can't call the cops.

2027
01:21:47,562 --> 01:21:49,285
And two:

2028
01:21:49,354 --> 01:21:51,044
You have to blow each other,

2029
01:21:51,082 --> 01:21:52,031
and we get to watch.

2030
01:21:52,969 --> 01:21:55,392
Then you have
to go ass to mouth.

2031
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:01,480
All right, just
the first condition.

2032
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:03,652
Seriously?

2033
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:04,615
Do I stutter?

2034
01:22:04,648 --> 01:22:06,536
Yeah, seriously.

2035
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:12,675
What do you think?

2036
01:22:12,713 --> 01:22:14,120
(sighs)

2037
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:17,000
I almost hate to say it, but...

2038
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,920
it kind of makes sense.

2039
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:22,886
Hey, maybe that's why we spent
so much time in that store,

2040
01:22:22,919 --> 01:22:24,325
why college

2041
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:26,726
or anything else
never panned out for us.

2042
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,252
I mean, think about it, man.

2043
01:22:28,295 --> 01:22:29,725
You and me running
our own business

2044
01:22:29,768 --> 01:22:32,320
instead of working
for some other asshole?

2045
01:22:33,351 --> 01:22:35,773
Could be
pretty fuckir sweet, right?

2046
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:39,995
Yeah, it really could.

2047
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,589
But I don't know, man.

2048
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,761
I was this close
to starting a new life.

2049
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:51,969
Jesus.

2050
01:22:53,638 --> 01:22:56,190
You're actually gonna make me
do this, aren't you?

2051
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,898
(sighs)

2052
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:03,104
Can you guys cover your ears
for a minute, please?

2053
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:15,709
You're my best friend...

2054
01:23:15,748 --> 01:23:17,535
and I love you.

2055
01:23:19,235 --> 01:23:22,235
In a totally heterosexual way.

2056
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:24,512
Yeah, right.

2057
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:29,754
Please, man, don't leave me.

2058
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,127
Thanks.

2059
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,966
That'll be $5.79.

2060
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:46,204
# #

2061
01:23:53,953 --> 01:23:56,440
I mean, you already taught me
how to dance at a wedding.

2062
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:00,636
I mean... l-I know you
don't believe in romantic love.

2063
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:07,961
