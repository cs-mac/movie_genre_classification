- It's time you started.

486
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,621
I suppose you're going to keep me here.

487
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,592
I know too much.

488
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,796
I know too much?
I don't know anything.

489
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,466
This Maurice Horton. This assassin.

490
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,241
He's gonna die, you know that.

491
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,146
I didn't until you just told me, no.

492
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:51,186
I'm not interested.
I want to look around a villa.

493
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,119
If I don't, I'm out of a job.

494
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,085
Dead men don't need jobs.

495
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:02,760
When Maurice Horton dies,
you'll know who killed him.

496
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,697
Well, yes, I do.

497
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,528
Okay. Can't we pretend that I don't?

498
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,436
That's not the way we do things.

499
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:16,206
Tell me. When this pig dies,
and he will die,

500
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,610
how can we guarantee your silence?

501
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,547
I mean, guarantee?

502
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,450
I tell you, there are two ways.
Numero uno.

503
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,554
We kill you also.

504
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,356
Silence, a guarantee, no?

505
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,896
Oh. What is number two-o? Duo?

506
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,866
- Due.
- Due.

507
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,036
You kill him.

508
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:49,644
Of course, we will pay you big money,
so it will look voluntary.

509
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,209
See, we are not so unreasonable.

510
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,045
I...

511
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:01,154
So, they thought Mike Lawton
was Michael Horton? M. Horton.

512
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,226
Let's talk about this later.

513
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,090
I thought you'd choose something
more mysterious.

514
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,255
Lawton, a bit ordinary, isn't it?

515
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,525
It's meant to be ordinary.

516
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,035
Fine, but in the books
they're not so boring.

517
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,765
What are you suggesting?

518
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,272
Don't know. I'm not a killer.

519
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,447
I read one once where the...

520
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,677
You've got to learn
to give your mouth a rest.

521
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,689
This is secret business.
I don't want the world to know.

522
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,429
Oh, look, there she is.

523
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,265
That must be him.

524
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,133
God, he's no Clark Gable, is he?

525
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:57,380
I'll explain all that when I get back.
Don't argue about it! Do it!

526
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,312
Have you got a pen?

527
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:04,710
I want £100,000,
whatever that is in Italian lire,

528
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,622
to the Hotel Gabrielli
by 11:00 tomorrow morning.

529
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,052
Gabrielli!

530
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:19,728
If he is that rich, I don't suppose it
matters that he's married. £100,000.

531
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,896
That's what I was getting.

532
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,504
What, exactly?

533
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,273
That was my fee.

534
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:35,842
I can do the business when you do it.
Make sure the cash gets here.

535
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,785
You got his envelope, he got yours.

536
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,951
He got the target, you got me.
He's done the job for you.

537
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,827
You're joking. He couldn't do it.

538
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,800
- Why not? Any fool could.
- I'm not a plumber.

539
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,371
- It's a highly skilled job.
- Rubbish!

540
00:47:55,505 --> 00:48:00,340
He's got the instructions.
All he needs is the nerve, and wallop!

541
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,002
He's got your man... and your money.

542
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,115
I've done it
and that's how much it costs.

543
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,656
- Have you got a hairpin?
- What?

544
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,186
Oh, yes.

545
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,236
Bye.

546
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,805
Idiot.

547
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,966
Well... salute!

548
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,212
£100,000 for my life!

549
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,080
He picks it up here tomorrow, boss.

550
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,817
Signore Horton is very... confident, no?

551
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,521
It would be very nice if we could take
his money as well as his life.

552
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:59,500
We could use it to pay you
when you kill the pig.

553
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,404
Mr. Scarpa, I can't shoot anybody.
I couldn't do it.

554
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,773
No, no, I know you could.
It's okay. No worry.

555
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,210
You use a bomb.

556
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,348
There it is.

557
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,198
Oh, come on!

558
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,137
I can't bear it.

559
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,894
"Miss Caroline Wright."

560
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,130
It was a woman.

561
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,660
- He killed a woman.
- The maid's coming.

562
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,410
Sleep well.

563
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,357
[Distant music]

564
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,959
Patricia, I'm really sorry about
what happened earlier.

565
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,501
- Nearly happened.
- It's okay.

566
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,366
All part of the business, I expect.

567
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:49,104
Today, I've been stood up
by my date, a married man.

568
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:54,673
I've been aimed at by a hired killer,
had a gun held to my head,

569
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:59,346
been held captive against my will
by a strange man in a hotel room.

570
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:05,893
It's been one of the best days
of my life.

571
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,360
Really?

572
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,878
You can go now if you want.

573
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,854
You're not going to tell anyone.

574
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,550
No one to tell. Really, no one.

575
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,658
I'm missing and nobody knows.

576
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:44,231
When I'm not missing, nobody knows.

577
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,067
And often achieves a bulk of four tons...

578
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,737
Baby hippos.

579
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,618
The power in these ponderous jaws
is tremendous.

580
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,093
The life I lead is a mundane,
sick existence.

581
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,219
Lonely. You think you're lonely?

582
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,594
You should try being an assassin.

583
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,463
Don't meet many people
when you're an assassin.

584
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,130
Not for long, anyway.

585
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,831
Yes, but what a life.

586
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:04,173
- I bet you've some stories to tell.
- Who to?

587
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,616
Me.

588
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:16,653
I only needed this. I was gonna make
this the last big one then I'd get out.

589
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:21,088
- Buy a flower shop.
- A flower shop?

590
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,428
- You?
- Yeah.

591
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,132
Well...

592
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,263
That would be a change of direction.

593
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:34,105
- Now I've blown it.
- Get it back. He's done the work.

594
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,771
- It's your money.
- Steal it?

595
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,643
A bit below you, stealing?

596
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:43,117
- It's not as if he'll tell.
- Easier said than done.

597
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,620
Rubbish! We'll think of something.

598
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,402
Sorry to interrupt.
We're watching Horton!

599
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:42,909
Yes, sorry.

600
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,038
So, what's the plan?

601
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,446
- What?
- It's your idea. What now, boss?

602
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:55,515
It's easy.
We're stealing the money from him.

603
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,425
Right? Well, when is the best time
to do that, then?

604
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,261
At the perfect moment.

605
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,461
That's what this game is about.

606
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:09,629
Waiting for the perfect moment.

607
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,106
Here it comes.

608
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,772
Here we are, signore.

609
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,381
£100,000.

610
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,043
210 million lire.

611
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,986
- Thank you.
- Scusi. Telefono.

612
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,147
- Grazie.
- Prego.

613
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,066
Actually...

614
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,968
What's the matter, Maurice?

615
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:49,302
- Can I put this in hotel security?
- Si, Signore Orton.

616
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,745
- Horton.
- Orton.

617
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,680
Maurice Horton.

618
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,649
Maurice Horton.

619
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,989
Room 235. Have you got that?

620
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,957
Rossi, you see that case?

621
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,687
Si.

622
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,660
You go shopping.

623
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,496
Maurice Horton.

624
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,493
Please take note.

625
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,765
[Sighs] Thank you.

626
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,475
It's identical, boss.

627
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,445
Perfect.

628
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,714
What's happening?

629
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,784
Are you ready?

630
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,808
Can I place this in... hotel security,
please?

631
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,381
Si, Signore Horton.

632
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,313
No, no, no, Orton.

633
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,215
- Orton.
- Orton.

634
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,081
Orton.

635
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,919
- Room 310.
- Orton.

636
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:16,730
All you've got to do
is get in there and swap the tags.

637
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:23,271
We get the money and that Horton
shit, he gets what he deserves.

638
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,513
Orton.

639
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,753
- Please take note.
- Right, thank you.

640
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,564
I'll pick it up later. Thank you.

641
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,897
Thanks.

642
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,979
You've never felt the need
for a woman's company?

643
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,954
Yes, maybe but it's always been

805
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:52,870
- Isn't that the estate agent girl?
- Is it?

806
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:57,112
What's she hanging around for,
looking so pleased with herself?

807
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,416
You'll have to change your name.

808
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,148
Something boring.

809
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,722
Miss Smith?

810
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,054
How about that, Miss Gladys Smith?

811
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,461
- How about Mrs. Charlton Black?
- Oh!

812
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,329
That's far too exciting.
Who's Charlton Black?

813
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,838
Me.

814
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,171
You don't have to answer straightaway.

815
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:37,776
- It can wait. Think about it.
- Why wait?

816
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,911
This is the perfect moment.

817
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,357
The answer's yes, Charlton.

818
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,426
It's Chuck, really.

819
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,801
The answer's yes, Chuck.

820
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,136
[Engines roar]

821
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:08,706
Bloody hell.

822
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,683
It just needs a little work.

823
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:34,070
[Mutters in Italian]

824
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,916
Faster!

825
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,849
[Rattling]

826
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:44,196
(music) I'm tired of being a yes man
Forever going wrong

827
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:52,171
(music) I'm gonna get my own back, the
world is gonna turn before too long

828
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:58,385
(music) Maybe now at last
I'm feeling strong

829
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:03,688
(music) And I'm waiting
for the perfect moment

830
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:09,220
(music) Looking for an end
to my wasted day

831
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:15,461
(music) The perfect moment

832
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:21,635
(music) Suddenly the world
don't look so gray

833
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:28,342
(music) Got to face the music
and settle up the score

834
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:36,416
(music) A change in my direction
I just can't walk this way no more

835
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:42,153
(music) Now there's a clear path
to your door

836
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:51,333
(music) You know too much about me
Too much to let you go

837
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:58,608
(music) So stay a while longer
Tell me things I really ought to know

838
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:05,378
(music) Gotta find a place
where love can grow

839
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,789
(music) I'm waiting for the perfect moment

840
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:15,894
(music) Looking for an end
to my wasted day

841
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:23,367
(music) I hope I find a way
a way to convince you

842
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:28,569
(music) That we've got a chance
to make a new start

843
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,043
(music) I've been searching hard

844
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:38,917
(music) Don't make no sense
to stay apart

845
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:43,317
(music) You're here in my heart

846
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:11,148
(music) The perfect moment (music)
