1
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,140
Guess how fast we're going now.
I don't care, I'm having a baby!

2
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,300
Hundred and five miles
an hour, you believe that?

3
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,340
Reese, you just passed the hospital!

4
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
The baby's coming, he's coming
now! All right, all right, hold on.

5
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,300
Okay, but I think he might be
stuck. Grab onto something. Ready?

6
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,460
One, two, three!

7
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,300
It's a baby boy.

8
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm happy that Waffle House
was okay with me coming here

9
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,780
To talk to y'all about my daytoday.

10
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,820
And, y'all, that's
pretty much, in a shell

11
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,260
What it's like to manage a Waffle House.

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,940
Ma'am, I don't know what else
you want me to say to them.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,500
And I'm also gonna need to
know where your commode's at.

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,380
Okay, let's give him a
round of applause. Thank you.

15
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,420
Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.
Ricky, is your father here?

16
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,940
No, ma'am. I haven't
seen my daddy in years.

17
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,260
But my mama say he's out racing cars

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,740
And, well, dipping his
wick in anything that moves.

19
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,380
Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're gonna move on to Brennan.

20
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,420
Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.

21
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,980
Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.
You'll be my best friend forever.

22
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,940
His job is like as a prison guard.

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Excuse me, darling. I'm Reese Bobby.

24
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,460
I'm here for career
day with my son, Ricky.

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,340
Dad! Hey there, boy!

26
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,380
Man, you got big. How long's
it been? Three, four months?

27
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,500
Ten years. Ten years?

28
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,940
Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.

29
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,700
Mr. Bobby, there's no smoking in here.

30
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,660
It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,620
Okay, I am a semiprofessional
racecar driver

32
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
And an amateur tattoo artist.

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,660
And the first thing you gotta learn
if you're gonna be a racecar driver

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,340
Is you don't listen to losers

35
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,900
Like your knowitall teacher
here. Okay, I think that's enough.

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,060
Your teacher wants you to
go slow, and she's wrong

37
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,820
Because it's the fastest who gets paid
and it's the fastest who gets laid.

38
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,420
Oh, yeah. You know
what I'm talking about.

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,060
You people are in the wrong on this one!

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,340
So in the wrong!

41
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,340
This is egregious, do
you hear me? Egregious!

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,940
We were cellmates together,
Andy. You got payback coming!

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,460
Dad!

44
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,220
Don't listen to these people,
Ricky. You're a winner.

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,340
You got the gift. Always remember,
if you ain't first, you're last.

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,100
If you ain't first, you're last.

47
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,300
See you when you're grown
up. Dad! Come back, Dad!

48
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,140
It's a hot one here in Talladega

49
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,860
And this crowd of over 180,000
is enjoying one heck of a day.

50
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,580
Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.
Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.

51
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,220
All right, fellas, let's go.

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,940
Looking good. Yes, come on.

53
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,300
Keep it up, baby.

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,660
All right, way to go. Go, way to go.

55
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,380
Nice jack work, Ricky.

56
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,420
Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.

57
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,620
Shake and Bake! Terry, it's
all on you, bro. You go.

58
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,980
Go, baby, go. Wait, what are you doing?

59
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,900
I gotta take a piss. Go, go, go!

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,700
It doesn't matter, Lucius.
We're in last place. Relax.

61
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,660
Jeez, I gotta go take
a whiz. Get off my ass.

62
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,820
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

63
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,460
That's why this group right here
is the laughing stock of NASCAR.

64
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,380
Face it, we suck.

65
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,340
It's not always bad to be in last place.
Here's some things we can focus on:

66
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,540
One, we tried hard. And two,
we're still dear friends.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,140
Glenn, shut up.

68
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,860
I see Terry. He's having
a chicken sandwich.

69
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,860
Hey, fellas! These are really
good. You should try one.

70
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,900
That place actually makes a nice sauce.

71
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
Let me eat this, then I
gotta make a phone call

72
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Then I'm coming back, all
right? This is the bottom line.

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,300
If we don't get that
car back on the track

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,100
Our sponsors are gonna shit a chicken.

75
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,260
Now, is there anyone out there
who wants to go fast? Anybody?

76
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,460
I wanna go fast.

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,380
Hey, get him a suit. Hurry
up, make it snappy. Let's go.

78
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,780
Hustle up, hustle up. Hey, man!

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,500
Remember when we got kicked out of
biology for playing with Matchbox cars?

80
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,220
Yeah! Who's retarded now?

81
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Yeah. Hey, what are
you doing after this?

82
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
After the race? Yeah.

83
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,300
I don't know, but it feels like
we're wasting a lot of time.

84
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,500
No, I know, I know.
I'm just excited, man!

85
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,100
Yeah, I know. Yeah. Hey! I love you!

86
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,820
What? Nothing.

87
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,820
Shake and Bake! Get some!

88
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,180
You're my best friend!
You're my best friend!

89
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,060
Okay, then! I'm in there with you!

90
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,140
I gotta get going! Go, go!

91
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,380
Yeah! That's Ricky, baby!

92
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,900
That's my boy, Ricky!

93
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,420
Hey, Ricky, just remember one thing:

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,580
If you wreck that car, that's
200 grand out of your pocket

95
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,780
So let's take it nice and slow, okay?

96
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,700
With all due respect, Lucius,
I'm gonna do some driving.

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,540
Excuse me, coming through.

98
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,900
Apparently, we've got a situation
for the Laughing Clown, number 26 car.

99
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,900
Terry Cheveaux is refusing to
drive. One of his crew members

100
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,380
Has taken the wheel.

101
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,740
Hey, just wanted to share a little
piece of personal information with you.

102
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,220
I got a chubby right now

103
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,460
Because this is one of the most
awesome experiences of my life

104
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,260
Because I'm getting to drive a racecar!

105
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,140
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,500
Wow, that was cool.

107
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,580
Come on, come on.

108
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,420
The big story from Talladega:

109
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,860
Littleknown jackman Ricky Bobby
places third in the Dennit machine.

110
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,300
Ricky, first of all, where did
you learn to drive like that?

111
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,540
In a car. Car handle really good. Yeah.

112
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Can you speak up, Ricky?

113
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,540
A car. It handled real good.

114
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,140
So, what do you think, Mr.
Dennit? He sure can drive.

115
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,740
He's got guts. Dennit Racing
needs a racer like him.

116
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,660
Come on, Dad. He's just a stupid cowboy.

117
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,420
Look how bad he is in that interview.

118
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,420
Junior, driving has got
nothing to do with interviews.

119
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I just wish to hell you had a
little more stupid cowboy in you.

120
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,300
I felt like I was on a spaceship and....

121
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,020
I'm not sure what to do with my hands.

122
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,100
Be good to hold them down by your side.

123
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,340
We're really happy
with what was going on.

124
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,420
And at the end of the day,
you know, you gotta be happy.

125
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,580
What did you say his name was again?
His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.

126
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,420
Ricky Bobby? He's got two first names.

127
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Whatever his name is,
let's get him over here.

128
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,860
Everything ended up fine.

129
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,260
Yeah, okay, everything was fine.
Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.

130
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,780
Ricky Bobby, a force to
be reckoned with, possibly

131
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,300
In the near future.

132
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Ricky Bobby with yet
another impressive win.

133
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,420
He is dominating NAS CAR.

134
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,300
First or last, baby, you know it!

135
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,300
I've never seen a driver who
wants to win more than this guy.

136
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,900
I could get used to this winning thing!

137
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,740
Dennit Racing Incorporated has
decided to field an additional car.

138
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,820
And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby

139
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,140
Who's been like a son to me, only better

140
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,740
I'm naming Cal Naughton
Jr. As the driver.

141
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,340
All right.

142
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,340
Cal Naughton. Hey

143
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,140
We just want to say to all
you other drivers out there

144
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,380
If you smell a delicious,
crispy smell after the race

145
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,660
It's not your tailpipe,
it's a little bit

146
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,380
Of shake....

147
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,900
And then bake.

148
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,420
Shake and Bake!

149
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,180
That's our nickname.
Get used to hearing it.

150
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,220
And Ricky Bobby wins

151
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,740
With Cal Naughton Jr. Finishing second.

152
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah! Hey, man!

153
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,580
Shake.... And Bake!

154
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,300
Hey, driver! Drive these.

155
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,300
Please be 18.

156
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,660
You want to make this out to Charlotte?

157
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,420
Hey, excuse me, Ricky.

158
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
Hey, Dale. Hey, can
I get your autograph?

159
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,660
Sure. Who do I make this out to?
It's for me. I think you're awesome.

160
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,340
Don't tell the other drivers.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

161
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,900
I'll see you out there.

162
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,100
Absolutely, ma'am, I'd
love to sign your baby.

163
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,300
You're not gonna wanna
wash that forehead.

164
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,300
That's right, Powerade's number one.
Not just for hydration, for vitamin.

165
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,940
No, it's me, it's me,
Susan, your assistant.

166
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,180
Gotta watch it when I
get into autograph mode.

167
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,260
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,
I shouldn't have been standing.

168
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm Ricky Bobby. Christmas
is right around the corner

169
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,220
And what better gift to give a loved one

170
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,980
Than the Jackhawk 9000?

171
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,460
Available at WalMart.

172
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,140
When you work on your
mysterious ladypart stuff

173
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,740
You should have the right tools
too. So that's why you should use

174
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,780
Maypax, the official tampon of NASCAR.

175
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,740
I'm Ricky Bobby.

176
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,180
If you don't chew Big
Red, then fuck you.

177
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,780
Prune candy.

178
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,380
You happy? I'm very happy.

179
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,060
Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,540
Urging you never to travel to Tijuana.

181
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,460
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

182
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay, I'm starting to get sick.

183
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,700
Dick Berggren in Las Vegas,
Victory Lane, for Fox Television.

184
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,820
Ricky Bobby, today's big winner.
Heck of a win for you today

185
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,060
But it seems as if you either win
or crash the car trying to win.

186
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,420
Well, Dick, here's the deal. I'm
the best there is, plain and simple.

187
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,940
I mean, I wake up in the
morning and I piss excellence.

188
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,100
And nobody can hang with my stuff.

189
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,420
You know, I'm just a big,
hairy, American winning machine.

190
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,540
If you ain't first, you're last.
You know what I'm talking about?

191
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,100
That phrase is trademarked

192
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,700
Not to be used without
permission of Ricky Bobby Inc.

193
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,340
Supper's ready! Come on, y'all! I've
been slaving over this for hours!

194
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,380
Dear Lord baby Jesus

195
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,020
Or as our brothers to
the south call you, Jesus

196
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,300
We thank you so much for this
bountiful harvest of Domino's, KFC

197
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,380
And the always delicious Taco Bell.

198
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,380
I just want to take time to
say thank you for my family

199
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,100
My two beautiful, beautiful,
handsome, striking sons

200
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,700
Walker and Texas Ranger

201
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,940
Or T.R., as we call him

202
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,900
And of course, my redhot
smoking wife, Carley

203
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,860
Who is a stonecold fox.

204
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,700
Who if you were to rate her ass
on 100, it would easily be a 94.

205
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,340
Also wanna thank you for my
best friend, Cal Naughton Jr

206
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,340
Who's got my back no matter what.

207
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,500
Shake and Bake.

208
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,820
Dear Lord baby Jesus, we also thank
you for my wife's father, Chip.

209
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
We hope that you can use
your baby Jesus powers

210
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,260
To heal him and his horrible leg.

211
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,060
And it smells terrible and the
dogs are always bothering with it.

212
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Dear tiny infant Jesus, we

213
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,860
Hey, you know, sweetie

214
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,300
Jesus did grow up.

215
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,460
You don't always have
to call him "baby."

216
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,340
It's odd and offputting
to pray to a baby.

217
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Well, I like the Christmas
Jesus best and I'm saying grace.

218
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,220
When you say grace, say it to
grownup Jesus, teenage Jesus

219
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,860
Bearded Jesus, whoever you want.

220
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,380
You know what I want?

221
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,060
I want you to do this grace good,
so that God will let us win tomorrow.

222
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,060
Dear tiny Jesus

223
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,060
In your goldenfleece diapers, with
your tiny, little, fat, balledup fists

224
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,740
Pawing at the air.... He
was a man. He had a beard.

225
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,340
Look, I like the baby version
the best, do you hear me?

226
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,300
I win the races and I get the money.

227
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,140
Ricky, finish the damn grace.

228
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,100
I like to picture
Jesus in a tuxedo Tshirt

229
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,940
Because it says, like,
"I wanna be formal...

230
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,860
Right. ...but I'm here to party too."

231
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,380
Because I like to party,
so I like my Jesus to party.

232
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,220
I like to picture Jesus as a
ninja fighting off evil samurai.

233
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,380
I like to think of Jesus,
like, with giant eagle's wings.

234
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,460
And singing lead vocals
for Lynyrd Skynyrd

235
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,460
With, like, a angel band.

236
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,420
And I'm in the front row,
and I'm hammered drunk.

237
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,380
Hey, Cal? Why don't you just shut up?

238
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,540
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

239
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:49,220
Dear 8pound, 6ounce,
newborn infant Jesus

240
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,340
Don't even know a word yet

241
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,540
Just a little infant and so
cuddly, but still omnipotent

242
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,300
We just thank you for all the races
I've won and the 2 1.2 million dollars

243
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,220
Love that money!

244
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,820
That I have accrued
over this past season.

245
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,180
Also, due to a binding
endorsement contract

246
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,820
That stipulates I mention
Powerade at each grace

247
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,340
I just wanna say that
Powerade is delicious

248
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,580
And it cools you off
on a hot summer day.

249
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,460
And we look forward to Powerade's
release of Mystic Mountain BIueberry.

250
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,100
Thank you for all your power and
your grace, dear baby God. Amen.

251
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,380
Amen. Amen.

252
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,900
Let's dig in!

253
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,140
That was a hell of a grace, man.
You nailed that like a split hog!

254
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm not gonna lie to you, it felt good.

255
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,980
Dad, you made that grace your bitch.

256
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,460
Hey, boys, I wanna see
some napkins in the lap.

257
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,060
Boys, how was school today?

258
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,340
I threw a bunch of Grandpa
Chip's war medals off the bridge.

259
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,900
Sounds like a good day.
Texas Ranger, how about you?

260
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,380
Well, the teacher asked me what
was the capital of North Carolina.

261
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,460
I said, "Washington, D.C."

262
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
Bingo. Nice.

263
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,900
She said, "No, you're wrong."
I said, "You got a Iumpy butt."

264
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,300
She got mad at me and yelled
at me and I pissed in my pants.

265
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,300
And I never did change
my pee pants all day.

266
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,460
I'm still sitting in my dirty pee pants.

267
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,020
I wet my bed until I was
19. There's no shame in that.

268
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,620
I get emotional because you
guys are working so hard.

269
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm just so proud of
you. You remind me of me

270
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,620
Precocious and full of wonderment.

271
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,740
Tell you what, Ricky,
you are truly blessed.

272
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,340
These two are two in a million. I am.

273
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,460
Just like Carley's tatas.

274
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,820
You won't find another
rack like that, I guarantee.

275
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,660
Thank you, Cal.

276
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,420
That's real sweet of you, Cal.

277
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,380
That's real nice. That's one of
the nicest things you've ever said.

278
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,180
Well, I mean it. Stop,
you're gonna make me cry.

279
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,060
It comes from my heart, that's why.

280
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,340
I can't hold my tongue.

281
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,860
These kids are my grandchildren,
and you are raising them wrong.

282
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,380
They are terrible boys.

283
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,180
Shut up, Chip, or I'll
go apeshit on your ass!

284
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm gonna scissorkick you
in the back of the head.

285
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,980
Yeah! Yeah. Turn up the heat.

286
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,700
Go on and get some, boys.

287
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm 10 years old, but
I'll beat your ass.

288
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,980
Chip, I'm gonna come at
you like a spider monkey.

289
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,860
Like a spider monkey! Go on.

290
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,260
Chip, you brought this on.

291
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,340
The greatest generation, my ass.

292
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,060
Tom Brokaw is a punk.

293
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
What is wrong with you?

294
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,620
Chip, I'm all jacked up on Mountain Dew.

295
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,500
I love that.

296
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,300
You gonna let your sons talk to their
grandfather like that? I'm their elder.

297
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,380
I sure as hell am, Chip. I love
the way they're talking to you.

298
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,380
They're winners. Winners
get to do what they want.

299
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,060
Hell, you're just a bag of bones.

300
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,020
Only thing you ever done with
your life is make a hot daughter.

301
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,220
That's it. That is it!

302
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,540
We wanted us some wussies

303
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,460
We would've named them Dr.
Quinn and Medicine Woman, okay?

304
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,780
I work too hard for your bull, Chip.

305
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,780
Come here. You make me hot. Come here.

306
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,260
Everyone just keep eating.

307
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,980
It's on. Come here. Come here.

308
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,820
All right.

309
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,420
I'll hold your hair.

310
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,420
Hey, Stephen. Hey, Ricky.

311
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,380
Got those two tickets
for my special friend?

312
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,300
Yeah, sure do. You know I do,
Ricky. Got them right here, buddy.

313
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,660
Great. Hey, how's your mama's hip?

314
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,980
She's gonna be all right,
thank you for asking.

315
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,260
Appreciate it. Hey,
good Iuck today. Thanks.

316
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,780
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

317
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,700
That boy leaves two tickets
for his daddy at every race

318
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,260
And he never shows up.

319
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,220
That's a shame.

320
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,380
The human heart is such a mystery.

321
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,900
Let's sell these
bitches, huh? Hell, yeah.

322
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,900
Beer money, huh? There you go. Yes.

323
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,540
As the laps wind down,
Jamie McMurray is the leader.

324
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,820
Cal Naughton in second.
Ricky Bobby in third.

325
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,540
What's up, Cal? You ready
for a little ShakeandBakeage?

326
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,540
Hey, buddy. Naughton Jr.
Is letting Ricky Bobby

327
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,300
Draft up to him to make that
slingshot move past McMurray.

328
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,140
Can you believe that he would
do that for his teammate?

329
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,940
Set him up that way?

330
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Slingshot, engage.

331
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,260
And there goes Ricky
Bobby on the outside!

332
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
That's how we do it.

333
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,260
Makes his move. Naughton's
giving him plenty of room.

334
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,020
What in the hell is he doing,
guys? Get him off of me.

335
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,340
They touch! They spin!

336
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,620
Snap!

337
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,580
Come on, man!

338
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,660
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

339
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,980
Look at that! Ricky Bobby's gonna
try to win the race in reverse.

340
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,860
Man, he wants this win bad!

341
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,700
Ricky Bobby wins it in reverse!

342
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,740
Unbelievable! I love that! That is cool!

343
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,900
Jamie, losing's never fun, but here's
something to pick your spirits up.

344
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,700
It's real nice. I got it
at Target. It's on sale.

345
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,980
Yeah!

346
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,060
That's it. Another one. Another
one. All right, man. We did it!

347
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,700
I don't wanna be raining on
your parade, but I gotta tell you

348
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,020
That was some of the dumbest
driving I have ever seen in my life.

349
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,100
Thank you. And I know you won the race

350
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,820
But you're not gonna live forever.

351
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,820
I'm not stupid, Lucius. No
one lives forever. No one.

352
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,340
But with advances in modern
science and my high level of income

353
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,860
I mean, it's not crazy to think I
can't live to be 2 45, maybe 300.

354
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,500
I just read in the newspaper they
put a pig heart in some Russian guy.

355
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,100
Know what? I mean, do
you know what that means?

356
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,860
No, I don't know what that
means. I guess, longer life.

357
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Well, no, he didn't
live. He didn't live?

358
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,700
No. It's just exciting that
we're trying things like that.

359
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,540
Ricky? Hey, Mr. Dennit.

360
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,820
Cheers. Yeah.

361
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,420
She already wasted? Celebrating.

362
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,740
She's celebrating. You
feel pretty good today, huh?

363
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,940
Look, Ricky, early word out of NASCAR

364
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,860
Is your little obscene gesture's
gonna cost you 100 points.

365
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,380
You know how much that costs
us in sponsorship dollars?

366
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,300
With all due respect, Mr. Dennit

367
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,500
I had no idea you had experimental
surgery to have your balls removed.

368
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,740
What did you say? What was that?

369
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,820
Well, what? I said,
"With all due respect."

370
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,740
That doesn't mean you get to
say whatever you wanna say to me.

371
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,580
It sure as heck does. No, it doesn't.

372
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,420
It's in the Geneva
Convention. Look it up.

373
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,820
I remember your daddy used to love it.

374
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,660
This is not my dad This is my team
Used to love it when I used to win.

375
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,380
Now, I suggest you and
your wife, Mrs. Jim Beam

376
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,580
You guys go take a chill
pill. Enjoy the win!

377
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,500
Come on, man! Yeah, Ricky. Okay.

378
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,380
Baby, photo op, photo op. Come on.

379
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,300
Come on, number one.

380
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Hold my hand, baby.

381
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,460
I'll tell you what, though, guys,
that was a hell of a race today.

382
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,380
Shake and Bake in full effect.
It's always been like that.

383
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,340
Me and Ricky, since we
were little kids, man.

384
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,660
We go together like Chinese food
and chocolate pudding. Let's face it.

385
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,540
Yeah, but those are two things
that don't really go together.

386
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,260
We go together like cocaine and waffles.

387
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,180
No, like, for instance, if
I say peanut butter and....

388
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,660
Ladies, right? Yep.

389
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,060
No, jelly. Am I right?

390
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,420
Jelly? You like to put jelly on a lady?

391
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm gonna settle this thing.
Let's just get ourselves

392
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,540
A whole mess of cocktails, get
drunk and work this thing out.

393
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,380
Work this thing out. That's right.

394
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,260
So I was talking to Nana on
Saturday, and her birthday's coming up

395
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,660
But I don't know what to
get her. She's gonna be 88.

396
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,540
Get her a coffin.

397
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,420
Hey, Cal, I'm sorry
about wrecking you today.

398
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I mean, but that was for the team.
No, that's cool. That's cool, I know.

399
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,060
I was thinking, though, one time

400
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,860
It would be really awesome if, like,
you could slingshot me in for a win.

401
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,620
Yeah, but Okay, but if you won

402
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,220
How am I gonna win? Yeah.

403
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,940
Think about it. No, I
was thinking about it.

404
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,260
I mean, it's not like
you're finishing 18th.

405
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,380
There's nothing wrong with silver.
Nothing wrong with silver at all.

406
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,940
I'm just kidding you,
man. I don't wanna win.

407
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
I'll just bury it down inside.

408
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,620
Bury it deep down in there,
and never bring it up again.

409
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,060
It's painful, and I love you!

410
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,140
Get her a gigolo.

411
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,980
What? A guy to have sex with her.

412
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,100
No, she's gonna be 88 and....

413
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,860
You don't stop liking
sex when you're old.

414
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,340
Well, I was thinking
more along the line of....

415
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,060
Like, she likes afghans and quilts.
She's probably got a million of those.

416
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,340
How many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her?

417
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,620
None. Exactly.

418
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Be thoughtful, Glenn.

419
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,900
Don't stop.

420
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,740
What is that?

421
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,460
Someone made a tape of
something dying or something.

422
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,500
Hey, turn that crap
off. What's going on?

423
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,620
I want this music out of my head.

424
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,420
Hey, turn that off!

425
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,820
Turn that off right now!

426
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,060
Why did you stop the jazz music?

427
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,060
Was it not pleasant for you?

428
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,180
No one plays jazz here
at The Pit Stop, okay?

429
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,820
So why is the song on the jukebox?

430
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,260
We keep it on there
for profiling purposes.

431
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,420
We also got the Pet Shop Boys and Seal.

432
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,180
My name is Jean Girard

433
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,940
And I am a racingcar
driver just like you

434
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,180
Except I am from Formula Un.

435
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,660
I am the greatest one
in the whole world.

436
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,340
I have been following your career
with great interest, Monsieur Bobby.

437
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,060
I can't understand a word
you've said the whole time.

438
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,060
Did you eat peanut butter or something?

439
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,260
You sound like a dog with peanut
butter on the roof of your mouth.

440
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,980
I think what you are
hearing is my accent.

441
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,660
I am French.

442
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,420
You say you're French?

443
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,420
We? No, we are not French.

444
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,780
We're American, because
you're in America, okay?

445
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,460
Greatest country on the planet.

446
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,460
Well, what have you given the world

447
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,860
Apart from George Bush,
Cheerios, and the ThighMaster?

448
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,940
Chinese food? Chinese food.

449
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,460
That's from China.

450
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,660
Pizza. Italy.

451
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,340
Chimichanga. Mexican.

452
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,300
Really, smartypants? What
did French land give us?

453
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,620
We invented democracy, existentialism

454
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,060
And the blowjob.

455
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,180
Those are three pretty good things. Hey.

456
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,900
Well, that last one's pretty cool.

457
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,820
You know, the 69 with the
head near the That bit.

458
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,260
We came up with it.

459
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,820
We created the missionary position.

460
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,580
You're welcome. Ricky Bobby

461
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,860
I have come here to defeat you.

462
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,900
Oh, well, there's strikes
two and three right there.

463
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,140
Did you hear what he just said?

464
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,580
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

465
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,660
You are fast, Ricky Bobby

466
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,140
But I am faster.

467
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,020
All right, you let go of me,
you Formula One jazz nutjob!

468
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,700
Like the frightened baby chipmunk

469
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,700
You are scared by
anything that is different.

470
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,300
I will let you go, Ricky

471
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,660
But first I want you to say:

472
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,580
"I love crepes."

473
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,380
Don't you say it, Ricky.
These colors don't run.

474
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,180
I'm not gonna say it. Good.

475
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Hey, look, Frenchy, I thought about it.

476
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,940
So why don't you go
ahead and break my arm?

477
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,260
I do not want to break
your arm, Monsieur Bobby

478
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,020
But I am a man of my word.

479
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,340
Here's the deal. He's not gonna break it

480
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,860
Because I'm gonna slip out
of it right now. Houdini.

481
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,420
Get down, you little pancake.

482
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,140
Someone get me a beer while I'm here.

483
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
But you have forced me to do this.

484
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,380
You are now mocking me and
making me look ridiculous.

485
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,380
Just say, "I love crepes."

486
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,300
You know, just to put this in there, I
had a whole mess of crepes this morning.

487
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,460
They're like pancakes,
maybe even better.

488
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,380
Are they the really thin pancakes? Yeah.

489
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,420
They are the really thin pancakes.
It's just a French word for them.

490
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,260
My God, I love those. Put
any syrups you want on them.

491
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,300
I'm saying, think about it.
They come with cheese sometimes?

492
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,220
Yes, of course, a fromagecrepe.

493
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,340
Well, why didn't someone
yell that right away?

494
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,300
You know what's in the crepe suzette?

495
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,460
Oh, I love the crepe
suzette. With the sugar

496
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,340
And lemon juice, Grand
Marnier. Sugar and lemon juice.

497
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,060
I wish I could crawl into
one of those right now.

498
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,900
I'd eat my way out from
the inside. They are tasty.

499
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,540
Either way this goes, could
we get some after we're done?

500
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,380
Absolutely. We're gonna do
that. So, what if you just said:

501
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,900
"I love really thin pancakes"?
That is a fair compromise, no?

502
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,300
That is a fair compromise.
Very fair, actually.

503
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,180
No! Because then everyone would
know I really meant crepes.

504
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,860
That's a pretty good compromise.

505
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,980
Why do you want me to
break your arm so badly?

506
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,340
You don't understand because
you don't understand liberty.

507
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,380
You don't understand freedom.

508
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,260
So you put a crack in my arm like
the crack in the Liberty Bell.

509
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,380
Hey. This is just
between you and me, okay?

510
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,820
I mean, forget all these other guys.

511
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,740
But he did give you a pretty
decent out. But it's your call.

512
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,620
What do you think?

513
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,300
Don't say it. Yeah.
I'm not gonna say it.

514
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,900
Break it, Pepe Le Pew.

515
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,460
As you wish.

516
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,860
He actually did it! All
right. You did it. Back off.

517
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,900
I didn't say it! No, you did not.

518
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,460
Your injury is one of
ignorance and pride.

519
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,380
Hold it right there, Mr.
Fancy Pants Foreigner.

520
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,980
You just broke my bro's arm.

521
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,740
Now you're about to get Tasered.

522
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,900
Say hello to Dr. Watts. Get him, Cal.

523
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,260
I need you all to step away

524
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,700
From my driver.

525
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,860
The hell you talking about, "my
driver"? What are you doing with a gun?

526
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
Don't you worry about my gun, Ricky.

527
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,620
Jean Girard is my new boy at
Dennit Racing. He's here to win us

528
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,540
An overallpoints championship,
something you apparently

529
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,460
Have no interest in. He's
gonna usher in a new era.

530
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,340
Mr. Dennit, with all due respect

531
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,740
And remember, I'm saying,
"with all due respect."

532
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,380
That idea ain't worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.

533
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,660
That's good. That's good
fun. That's good fun, Ricky

534
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,820
But that doesn't bother me
anymore because Jean is the future

535
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,340
Ricky, the past.

536
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,820
So, Jean, introduce me
to your new teammates.

537
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,620
Everybody, this is my husband, Gregory.

538
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,420
What?

539
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,140
See you at the track.

540
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,220
Did he just say "husband"?

541
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,820
Sweet Lord. Dennit hired a
gay Frenchman as your teammate.

542
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,420
The room's starting to spin real fast.

543
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,940
Because of gayness.

544
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,900
Cal, I love you. Ricky? Ricky! Oh, God!

545
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,860
Fans and NASCAR, everyone is talking
about this new driver, Jean Girard.

546
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,460
Let's find out a little bit more about
him from our reporter, Davey Wesling.

547
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,380
Talented. Eccentric. Dominating.

548
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,060
These are the words
that define Jean Girard.

549
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,180
Before each race, Jean Girard spends
time with his worldclass horses

550
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,460
Who are also gay.

551
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,060
Jean's days are filled
with sundrenched walks

552
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,340
With his beloved husband, Gregory.

553
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,180
Though Gregory is no stayathome spouse.

554
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,340
He's a worldclass trainer
of German shepherds.

555
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,700
Rolfe, the Nazi boyfriend. Up on top!

556
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,260
Very nice. Very nice.

557
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,460
Only time will tell if
Jean's foray into NAS CAR

558
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,780
Will end up in Victory Lane.

559
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,660
Well, kiss my ass on Sunday.

560
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,860
Lucius, what the hell is
going on? The man can drive.

561
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,900
And check out his crew chief over there.

562
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,420
Won the Nobel Prize
for physics back in '93.

563
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a new track record.

564
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,380
As it stands now, Jean Girard is
sitting on the pole, which is, of course

565
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,700
A statement of fact
and in no way a comment

566
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,740
On the driver's sexual orientation.

567
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,700
Put a smile on your face? That's
the future of Dennit Racing.

568
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,380
That make you happy? I'm
just thrilled, Mr. Dennit.

569
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,540
I love seeing some
French guy break my record

570
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,580
While I got my arm wrapped
up like a fricking gordita.

571
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,300
Hello, Ricky Bobby.

572
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,780
What happened last week was
very regrettable and unfortunate

573
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,620
And, as a gesture, I would like to

574
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,380
Sign your cast, please.

575
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,180
Hell, you know what, get my
car off the trailer, guys.

576
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,980
Baby! That's my baby!

577
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,420
Hold on, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky,
Rick. What are you talking about?

578
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,180
Look. I wanna drive. My arm's fine.
So let's get the car off the trailer.

579
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,340
Don't look at me. Get
it off the trailer!

580
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,820
Even with a healthy arm, you don't
have a chance against Jean Girard.

581
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,820
All right, fellas. You heard the
man. Get the car off. Let's go.

582
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,460
You guys heard it.

583
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,300
What's going on? Soon you
will know what it is like

584
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,020
To be defeated by the hands of
somebody who is truly better than you.

585
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,580
As William Blake wrote, "The
cut worm forgives the plow."

586
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,660
Well, let me just quote the
late, great Colonel Sanders

587
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,380
Who said, "I'm too drunk
to taste this chicken."

588
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,460
What's that got to do with this?

589
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,340
I got a message for all of
them. Ready? Shake and Bake!

590
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,060
What does that do? Does that blow
your mind? That just happened!

591
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,460
What is that, a catch
phrase or is that epilepsy?

592
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,340
Shake and Bake. Shake and Bake. What?

593
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,220
Listen, you better be careful because
tomorrow you're going to get beaten.

594
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,380
Beaten real bad, cowboy.

595
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,100
Really? Yes!

596
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,300
I don't want to know. That's news to me.

597
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,860
Tomorrow you'll be in trouble.
I'll rip you a new one.

598
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,420
There's going to be a croissant
I'm going to take away.

599
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,700
I play for keeps!

600
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,060
I give you one option, Monsieur Bobby.

601
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,300
As a sign of humility, if
you kiss me on the lips now

602
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,260
I will return to Paris and you
will never see me again in NASCAR.

603
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,780
The answer is never!

604
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,620
I close my Do you hear me? Never ever!

605
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,500
Well, yes or no? That's sick.

606
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,460
Let me tell you, hold
on. Shake and Bake.

607
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,780
Yeah!

608
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,780
What does that mean? It makes no sense!

609
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,740
This "Shake and Bake," it's nonsense.

610
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,340
Hey, baby. You guys are
so smooth. Thanks, darling.

611
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,420
Cal, you could say that 10,000 times
and it still wouldn't be enough.

612
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,900
It fires me up. I love
it. Say it one more time.

613
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,100
Shake and Bake! Doesn't that feel good?

614
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,380
Yeah! It rhymes, they're
both verbs. It's awesome.

615
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,860
NAS CAR on Fox welcomes
you to Lowe's Motor Speedway

616
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,500
Where tonight we'll go 500 miles.

617
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,060
The big stories tonight are
at both ends of the grid.

618
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,500
Up front, Larry, the surprising
French Formula One driver, Jean Girard.

619
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,980
And at the opposite end of
the grid, Darrell, Ricky Bobby.

620
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,340
I saw Ricky Bobby last night walking
around with a cast on his arm.

621
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,460
Now, I don't know who he conned
into letting him start this race.

622
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
Just keep a camera
on him all night long.

623
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,460
I am so excited.

624
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,300
This is a new era for
Dennit Racing, huh?

625
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
So serious all the time
about your big race team.

626
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,020
Who cares? But this is
my life. This is my life.

627
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,700
You know what? There's only one
good thing about coming to the races

628
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,700
And that is the
vibrations from the cars.

629
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,780
Oh, I love when them cars whiz by.

630
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,500
Can feel the motor

631
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,020
Running up my legs.

632
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,060
Ricky Bobby, who never met
a sponsor he wouldn't push

633
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Has a Fig Newton sticker
on his windshield.

634
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Think NAS CAR will
blackflag him for that.

635
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,820
He sold the windshield!

636
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,740
This sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient, but I love Fig Newtons.

637
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,420
Ricky Bobby started
this race in the back

638
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,900
But he's making no friends
on the way to the front.

639
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,740
I'm all about getting to the front
tonight, Lucius. Let's go! Let's move it!

640
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,860
Well, he's driving like a man possessed.

641
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,860
I'm not even sure he realizes how
much damage he's doing to his car.

642
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,100
Hey, Ricky. You know you're driving
like a pissedoff teenager, okay?

643
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,980
Where is that Frenchy?

644
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,220
I got you, Pepe Le Bitch.

645
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,500
Oh, Ricky Bobby.

646
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,420
Hey, it's me, America.

647
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,020
Yeah, I'm here.

648
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,620
You have spilled my macchiato.

649
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,580
Look at Girard in the 55.

650
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,660
He's made that car three lanes
wide, but he's still fast.

651
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,620
No, no, no, my friend. This
way also closed. Not this way.

652
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,460
Lucius, what's he doing?
He's everywhere at once.

653
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,020
Guy's dangerous, Ricky.
He's like a cobra. Back off!

654
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Where's Cal? I need
a little support here!

655
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,940
Tell Ricky I'm on my way.

656
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,100
Damn it!

657
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,980
Hey, Ricky, listen.

658
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:26,140
Cal blew out his engine.
You have no backup. Back off!

659
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,420
I ain't backing off. I'm Ricky
Bobby, I'm the best there is.

660
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,340
He's too good, Ricky. Lay off!

661
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Bobby's boxed in. There's
nowhere to go there.

662
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,340
He's gonna try the outside move
again. I don't know if it's gonna work.

663
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,140
Come on, Daddy!

664
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,980
Come on, Daddy! Whoop his butt!

665
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,740
Send that weird man back to Indonesia.

666
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,420
Come on! Bobby moves to the outside.

667
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,380
Not a lot of room. He's in the wall!

668
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,740
Bobby is sliding,
slamming into the wall.

669
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,700
He's airborne!

670
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,300
Yep. I'm flying through
the air. This is not good.

671
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,140
Ricky! Cool!

672
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,020
Ricky!

673
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,420
Peaches and cream!

674
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,500
The car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke.

675
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,620
Ricky Bobby appears to be okay

676
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,340
But that Wonder Bread car is toast.

677
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,220
Fantastic.

678
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,020
Oh, my God! Ricky!

679
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,340
Hakuna matata, bitches.

680
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,820
It's okay, guys, it's just
a wreck. Ricky can handle it.

681
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,420
Now, that's one of the
nastiest wrecks you'll ever see.

682
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,660
Oh, no, no, no.

683
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,860
It's all right. You're safe.

684
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,020
You're safe. We got you. We're here.

685
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm on fire.

686
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,020
It's all right. It's all
right, you're not on fire!

687
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,980
You're lying! I'm on
fire! There is no fire.

688
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,700
I'm on fire. I don't
wanna die. Come back here.

689
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,500
But something looks wrong. I mean,
he's running around like he's on fire.

690
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,380
Oh, my God! Help me! I don't
wanna die! Stop, drop, and roll!

691
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,140
You're not on fire,
Ricky Bobby! I'm on fire!

692
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,740
You're not on fire.

693
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,220
But I'm not even sure he even
knows where he's at right now.

694
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,340
This makes us all realize the kind
of pressure these drivers are under.

695
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,940
Mr. Bobby, come on down here.

696
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,740
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jewish God!

697
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,460
Help me, Allah!

698
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,260
Help me, Tom Cruise!

699
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,020
But how did he get down
to his underwear that fast?

700
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,460
Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft
on me to get the fire off me!

701
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,940
Look. Here, help's coming.

702
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,860
Wait a minute! It's Cal Naughton.

703
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,340
Oh, God! Please don't let the
invisible fire burn my friend!

704
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,940
I got you! I got you,
man! I'll help you!

705
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,860
He's jumping on Ricky, trying
to put the nonexistent fire out.

706
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,580
Now, that's a teammate right there.

707
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,420
This is going downhill fast.

708
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,380
It would be a great time
to go to commercial break.

709
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,740
Help me, Oprah Winfrey!

710
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,500
You know, Larry, there's good days
in racing, and there's bad days.

711
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,020
Ricky Bobby just had himself a bad day.

712
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,020
He's suffering from catatonic shock.

713
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,740
His injuries are minor, but right now he
can't deal with the trauma of the wreck.

714
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,100
Golly, this is a hard decision.

715
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,180
But I have thought about it,
and I want the plug pulled.

716
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,700
Yeah.

717
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,220
Ma'am, your husband's not dying.

718
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,620
He's just taking a nap.

719
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,060
Just look at him. No, I'm not lying.

720
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,500
I've never seen him
make that noise. Ever.

721
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,220
Got more plugs in him
than a Circuit City.

722
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,060
Oh, baby. Mama loves you so much.

723
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,340
Hey, Ricky. It's me, Cal.

724
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,940
Just want you to know, I got
your back, bro. No matter what.

725
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,340
There's something I
want to get off my chest

726
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,380
And it's about that summer when
you went away to community college.

727
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,060
I got a offer to do Playgirl magazine

728
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,660
And I did it.

729
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,140
I did a full spread
for Playgirl magazine.

730
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,540
I mean spread, man. I pulled
my butt apart and stuff

731
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,060
And I was totally
nude, and it was weird.

732
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,980
You probably didn't hear about it

733
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,420
Because I went under
the name of Mike Honcho.

734
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,300
But I just wanted you to know that.

735
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,300
If you could hear me, if it
got into your brain somehow

736
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,740
That I spread my butt
cheeks as Mike Honcho.

737
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,820
"Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

738
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,940
Gretchen, my friend, got her
period. I'm so jealous, God.

739
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,100
I hate myself for being
so jealous, but I am.

740
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,380
I wish you'd help me just a little.

741
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,180
Nancy's sure she's going to get
it soon too. And if I'm last...."

742
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,380
Hey, Ricky. Ricky!

743
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,620
Come on, man, wake up.

744
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,540
Are you faking it?

745
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,300
Are you faking it? Fake it!

746
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,300
I don't know how much longer I
can take seeing you like this.

747
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,940
I am not gonna let you die here

748
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,100
Like some kind of vegetable.

749
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm gonna put an end to this right now.

750
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,380
Get all this crap off you.

751
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,700
You don't need any of this crap.

752
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,140
This is it. This is how it ends.

753
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,820
This is how Shake and Bake ends.

754
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,660
It's shadow time, buddy.

755
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,740
It's time to go home to Jesus.

756
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,460
Goodbye, buddy.

757
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,420
Oh, wow, you definitely

758
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,980
You definitely still
got some fight in you.

759
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,500
Okay, maybe we give this another day.

760
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,340
Middle. I'll go up to the
middle. Let's play some defense!

761
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,340
I just wanna say thanks, doc,
for taking care of our boy here.

762
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,740
Oh, shit. That's a foul! That's a foul!

763
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,420
Doc, give it to me straight.

764
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,820
Is he ever gonna be able to walk again?

765
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,900
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
someone had told you. He's fine.

766
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,780
He found that wheelchair in the hallway.

767
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,860
His paralysis is entirely psychosomatic.

768
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,660
But we all need to go along with
this, because he's in a delicate state.

769
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,340
So when you say
psychosomatic, you mean, like

770
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,100
He could start a fire with his thoughts?

771
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,300
No, not at all. It means
it's all in his mind.

772
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,180
I'm saying, sometimes you get a knock
on the head, you get special powers.

773
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,700
It happens all the time.
Read a comic book, okay?

774
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,460
Everyone's real friendly.

775
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
It doesn't hurt being Ricky
Bobby. I'm not gonna lie to you.

776
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,300
So how's the physical therapy going?

777
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,380
Oh, I gave that up. Yeah, I gave that up

778
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,700
After maybe the first day. Within
the first hour, I gave that up.

779
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,980
I'm through lying to myself, you know?

780
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,580
It's time to be mature about
this and just face facts.

781
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,340
I bought myself a hundredthousanddollar

782
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,780
Handicapaccessible van

783
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,660
With the captain's chairs and the DVD
plasma screens in the back for the kids.

784
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,300
You all paid up on that?
Yeah. That's all paid in full.

785
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,500
It's parked out there. And
then the next thing I gotta do

786
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,660
Is I just gotta have a sitdown
with Carley and just let her know

787
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,860
That it's okay for her to
seek the comfort of other men.

788
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,180
Because she's gotta run wild. You
can't keep something like that back.

789
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,740
Hold on, man. Hold....

790
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,220
We gotta tell him. Now?

791
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,180
No, I don't care what the doctor
said, we gotta tell him now.

792
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,900
Ricky, the doctor told us

793
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,900
That we should let you work
it out in your own sweet time

794
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,340
But, Ricky, you can walk.

795
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,420
What did you just say?

796
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,580
He's telling you the truth,
man. It's all in your head.

797
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,300
You sick sons of bitches!

798
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,300
I mean, you walk in that door

799
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,020
On your two legs, all fat and cocky

800
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,700
And looking at me in my chair, and
you tell me it's all in my head?

801
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,900
I hope that both of you have sons.

802
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:40,100
Handsome, beautiful, articulate sons
who are talented and star athletes

803
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,180
And they have their legs taken away!

804
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,340
I pray you know that pain and that hurt.

805
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,740
Don't you put that
evil on me, Ricky Bobby!

806
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,420
Don't you put that on
us! You are not paralyzed!

807
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,340
I am so paralyzed!

808
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,900
No, no, no! No, he needs to know!
Getting a little rough on him.

809
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,420
He's always crying! Tough
love, it is. Tough love.

810
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,460
Wake up, idiot! You
wanna know what I am?!

811
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,020
You wanna see what my life is?!

812
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,340
Don't do it.

813
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,780
You wanna see what's going on here?
Don't you stick that knife in your leg.

814
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,860
Man! Hold on, hold on.

815
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,460
Hold on, now. Walk it
off. Oh, that hurts.

816
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,860
Oh, my! Walk it off.

817
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,860
Stretch, stretch. Stretch it out.

818
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,460
Hey, man. You can walk! You can walk!

819
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,380
I can walk!

820
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,460
I think I touched a nerve. Right there.

821
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,380
All right, we got it, we
got it. Hold it right there.

822
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,780
Maybe don't touch it.

823
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,900
Can you feel it? I can!

824
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,420
We'll use this knife to pry
it out. We'll pull it out.

825
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,300
Now we got two in there.
Just don't think about it.

826
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,700
We're going down a bad
path. Cut around the meat.

827
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,580
I'll cut right here. Stretch it out.

828
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,140
Just take out a plug of
meat. Just like a deer.

829
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,060
We gotta wiggle it a little bit.
That's it. Can you feel that?

830
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,060
Yeah, I feel that. You are back!

831
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,820
I love you guys!

832
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,180
Hey, I'm sorry, guys. I mean, I
hope your boys don't lose their legs.

833
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,540
Thanks, buddy. So when
do I get to drive again?

834
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,780
Well, that's the thing. The doctor
said you suffered major trauma

835
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,380
And he thinks you should
take it slow for a while.

836
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,300
Yeah, so, I was thinking, like,
while you're resting up and stuff

837
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,300
Maybe you could let me win
a few. Well, there you go.

838
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,340
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

839
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,860
Yeah. I'm Ricky Bobby. I
mean, you know how I play it.

840
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,300
Yeah. First or last, right, baby?

841
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,820
Don't know what I was thinking. Besides

842
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,860
Dennit Jr. Must be freaking
out. All the money he's losing?

843
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,580
Without me on the track?

844
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,060
I mean, I just laugh

845
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,220
Thinking about him whining all
the time, bitching and moaning:

846
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,300
"Damn, I wish Ricky was here."

847
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,140
You know what I mean?

848
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,020
What?

849
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,580
Frenchy can drive.

850
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,740
Oh, no.

851
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,340
Very good.

852
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,740
C'est la vie and que sera, sera.

853
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,980
It looks like the
NASCAR has gone French.

854
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,900
Well, in other news, Ricky Bobby

855
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,220
Is going to be running some test
laps this weekend at Rockingham

856
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,580
In an attempt to come
back from his grisly crash.

857
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,340
It's one of the hardest
things to do in racing.

858
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,180
To try to bounce back after
a devastating, violent wreck.

859
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,740
Ricky Bobby was traumatized
during the incident.

860
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,300
All right, baby. Come on, now.

861
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,740
But today he gets to strap back into
a racecar for the first time since

862
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,140
To try to show he can
still get the job done.

863
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,500
He's gonna be great. Yep.
He's gonna be great, sure.

864
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,420
Would you stop staring at
me like that, Susan? I swear

865
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,220
You are the weirdest
little girl I've ever seen.

866
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,100
Okay, I'm really gonna open it up!

867
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,380
I missed you, Mama
Speed. Ricky Bobby's back.

868
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,300
Wait, how fast is he going?

869
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,020
Twentysix miles an hour.

870
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,820
What were those things?
Were those the other cars?

871
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,780
Oh, God. So fast.

872
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,700
Go, baby! There you are.

873
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,660
Am I on fire? I'm on fire.

874
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,860
No, no, you're not on
fire. Stretch it out.

875
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,620
It's okay, baby. Take it easy.

876
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,900
Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick. Oh, God.

877
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,940
Oh, he's in his underwear again.
Ricky! Please put your clothes on.

878
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,300
He's in his underwear
again. Go get him, fellas.

879
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,820
Oh, Lord.

880
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,860
You know who's gonna be
number one at Dennit Racing?

881
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,460
Not Ricky? I'm gonna windmill you.

882
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,380
Mr. Cal Naughton Jr.

883
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,300
Come back at him. It's
the only way. Who are you?

884
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,100
Number one. No.

885
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,740
Oh, yes, ma'am. Ricky! Come on, man!

886
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,460
It's embarrassing.

887
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,300
The ninjas are trying to get me.
The ninjas are trying to get me.

888
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,420
Oh, my God. What happened?

889
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,940
What happened? He's done. He's done.

890
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,620
That's what's happened.
It's over. He's finished.

891
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,380
What's gonna happen to me?

892
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,620
I feel like I was riding inside an
asteroid or a comet or something.

893
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,860
Yeah, you were going fast.

894
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,180
Look at that. What are we gonna do?

895
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,900
This is ugly. This is bad
for all of us. Look at that.

896
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,100
I gotta go check on cuckoo
bird. No, cuckoo's okay.

897
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,980
Why don't you get over there
and settle down Carley for me?

898
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,300
Could you do that for me? Yes, sir.

899
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,940
There you go.

900
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,300
What began as a day of hope and optimism

901
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,700
For Ricky Bobby and his race team
has ended here in sad disappointment.

902
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,180
There we go, boy.

903
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,260
I lost all muscle
control. Yeah, you did.

904
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,780
He just lost his muscle control
is all. I lost my muscle control.

905
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,460
He's fine. He just can't
control the muscles.

906
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,420
Thanks for the lift,
Hershell. Yeah, no problem.

907
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,540
Jenga!

908
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,820
I love you, Cal.

909
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,620
Good one, kiddo. What
the hell's going on?

910
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,980
Hey, Ricky, nice of you
to stop by for a visit.

911
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,020
What do you mean, a
visit? This is my house.

912
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,660
Baby

913
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,060
Shoot. I'm so sorry.

914
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,380
I really I didn't
want it to be this way.

915
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,140
Hey, what happened to
the family portrait?

916
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,980
You just crudely pasted
your face over mine.

917
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,100
We're getting married, Ricky.

918
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,700
And we're getting matching
leprechaun tattoos.

919
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,820
Isn't that cute? With
a little pot of gold.

920
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,300
Is this some kind of joke?
You guys putting me on?

921
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,420
I was gone three hours. Dennit
just fired me from the team.

922
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,500
Ricky, you and I

923
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,380
We both know that this marriage
has been over for a long, long time.

924
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,340
No! I honestly did not know that!

925
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,180
Ricky, you can't race no more.

926
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,340
I'm not going back to being poor
and dancing at the Wizard's Den.

927
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,300
You know, my old boyfriend Greg?

928
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,500
He still works there and he was crazy.

929
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,700
Baby, stop.

930
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second.
Let me make sure I got this straight.

931
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,980
Are you asking me for a divorce?

932
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,660
Yay! Two Christmases!
Yay! Two Christmases!

933
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,740
Cal?

934
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,780
How could you do this to me, man?

935
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,540
Ricky, your marriage was a hollow shell.

936
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,380
It was a cruel charade.

937
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,660
She just gave me the
411 on the whole deal.

938
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,420
And you know what else? You
never let me win one time.

939
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,900
I thought we had a good
thing going. Shake and Bake.

940
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,780
You're doing great. You
just keep it up. Keep it up.

941
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,980
And Mr. Dennit told me
that it's my time now.

942
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,300
Oh, really? That Shake and Bake is dead.

943
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,940
And we just came up with a new nickname.

944
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,500
It's so good. It's so
good. I got a new nickname.

945
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,580
The Magic Man. Now you see me

946
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,020
Now you don't.

947
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,460
That is the stupidest
nickname I've ever heard.

948
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,300
Is it, Ricky?

949
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,660
Because I think you
wish you thought of it.

950
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,420
All right. You got me.
That's an awesome nickname.

951
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,620
I've always had a lot of great ideas.

952
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,820
I also think I might design a car
that's in the shape of a rabbit.

953
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,620
It might poop out little real rabbits
out the back that'll run around the track.

954
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,180
You have live rabbits being
pooped out onto a track?

955
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,100
If I win, I might do a special
thing with David Copperfield

956
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,460
Where he hides in my
car in the passenger seat

957
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,020
And he just flings magic
stuff out the window.

958
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,100
Did you run any of this by NASCAR?

959
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,900
Watch the mail for that invitation to
the wedding, because I want you there.

960
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,420
What?! I know it

961
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,380
That some bad stuff happened
just now, but in time

962
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,380
The wedding's not for a couple of weeks.

963
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,300
Why would I come to your guys' wedding?

964
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,500
You're gonna get over
it and be my best man.

965
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,220
I'm not gonna be your best man!

966
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,380
Baby, he's not gonna
come to the wedding.

967
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,500
Cal, do you realize the implications
of your actions right now?

968
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,060
What's "implication" mean?

969
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,620
We are no longer friends.

970
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,460
Why? What do you mean, "Why?"

971
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,820
You're wrecking my life!

972
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,660
You just lost your wife.
You just lost your job.

973
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,540
Don't throw out your best
friend because of your anger.

974
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,300
That's absolutely ridiculous, man. Ricky

975
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,300
Remember, the field mouse is
fast, but the owl sees at night.

976
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,900
That's kind of creepy, ain't it?

977
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,460
Hey, Ricky, I'll call
you tomorrow. Shut up.

978
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,300
Bye, kids. I'll see
you next weekend. Bye.

979
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,620
Ricky! Boys! Is everything all right?

980
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,460
Mama, we got nowhere to go.
Carley and Cal took everything.

981
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Well, you're home now,
and you got your mama.

982
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,100
Get in here, boys. Come on.

983
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,980
Come on. Get in this house.

984
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,100
Hey, Ricky. Are you on fire?

985
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,220
Nice denim shorts,
dude. Hey, shut up, man.

986
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,220
Hump me!

987
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,060
Now, you watch yourself.

988
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,460
Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I
promise it won't happen again.

989
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,940
Hey, sorry, man.

990
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,260
Hey.

991
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,460
I lost my license.

992
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,820
That's why I'm on the
bus. I'm delivering pizzas.

993
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,340
Motherfucker, what
makes you think I care?

994
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,420
Shut the fuck up!

995
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,140
I was just telling you that because

996
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,540
Like I said, I lost my license. I've
been having a lot of problems lately.

997
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,300
Problems? I don't wanna hear
about your damn problems.

998
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,140
Everybody got problems.

999
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,460
My mama got problems.
She just lost her leg.

1000
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,340
My cousin Pookie just lost a testicle.
My dog threw up somebody's finger.

1001
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,100
That's a problem.

1002
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,180
I really regret opening my
mouth and talking to you.

1003
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,140
Sorry. Sorry. Get out of the road!

1004
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,340
Hey, come on, man. I'm on a bike. Relax.

1005
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,700
Hey, shut up! Idiot!

1006
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,340
It's open.

1007
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,340
Hugalo's Pizza. We are pizza.

1008
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,420
You are pizza? Yeah, we
are pizza. I gotta say it.

1009
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,020
Either close the door or come
in. I got weed in here, cowboy.

1010
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,100
You got three pizzas that haven't
been eaten just sitting over there.

1011
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,020
I know. I've been calling
them all day trying to get you

1012
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,540
But they keep sending me
different delivery people.

1013
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,460
Trying to get me? Why?

1014
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,340
Because I'm your daddy, that's why.

1015
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,180
What did you just say?
I said, I'm your daddy.

1016
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,860
I'm Reese Bobby.

1017
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,860
Me and your mama did it in a Rustler
Steak House bathroom when I was 17.

1018
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,860
And then you showed up.

1019
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,500
Hey, son.

1020
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,060
Son! Son, did this go good? No!

1021
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,260
Seems to me like it went
pretty good. You're not my dad.

1022
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,660
It got a little heated,
but.... Stop talking to me!

1023
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,020
Hey, is that a Huffy? That's
a nicelooking bike, boy.

1024
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,020
I can't believe it!

1025
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,420
I mean, he's been blowing
me off for 25 years

1026
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,140
And now he wants to get to know me?

1027
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,180
How the hell did he even find me?

1028
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,580
I called him.

1029
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,700
Are you kidding me? Mama,
why did you go do that?

1030
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,580
Son, you need help.

1031
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,420
I know he's a son of
a bitch. He's scary.

1032
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,420
But you're a grown man. You're
delivering pizzas on a bike.

1033
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,300
How'd you even get hooked up
with him in the first place?

1034
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,300
You probably couldn't
tell by looking at him now

1035
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,140
But your daddy used
to be a real charmer.

1036
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,220
And that night in the ladies' room of
the Rustler Steak House, he chose me.

1037
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,660
In a ladies' room? Shut up
in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1038
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,980
In a ladies' room? Shut up
in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1039
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,100
One of you turds is about
to get smacked in the mouth!

1040
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,620
Hey, stop yelling at me, okay?
I'm your dad. You're 7 years old.

1041
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,460
Don't talk like that.

1042
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,340
Hey. Hey there, Lucy.

1043
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,420
How you doing?

1044
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,340
Oh, hey there, Ricky. Look, son

1045
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,460
I know you don't want me to be here

1046
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,660
But I saw what happened to you on
the television. You saw the fear.

1047
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,860
I can help you with that, son. Really?

1048
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,300
What do you care about me or us?
You never even met your grandkids.

1049
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,700
What are you looking at, Popeye?
Shut up, you little potlicker.

1050
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,340
I'll put you in a microwave.

1051
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,060
Now, you show me the DNA test

1052
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,260
And then maybe I'll say
hello to these swamp rats.

1053
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,180
You people shut the hell up! I got a
wife in an oxygen tent trying to sleep.

1054
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,420
You better shut up or I'll come over
there and rip a hole in that tent.

1055
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,860
Yeah, shut up, Frank!

1056
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,500
Go shave your balls, you dusty old fart!

1057
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,180
Okay, I guess they are my grandkids.

1058
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,340
I know you, son. I know you well.

1059
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,780
You're just like me. Talladega's
coming up in a couple of weeks

1060
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,660
And I know you wanna win
that thing. No, I don't.

1061
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,980
Listen, Ricky.

1062
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,140
I'm 55 years old and all
I got to my name is a car

1063
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,180
And a duffle bag full of
underwear, and sweet, stinky weed.

1064
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,380
How much you selling
that weed for, old man?

1065
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,980
I know I screwed up raising you as a boy

1066
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,300
But just let me help you as a man.

1067
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,020
Do it, Dad. Get your
balls back. Go fast again.

1068
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,340
Fine. I'll do it.

1069
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,660
But I ain't calling you Daddy.
Well, what you gonna call me?

1070
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,580
All right, Professor
Dickweed. What's the plan?

1071
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,900
Well, basically, what happened
to you is that you saw the fear.

1072
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,380
So before you can even
think about any real driving

1073
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,420
You gotta make friends with
that fear. So get in the car.

1074
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,940
What the hell?! There's a
goddamn cougar in the car!

1075
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,180
I know there's a cougar,
I put it in there.

1076
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,380
You gotta learn to drive with the fear.

1077
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,260
Ain't nothing more damn frightening
than driving with a cougar in the car.

1078
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,420
God, where'd you get
that thing? I trapped it.

1079
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,540
Been keeping it in my bathroom at
the motel, feeding it old pizza.

1080
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,020
Now get back in that car, you hear
me? No, I'm not getting in that car.

1081
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,980
Hey, listen to me. If you're calm,
that wondrous big cat will be calm too.

1082
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,620
But if you're scared

1083
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,420
That beautiful death machine
will do what God made it to do

1084
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,300
Namely, eat you with
a smile on its face.

1085
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,500
God, he's just following
me wherever I go.

1086
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,220
Well, he's just looking at you.

1087
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,020
You're saying if I just calm
down, the cougar will be okay?

1088
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,460
You got it. Damn it. Okay.

1089
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,540
Come on, son. You can do it. Come on.

1090
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,340
Oh, come on.

1091
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,460
That's it.

1092
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,260
And no sudden moves. Like, is
this too fast? Oh, man. See?

1093
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,460
That's a little quick.
You see what he did?

1094
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,980
You gotta be a little more
deliberate in your movement.

1095
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,820
I'm just gonna get in there.
I'm just gonna grab the handle.

1096
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,540
I'm gonna get in and drive
that car. I'm gonna do it calm.

1097
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,300
Calm. Piece of cake. I was
just trying to stay calm.

1098
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,900
Oh, man! Sometime today, son.

1099
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,460
Okay, here we go. I'm getting in.

1100
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,340
Oh, God, help me!

1101
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,780
Ricky! Control your
heart rate. Oh, my God!

1102
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,380
Hey, Mama.

1103
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,900
Well, hey there, Ricky. How'd it go?

1104
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,500
Well, I was mauled by a cougar

1105
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,940
Learned nothing about driving, and
my Crystal Gayle shirt was ruined.

1106
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,900
But other than that, it went fine.

1107
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,340
Where are the boys at?

1108
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,980
I dropped them off at Sunday school
at my church about 10 minutes ago.

1109
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,340
Anarchy!

1110
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,740
Anarchy! Anarchy! Anarchy!

1111
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,420
There they are. What in tarnation?

1112
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:33,660
Anarchy! I don't even
know what that means

1113
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,100
But I love it!

1114
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,100
What in the hell? That is it!

1115
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,020
That puts the lid right on the jar!

1116
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,140
Mama! Mama! No, Ricky, no.

1117
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,700
I will not have my grandbabies
acting like shiftless, wild hobos.

1118
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,860
All right, now, you boys
listen up, and you listen good.

1119
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,460
Now, I am declaring Granny Law.

1120
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,460
And if you do not obey Granny Law

1121
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,140
I will paint your back porch red.

1122
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,460
Sorry, Granny, but
you're shit out of Iuck.

1123
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,060
We make the rules, not you.

1124
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,260
Hey!

1125
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,180
You're gonna break us like
wild horses, ain't you?

1126
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,460
It's the beginning of a new age.

1127
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,460
Hey, Derek, it's Ricky.

1128
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,020
Just wondering if you can ditch school

1129
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,020
And take over my shift
at the pizza place

1130
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,420
Because I got strep throat.

1131
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,100
And it's bad. I don't wanna
give it to everyone else.

1132
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,460
So call me back. You know the number.

1133
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,900
Hello.

1134
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,220
Hey, man. How's it going?
You wanna come over and party?

1135
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,820
Did you just say "party"?

1136
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,540
You know what? No. Because
I still hate you, okay?

1137
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,780
What are you so mad about?
What do you think I'm mad about?

1138
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,340
Come on, man, that was last week.

1139
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,140
What about the time you
ran over my leg with a car?

1140
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,980
I let that go that
day. Yeah, I remember.

1141
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,020
Wind is kicking up.

1142
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,460
Are you in the hot tub?

1143
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,660
Answer me this: When you're in spa mode

1144
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,100
How come the water
level drops in the spa?

1145
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,820
Are you pressing the buttons in
the back panel or in the kitchen?

1146
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,300
I just started pressing stuff.
Hey, don't press all those buttons.

1147
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,980
I'm getting bored. You wanna
come over and play G.I. Joes?

1148
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,780
I would love to. No!

1149
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,980
Come on. You know what? Screw you, man.

1150
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,860
Ricky, man, you gotta
cross over the anger bridge.

1151
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,020
Come back to the friendship shore.

1152
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,780
"Cross over the anger bridge"?
Yeah, that's where you're at.

1153
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,740
You're stuck on an anger bridge.

1154
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,700
Can you not see why I'm
stuck on the anger bridge?

1155
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,420
Look, I don't know why I'm
talking to you, okay? What is it?

1156
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,020
They got bottomless
nachos at Bennigan's.

1157
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,940
God, a whole mess of nachos
sounds good right now.

1158
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,500
I don't have a car no
more. Can you come get me?

1159
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,420
I'll get you. Which one of your cars do
you miss the most? I'll bring that one.

1160
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,660
I miss the Hummer. I'm
coming in the Hummer.

1161
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,420
Are you ready? Yeah. No, wait.

1162
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:01,100
Okay. Our friendship is done. All right?

1163
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,340
You hear? You wanna
hang out in your house.

1164
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,540
Come on. Screw you,
dude. I'm hanging up.

1165
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,580
Okay, that's it. Bye.

1166
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:12,100
Oh, man, this is absolutely crazy.
I mean, this is borderline reckless.

1167
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,900
Don't you get it? You don't drive with
your eyes, you drive with your heart.

1168
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,920
This is just dumb. I can't see a thing.

1169
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,040
You gotta feel the road. You
gotta let it live inside you.

1170
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,760
Are you feeling anything
now? I'm feeling a little bit.

1171
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,960
What do you feel? Tell
me what you're feeling.

1172
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,160
I'm feeling the worn wood
of the steering wheel.

1173
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,320
Yeah. What else? A little bit of heat.

1174
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,760
That's you and the car melded together.

1175
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,440
Yeah, now I'm really feeling it. I
feel like the car could drive itself.

1176
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,520
I bet it could. Start her up.

1177
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,720
I'm gonna start this car up.

1178
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,200
Attaboy. All right, son.

1179
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,160
Drive.

1180
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,080
I'm embarrassed. I really
thought I could feel it.

1181
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,440
You know what? We better hightail it
out of here. Frank's gonna be pissed.

1182
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,280
All right.

1183
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,920
No, no, Ricky. No blindfold.

1184
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,320
Get this highway clean, come on.

1185
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,320
I gotta tell you, Granny, this blows.

1186
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,880
How much more of this? I don't know.

1187
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,800
How many more times are you gonna
toss me the radio in the bathtub?

1188
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,640
Hello? Hey, man. You up?

1189
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,240
No. Wake up. I need to talk to you.

1190
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,120
I think your house is haunted.

1191
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,360
Hey, come on. It's 2:30 in the morning.

1192
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,120
I can't sleep in here, man. I'm scared.

1193
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,920
Look, there's nothing to be
scared of. It's a new house

1194
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,400
There's a lot of creaks
and moans and groans in it.

1195
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,520
Put on You got your TV on? Well,
yeah, I fell asleep with it on.

1196
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,480
Turn on channel 42. Fortytwo?

1197
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,000
Look at them buns. Well,
that is a set of buns.

1198
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,000
And down, and down, and

1199
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,600
What's she doing exercising
at 2:30 in the morning?

1200
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,680
Oh, yeah, that's a really good point.

1201
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,320
I don't know why I'm talking to
you. Do you remember that I hate you?

1202
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,000
Hey, man, you know what I was thinking?

1203
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,800
You're lucky. I'm lucky?

1204
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,920
How so? Well, check it out.

1205
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,720
I'm sitting here in this enormous
haunted mansion, can't sleep.

1206
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,160
You're hanging out at
your mom's. That's awesome.

1207
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,360
That's, like, the opposite of awesome.
Well, this is like a hotel room

1208
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,080
With someone else's junk in it.

1209
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,600
Okay, yeah, well, that someone
else's junk, that used to be my stuff.

1210
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,360
I'm just having a hard time, man.
I'm just calling up for some support.

1211
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,520
Do you? Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

1212
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,400
Hey, one more thing. Yeah?

1213
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,040
When you have the stereo on
at the same time as the TV

1214
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,240
How do you control the volume on the TV?

1215
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,080
Why do you want to listen
to the TV with the stereo on?

1216
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,120
Because I like to party.

1217
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,200
Why am I still talking to you?

1218
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,240
Come on. We were doing good there, man.

1219
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,520
I'm taking care of your house good.

1220
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,040
I keep snapping back into it. It's
like a trick you're pulling on me.

1221
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,400
All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
All right, man. Talk to you tomorrow.

1222
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,280
Shit.

1223
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,200
Get out.

1224
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,160
Where did stockcar racing come from?

1225
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,440
What?

1226
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,720
Hey, stop doing that. How did
stockcar racing get its start?

1227
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,560
Bootleggers in Prohibition had to have
cars fast enough to outrun the Feds

1228
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,520
Then they started racing
each other. That's right.

1229
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,920
If I was right, why'd you
throw another bucket on me?

1230
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,920
I filled up three. Now, there's
nothing like driving to avoid jail.

1231
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,680
Nothing hones your mind and
your instincts like necessity.

1232
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,200
So I taped a kilo of cocaine underneath
the car and called the boys in blue.

1233
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,200
Now, the way I figure it,
you got about two minutes

1234
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,880
Before they show up
and you do five to 10.

1235
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,920
So, what's it gonna be? Fear or prison?

1236
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,360
What the hell are you talking
about? Real simple, son.

1237
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,680
Cops are coming.

1238
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,040
There's a kilo of Colombian bambam
under the car. Time to be a man.

1239
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,200
You got hair on your peaches or what?
You're not kidding, are you? Man.

1240
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,600
You crazy creep!

1241
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,920
Come on, son. What's it gonna be?

1242
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,840
Speed or jail?

1243
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,920
Grandpa, would you
like to take us fishing

1244
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,440
And tell us life lessons and
stories about your childhood?

1245
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,000
I got a better idea.

1246
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,040
Why don't you boys go dig a
hole and I'll get another beer?

1247
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,320
Someone didn't love you enough
when you were little, did they?

1248
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,320
Good call. Here, that's worth a nickel.

1249
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,640
Tragic.

1250
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,640
Son of a bitch, son of
a bitch, son of a bitch.

1251
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,960
Oh, man. Oh, man!

1252
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,240
Onesixteen. Onesixteen!

1253
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,880
I'm going fast again!

1254
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,280
Pull over! Pull over!

1255
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,320
Pull over? I'll pull over
for you. How about this?

1256
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,360
Where are you?

1257
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,840
Gotcha.

1258
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,080
"Feels good going fast, doesn't it?

1259
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:56,240
By the way, don't try and snort
these Lucky Charms. Reese."

1260
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,760
Okay.

1261
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,320
Okay.

1262
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,280
There you go, little man.

1263
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,560
Hey, Ricky!

1264
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,240
How you doing?

1265
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,200
Oh, Nana, not my prison
shank. In the can.

1266
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,000
There's your
motherflipping driving test.

1267
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,120
Mr. Bobby, you are magnificent.

1268
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,960
Down, Karen! Get down! Get down, Karen!

1269
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,880
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

1270
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,200
Well, son, you are looking
good behind that wheel.

1271
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,240
Thanks, Daddy. I gotta tell you,
I feel good. Heck, you know what?

1272
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,200
Let's go out tonight, you
know, the whole family.

1273
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,640
I'm talking about sitting
down, enjoying a gourmet meal

1274
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,200
At a place that's real special.

1275
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,640
Hi. Those plates are hot.
Enjoy. You got your own skillet.

1276
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,320
Be back to check on you
in a minute. Thank you.

1277
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,680
Oh, gooder than grits.

1278
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,320
Let us pray.

1279
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,960
Dear Lord baby Jesus

1280
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,200
Lying there in your little ghost manger

1281
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,720
Just looking at your Baby
Einstein developmental videos

1282
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,040
Learning about shapes and colors and....

1283
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,560
We just have so much to be thankful for.

1284
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,160
First off, my sons no longer act

1285
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,480
Like retarded gangbangers. Amen.

1286
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,280
Also, I got my balls back
behind the wheel of a car.

1287
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,480
And most importantly, we thank you

1288
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,680
For bringing back our nasty,
delinquent, potdealing daddy to us.

1289
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,920
For he was lost, but
now he is found. Amen.

1290
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,320
Amen. Amen.

1291
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,040
Son, that was lovely.

1292
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,040
What a lovely meal. It sure is.

1293
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,320
It certainly does look delicious.

1294
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,640
I gotta tell you, this is about
a damn perfect evening right now.

1295
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,440
It is, isn't it?

1296
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,600
You know what we should do?

1297
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Every week, we should come
back to this Applebee's

1298
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,280
And sit at this table,
and have a family meal.

1299
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,840
That's a great idea, Mama.
And order the same stuff.

1300
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,960
That would be great. And
I would be delighted, Reese

1301
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,280
If you would accompany me to
ballroom dancing on Tuesday nights.

1302
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,280
Tuesday night? It's a lot of fun.

1303
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,120
I think you'd have a good time.
How's everybody doing here?

1304
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,320
Dolly, it's so good. Oh,
it's really, really good.

1305
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,880
You know, I just I hate
to be a pain, darling

1306
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,400
But I asked for no onions
on my Bourbon Steak.

1307
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,920
I am so sorry. I thought
you asked for onions

1308
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,960
Okay, okay, maybe don't interrupt me.

1309
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,280
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
Yeah, well, I think you did mean to

1310
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,640
And I also think that you meant
to put the damn onions on my steak.

1311
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,560
Okay, Reese. Grandfather

1312
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,840
Can't we resolve this
conflict without anger?

1313
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,400
I'm a veteran and a diabetic! Dad!

1314
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,560
Dad! Why are you doing
this? Applebee's has rats!

1315
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,040
I found a whole rat in my Cobb salad!

1316
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,480
Dad, where are you going?

1317
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,960
Come on, frat boy, you wanna go?

1318
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,520
What's going on, man? Ricky, let him go!

1319
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,200
Things were going good, weren't they?
That's exactly why I had to blow it up.

1320
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,320
I don't know what organ
or bone people have

1321
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,360
That makes them act right, but I
was born without it. I'm no good.

1322
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,120
All those races I won, that
was for you, you know that?

1323
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:55,040
I did just like you told me: "If
you ain't first, you're last."

1324
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,880
What the hell are you talking about?

1325
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,680
What you told me that day
at school for career day.

1326
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,240
You came in and you said, "If
you ain't first, you're last."

1327
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,000
Oh, hell, Ricky, I was
high when I said that.

1328
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,880
That doesn't make any sense at all.

1329
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,080
"You're first or last." You can be
second, you can be third, fourth.

1330
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,080
Hell, you can even be fifth.

1331
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,800
What are you talking about? I
lived my whole life based on that.

1332
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,200
Well, now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

1333
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,480
Well, that's the milliondollar
question, isn't it?

1334
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,240
Good luck to you, son.

1335
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,720
Hey, Dad!

1336
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,480
Where are you going?

1337
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,360
Does it matter?

1338
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,280
Here we go.

1339
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:16,880
Here we go.

1340
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,240
Hey, don't bump me.

1341
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,800
Oh, man, I'm flying.

1342
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,320
Game over. Come on, reset.

1343
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,160
Boy, you are a terrible driver, no?

1344
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,080
How'd you get on a video game so fast?

1345
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,960
Is your name, by chance, Ricky Bobby?

1346
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,320
Hey, screw you, man! I
got nothing because of you!

1347
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,560
I hate you! Hey, Ricky.

1348
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,840
I am on fire. I am on fire.

1349
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,760
Susan?

1350
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,920
And so then I got a
marketing job with NASCAR.

1351
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,120
Really? Yeah, it's great. It's great.

1352
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,920
Well, gosh, you look fantastic.

1353
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,480
Thank you. I mean,
you've always looked good.

1354
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,320
I mean, I'm just I'm happy for you.

1355
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,520
Thank you.

1356
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,360
But what about you?

1357
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,560
How have you been? What
have you been doing?

1358
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,480
Well, they want me to race at Talladega
next weekend, but I'm not gonna do it.

1359
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,320
Because I'm done. I'm done
with the racing, with driving.

1360
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,360
Why would you do that?
Because I've really moved on.

1361
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,000
I've sent in my application
to The Real World

1362
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,600
So I'm hoping to hear back.

1363
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,360
I'm putting a lot of my eggs
into that basket, the MTV basket.

1364
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,760
I'm also thinking about
getting a gun and dealing crack.

1365
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,760
Being a crack dealer, but not like
a mean crack dealer, but like a....

1366
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,120
You know, like a nice one.

1367
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Just kind of friendly, like, "Hey

1368
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,760
What's up, guys? You want some crack?"

1369
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,320
I'm just waiting on those two things
to kind of flesh themselves out.

1370
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,360
You know what, Ricky?

1371
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,560
I have kept my mouth shut for
a really, really long time.

1372
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,320
And I just don't think that
I can keep it shut anymore.

1373
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,280
I just have to tell you that I
think you are making a big mistake.

1374
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,280
Really? Yes.

1375
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,880
Why is it that you always
fall for people who leave you?

1376
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,000
Have you noticed that?

1377
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:19,320
Like Carley and your
dad and your sponsors.

1378
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,120
And you always have
to prove yourself. Wh?

1379
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,360
Well, you gotta listen to me here, okay?

1380
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,640
You gotta win to get
love. Everyone knows that.

1381
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,160
I mean, that's just life.

1382
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,280
Look at Don Shula, legendary coach.

1383
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,800
Look at that Asian guy
who holds the worId record

1384
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,920
For eating all those hot dogs in a row.

1385
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,800
Look at Rue McClanahan
from The Golden Girls.

1386
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,000
All three people, all
great champions, all loved.

1387
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,680
Do you wanna know why I think
that you should race again?

1388
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,000
Sure. Why?

1389
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,320
Okay. It's because it's
what you love, Ricky.

1390
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,560
It is who you were born to be.

1391
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,160
And here you sit, thinking.

1392
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,280
Well, Ricky Bobby is not a
thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver.

1393
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,920
He is a doer. And that's
what you need to do.

1394
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,960
You don't need to
think, you need to drive.

1395
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,000
You need speed. You need to go out
there, and you need to rev your engine.

1396
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,280
You need to fire it up.

1397
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,160
You need to grab hold of the
line between speed and chaos

1398
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,120
And you need to wrestle it to
the ground like a demon cobra.

1399
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,120
And then, when that fear rises
up in your belly, you use it

1400
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,240
And you know that fear is
powerful because it has been there

1401
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,320
For billions of years! And it is
good, and you use it, and you ride it.

1402
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,360
You ride it like a skeleton
horse through the gates of hell

1403
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,160
And then you win! You win!

1404
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,080
You don't win for anybody else,
you win for you. You know why?

1405
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,400
Because a man takes what
he wants, he takes it all.

1406
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,200
And you're a man,
aren't you? Aren't you?

1407
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,240
Susan, I've never heard
you talk like that.

1408
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,640
Are we about to get it on?

1409
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,600
Because I'm as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now.

1410
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,360
This is awesome. Yes, it is.

1411
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,520
Are you climbing on
the table now? Yes, sir.

1412
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,400
I can't believe this.

1413
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:28,400
This is like that Whitesnake
video where the girI crawIs on....

1414
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,480
Yeah. Just like that. What's her name?

1415
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,800
Tawny Kitaen. She's really good.

1416
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,960
She's great. She's fantastic.

1417
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,680
Everyone, turn away.

1418
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,960
Things are gonna get crazy.
We're gonna make animal noises.

1419
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,400
Looks good, damn good.
Yeah. That's good, guys.

1420
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,360
Yeah, Ricky, it's good to be back.

1421
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,200
Talladega. Talladega.

1422
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,360
I missed you dudes.

1423
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,880
Even you too, Glenn.

1424
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,680
I didn't have a whole lot of money
left, but what I did I put into the car.

1425
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,800
We got some lowerend sponsors,
so it's nothing to shout about

1426
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,240
But at least we got something to run in.

1427
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,720
Let's see what we got, guys.

1428
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,280
What are we looking at?
"Julio's thongs for men"?

1429
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,480
Come on, what kind
of dude wears a thong?

1430
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,720
Yeah, that's messed up.

1431
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,280
Perverts, you know?

1432
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,280
It's not the best car, but it'll move.

1433
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,280
Hold on, now, baby. Let's just see
what this thing's got under the hood.

1434
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,120
There she is. Looks like
the Pep Boys threw up.

1435
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,120
Damn. Like I said, work in progress.

1436
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,920
All right, I tell you what we gotta
do. Since we got no corporate money

1437
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,960
We have to build this engine ourselves.

1438
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,200
I want you to hit up every independent
driver out there for spare parts.

1439
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,360
Yeah, Lucius, that's crazy.

1440
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,920
Well, crazy is all we got
right now, okay? So do it.

1441
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,240
Now, where you going?

1442
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,760
I wanna tell Gerard Depardieu
we're coming for him.

1443
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,600
There you go, baby. Give him hell.

1444
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,200
Get this engine built. Get it built.

1445
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,480
I have not finished.

1446
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,200
Monsieur Girard, Ricky
Bobby is here to see you.

1447
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,280
This is the one I was
talking about, Ricky Bobby.

1448
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:02,000
Thank you, Bacco. Go.

1449
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,080
You're a tough man to
find. You know that, buster?

1450
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,840
I prefer solitude the day before a race.

1451
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,040
I am being so incredibly
rude, Monsieur Bobby.

1452
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,600
Let me introduce you to my lunch guests.

1453
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,160
This is my dear old
friend EIvis Costello.

1454
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,120
Delightful to meet you, Mr.
Robert. I thought you were dead.

1455
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:27,840
And next to him is hiphop artist,
poet and my brotherinlaw, Mos Def.

1456
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,720
I like your driving style.
I'm more of a Tony Stewart man

1457
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,400
Number 20 car, myself.

1458
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,640
How he gets into those straightaways.

1459
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,320
Gets it in the paint. Get her done!

1460
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,320
And across from Monsieur Def

1461
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,640
Is Breeze.

1462
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,040
Hey. You're Breeze or you're
Breeze? Which one of you is Breeze?

1463
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,640
Together we are Breeze.

1464
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,600
They are like twins,
born from different wombs.

1465
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,480
Right. They are God's most

1466
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,000
Beautiful mistake.

1467
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,840
They do everything together. Everything.

1468
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,320
They read the same books.

1469
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,360
They do Pilates together.

1470
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,800
They walk, talk, sleep

1471
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,960
Even go make toilet.

1472
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,120
Okay, you're starting
to creep me out, man.

1473
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,840
A single plop.

1474
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,640
One single plop.

1475
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,240
I don't need to hear
about doing a toilet.

1476
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,000
You want more examples?

1477
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,200
No, you listed like
8000. Less than that.

1478
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,280
It's none of my business. More like

1479
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,280
I don't know, between five and 10.

1480
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,440
Look, I need to talk to you.

1481
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,320
Walk with me, Ricky Bobby.

1482
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,800
You have a good lunch. Take care, man.

1483
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,600
Goodbye, Ricky. Goodbye.

1484
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,680
Holding hands with a man makes
me terribly uncomfortable.

1485
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,000
It is a sign of friendship
in many countries.

1486
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,920
Well, not in ours.

1487
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,720
There's nothing sexual about it.

1488
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,240
Please don't be worried at
the fact I have an erection.

1489
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,240
It has nothing to do
with you. Hey, come on.

1490
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,320
Look. Here's the deal. I came
here to tell you one thing.

1491
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,240
All right? Tomorrow, I'm coming for you.

1492
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,320
Do you know why I came
to America, Ricky Bobby?

1493
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,200
Public schools, healthcare
system, giant water parks.

1494
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,520
I mean, the same reason
anyone comes to America.

1495
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,200
I came here for you to beat me.

1496
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,800
What the hell are you talking
about? My husband, Gregory, and I

1497
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,800
Wish only for that which
every other couple wishes for:

1498
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,960
To tame Komodo dragons in Sri Lanka

1499
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,320
And teach them to perform Hamlet.

1500
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,000
But before I can do that....

1501
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,720
That's dumb. It's not dumb.

1502
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,760
It is dumb. Why is it dumb?

1503
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,920
I don't know. But before I can do that

1504
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,360
I must be beaten by a driver
who's truly better than me.

1505
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,920
So you're gonna lose to me on purpose?

1506
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,840
No. No?

1507
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,240
No!

1508
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,080
I will battle you with
the entirety of my heart.

1509
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,120
And you will probably lose.

1510
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:03,120
But maybe, just maybe

1511
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,120
You might challenge me.

1512
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,840
God needs the devil.

1513
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,960
The Beatles needed the Rolling Stones.

1514
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,560
Even Diane Sawyer needed Katie Couric.

1515
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,560
Will you be my Katie Couric?

1516
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,280
I feel like I'm in Highlander.

1517
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,000
What's the Highlander?

1518
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,320
It's a movie.

1519
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,400
Any good? Very good.

1520
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,560
It won the Academy Award. Oh, for what?

1521
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,400
For best movie ever made.

1522
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,760
I just want you to know I came
here today to tell you one thing.

1523
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,800
That come race time tomorrow,
I'm coming for you, all right?

1524
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,920
May God be with you. Yeah.

1525
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,240
Because although today I am friendly

1526
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,760
Tomorrow will be war!

1527
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,840
All right.

1528
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,680
Ladies and gentlemen, pull up a chair,
drop the kids off with their aunt

1529
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,680
And take the phone off the
hook because it's race day here

1530
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,080
At the Talladega Superspeedway.

1531
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,280
Hey, guys.

1532
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,640
Why so down? Ricky

1533
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,280
We were up all night working on the car.

1534
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,600
And then something
happened. There was a fire.

1535
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,320
Did you say "fire"?

1536
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,880
Glenn is dead, Ricky.

1537
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,280
I mean, he died last night in my arms

1538
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,960
As I held him. Oh, man.

1539
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,760
He was so scared, because
you know how little he is.

1540
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,280
And death was coming for
him, and he stood there

1541
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,000
And with a tear coming out his eyes,
he said, "Tell Ricky, win for me."

1542
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,920
That's all that little bastard
wanted, was for you to win.

1543
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,280
I wish you could've seen him.

1544
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,200
I wish you could've felt
his little heart fluttering.

1545
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,720
Sweet Jesus.

1546
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
Poor Glenn.

1547
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,360
Hey, what the hell,
man. Hey, Glenn. Glenn!

1548
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:12,120
I see you. Glenn, what did I say?

1549
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,880
I said, "Wait till after
the race." Was he crying?

1550
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,480
I'm sorry, Ricky. We were just trying
to give you a little extra motivation.

1551
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,520
Well, that is just sick, guys.

1552
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,720
It's okay, Susie. I appreciate it, guys.

1553
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,360
Just trying to help out

1554
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:29,320
Even though it was weird and perverse.

1555
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,800
They're just trying to help,
Ricky. We're a team here.

1556
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,320
I appreciate it. Let's
see what's under the hood.

1557
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,520
All right, let's have a look.

1558
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,480
Hot dog. I mean, that's like looking
up Bridgette WilsonSampras' skirt.

1559
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:49,080
We were up all night working on it.
Like I said, a lot of teams gave parts.

1560
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,360
Nice work, guys.

1561
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,280
And your sponsors weren't
doing very much, so

1562
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,280
Well, we repainted the car.

1563
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,840
Well, take a look. Come on, guys.

1564
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,920
Well, I like the cougar,
but what company is "M.E."?

1565
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,280
"Me" is you

1566
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,320
Because it's just you out there.

1567
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,360
We don't have any corporate sponsors.

1568
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,640
We don't have any fancy team owners.

1569
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,400
We have you

1570
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,520
And this car, and this cougar

1571
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,560
Which symbolizes the fear
that you have overcome.

1572
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,560
It's all there for you.

1573
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:30,240
Ricky, this car is like your Excalibur,
the mighty sword King Arthur used

1574
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,760
To bring together the
Knights of the Round Table

1575
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,720
Until Lancelot betrayed him by laying
with his queen, in the biblical sense.

1576
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,520
Okay, Glenn.

1577
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,760
Everything cool that
Susan said, you wrecked it.

1578
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,680
Guys, let's go win
ourselves a race, all right?

1579
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,000
There you go. Yeah! Right?

1580
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,360
Let's get out there and win a race.

1581
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,520
Let's get out there and win a race.

1582
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,240
From Provence, France

1583
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,040
Driver of the number 55 Perrier car

1584
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,280
Jean Girard.

1585
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,200
From West River, North Carolina

1586
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,520
Driver of the number 47 Old Spice car

1587
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,000
Cal Naughton Jr.

1588
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,880
Hey, Carley.

1589
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:45,640
Hey, Ricky. Carley! Hey, baby.

1590
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,200
Baby.

1591
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,240
Oh, hey, Ricky.

1592
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,200
Hey, man. We missed you at the wedding.

1593
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,200
You missed me at the wedding?
Oh, man, it was so classy.

1594
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,880
We had a Styx cover band
and a nacho fountain.

1595
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,080
Check it, it was a nacho fountain
with six kinds of cheese on it.

1596
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,400
Liquid cheese? It cascaded down? Yeah.

1597
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,760
Are you serious? Amazing.
Six different kinds.

1598
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,440
Swiss, Havarti. What was the other one?

1599
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,760
Gouda. Cheddar, Gouda.

1600
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,920
That's the greatest
thing I ever heard of.

1601
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,000
Bean buffet in front
of it. It was awesome.

1602
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,360
Don't listen to him. And remember
one thing, he's the competition.

1603
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,440
You're not very focused right
now. I need you to focus.

1604
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,080
Hey. What?

1605
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,440
I'm the Magic Man now.
Okay? Yeah, I know.

1606
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,640
So get ready for some tricks
up these sleeves, all right?

1607
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,200
Watch your buns, pal.

1608
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,160
Baby, that is real good talk.
Like we practiced last night.

1609
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,680
I got something to tell you,
you mangy piece of trash.

1610
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,480
What? I'm sorry.

1611
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,240
I took you for granted, Cal, and
you were a really good friend to me

1612
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,600
And I never gave you
your due. It was my fault.

1613
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,240
I'll tell you the truth. I'm a
little confused by your tactics.

1614
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,280
Tactics? Yeah. I'm
gonna keep acting tough

1615
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,520
Until I figure it out. All right?

1616
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,000
See you on the track.

1617
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,480
Come on, baby. I love you.

1618
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,320
I love you too. Come on.

1619
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,520
Abracadabra, homes.

1620
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,320
Hi, Bill Weber, along with Wally
Dallenbach and Benny Parsons.

1621
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,320
Thanks for having us. Today,
Talladega, NASCAR's biggest track

1622
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,320
Where the big concern is the big wreck.

1623
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,480
And it's not if it happens,
it's where and when.

1624
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,880
We have a guy in the race today
that'll probably cause it, Ricky Bobby.

1625
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,240
Starting in the rear of
the field, underfunded

1626
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,920
And the last time we saw
him, he caused a big crash.

1627
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,520
A lot of big stories and some
big questions here at Talladega.

1628
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,520
All right, go get them.

1629
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,520
You must decide, Ricky Bobby.

1630
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,360
Is it foolish pride, or
is it greatness for you?

1631
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,320
Hey, Jarvis! Go ahead, Cal.

1632
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,680
If you slept with
your best friend's wife

1633
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,520
Why would he apologize to you?
Yeah, I know. That's weird.

1634
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,440
That's what I'm saying. My
head's all tied up like a pretzel.

1635
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,200
I got a pretzel in my head.

1636
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,520
Ricky! Come on, Dad!

1637
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,280
I've got some big investors coming by.

1638
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,360
These guys are bigmoney power players.

1639
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,800
If things go right, they could have
us owning half the cars in NASCAR.

1640
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,760
So I want you No, I want you to behave.

1641
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,280
Oh, really? Quiet.

1642
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,680
Should I not tell them
after 14 years of marriage

1643
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,960
You're still afraid to
let me see you naked?

1644
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
That's not a fear thing,
it's a trust thing.

1645
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,640
Hey! I was wondering
where you guys got off to.

1646
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,000
Baby, this is Ted
Beamen from Halliburton.

1647
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,280
Nice to meet you. Over here

1648
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,280
Is Dick Tangfield from Dynacorp.

1649
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,280
Back there is.... You
have beautiful teeth.

1650
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,360
Yes, he does. Get yourselves down there.

1651
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,200
Adorable. Make yourselves at home

1652
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,760
Grab something to eat, over
here.... Sweetheart, sweetheart.

1653
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,360
You're a sweetie pie.

1654
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,320
She's very affectionate.
She suffered a recent loss

1655
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,920
You taste good too.

1656
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,000
So she's a little emotional.

1657
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:58,360
Okay, that's fine. Go ahead, find a
seat. Can we get these guys something?

1658
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,920
Jean Girard started from the
pole and is out to a big lead.

1659
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,360
As you know, Bill, he's
been doing that all year.

1660
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:11,480
Where are you, Ricky Bobby?
Come face your destroyer!

1661
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,320
"Come face your destroyer"?
Listen to how I sound.

1662
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,200
I sound like a massive prick.

1663
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,040
Come on, baby! Yeah, that's it.

1664
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,080
All right, Lucius. Time
to let the cougar loose.

1665
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,240
Here we go, boys.

1666
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,400
Ricky Bobby, in the
6 2 car, on the move.

1667
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,840
He's gone from 26th to 18th place.

1668
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,640
Now let's go to John Hannafin, in
the stands with a countrymusic legend.

1669
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,120
Thank you, Sean. I'm here with one
of the greatest countrymusic stars

1670
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,000
Of all time, Kenny Rogers.

1671
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,200
What do you think of the race so far?
It's good. They're going really fast.

1672
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,360
John, that's not Kenny Rogers.

1673
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,200
In the song "The Gambler," you sang:

1674
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,400
"You gotta know when to walk
away and know when to run."

1675
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,160
Should Ricky Bobby have
stayed away from racing?

1676
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:09,400
Mr. Bobby's very competitive. If
he wants to race, he should race.

1677
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,560
Well, this is John Hannafin with Kenny
Rogers. And now back to you, Bill.

1678
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,720
Well, that, of course,
was not Kenny Rogers.

1679
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,920
Not even close.

1680
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,120
Ricky, you've got Brian Wavecrest

1681
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,680
The guy that replaced
you at Dennit, dead ahead.

1682
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,600
Bobby working really hard
to pass the Wonder Bread car.

1683
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,560
That's his old ride, of course.

1684
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,520
We've passed the halfway
mark with Ricky Bobby

1685
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,760
Now three car lengths behind the leader.

1686
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,240
Maybe subconsciously you
slept with Ricky's wife

1687
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,120
As a way of getting back at him

1688
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,080
For making you come in
second all those years.

1689
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,360
I know one thing, Carley was definitely
unconscious every time we had sex.

1690
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,360
Lucius, I got Cal
Naughton dead ahead of me.

1691
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,400
Hey, Cal, you should pay
attention. I think he's passing you.

1692
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,840
Is Ricky passing me in my subconscious?

1693
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,880
No, he's actually passing you.
That's happening right now.

1694
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,600
Go, Ricky! Go!

1695
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,320
Let's go back to our John Hannafin

1696
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,120
Who's in the stands with
an NBA legend, Larry Bird.

1697
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,680
Folks, I'm here with one
of the great NBA superstars

1698
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,600
A real legend, Larry Bird.

1699
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,040
I almost didn't recognize you with
the sunglasses. What are you up to?

1700
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,840
Come on, John, pay attention.

1701
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,240
I'm concerned. He
might have had a stroke.

1702
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,880
Didn't Ricky Bobby
used to drive for you?

1703
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,080
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's doing quite well.

1704
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:36,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Richard!

1705
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,480
Get Cal Naughton's crew
chief on the radio right away.

1706
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,520
I believe you have some tickets
waiting for me. My name's Reese Bobby.

1707
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,240
Reese Bobby.

1708
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,280
Mister, these tickets have been
waiting for you for a long time.

1709
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,640
Who needs two? I got tickets!

1710
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,960
Tickets, right here, 60 bucks a pop.

1711
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:15,520
All right, Girard, I found you.
Now let's see where this goes.

1712
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,360
Bobby's gotten around Naughton

1713
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,080
And now he's right behind Girard,
but Girard's gonna block the track.

1714
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,360
Man, he's scary good.

1715
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,560
Ah, Ricky Bobby.

1716
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,280
Now we shall dance, and
yes, it will be a slow jam.

1717
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,000
Damn it. Come on, man.

1718
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,360
I was wrong about you, Ricky Bobby.

1719
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,920
You are not the one to defeat me.

1720
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,120
I can't get around him, man.

1721
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,720
You tell Cal Naughton
to take Ricky Bobby out.

1722
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,960
Hey, Cal, listen. I hate to add
to your tremendous moral confusion

1723
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,520
But I just heard from Dennit.

1724
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,840
He said to take Ricky Bobby out
of the race or you're fired, buddy.

1725
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,360
What are you talking about?

1726
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,240
Tell him if he doesn't do it, he's done.
That's right, he'll be driving a tour bus.

1727
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:18,000
Well, you tell Mr. Dennit that
Ricky Bobby is my best friend.

1728
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:21,000
And it's Shake and Bake time.
Cal, I don't like the way

1729
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,560
You're talking out
there. Damn the torpedoes!

1730
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,000
Come on, man, slingshot
it. Slingshot, come on.

1731
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,200
I can't believe it. If it
isn't Mike Honcho himself.

1732
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,920
Shake and Bake, buddy!

1733
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,040
Shake it before you bake it.

1734
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,440
Here I come. Slingshot engaged.

1735
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,240
Yeah!

1736
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,440
I love you, Cal!

1737
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,440
What are you doing? Can't
believe it. Now I've seen it all.

1738
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:03,400
Cal Naughton from Dennit Racing just
helped a rival driver pass a teammate.

1739
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,680
Darrell, you tell Brian Wavecrest
to take out Cal Naughton right now.

1740
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,240
Right now, you do it. You do it!

1741
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,200
Yes, sir.

1742
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,040
And the 26 car just ran
Naughton into the wall.

1743
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,520
Oh, man.

1744
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
Damn you, Wavecrest!

1745
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:48,240
The entire field was in that wreck,
and we've only got six laps to go.

1746
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,320
Only Ricky Bobby and Jean
Girard got away clean.

1747
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,320
It's just Jean and Ricky.

1748
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,320
And now the matador shall
dance with the blind shoemaker.

1749
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,440
Race officials have completed an
extensive cleanup of the track.

1750
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,280
We're ready to get back to racing.

1751
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,800
The 200,000 fans are on their feet,
and the green flag is in the air.

1752
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,640
Bobby and Girard are dueling
each other for the lead.

1753
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,240
No one seems to have the edge.

1754
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,400
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go!

1755
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final lap.

1756
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,320
By the way, Ricky, I
watched the Highlander movie.

1757
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,000
It was shit.

1758
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,240
Hang on, baby Jesus,
this is gonna get bumpy.

1759
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,120
I've seen a lot of big
crashes at Talladega

1760
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,200
But this is the longest
one I've ever seen.

1761
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,240
Let's take a quick commercial
break and we'll be right back.

1762
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,320
Hungry for both steak and shrimp?

1763
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:36,040
Welcome back to Talladega,
where the long one continues.

1764
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,320
No, no! Jean Girard and Ricky
Bobby have wrecked in the last lap

1765
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,280
On the straightaway. What a shame.

1766
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,280
Oh, God.

1767
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:56,280
It looks like neither Girard
or Bobby will finish this race.

1768
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,560
We'd like to thank you for joining
us for NBC's coverage of NAS CAR.

1769
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,840
Coming up next, it's Ice
Dancing to the Hits of Motown.

1770
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:25,240
Wait a minute, there's something
going on on the track down there.

1771
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,720
Oh, my God, they're
racing each other on foot.

1772
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,240
These men will not quit.

1773
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,560
Go! Go!

1774
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,880
Ricky, Ricky. He's going,
he's going, he's going. Look!

1775
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,160
He did it!

1776
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,920
Well, I'll be damned.

1777
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,280
Good for you, Ricky Bobby.

1778
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,360
Yeah! Yeah!

1779
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,000
Ricky Bobby wins!

1780
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,720
You'll never see anything like
that in a hundred lifetimes.

1781
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,480
It was completely illegal and in no
way will count, but that was something.

1782
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,240
It was. That was really good.

1783
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:53,360
Monsieur Bobby, by defeating me today

1784
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,960
You have set me free.

1785
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,560
And for that, I thank you.

1786
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:04,240
I will never shake your hand, ever.

1787
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,320
But I will give you this.

1788
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,360
Sir, you taste of America.

1789
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,560
Thank you.

1790
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,680
No, once was good. Once was good.

1791
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,080
Boy, that Halliburton. Halliburton's
taken off, haven't they?

1792
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,600
Yeah, yeah, we're doing well.

1793
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,520
Now there's some stock I'd
like to get my hands on.

1794
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,760
Ladies and gentlemen, NASCAR fans

1795
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,520
Your eyes on Talladega's
famed Victory Lane

1796
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,600
As we get ready for trophy time here

1797
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,000
Following an exciting
running of the Talladega 500.

1798
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:10,360
First, a very brief explanation.

1799
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:15,160
Because the drivers that finished
first and second got out of their cars

1800
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,800
They have officially been disqualified.

1801
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:21,720
So now the winner, he was
third, he's now number one:

1802
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,760
Cal Naughton Jr.!

1803
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,600
Yeah, come on, guys!

1804
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,280
Give me that thing.
Cal, you're number one!

1805
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,960
I've been waiting a long time
for you to say my name, man.

1806
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,200
I know it's a technicality,
but I tell you what

1807
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:43,720
You try to take this away from
me, I'll sock you in the face.

1808
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,720
Ricky.

1809
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,560
Give me that thing.

1810
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,640
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

1811
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,200
Cal! Put me down.

1812
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,960
I'm proud of you!

1813
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,720
Get up here, man. No, you come up here.

1814
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,240
You come up here.

1815
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,920
Cal Naughton! Cal Naughton. Oh, my God.

1816
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,040
For this to happen.... Am I dead, man?

1817
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,440
You won the Talladega 500, all right?

1818
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,440
I owe you an apology.

1819
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,320
Come on. Man, I'm sorry about Carley.

1820
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:24,440
She walked straight up to me
and grabbed me in the crotch.

1821
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:28,240
It's like a tractor
beam of hotness. I know.

1822
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:31,360
Shake and Bake?

1823
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,960
No. Never again.

1824
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,200
You're right. I was a total dick, man.

1825
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,520
From now on

1826
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,960
It's Magic Man

1827
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,640
And EI Diablo.

1828
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,280
What's "Diablo" mean?

1829
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,760
It's like, you know....

1830
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,240
It's like Spanish for,
like, a fighting chicken.

1831
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,760
That's awesome. I know.

1832
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,080
With the claws. With
the claws and the beak.

1833
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,640
Where did you think of that?

1834
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,400
You just Sometimes things click.

1835
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,480
I love you, bro. I love you too.

1836
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God, I can't believe it!

1837
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,280
Excuse me, guys. Nice job.

1838
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,760
Hey, Ricky.

1839
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,520
Hey, Carley.

1840
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:24,400
I've decided I can love
you again. You're a winner.

1841
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,320
Yeah, I don't think so. Really?

1842
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:32,360
Are you prepared to walk
away from these pearIs

1843
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:34,960
Of delight?

1844
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,120
Well.... Yeah, this is
tough. How would it work?

1845
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,040
Would Cal move out? Yep, gone.

1846
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,200
Kids move back in?

1847
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,560
Can I just have a little
refresher? Of course, baby.

1848
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,200
This is why you fell
in love, don't forget.

1849
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,560
Yeah, I'm in. I'm moving in right now.

1850
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,680
I'll drive 100 miles
an hour to your house.

1851
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,600
Our house. Our house. Our house, yeah.

1852
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,160
No, I'm not. Come on.
It's gonna be awkward.

1853
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,880
Hey, baby. Hey.

1854
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,760
Wait a minute.

1855
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,320
You are ready to walk away

1856
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:16,120
From FHM magazine's
number seven hottest ass

1857
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:20,120
For the girI who forgets
to get your dry cleaning?

1858
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,680
Yeah. Yeah?

1859
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,640
Yeah. Good luck, weirdoes.

1860
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,600
Carley, come back here. Yes, Susie Q?

1861
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,800
There's something I've wanted to
tell you for a really long time.

1862
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,320
Thank you. Maybe one together?

1863
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:38,200
Susie Q, are those real? Yeah.

1864
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,280
Well, girI, you got some game.

1865
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:45,160
We'll see you on down the road. Yeah.

1866
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,200
You seen Cal? He's
somewhere around here.

1867
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:50,280
Hey, Cal! Baby, I'm
coming. Thanks, baby.

1868
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,000
Maybe one more? Oh, boys.

1869
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,640
She's crazy. Oh, thank you.

1870
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,440
You did good. Thanks, Mama.

1871
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,200
He's amazing.

1872
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,320
That was one heck of a day, I gotta say.

1873
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,320
That's some nice driving there, cowboy.

1874
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,280
Hey, Daddy. Well, hello, Reese.

1875
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:12,160
Well, if it isn't our old
mangy, transient grandfather.

1876
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:15,320
Well said, grandson.
Take that as a compliment.

1877
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:18,520
Hey, Ricky, let me ask you a question.

1878
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,280
Who did you win that race for?

1879
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,520
Well, I sure as hell
didn't win it for you.

1880
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,600
I like hearing that.

1881
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,280
I guess if I really gotta think about it

1882
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,320
I just went out there and drove.

1883
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,760
And knew that no matter what happened

1884
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:42,960
My boys, my mama, and
my lady would love me.

1885
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:47,320
Hi, I'm his lady, I'm Susan.

1886
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,200
I painted the car, I.... We had sex.

1887
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,200
Is that right? Yeah.

1888
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,400
Well, I wish I could've
been there for that.

1889
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,160
Son, I'm proud of you.

1890
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,080
Yep. Yeah, I think....
I guess things are

1891
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,200
Just pretty much perfect right now.

1892
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,280
It's making me a little itchy.

1893
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,240
Well, what do you say we get
thrown out of an Applebee's?

1894
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,920
That sound like a good
idea? You read my mind, son.

1895
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,560
You can cuss at Applebee's.
Everybody pile in.

1896
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,560
How does one get thrown
out of Applebee's?

1897
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,240
You're about to find out. Okay.

1898
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,440
Watch, the doors actually open.

1899
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,240
Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

1900
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,840
We just want to take a moment to talk
to you about snow blindness in cats.

1901
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,200
It's affecting more and
more cats every year.

1902
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:10,120
And it scares the living shit out of us.

1903
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,200
Ninetyeight percent of us will
die at some point in our lives.

1904
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,280
The darkness is creeping towards
you, whether you know it or not.

1905
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,040
A little planning can go a long way.

1906
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,240
Listen, leaving your
big old corpse behind

1907
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,360
For your loved ones to
deal with ain't cool.

1908
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,080
That's why you should call
McCreedy Funeral Service.

1909
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,080
McCreedy's. They'll find
the hole and build the box.

1910
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,640
Bodies that look so good,
you're gonna wanna talk to it.

1911
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,400
We like to have a lot of
laughs on the racetrack

1912
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,960
But today we wanna talk
about something serious:

1913
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:46,200
Packs of stray dogs that
control most of the major cities.

1914
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:52,360
That's packs of wild, vicious dogs
that are controlling most of....

1915
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,360
Sorry.

1916
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I like to picture Jesus
like a mischievous badger.

1917
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,320
Like a muscular trapeze artist.

1918
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:02,880
Like a shapeshifter or a
changeling, like that guy.

1919
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:04,680
You ever hear of that TV show Manimal?

1920
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I like to think of
Jesus as a figure skater

1921
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,880
Who wears, like, a white outfit

1922
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:13,480
And he does interpretive ice
dances of my life's journey.

1923
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,680
Like a dirty old bum.

1924
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,240
He comes up to me, I'm about to sock
him one because he's a dirty old bum.

1925
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,800
Then I said, "Wait a minute,
I better not sock this guy.

1926
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,360
Something special about him."

1927
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,760
Yeah, and it turns out it's Jesus. Yeah.

1928
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,240
One, two.... Oh, God.

1929
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,920
Not again! No go. No go!
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1930
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,040
We got two knives in my leg.

1931
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,480
I know, but one is a safety
knife. One is a safety.

1932
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,360
It's coming out. It's coming out.

1933
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,920
I'm choking on my own spit.

1934
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,640
It hurts so bad I'm
choking on my own spit.

1935
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,200
Good night, guys. I'm
losing a lot of blood.

1936
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:50,200
Just relax, man. Good night.

1937
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,080
Ricky! Wake

1938
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:59,720
Sometimes, when it's late at night,
I dress up like Donna Summers.

1939
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:04,520
You know, I put on the skirt
and the fourinch heels, man.

1940
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,200
I love it.

1941
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,720
Sorry. Sorry.

1942
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:22,560
I would be honored if you
would let me sign your cast.

1943
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,240
And I would be honored
if you'd sign my balls.

1944
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:28,040
Oh, baby, that is a good
one. Hey, what are you doing?

1945
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:48,840
"Don't touch a one of
them. They're mine."

1946
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,320
So, what do you think
that story was about?

1947
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,320
Doesn't the bear symbolize the old South

1948
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:01,680
And the new dog, the encroaching
industrialization of the North?

1949
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:06,800
Duh. But the question is, should
the reader feel relief or sadness

1950
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,560
At the passing of the old South?

1951
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,360
Well, how about both?

1952
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,600
Oh, I get it. Moral ambiguity.

1953
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:18,280
The hallmark of all early
20thcentury American fiction.

1954
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:21,360
Great analysis, Walker. Thank you.
