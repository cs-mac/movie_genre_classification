1
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,855
To our grandparents...

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:26,889
Montevideo. Saturday, 7:14 AM.

3
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:24,889
Yo, Leche.

4
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:54,889
Fucking dogs!

5
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,854
It comes off with water, Leche.

6
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,389
The shit comes off.
The curse stays.

7
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,156
- It's the other way round.
- Really?

8
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,854
It's good luck.
Hey, I'm a genius,

9
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,888
I stepped on dogshit. When
I was a kid they taught me...

10
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,878
that it's good luck.

11
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:15,888
- Who told you that?
- My Uncle Alfonso.

12
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:18,888
The one that choked...

13
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:19,878
on an Easter egg?

14
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,384
Hard-boiled egg.

15
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,879
A hard-boiled egg.

16
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:23,879
With all due respect, Seba,

17
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,889
would you believe
a guy like that?

18
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,853
Fuck you, Leche.

19
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:28,878
Stepping on dogshit is plain
bad luck. It's a curse.

20
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:31,888
At least 24 hours
of bad luck.

21
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,853
Shut up, dumb ass.

22
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,888
- What, you don't believe me?
- No.

23
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:36,878
Uh?

24
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:41,853
Uh?

25
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:44,888
I say it comes heads, ok?

26
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,405
- Number.
- Ok.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,888
Leave it. It counts.

28
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:56,888
No, it doesn't.

29
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,904
Tails.

30
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,852
See?

31
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,387
You try now, Seba.

32
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:05,887
I say heads again.

33
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:09,853
Tails.

34
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:14,887
You're in deep shit,
aren't you, Leche?

35
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:19,852
I'm fucked.

36
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,887
Ok, see you.
I'm going to sleep.

37
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:24,404
Hey, wait,

38
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,852
I bet...

39
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,886
I bet this loser
a beer...

40
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,887
Stone, paper, scissors, c'mon.

41
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:33,852
No way.

42
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:36,887
Go get one, then.
It's your turn.

43
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:44,903
My turn?

44
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:52,887
Loser!

45
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,887
Anything else?

46
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:14,904
$25.50

47
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:21,887
Thanks.

48
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:49,876
Where are you going, Javi?

49
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:52,886
- To get another one.
- Get me a cookie.

50
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,886
- Am I your servant?
- Uh?

51
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,903
Am I your servant?

52
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,886
C'mon, be a nice guy.

53
00:04:58,921 --> 00:04:59,876
What?

54
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:00,876
Money, what else?

55
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,886
Hey, c'mon,
I'm broke.

56
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:07,851
Get a job, loser.

57
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,886
What's so funny?
Do you have a job?

58
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:10,876
I'm a student.

59
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,851
So am I.
Do I scratch my balls all day?

60
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:15,885
I pass Italian and I'm
done with high school.

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,875
It's next Tuesday, right?

62
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,885
- It's on Tuesday?
- Monday.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,850
And I stepped on dogshit.

64
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,851
Yeah, you should be
studying instead, lazy ass.

65
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,851
I mean the exam is on Monday
and I'm cursed, dumb ass.

66
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,886
So the other five times you failed
the exam was dogshit too?

67
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,851
It's like a joke.

68
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:32,885
Right when I was about
to face Beatriy...

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,885
Fucking dogs.

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,850
Dogs?

71
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:40,885
I had a dream about dogs.

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,850
Good, Javi...
Ass kisser.

73
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,885
I dreamed about a dog
in a supermarket.

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,850
A dog in a supermarket?

75
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,885
Freud would say
you're a fag.

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,875
Yeah, really.

77
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:59,385
Why don't you dream
about tits and asses?

78
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,884
How long since you
watched a porn video?

79
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,849
I don't know.

80
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:11,850
What's that?
Dog shit?

81
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,885
+Don't "shhh" me!
- Cut it.

82
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,850
No, no.

83
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:24,884
C'mon. Let's go.

84
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,849
Yeah! Two # 329.

85
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:53,885
- Uh?
- Two #329 buses.

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,875
So what?

87
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:56,885
They crossed one
another in front of us!

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,875
We have to make a wish.

89
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,850
That's bullshit.

90
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:04,849
It worked yesterday
with two 522s.

91
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:08,884
Really? What did you wish for?
Stepping on dogshit?

92
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:16,885
Just make a wish.
You have nothing to lose.

93
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:30,874
What I have to do?

94
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:38,883
Do I have to blow a match?
Of course.

95
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:49,873
Thanks, dude.

96
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:52,883
- You're a smart cookie.
- Sure I am.

97
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:53,873
I mean it, Javi.

98
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,848
If you don't start believing in this,

99
00:07:55,883 --> 00:08:02,884
you can say "good bye" to sex
life, and "hello" to wanking.

100
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,848
Cut the crap.

101
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,883
Javi, Maria gave
you a hamster.

102
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:08,873
A hamster.

103
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:15,383
Do you know what that means
in girlfriends' language?

104
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:21,882
It means, "I'm confused, etc..."
You're a dead man.

105
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:26,848
Did she really give
you a hamster?

106
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,883
Did you know hamsters
are very intelligent?

107
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:30,873
That's bullshit.
Who said that?

108
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:32,848
Your...

109
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,882
- Yes, my Uncle Alfonso.
- Alfonso.

110
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:36,872
- So what?
- Uh?

111
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:41,847
What's up?

112
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,847
What did you wish for, Seba?

113
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,882
Can't tell you.
It won't happen if I do.

114
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,883
So now you
believe that bullshit?

115
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,848
That's all myth.

116
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:53,882
I wished for these two
bottles to stand still.

117
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,847
And you?

118
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,882
That everything goes smoothly.

119
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,883
With Beatriy or the exam?

120
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:01,873
Both.

121
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,848
I used Javi's wish.

122
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:09,382
Oh! That'll be a big help.

123
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,650
Look! They're standing still.

124
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,784
I'll ask her out after class...

125
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:18,851
an "end of course"
kind of outing.

126
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,882
Once at the bar,
I go "Beatriy,

127
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:25,847
what do you say if now...

128
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:29,882
...that you're not
my tutor anymore...

129
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,847
- Shut up, dumb ass.
- Uh?

130
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:35,883
You were in kindergarten and she
already had hair down there, schmuck.

131
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,847
Just because your girlfriend...

132
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,882
is about to dump you,
doesn't mean...

133
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,394
I can't get some.

134
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:42,872
- You're sick.
- Uh?

135
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,872
Hamster.

136
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,382
You are a waste of time.

137
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,847
What are you doing, idiot?

138
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:51,882
Leave him alone.
She gave him a hamster.

139
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,846
Time to rock!

140
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,882
What's up, dudes?
All neat?

141
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:58,872
All neat, Hernan?

142
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,847
"All neat" you said?

143
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:03,882
You should ask me
permission to say "all neat."

144
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,882
I brought the "all neat"
from Brazil 4 years ago.

145
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,846
I was the one who
started that trend.

146
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,881
But I'll let you use it, Seba.
Where do you come from?

147
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,881
Never saw you again
after the bar.

148
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,871
From nowhere.

149
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,881
We went to "La cueva de Vicente"
and then came back here.

150
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,871
Who was playing?

151
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,846
"Venganya Tolengo" and...

152
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,882
- "Motivos"
- "Motivos Navidenos"

153
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,899
I had to go
to Laura's.

154
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,846
Hadn't she
dumped you?

155
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,881
Yeah. But she
had my bike...

156
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,846
I had to fix it.

157
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,846
The chain was short.

158
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,881
But she didn't
really dump me.

159
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,846
We are cool.

160
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:36,871
We had to split...

161
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,880
because of
a karma problem.

162
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:39,870
Sure, karma.

163
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,846
No, you don't get
the karma stuff.

164
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,881
Do you want me to explain it?
It's really important.

165
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,871
No, I have to work.
I'm sleepy.

166
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:48,881
Sleepy? I know a yoga
technique to stay awake.

167
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,881
It's really cool.
Once, at Cape Polonio,

168
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,846
it kept me awake
for seven,

169
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:57,880
eight days without sleeping.
It was great.

170
00:10:57,915 --> 00:11:01,397
On the seventh day
I started receiving,

171
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:04,157
these energy messages
from the moon.

172
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,881
I’m so dumb. I’ve to
have make a wish.

173
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,846
Now I will
get half of each wish:

174
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,880
Beatriz will tell me I’m cute but
she'll go back to her boyfriend...

175
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,880
And l'll pass the written part,
but fail at the oral...

176
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,870
In fact...

177
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
So I tell Hector I don't
come to work...

178
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:18,870
because I registered for college...

179
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
And then I tell dad I can't
go to college because...

180
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,870
I got another job...

181
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,869
And to Maria...

182
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,880
They were standing right there,
straight up, they were not falling.

183
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:28,871
Stupid bottles.

184
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,846
You can't tell
others your wishes.

185
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,881
Uncle Alfonso was right.
He would tell me,

186
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:35,871
"Seba..."

187
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,846
...and then Paulo
shows up and says...

188
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,881
"Why don't we do a
happening' or something?"

189
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,897
So I'm writing it,

190
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,845
but in my head...

191
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
If I put it on paper
I'll kill the magic.

192
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,870
- Totally.
- I got it here.

193
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,881
Do you want me
to tell you about it?

194
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,871
Sure, man.

195
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,846
Hang on...

196
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,881
Hang on a second...

197
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,845
<P>

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,380
Asshole!

199
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,845
Who is it?

200
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,879
Open your bourgeois minds!

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,380
What time do you have
to work tomorrow?

202
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:23,845
Tomorrow? You mean today.
In a few hours.

203
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,879
You know, I was thinking,
and I came up with...

204
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,896
a great idea for you.

205
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,905
To quit your job.

206
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,880
- Really?
- Yeah...

207
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:37,870
Uhh...

208
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,845
What idea?

209
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,844
I can't remember now...

210
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,879
but it was a good idea.
Really good.

211
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:47,879
Good, keep trying, Leche.

212
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,844
What is it?

213
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,879
Do you want to spend all
your life driving that car?

214
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:59,879
"We are open 24 hours"
You are such a loser...

215
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:06,844
Asshole!

216
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,879
You don't play with this, idiot.

217
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,843
You don't play with this, idiot.

218
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:14,878
Why not?
A piano will fall on my head?

219
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:18,878
Hey, Javi...

220
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:24,844
Fuck!

221
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,843
The cigarette!

222
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:32,878
What should I do
with you, Javier?

223
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,895
- Fire him, Dad!
- You shut up!

224
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,904
Javier, you are like
a son to me.

225
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:41,878
You want me to say it?
I'll say it:

226
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:45,395
"You are like a son to me."

227
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,878
So, why do you
do that to me?

228
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:49,868
Do what?

229
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:51,843
"Do what?"

230
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:56,843
Do you think
I'm stupid?

231
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,869
Do you think I don't
know what you...

232
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:05,879
and your friend "Chele"
did the other day?

233
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,879
"Leche". His name is "Leche."

234
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,843
I don't give a fuck.

235
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:16,843
I just know he's
a stupid asshole

236
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:19,878
who has shit for brains and he
is filling your head with shit too.

237
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:20,868
I care about that!

238
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:24,843
Don Hector, how are you doing?

239
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:28,844
You know, I was thinking
the other day...

240
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:36,878
and came up with this
great idea for your business...

241
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:45,842
- Fire him, Dad!
- You shut up!

242
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:50,878
Look, Javier, this is
your last chance.

243
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:53,843
I want you here
at 5 pm.

244
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:58,843
Well groomed, and
determined to succeed.

245
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,877
- He had to work the noon shift!
- You shut up!

246
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:05,842
Look at me.
How did I start?

247
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:09,842
- Say it, say it.
- Handing flyers.

248
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,842
- That's right. Where?
- At the City Hall Square.

249
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,877
I was a "sandwich man."
Look at me now. What do you see?

250
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:20,842
Success, Javi.
Success.

251
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:23,877
So... I want you
here at 6 pm.

252
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:26,842
Go, get some rest.

253
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,877
6 PM? Didn't you say
5 PM?

254
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:30,866
At noon!

255
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,841
Would you shut up?

256
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:40,877
Be a nice kid. Ok? Go, go.

257
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:45,877
And you? What are
you waiting for?

258
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,841
A ride home?

259
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:56,876
Get your lazy ass
out of here!

260
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:04,376
- Are you stupid?
- What's wrong, kid?

261
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:06,876
"Don Hector.
I have a great idea!"

262
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,841
What's your problem?

263
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:11,876
"Driving school and advertising
on wheels, all in one."

264
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,841
- You're so stupid.
- You don't get it.

265
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,876
Driving school and advertising on
wheels is a great business idea.

266
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,875
You get someone
to drive the car...

267
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,876
while you play the commercial.

268
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,841
Look.

269
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:25,866
This must be one of your ideas.

270
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:29,377
How do you know
it's mine?

271
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:32,876
Because it is a 25 Watts one.

272
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:37,893
Asshole.

273
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:44,402
Fuck off.

274
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:50,876
Easy.

275
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:23,840
Square root of 77?

276
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:31,876
"Did you know hamsters
are very intelligent?"

277
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:10,374
''How are you doing, champ?
Hi, Mr. Duarte. ''

278
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:16,875
- How are you doing, champ?
- Hi, Mr. Duarte.

279
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,869
So, how's school?

280
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,864
School is all right.

281
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:35,373
So, how's school?

282
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:38,839
School is all right.

283
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:42,374
- Everybody's well at home?
'-Yes, luckily.

284
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:48,141
- Did you step on?
- Yes, luckily... uh?

285
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:53,873
Yeah... Some folks say
it's good luck.

286
00:18:56,874 --> 00:19:00,875
The small farmers foundation has
started scientific research on apple,

287
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,874
...peach, orange and pear trees.
Next year the research...

288
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:09,891
...Will also include
berries and kiwi.

289
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:13,839
The foundation's steering
committee...

290
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:21,873
...Decided earlier this week
to fund new programs...

291
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:26,839
''Ale: I’m gone to the beach.
L'II be back on Monday.

292
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,874
Do your study and look after grandma, ''
blah, blah, blah... ''Kisses, Mom. ''

293
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,874
''PS: Beatriz called to
cancel today's class. ''

294
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,838
Fuck!

295
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:41,838
Fucking dogs!

296
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:44,873
In an effort to help small
farming companies...

297
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:48,839
buy new equipment.

298
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:56,873
Union leaders met with
the Secretary of Agriculture...

299
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:18,837
I'm coming!

300
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:26,872
Grandma, did you
not hear the bell?

301
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:39,871
- Ale.
- Don't call me Ale. I'm Leche.

302
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,872
- I knew you were home.
- Yes, yes.

303
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:45,837
- Put on a record.
- No.

304
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:51,837
- "Manson."
- Manson has tits.

305
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:55,871
- I went out with my cousin yesterday.
- Really?

306
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,836
Good.

307
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:59,836
We drank beer.

308
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,871
You can't drink
beer, right?

309
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,389
Because of the pills.

310
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,872
How much did you drink?

311
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:11,836
One bottle.

312
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:14,871
I gave him pills and
he gave me beer.

313
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:17,836
- Who?
- My cousin.

314
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,871
We bought
a supermarket cart.

315
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,861
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

316
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:24,871
- How much?
- I don't know. My cousin paid.

317
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,836
- You stole it.
- Yeah.

318
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:28,836
And it was a
very high place,

319
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:32,871
and my cousin would sing..."fly
birdie, fly, and the dog also flies."

320
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:34,836
What?

321
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:38,871
- What happened, Gerardito?
- I don't know.

322
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:39,861
What happened?

323
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:42,835
Have you seen
my dog Ulyses?

324
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,870
I know your dog.
What happened to Ulyses?

325
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:47,835
We don't know.

326
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,871
Remember what happened
to your other Ulyses? - Yes.

327
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,836
- You remember?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:54,861
- Did you like that?
- No, you didn't.

329
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:57,370
- Did you like that? No.
- Put on a record.

330
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,870
- What do we have to do then?
- I don't know.

331
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:02,887
- What do we have to do?
- I don't know.

332
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,870
- We should go look for him, right?
- Yes.

333
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:09,387
Let's go.

334
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,835
Kiss grandma.

335
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,835
So, what are you
doing now?

336
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,870
- We'll go look for Ulyses.
- You'll go look for Ulyses.

337
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,870
What happened to your forehead?

338
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:27,869
Nothing. I fell.

339
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:32,869
The lady downstairs
asks if this shoe is yours.

340
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:36,387
Yeah.

341
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:39,835
Thanks.

342
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:47,869
How's it going, grandma?

343
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:57,871
You really love this shit.

344
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:20,870
Son, open the door.

345
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:27,870
Open the door, Javier!

346
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,835
What were you doing?

347
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,834
Having lunch with "Alfonso".

348
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:48,834
You said you wouldn't
give it a name.

349
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,834
I named him Alfonso
because he's kind of slow.

350
00:24:53,869 --> 00:25:01,868
You're eating dog food again, Javi?
It's not good for either of you.

351
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:08,869
This is "the ideal supplement
for an insufficient intake."

352
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:12,834
And it tastes good.

353
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,833
- Try it.
- I don't want to.

354
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:22,868
- Try it...
- Cut it, I don't want!

355
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:25,833
We need to talk.

356
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:29,869
We are talking.
Or this is playing golf?

357
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,885
I'm not in love
with you.

358
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,394
I just don't feel the same

359
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,833
I felt the other times.

360
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:41,868
- And what do you feel?
- Right now?

361
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,833
No, the other times.

362
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,832
I don't know. You know...

363
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,867
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

364
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:52,833
Give me a metaphor.

365
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:55,868
Let me see... A roller coaster.
The way you feel on a roller coaster.

366
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:57,868
They closed
the roller coaster.

367
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:01,832
They reopened it,
asshole.

368
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,867
Let's say you are on the
Big Wheel, high up there.

369
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:06,867
You know how
you feel...

370
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:08,832
Like floating.

371
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:13,833
- No, I never "floated".
- Me neither.

372
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:18,867
It's not like that, but
it's kind of like that.

373
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:22,867
So, what do you feel
for me right now?

374
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:23,857
I really care about you.

375
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,833
But it's not what
it used to be.

376
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:31,368
I do have feelings,
but... you know...

377
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:36,868
- Kind of a Mary go Round.
- Fuck off.

378
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:41,833
- Kiss me.
- No way.

379
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:42,858
- C'mon... Kiss me.
- No way, Javi.

380
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,833
You smell like dog.

381
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:53,867
Ok, I'll brush my teeth.

382
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,867
And you, Javi?
What do you feel?

383
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,867
- Right now?
- Yes.

384
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:36,866
Dog smell.

385
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:57,866
CLOSED DUE TO DEATH
IN THE FAMILY

386
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:05,830
Fuck!

387
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:11,866
"MY NAME IS ULYSES
AND I'M MISSING"

388
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:15,831
Two hundred...

389
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:18,866
Ready. 200 copies, kid.
Do you want a bag?

390
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:26,865
Hey, kid!

391
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,866
- Hey, Pitufo. All neat?
- Yup.

392
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,831
What was Gerardito doing?

393
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:36,865
Leche's neighbor?
He made 100 copies.

394
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,382
- What happened to Sandia?
- Why?

395
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,865
There's a sign
on the video store.

396
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,865
No, he went to
get hot dogs.

397
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,855
He has another sign:

398
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:47,855
"Sorry. We are experimenting
technical difficulties."

399
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:49,360
That's when he's

400
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,854
taking a dump.

401
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,831
Really?

402
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,866
Is he going
to be out long?

403
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,856
No. Wait around.

404
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,831
Do you know this?

405
00:28:58,866 --> 00:28:59,856
The Guinness Book
of World Records.

406
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:02,866
I've got the book, the magazine...
Everything.

407
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,865
We'll be the first
Uruguayans in the book.

408
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,830
Who?

409
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:09,830
Kiwi and I.

410
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:13,865
"lo sono, tu sei, lui e"...

411
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,866
lo sono, tu sei...

412
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,883
...lui...

413
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:20,891
es...

414
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,830
"E".

415
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,865
lo sono. Tu sei. Lui...

416
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,882
Luis...

417
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,830
e...

418
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:35,865
- What's the record?
- Around 15,000.

419
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,830
But we'll beat it.

420
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:42,865
And that's just the beginning.
Then we'll do a couple...

421
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,882
of talk shows "Hola Susana"...

422
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,891
and "Sofovich"
in Buenos Aires...

423
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:51,864
Then "Don Francisco"
in Miami...

424
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,829
And then doors will open.

425
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:55,864
And finally the Guinness book.

426
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:56,854
Awesome...

427
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,865
Let me see... I want to see
if my uncle is here.

428
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,855
Your Uncle Alfonso?

429
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:05,865
Yes, he was a genius.
He ate 150 hard-boiled eggs.

430
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,855
Really.

431
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:09,864
Actually 149... He
swallowed them. Like this.

432
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:13,864
But the last egg did him.

433
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:14,854
He choked on it.

434
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:17,864
With all due respect, Seba.
What a dumb ass.

435
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:25,864
Fuck you, Pitufo.

436
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:47,364
Hello, Beatriz? Uhh...
It's Leche, all neat?

437
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,864
No... Uhh... Beatrice?
Leche here. What's up?

438
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,828
Beatrice.

439
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,863
Beatrice, tutto bene?

440
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,828
Leche here...

441
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:09,853
I was thinking about...

442
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:17,863
My mom told me...
...Maybe you couldn't...

443
00:31:18,863 --> 00:31:26,863
Grandma, only half of that one.

444
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:32,864
Beatrice... Ok, c'mon...

445
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:36,829
Shit.

446
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:41,358
Beatrice... uh...

447
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:45,853
+Hello.
- Hello.

448
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,863
Hey, Javi, what's up?
Who are you with?

449
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:49,828
Hamster.

450
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:53,864
- Oops. I'll call you later.
- Good.

451
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:55,828
Who was that?

452
00:31:55,863 --> 00:32:00,863
Nobody. Some chick.

453
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:05,863
I can't find...

454
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:08,828
my bra.

455
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:12,862
Look under the bed.

456
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,827
It isn't.

457
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:19,863
Check if the remote
control is there too.

458
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,863
How long has it been
there, asshole?

459
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:29,827
3, 4 days, I don't know.

460
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:36,827
Cut it out, Javi.
It's over.

461
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:40,862
- Take "Alfonso".
- It's for you.

462
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:44,862
He likes you.
Take it.

463
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:52,862
I'm out of here.

464
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:58,861
Is Sandia coming
anytime soon?

465
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,827
Hang on.

466
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,827
How's Leche doing?

467
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,827
- El Leche?
- There he is.

468
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,862
He's obsessed with
his Italian exam.

469
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,861
He has a crush
on his teacher.

470
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,826
His teacher?

471
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,861
His private tutor.
Some chick.

472
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,826
Huh.

473
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,361
- Hello.
- Kiwi!

474
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,827
Ready to go on T. V?

475
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:28,826
Sure.
The sky is the limit.

476
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,861
Hey, today's Saturday,
don't you have a match?

477
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,373
Are you crazy?

478
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:33,851
Didn't you know?

479
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:35,861
He's been suspended
for punching a referee.

480
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:36,851
Yeah, suspended...

481
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:44,860
But check this out.

482
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:54,862
At the tone, the time will be...
4: 16 p.m.

483
00:33:54,897 --> 00:34:02,861
Thanks.

484
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:14,826
Essere verb.

485
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,826
Mother fucking verb...

486
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:21,861
"lo sono... tu sei... lui e..."

487
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:26,861
...io sono... tu sei... lui "se"...

488
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:29,877
"e"...

489
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:32,826
"e"...

490
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,826
tu sei, lui e...

491
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:39,861
- Are you keeping count?
- Yup. 126, 127,128

492
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:40,851
What was the record?

493
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,860
15,953. Hold on,
I'll get there.

494
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,825
Uh... Sure.

495
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Hold on... look... I'm
getting there...

496
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:52,825
Bye, dude.

497
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:00,860
- Look, here's an Uruguayan.
- Look At that.

498
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,860
I care about you, Javier.

499
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:21,825
If I tell your dad...

500
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
you were in the
car with those junkies...

501
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,877
he'll kick your ass.
You know that.

502
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:29,859
- Just fire him, dad.
- You shut up!

503
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,876
I've thought about
firing you,

504
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:35,859
but your dad would kill you.

505
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:38,824
But I'm a good guy.

506
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,825
You know I'm your friend.

507
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,860
- Your friend. You listen?
- Yes, I know.

508
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:46,824
Pull over here.

509
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:54,859
Joselo and I
are getting off.

510
00:35:54,894 --> 00:36:02,823
Lui e...

511
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:09,859
"Distinguishedetti since 1892 at
the scientific congressetti of...

512
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:13,824
Parisetti, Genevetti,
Chicagotti and Montevideo..."

513
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:21,859
All bullshitte, et cetera, and
go fucketti your motheretti.

514
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,850
Look...

515
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,860
What are you doing here?
Get lost.

516
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:33,824
Fire him, dad.

517
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,859
He's not a bad kid,
just a little raw.

518
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:41,859
Too much muscle and
no brains. Anyway...

519
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:43,824
let's talk about work.

520
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,359
Drive around
the neighborhood...

521
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:49,126
playing the pasta
commercial.

522
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,859
Nice commercial,
isn't it?

523
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:53,824
Around 10...

524
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,859
you take the car
to Rolo's garage.

525
00:36:57,894 --> 00:37:01,859
And you pick it up
at 6 am tomorrow.

526
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:03,823
6:00 am, is that clear?

527
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:07,858
You'll go to the town
of Las Piedras with Joselo.

528
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,823
I have a gig there,

529
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:12,859
a commercial
for a bakery.

530
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:13,849
Ok?

531
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,824
Wait a moment!

532
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,358
And don't let
me down...

533
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:24,625
or I'll tell your dad.

534
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,858
And don't go out tonight.

535
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:31,823
Go to bed early.

536
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:37,858
Concentrate. Like a
soccer player, ok?

537
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:43,858
Bye, see you tomorrow.
Don't let me down.

538
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:21,856
Shit.

539
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:27,821
"lo sono,

540
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:30,822
tu sei, lui e."

541
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:37,856
Lui e, lui e, lui e...

542
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,821
Hey dude...

543
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:40,846
Is there a video store
around here?

544
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:42,821
- A video store?
- Yup.

545
00:39:42,856 --> 00:39:45,356
- Must be Sandia's...
- Yup.

546
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:47,856
- Two blocks this way...
- Yup.

547
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,857
Hey...
Aren't you Gepetto?

548
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:51,846
Yup.

549
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,856
Do you remember me?
Marmota's brother.

550
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,856
Two blocks, and then?

551
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:57,846
Right away.

552
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,821
A sharp left...

553
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:00,846
Didn't you work as
a royal guard?

554
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,856
Yup, but they fired me.

555
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,821
- How come?
- Voices.

556
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:06,855
Two blocks
and a sharp left?

557
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,867
Voices?

558
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:14,846
Voices...

559
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:18,856
in my head, get it?

560
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:22,855
You're standing there.

561
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,845
8 hours a day.

562
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,855
You can't talk,

563
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,820
you can't move...

564
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:30,855
You can't do anything. So...
What do you do?

565
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,820
- I don't know.
- So?

566
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:36,356
- I don't know.
- You think.

567
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:39,820
You think a lot.
All the time.

568
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:43,855
And then your head starts
thinking by itself, get it?

569
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,872
- Really?
- Sure.

570
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:47,820
You think a lot.

571
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:50,820
And one day the voices start.

572
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:55,854
Blah, blah on one side,
blah, blah on the other side.

573
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:56,844
I don't believe you.

574
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:01,820
That's tough.

575
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:04,855
And then... Simon came.

576
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,872
A voice.
Like a Sergeant.

577
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:10,854
- A Sergeant?
- No, a voice.

578
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,854
Simon says:

579
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,819
Dance!

580
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:16,844
Simon says:

581
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:17,844
Dance!

582
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:20,820
But you...

583
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:25,855
can't move, you're
a royal guard.

584
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,820
Like a statue.

585
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:30,820
And then all
the schoolchildren.

586
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:34,355
Thousands of them
with their teachers.

587
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:39,621
And the wiser ones
tell you things:

588
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:44,855
Stupid cop.
Fucking stupid cop.

589
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,820
And then Simon kicks in.

590
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:53,355
Simon says: Hit the
suckers, kick them.

591
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,621
- Did you kick them?
- No, but anyway...

592
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:03,854
And a royal guard scream
is something else.

593
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:08,855
And the little boy
was in shock.

594
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,854
His father wants
to sue me.

595
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:14,819
- Really?
- Yup.

596
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:19,854
Alright, Gepetto.
See you around.

597
00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:21,866
Bye.

598
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,844
What?

599
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:24,843
What did you say?

600
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:26,818
- What?
- What?

601
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:29,353
- Did you call me?
- Nothing.

602
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:31,854
- Did you say something?
- No.

603
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:39,854
See you, dude.

604
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,853
+Hello?
- Uh... Hello. Clarita?

605
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:05,818
Yes, who's this?

606
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,818
Alejandro,
Marisa's son.

607
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:11,352
Alejandrito!
You sound like a man.

608
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:14,119
- How are you?
+Good, good. Thanks.

609
00:43:14,154 --> 00:43:16,853
+Did you want to talk
to your tutor?

610
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:18,818
Yes, is Beatriy in?

611
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:22,818
No, you just missed her.

612
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,818
But she said
she'd call you.

613
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:27,852
- Would you know where she went to?
+Lalo's, I think.

614
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:30,817
But they had broken up...

615
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:32,852
Tell me about your grandma.
What a wonderful woman.

616
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:36,369
So vital,
so optimistic.

617
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:39,629
I always think of her.

618
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,817
What a charming
woman.

619
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:45,817
We used to get together for tea...

620
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:53,853
- I brought your stuff.
- I don't want it.

621
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:04,853
Look everybody,
here's Maria's bra!

622
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:11,818
You just left It there...

623
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:15,817
Oh, poor thing. You're
not taking care of him.

624
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:18,852
It doesn't play dead, doesn't
do anything. It's a pain.

625
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:26,853
You are a pain.

626
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:40,852
Hey, that tape is mine.

627
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,817
Uh?

628
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:45,851
- That's my tape.
- No, it's mine.

629
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,817
You gave it to me.

630
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:55,852
I gave you back your things,
now the tape is mine.

631
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:11,817
- That tape is mine.
- Uh?

632
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:14,851
- That's my tape.
- No, it's mine.

633
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:17,816
You gave it to me.

634
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:22,851
Get out of here, kid.
Don't touch.

635
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,816
Get out of here!

636
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:31,851
Don't bother me.
Can't you see I'm playing?

637
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,816
Fuck!

638
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:36,851
Hey, sir, this kid here
is bothering me!

639
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:44,850
I knew you were
going to lose.

640
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,815
Did you order
a piyya?

641
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,850
Yeah, but that
was an hour ago.

642
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:54,868
I got a hot dog
in the meantime.

643
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:56,816
Sorry. I'm new
in the job...

644
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,351
and don't know
the streets too well.

645
00:45:59,386 --> 00:46:01,850
That piyya must be
cold as shit by now.

646
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,850
Sorry, I had no idea.

647
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:04,840
It's 36 pesos.

648
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,815
- 36?
- Yes.

649
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,850
Here, keep the change.

650
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:15,814
Thanks, man.

651
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:16,839
What did you say?

652
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,816
- What did you just say?
- What?

653
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:19,841
- What did you just say?
- What? I said nothing...

654
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:20,841
Who did you call
a fucking cop?

655
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:21,841
I said nothing!

656
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:24,851
You calling me a fucking cop,
stupid whale?

657
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:32,850
Come here,
come here!

658
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:45,816
What's up, grandma?

659
00:46:45,851 --> 00:46:49,350
Dear housewife, do you know where
you are getting Sunday's pasta?

660
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:52,850
Of course, at ''Your Majesty''.
Your Majesty pasta factory...

661
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:55,815
...a guarantee of flavor
and distinction...

662
00:46:55,850 --> 00:47:03,850
''Your Majesty'' pasta factory,
and enjoy your Sunday lunch.

663
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:11,350
Dear housewife, do you know where
you are getting Sunday's pasta?

664
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:15,850
Of course, at ''Your Majesty''.
Your Majesty pasta factory...

665
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:17,814
...a guarantee of flavor
and distinction...

666
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:23,849
...''Your Majesty'' pasta factory,
and enjoy your Sunday lunch.

667
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,815
Fucking piyya-man.

668
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,850
Look at this piyya,
it sucks.

669
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:30,850
Take it easy, Sandia.

670
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:33,814
Forget about it.

671
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:37,849
Did you know there's only one
Uruguayan in the Guinness book?

672
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,814
I had no idea.

673
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,849
The guy clapped his
hands for 5 days.

674
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:46,814
Non-stopping.

675
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:53,849
And what was
he applauding?

676
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:55,849
I'm going inside...

677
00:47:55,884 --> 00:48:00,814
Ciao.

678
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:08,848
Go for it, Kiwi.
Keep going!

679
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,814
Do you know what
the problem is?

680
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,849
People don't realize that sex
is the all what matters.

681
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:19,865
This kid was telling
me the other day...

682
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,848
about this Freud thing.
You know Freud?

683
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:27,813
It's all about fucking.

684
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,848
That's what people have
on their minds: Fucking.

685
00:48:29,883 --> 00:48:31,865
People are crazy.

686
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,813
You think so?

687
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:37,348
That's why porn
movies are the truth.

688
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:40,848
That's real life.
All those sugar-coated,

689
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:43,813
fiction flicks
are bullshit.

690
00:48:43,848 --> 00:48:46,848
That's why I watch porn.
It's not for the babes.

691
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:50,365
Porn movies
are real life.

692
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,124
They show things
as they are.

693
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:55,848
They call things
by their name,

694
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:58,814
even when it hurts.

695
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:02,849
I know what
I'm talking about.

696
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:04,813
I've been there.

697
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:07,813
Do you know
what I did for love?

698
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:15,848
Do you know how hard
I tried to fall in love?

699
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:23,848
Everything, I did everything.
Forget about it.

700
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:27,813
Hey, Sandia,

701
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:31,848
I've never seen a porn flick.
Are they good?

702
00:49:31,883 --> 00:49:33,813
Get a comedy, Seba.

703
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:39,847
Yeah, but I don't feel
like laughing today.

704
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:41,813
I'd like a porn one.

705
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:45,848
Get one with the Trinity guy.
This one, "Double Trouble".

706
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,860
Everybody takes it.

707
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:49,838
You'll enjoy it.

708
00:49:49,848 --> 00:49:50,837
Yeah, but I don't know...

709
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,812
Trinity, the one
with the fat partner.

710
00:49:53,847 --> 00:49:55,847
Yeah, but I don't really
feel like laughing.

711
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:56,837
I'd like...

712
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:58,847
But this isn't
about laughing.

713
00:49:58,882 --> 00:49:59,837
- No?
- No, no,

714
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:04,813
it's an adventure movie.

715
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:09,347
How about something
kind of porn?

716
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:13,812
- There's no "kind of porn"
- No?

717
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:17,847
Do you want it with
fucking or no fucking?

718
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:21,846
I don't know...
with fucking.

719
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:25,811
Look here.

720
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:27,847
There's good stuff here.

721
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:30,864
First class.

722
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:33,812
Yeah, cool.

723
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:35,847
Here's a Swedish one.
This one is good.

724
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:38,811
The Swedish are good, right?

725
00:50:38,846 --> 00:50:42,846
This one is French.
It just got in. Good stuff.

726
00:50:42,881 --> 00:50:44,846
The French are
good too, right?

727
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:46,811
What do I know?

728
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:49,847
But I won't understand
anything they say.

729
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:51,847
What's there to understand?

730
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,836
I don't know...

731
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:54,341
There's nothing to "understand."

732
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:55,836
There's nothing to "understand."

733
00:50:55,846 --> 00:51:01,846
- Really?
- Just get it and watch it.

734
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:07,845
Which one do you want?
Which one,

735
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,862
the Swedish or the French?

736
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:11,810
Uh... the Trinity one.

737
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:15,846
The one with
the Trinity guy?

738
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:18,847
- It's out.
- It's out?

739
00:51:18,882 --> 00:51:22,812
It's out.

740
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,846
No, no. Don't
touch the catalog.

741
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:25,836
Don't touch the catalog.

742
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:33,846
Okay, then, give me
the Swedish one.

743
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:40,811
Javi... have you thought
about tomorrow?

744
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:44,846
Then you thought about Maria.
Another Sunday without Maria...

745
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:46,811
...a guarantee of suffering
and depression...

746
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:54,845
Keep playing games with Maria,
and have a great Sunday, loser.

747
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:02,846
Beatrice...

748
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:04,811
Hello.

749
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:12,845
No, I already have cable TV.

750
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,340
Guess who.

751
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:18,835
Guess who.

752
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:19,835
I don't know.

753
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,846
- Guess who.
- Get out of here.

754
00:52:21,881 --> 00:52:22,836
It's me, stupid, Rulo.

755
00:52:22,846 --> 00:52:25,845
The Rulo, dude.
What's up?

756
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,862
Aren't you Marmota?

757
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:29,845
No, I'm his brother.

758
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,810
Marmota Jr.?

759
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:33,845
Marmota Jr.!
How are you doing?

760
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,810
I haven't seen

761
00:52:35,845 --> 00:52:37,845
Marmota in five years.

762
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,844
I have been
"doing time".

763
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:40,834
Sure...

764
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:43,344
In prison, idiot!
Marmota Jr.!

765
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:45,612
You've grown up.
Where's Marmota?

766
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:48,246
In the United States, studying.

767
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,845
Big time crook
your brother!

768
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,835
Marmota Jr.!

769
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:53,845
- Here
- You're wrong.

770
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,809
What's up?
Marmota Jr.!

771
00:52:55,844 --> 00:52:57,844
- Okay, see you.
- Where are you going?

772
00:52:57,879 --> 00:52:58,834
Home.

773
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,844
- I give you a ride. Come.
- No, no.

774
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:02,809
Marmota Jr., c'mon.

775
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:03,834
No, it's just two
streets away.

776
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:06,845
You are Rulo's friend.
Rulo drives you home.

777
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,845
C'mon, Marmota Jr. Hold this,
Marmota.

778
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,861
Marmota Jr.,
what a crook.

779
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:13,844
You go straight here...

780
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,809
Hey, Marmota Jr.

781
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:17,809
You know what
we're doing now?

782
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:18,834
We're going to get
some stuff for tonight.

783
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:24,344
- But I was going home.
- Marmota Jr.!

784
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:29,844
I told you, I already
have cable T.V.

785
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:49,344
Bo, dumb ass,
how did you break it?

786
00:53:49,379 --> 00:53:51,845
I told you, I tripped
with the cord.

787
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,809
Respect, my ass!

788
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:59,809
And if Beatrice'd call you?

789
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:02,844
I'll call her. She's not home
until 9:00 pm anyway.

790
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:03,834
What do you care?

791
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:06,844
Wasn't I too
young for her?

792
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:09,809
I'm not toasting.

793
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:17,844
Don't cheers. Drop here.

794
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:27,808
Where's Seba?

795
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:30,808
Smoke, Fede, smoke!

796
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:35,843
Marmota smokes pot and has a porn
video on him. What a kinky boy!

797
00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:36,833
Look at that!

798
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:39,809
Oh man.

799
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:45,843
Get it? I touch here, I get the Italian
channel and I study watching TV.

800
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:48,843
Your cable TV "system" sucks.
You don't see shit.

801
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:53,843
Uh? It's cable TV
and I get it for free.

802
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:56,808
It sucks.

803
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:58,807
Wow, hamster boy here,

804
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:00,843
who is about to say
good-bye to his sex life...

805
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:03,808
says cable TV sucks.

806
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,843
Let me tell you, cable TV
is better than any girlfriend.

807
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:07,833
Than anything else.

808
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:10,843
Guaranteed entertainment 24/7,

809
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:13,842
356 days a year.

810
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,859
365, idiot.

811
00:55:16,894 --> 00:55:19,807
Hamster.

812
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:21,842
- Right there. What did you touch?
- Uh?

813
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:23,860
- What did you touch?
- Nothing.

814
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:25,808
Now it's gone.
Stand right there.

815
00:55:25,843 --> 00:55:30,842
You'll be the antenna, I'll tell
you what's on the screen.

816
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:32,807
There's Moe, eh?

817
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:33,832
- There's Moe.
- Yes, yes.

818
00:55:33,842 --> 00:55:35,337
There's Moe.
Moe is the leader.

819
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,832
Moe hits Curly in the head...

820
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:38,807
with a hammer.

821
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:41,842
Curly turns around and hits Larry
in the stomach with a frying pan.

822
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:43,807
Larry is in pain.

823
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:49,842
Now Larry tries
to get back at Moe...

824
00:55:49,877 --> 00:55:51,842
Yo, antenna man, stand still.

825
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:52,832
Shit.

826
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:59,806
What can we do?

827
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:02,841
Shouldn't you be working?

828
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,858
Yup.

829
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:06,806
So?

830
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,807
So what?

831
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:14,842
Give me a break.
Who are you, Mr. Roger?

832
00:56:14,877 --> 00:56:15,831
Grandma,
your hand...

833
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:23,842
Grandma.

834
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:27,842
They'll fire your ass.

835
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:30,807
Uh?

836
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:33,842
Hector is going
to fire you.

837
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:34,832
You just mind your exam.

838
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:37,842
I have everything
under control.

839
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:42,859
Of course, at ''Your Majesty''.

840
00:56:42,894 --> 00:56:47,806
''Your Majesty'' pasta factory...

841
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:51,841
Dear housewife: Do you know where
you are getting this Sunday's pasta?

842
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:56,842
Of course, at ''Your Majesty''.
''Your Majesty'' pasta factory,

843
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:03,358
a guarantee of flavor...

844
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:09,806
- Door bell.
- You go.

845
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:13,841
I can't.
I'm surfing channels.

846
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,858
C'mon, get the door.

847
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:19,806
Hey, it's your house.

848
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:22,341
I cleaned your carpet
the other day, kid.

849
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:24,841
You drop the ashtray,
you clean the carpet.

850
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:32,840
Yeah, but it was your house.

851
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,840
Two out of three.

852
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:39,831
You lose.

853
00:57:39,841 --> 00:57:42,841
C'mon, two out of three.

854
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,831
Go.

855
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:46,841
Three out of five.

856
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:47,830
C'mon.

857
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,830
You're sick.

858
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
C'mon, you chicken,
three out of five.

859
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,840
That's the way it is...
even in the U.S.A.

860
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:54,840
In tennis it's three
out of five too.

861
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,857
Three out of five.

862
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,805
You're so lame.

863
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Oops, where do you
think you're going?

864
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,339
Who was it?

865
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:22,804
Who was it?

866
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:25,805
No one, I told you.

867
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:33,839
Some asshole playing
ring and run.

868
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:39,839
Last stop Marmota!
C'mon.

869
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:40,829
Get something to eat.

870
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:48,840
Ciao, Marmota.

871
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,830
Change that.

872
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,830
Change that.

873
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,805
This is great.

874
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Change that, schmuck.

875
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:12,840
Look! Leave that on.
Go back.

876
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,352
Right there.
Yes.

877
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:15,830
Yes, yes, yes.

878
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,839
- Who's that?
- The guy from ChiPs!

879
00:59:19,874 --> 00:59:21,804
What was his
character's name?

880
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,839
He's doing a "Lose
Fat Fast" commercial.

881
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:25,839
It was something
with a "P".

882
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:27,804
It wasn't Pictorino.

883
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,839
Hey "ChiPs",
don't do that to me.

884
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:36,804
What was his name?

885
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:40,804
No, no. Now you
go and think.

886
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:43,839
Hey, asshole, can't you go
around the other way?

887
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:51,838
It's four steps
shorter this way.

888
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:54,803
Hey Seba,

889
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:58,839
what was the name of the
dark-skinned guy from "ChiPs"?

890
00:59:58,874 --> 01:00:00,804
Arnold.

891
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:02,839
No, stupid.
The guy from ChiPs.

892
01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:03,829
Remember ChiPs?

893
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:11,838
I remember Arnold.

894
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,838
- Should we light this?
- Cool.

895
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,355
- Is Seba still in the can?
- Yup.

896
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,803
What did he take?
He's zoned out.

897
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:34,838
More so than my grandma.
And you've seen my grandma.

898
01:00:34,873 --> 01:00:38,837
Yeah. She's kind
of embalmed.

899
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:40,803
Hey, all neat?

900
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:44,338
- How did you get in?
- The door was open.

901
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:47,838
You won't guess what
just happened to me.

902
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:50,355
You found uncle
Alfonso's karma.

903
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,613
No, silly, this was
totally weird.

904
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:54,802
You were raped by
your own karma.

905
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:56,837
I won't tell you if
you're not interested.

906
01:00:56,872 --> 01:01:04,838
- No, we're not.
- Now that's nice!

907
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:08,802
I came here earlier but
you guys weren't in...

908
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:11,837
so I said, "I'll go up to the
rooftop and smoke some grass

909
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,802
until Leche comes"...

910
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:14,828
Guess who was
in the elevator?

911
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,803
Your neighbor,
the slow one.

912
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:19,838
Gerardito is not slow,
he's different.

913
01:01:19,873 --> 01:01:22,837
Are you friends with Leche?

914
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:23,827
Like brothers.

915
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:25,802
Me too.

916
01:01:25,837 --> 01:01:29,838
The kid was weird.
He was like looking for a dog...

917
01:01:29,873 --> 01:01:31,838
and then he goes,
"What's in there?"

918
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:32,828
What's in there?

919
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:34,803
Nothing, just the rooftop.

920
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,338
I've never been to the rooftop.

921
01:01:37,373 --> 01:01:39,802
And guess who
was in the rooftop?

922
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:43,837
- Gerardito's karma.
+No, stupid. The dog.

923
01:01:43,872 --> 01:01:44,827
Ulyses!

924
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:46,802
Uh? What was Ulysses
doing in the rooftop?

925
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:49,838
Something to do with Gerardito's
cousin and a song about a bird.

926
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:50,828
Uh?

927
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:52,838
I don't know, but the
kid was so excited.

928
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,354
And I mean so,
so excited.

929
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:57,837
I had to give him
some pot...

930
01:01:57,872 --> 01:01:58,827
to get him out of it.

931
01:01:58,837 --> 01:02:00,837
Smoke.
Here, smoke kid.

932
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:03,354
You gave Gerardito pot?

933
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,837
Hey, he really liked it...

934
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,854
He got really stoned.

935
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:09,801
He smoked like this...

936
01:02:09,836 --> 01:02:11,837
How can you give Gerardito pot,
you sick fuck?

937
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:13,802
Hey, he was really happy!

938
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:17,837
He freed himself. He let all...

939
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:19,854
his energy out, you know.

940
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:21,802
He was totally happy.

941
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:24,836
He was so high he was flying.
Jumping and screaming like crazy.

942
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,801
It really hit him.

943
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:29,836
But then he... like,
stalled.

944
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,836
He got stuck.

945
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:33,801
Stuck?

946
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:35,837
Yeah, I don't know, like,
weird, you know. Stuck.

947
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:38,837
What do you mean
"stuck", man?

948
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:40,801
What happened?

949
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:43,836
He was shaking,
his eyes were rolling.

950
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:44,826
I don't know.

951
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:47,836
That's a seizure, you asshole.
Gerardito is epileptic.

952
01:02:47,871 --> 01:02:49,801
Exactly.

953
01:02:49,836 --> 01:02:52,336
His mom said
something like that.

954
01:02:52,371 --> 01:02:54,800
What? You took
him to his mom?

955
01:02:54,835 --> 01:02:57,836
What was I supposed to do,
throw him off the roof?

956
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:59,801
He's a human being, man.

957
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:01,801
Let his mother
take care of him.

958
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:03,836
But don't say anything
about the grass...

959
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:04,826
or she'll kill me.

960
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:08,336
They should lock you up.
You're a son of a bitch.

961
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:11,835
That's a very bad vibe, dude.
I'm out of here.

962
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:18,852
See you later Leche.
Good bye.

963
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:25,835
How could he give
Gerardito grass?

964
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:35,800
Seba, your legs.

965
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:39,835
Was I in the can
for two hours?

966
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,852
Hey, dumb, what
did you smoke?

967
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:45,862
I don't know,
it looked like pot,

968
01:03:45,897 --> 01:03:48,836
but it hit you ten
times stronger.

969
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,853
They called it
fireworks.

970
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:54,801
Wouldn't it be
fireworks?

971
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:56,835
And how did the
"fireworks" hit you?

972
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:04,835
How did it hit me?

973
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:10,836
I don't know,
it makes you see stuff.

974
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:14,800
Yes, stay there.
Go back, go back.

975
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:17,835
Oops, it's 9:00 pm.
I have to call Beatriy.

976
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,835
Wait up, I'll go with
you and get the car.

977
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,835
Why don't you call
her from here.

978
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,852
The phone is broken.

979
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,800
Really, how come?

980
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:28,800
How come?
You don't know?

981
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:31,835
You were so high you
hit me with the telephone.

982
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,835
And tried to strangle his
grandma with the TV cord.

983
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,800
Get out of here.

984
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:38,835
Wait, you stay and
watch over my grandma.

985
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:41,800
She can't be
left by herself.

986
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:44,334
No, please man. She
scares me, really.

987
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:46,799
If she makes weird
noises unplug her.

988
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:52,335
And there's tits on channel 15.
You've never seen any.

989
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:57,834
Man, Leche, if she dies I
have nothing to do with it.

990
01:04:57,869 --> 01:04:59,834
Yo, this is a commercial.

991
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:03,799
Your problem.

992
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:11,834
- Hi, Barragan.
- Hi, Leche.

993
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:20,834
- Are you going to be long?
- Very.

994
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:05,833
USE INSTRUCTIONS

995
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:23,799
+Hello.
- Beatriy?

996
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:26,834
+Leche! ''come vai? ''
- "Bene, bene."

997
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:29,799
- You say, "bene" right?
+Yes, "bene".

998
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:31,833
I tried to call you.
Is your phone out of service?

999
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:34,833
Yes, my grandma
tripped on the cord...

1000
01:06:34,868 --> 01:06:35,823
Poor thing.

1001
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,833
Know What?
I got cable TV.

1002
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:38,823
Good.

1003
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,333
Look, I’m sorry about
canceling the class...

1004
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:43,833
...I had to help Lalo
move to his new place.

1005
01:06:43,868 --> 01:06:45,798
I’ve been kind of busy.

1006
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,833
I thought you and Lalo
had broken up.

1007
01:06:48,868 --> 01:06:51,798
Yeah, kind of. I don't know.
Yes and no.

1008
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,833
You know, I think you should
take some time to think.

1009
01:06:53,868 --> 01:06:55,833
Yeah, maybe... I don't know...
...Anyhow,

1010
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,845
how are you coming...

1011
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,823
with the exam prep?

1012
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,832
- Well, "cosi, cosi."
+''Cosi, cosi. ''

1013
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:05,797
Remember I can't give
you any more lessons.

1014
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:08,833
Did my mom give you the list
of things to go over?

1015
01:07:08,868 --> 01:07:09,823
Yeah.

1016
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:10,823
She's very cool, your mom.

1017
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,833
Yeah, she is.
And she loves you.

1018
01:07:12,868 --> 01:07:14,798
She wants to hook
me up with you.

1019
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:17,832
+Can you imagine?
- Can you imagine? Yeah.

1020
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,832
Alright, Leche.
I have to get going.

1021
01:07:20,867 --> 01:07:23,797
- Are you going out?
+Yeah...

1022
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,797
I think I’ll go to "Magenta"
with friends.

1023
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:27,832
+You are going to study, right?
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

1024
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:32,797
- You know, I got cable TV.
+Yes.

1025
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:36,832
- And there's an Italian channel.
+Yes.

1026
01:07:36,867 --> 01:07:38,797
- Channel 41.
+Yes, I know.

1027
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:40,797
- They speak Italian all the time.
+Sure.

1028
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:42,832
So I thought, instead
of having a class, uh...

1029
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:44,849
maybe you would
want to come over...

1030
01:07:44,884 --> 01:07:46,831
and we could
watch Italian TV...

1031
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:47,821
And you?

1032
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:51,796
Yeah, Leche, you know,
if you have any questions,

1033
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:53,832
you can write them down and then
you can call me and ask me...

1034
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:56,832
Oops, the door bell. Gotta go.
That must be Lalo.

1035
01:07:56,867 --> 01:08:04,831
Bye, sweetie.
Kisses, ciao.

1036
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:47,832
- Where is the car?
- Out there.

1037
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:52,831
- Did you call her?
- Yup.

1038
01:08:52,866 --> 01:08:55,796
And?

1039
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,796
You know...

1040
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,832
I was better playing
Space Invaders.

1041
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:02,797
Space Invaders?

1042
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:05,796
I had it on my Atari.

1043
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:07,796
What? Did you
have an Atari?

1044
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:10,831
Javi, did they give
you an Atari?

1045
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:15,848
An Atari? No.

1046
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:20,830
An Atari? No.

1047
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:26,821
Eight ball.

1048
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:34,795
Fuck.

1049
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,830
What are you doing, pervert?

1050
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:39,795
Are you stupid?

1051
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,795
It's okay, man.
She's asleep.

1052
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:46,831
Okay my ass, stupid.
Grandma, come this way.

1053
01:09:46,866 --> 01:09:51,830
She's asleep, Leche.
She doesn't understand.

1054
01:09:51,865 --> 01:09:55,830
You don't understand,
asshole.

1055
01:09:55,865 --> 01:09:57,795
Seba...

1056
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,830
You really beat your Uncle
Alfonso with this one.

1057
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:07,794
Shut up, idiot.

1058
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,795
So now you're into...

1059
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:13,830
touching your privates
next to a grandma.

1060
01:10:13,865 --> 01:10:15,795
Fuck off.

1061
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:20,330
You always liked her, huh?

1062
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:24,829
Feet off the table, kids.

1063
01:10:24,864 --> 01:10:32,830
Let's go. It's late.

1064
01:10:47,829 --> 01:10:52,828
Seba, let's go to "Magenta".

1065
01:10:52,863 --> 01:10:54,794
Is Magenta any good?

1066
01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:56,829
You have
nothing to loose.

1067
01:10:56,864 --> 01:10:58,794
Magenta?

1068
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:02,829
Hey, hold it, dude. That's
not nice. I'm totally happy.

1069
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:03,819
Hold it!

1070
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:09,828
"All you need is love..."
Fascists!

1071
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:11,793
Not in this life.

1072
01:11:11,828 --> 01:11:14,329
- C'mon, Beatriy is going.
- So?

1073
01:11:14,364 --> 01:11:16,829
And she's bringing
two girlfriends.

1074
01:11:16,864 --> 01:11:18,795
Really?

1075
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,795
Are they hot?

1076
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,829
Hot enough for the
likes of you guys.

1077
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:25,794
Leche, have you
ever thought...

1078
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:29,829
that while you were watching
Underdog Beatrice already...

1079
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:36,346
- Who was it?
- Jean Michael Hamster.

1080
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:42,829
- Where are you going, man?
- Bathroom.

1081
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:45,829
- "Beatrice."
- "Hamster."

1082
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:53,828
And what's with you?

1083
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:59,793
Beatrice...

1084
01:11:59,828 --> 01:12:07,829
lo sono... tu sei...
lui "se"...

1085
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:11,828
Beatrice...

1086
01:12:11,863 --> 01:12:14,793
Lui "e".

1087
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:22,828
- Grayie.
- Prego.

1088
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:31,793
- Five days?
- Five.

1089
01:12:31,828 --> 01:12:35,828
- What was he applauding?
- I don't know.

1090
01:12:35,863 --> 01:12:43,792
Good.

1091
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,827
Hey kids,
I'm out of here.

1092
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:46,817
What are you?

1093
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:48,793
Now this is grand!

1094
01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:50,828
Fede! How are you doing?
What is he doing here?

1095
01:12:50,863 --> 01:12:53,828
Remember him? He was
at your place today.

1096
01:12:53,863 --> 01:12:55,827
He's Rulo's friend.

1097
01:12:55,862 --> 01:12:56,817
You remember?

1098
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:57,817
How are you kids doing?

1099
01:12:57,827 --> 01:13:01,827
I'm Chopo. You know, like "Pocho"
spelled backwards, right?

1100
01:13:01,862 --> 01:13:03,827
This is Menchaca.
These are the kids.

1101
01:13:03,862 --> 01:13:05,827
All neat?
Yeah...

1102
01:13:05,862 --> 01:13:06,817
All neat.

1103
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:09,327
What happened to
your head, champ?

1104
01:13:09,362 --> 01:13:11,594
- Nothing, I fell.
- Oh, you fell.

1105
01:13:11,629 --> 01:13:13,827
You know, I was
admiring your jacket.

1106
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:15,792
- Very nice.
- Take it off.

1107
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:17,827
- Show him the jacket.
- Yeah, give it to me.

1108
01:13:17,862 --> 01:13:18,817
Give it to me.

1109
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:22,327
- You want to try it on?
- Yes, I do.

1110
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:25,791
You know how
I long for this jacket...

1111
01:13:25,826 --> 01:13:30,826
I want to show Menchaca
how it looks on me.

1112
01:13:30,861 --> 01:13:32,791
Menchaca, am I
a duke or what?

1113
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:34,827
Cut it out, let's go
get the stuff, c'mon.

1114
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:37,792
You're right.
Don't get mad.

1115
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:38,817
Menchaca was telling me
to go get some "stuff".

1116
01:13:38,827 --> 01:13:41,827
You get my drill?

1117
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:44,792
Very good stuff.

1118
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:49,827
Would you want to invest,
say, 200 pesos?

1119
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:51,827
No, I had enough
for today.

1120
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:54,792
You had enough?

1121
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:56,827
This guy, he's the king
of International porn...

1122
01:13:56,862 --> 01:14:01,827
and he's backing up
for only 200 pesos.

1123
01:14:01,862 --> 01:14:02,817
Sorry, but...

1124
01:14:02,827 --> 01:14:03,817
Excuse me,
I'm not talking to you.

1125
01:14:03,827 --> 01:14:05,827
I'm talking to Fede...

1126
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:06,817
"Seba", I'm Seba.

1127
01:14:06,827 --> 01:14:09,327
- 200 pesos is a lot.
- 200 is nothing.

1128
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,826
200 is nothing for
what I can get you.

1129
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:13,791
Yeah, but no, thanks.

1130
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:15,791
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1131
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,826
You give me 200 pesos and I'll
get you something incredible,

1132
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:18,817
right, Menchaca?

1133
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:20,827
Look at Menchaca.
He's so happy...

1134
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:24,844
Should we give them?

1135
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:28,826
100, 150... 200 pesos.

1136
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:30,791
Beautiful.

1137
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:33,826
You stick with me
and we deliver.

1138
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:36,791
We're friends,
you and me.

1139
01:14:36,826 --> 01:14:38,826
You're friends with Rulo,
you're friends with Menchaca.

1140
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:39,816
We won't fuck you over.

1141
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:42,826
Stick with us, we're going
to get you some stuff.

1142
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:44,826
This stuff is,
let me tell you,

1143
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:47,343
is very good stuff.

1144
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:49,791
It's a good stuff.

1145
01:14:49,826 --> 01:14:51,826
I'm not talking
bullshit here,

1146
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:52,816
right, Menchaca?

1147
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:56,826
Gotta go now.
I'll see you in...

1148
01:14:56,861 --> 01:14:57,815
uh... two minutes.

1149
01:14:57,825 --> 01:15:00,825
- Hey, the... the jacket.
- Don't touch me.

1150
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,815
- What?
- Don't touch me.

1151
01:15:01,825 --> 01:15:02,815
You don't have to touch.

1152
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:04,826
- What do you want?
- The jacket, you know...

1153
01:15:04,861 --> 01:15:08,826
Let me explain something here...

1154
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:11,343
Let's say... Menchaca,

1155
01:15:11,378 --> 01:15:13,601
Chopo, jacket, chicks.

1156
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:15,790
Are you getting my drill?

1157
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:17,825
We go to the neighborhood wearing
the jacket, the girls see me and go...

1158
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,790
Oh, Menchaca, Chopo.
Cool.

1159
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:22,825
Let me show off
a little, okay?

1160
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:26,842
You know, I'm kind of cold.

1161
01:15:26,877 --> 01:15:30,790
"I'm kind of cold," huh?

1162
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:33,825
Okay, if you're friends
with Rulo and Fede here,

1163
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,790
we're family.

1164
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,825
We'll see you
in two minutes.

1165
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,790
See you.

1166
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:44,824
Are they friends of yours?

1167
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:45,814
I don't know.

1168
01:15:45,824 --> 01:15:47,789
Tell me...

1169
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:48,814
are they friends
of yours or not?

1170
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:51,825
Yeah, I think they're
friends with my brother.

1171
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,790
There goes our money.

1172
01:15:53,825 --> 01:15:55,790
Trust them.
They just left.

1173
01:15:55,825 --> 01:15:57,825
And they're friends
with "Fede" here.

1174
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:00,789
Fuck off, dude.

1175
01:16:00,824 --> 01:16:06,789
They won't come back.

1176
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:08,824
Let me have a puff,
Leche.

1177
01:16:08,859 --> 01:16:10,790
Ask Javi.

1178
01:16:10,825 --> 01:16:13,791
Are you upset?

1179
01:16:13,826 --> 01:16:15,825
- Fuck you, "Fede".
- Fuck you.

1180
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,842
You're the one
who said "yes".

1181
01:16:17,877 --> 01:16:19,825
I did?
I asked you guys...

1182
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,790
and you said "yes".

1183
01:16:21,825 --> 01:16:24,825
What did you expect, with those...

1184
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:28,342
two faces standing there.

1185
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:31,100
What's so fucking funny?

1186
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:33,789
We just lost our money.

1187
01:16:33,824 --> 01:16:36,825
No problem, Leche
pays, anyway.

1188
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,815
Sure.

1189
01:16:37,825 --> 01:16:39,825
We spent our money
in the "good stuff."

1190
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:42,842
Go fuck yourselves...

1191
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:45,350
- The money!
- What?

1192
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:49,104
My fucking money!

1193
01:16:49,139 --> 01:16:52,481
C'mon, dumb ass!

1194
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:55,789
Fucking kids!

1195
01:16:55,824 --> 01:17:03,824
You fucking
did me, fuckers!

1196
01:17:18,823 --> 01:17:20,824
Could I just go in to see
if my girlfriend is there?

1197
01:17:20,859 --> 01:17:24,789
It's 100 pesos.

1198
01:17:24,824 --> 01:17:26,789
Just one second.
In and out.

1199
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:32,323
Sure. 100 pesos and
you get a free drink, man.

1200
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:37,823
- "Thanks", dude.
- "You're welcome", dude.

1201
01:17:57,823 --> 01:18:00,823
- Who did it?
- That one.

1202
01:18:00,858 --> 01:18:02,787
Hey!
Stop it!

1203
01:18:02,822 --> 01:18:07,788
I didn't do anything!

1204
01:18:07,823 --> 01:18:09,823
Stop, he's a
student of mine!

1205
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:13,340
- Leave him alone!
- Asshole!

1206
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:16,823
He's a student of mine!
Stop it!

1207
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:17,812
Beatrice...

1208
01:18:17,822 --> 01:18:25,822
You piece of shit!

1209
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:21,787
That's my tape.

1210
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:24,822
Don't be upset, Lalo. It's
just a ride to his house.

1211
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:27,787
He has no money.
Look at him.

1212
01:19:27,822 --> 01:19:29,822
I just asked him not to
throw out in the car.

1213
01:19:29,857 --> 01:19:32,339
- You heard that, man?
- Yes.

1214
01:19:32,374 --> 01:19:34,821
- Are you sure?
- He said yes.

1215
01:19:34,856 --> 01:19:37,839
Ok, I didn't hear him.

1216
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:40,787
Leche, you schmuck,

1217
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:41,812
why where you
throwing bottles?

1218
01:19:41,822 --> 01:19:44,822
I didn't do it, Beatriy. I swear.
It was someone who...

1219
01:19:44,857 --> 01:19:52,821
Shouldn't you be studying?

1220
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:21,785
No.

1221
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,786
- How's Alfonso?
- Dead.

1222
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:30,821
He choked on that shitty
food you gave him.

1223
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:35,837
Oh well,

1224
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:40,820
ciao.

1225
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,810
Are you sure?

1226
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,785
Yeah, I feel like walking.

1227
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,819
- Are you really sure?
- Yeah.

1228
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:08,810
Let him go, Beatriy.

1229
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,821
Well... Bye.

1230
01:21:12,856 --> 01:21:16,786
Hey, Leche!

1231
01:21:16,821 --> 01:21:18,821
You dropped
this matches back...

1232
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:22,837
there in the floor.

1233
01:21:22,872 --> 01:21:26,820
Good luck on Monday.

1234
01:21:26,855 --> 01:21:34,821
Uh...

1235
01:21:36,821 --> 01:21:44,820
lo sono, tu sei, lui e...

1236
01:24:34,818 --> 01:24:42,817
You're fired!

1237
01:26:26,817 --> 01:26:29,781
Where's Seba?

1238
01:26:29,816 --> 01:26:30,806
Wasn't he with you?

1239
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:33,781
Marmota Jr.
Big time crook!

1240
01:26:33,816 --> 01:26:41,816
Please, stop here!
You're going the wrong way!

1241
01:26:46,815 --> 01:26:50,316
- Five days?
- Uh?

1242
01:26:50,351 --> 01:26:54,083
- Five days?
- Yup.

1243
01:26:54,118 --> 01:26:57,816
What was he applauding?

1244
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:02,780
I don't know...

1245
01:27:02,815 --> 01:27:10,815
Maybe that it wasn't Sunday.

1246
01:27:22,815 --> 01:27:30,814
Fucking dogs!
