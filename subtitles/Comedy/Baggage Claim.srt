1
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,183
Marriage has always been
a big deal to my mother.

2
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,850
She loves weddings.

3
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,018
Especially hers.

4
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,682
And hers.

5
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,093
And hers.

6
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,260
And, well...

7
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,362
you get the picture.

8
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,207
But as easy as it was for
my mom to get married...

9
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,810
Whee!

10
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,379
my relationships...

11
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,553
have never been
cleared for takeoff.

12
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:34,228
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

13
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,943
My eyes shot out like a fish out
of water and I'm jumpin' in it

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,638
Oh, I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

15
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,240
I never stay within the lines

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,514
I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

17
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,056
I'm gonna take what's mine

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,221
Oh, don't get scared for me

19
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,790
Just be prepared for me

20
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,323
'Cause I'm in love with love

21
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,732
In love

22
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:10,537
When it comes to love
can't get enough

23
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:16,473
I'm not gonna change, I'm not gonna
change, I'm not gonna change my ways

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:22,776
'Cause I'm in love with love

25
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:28,224
'Cause I'm in love with love

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:34,596
When it comes to love
can't get enough

27
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,395
Can't get enough

28
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,631
I always wanted to be a
flight attendant. It's a great job.

29
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,599
You get to travel around the world,

30
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,610
meet interesting people
and see exotic places.

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,146
But that hasn't left
a whole lat of time for love.

32
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,145
My mom says it's
because I'm too picky.

33
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,651
I don't think I'm picky.
I just know what I don't want.

34
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,485
I don't want a man
with wandering eyes.

35
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,488
Or one that cares
more about his work than me.

36
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,762
I don't want a guy with
too much attitude.

37
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,596
Or too little ambition.

38
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,828
But I also don't want
to end up alone...

39
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,505
living in a house
full of cats...

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,673
smelling like soup.

41
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,570
And I don't want to spend
my entire life...

42
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,512
listening to my mother tell me

43
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,545
how she can find five husbands...

44
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,846
and I can't even find one.

45
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,186
But she won't be able
to say that for long.

46
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,517
A few months ago, I met this
amazing guy on a flight to Miami.

47
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,022
His name is Graham.

48
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,689
And I think he's the one.

49
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,959
"I've had a change
of business plans...

50
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,799
"...and it looks like I'll be spending
Thanksgiving at home in Chicago."

51
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,872
"I know it's short notice, but..."

52
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,633
Give me that.

53
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,713
"... If you can make it, I would love
for you to join me for a weekend...

54
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,017
"...you'll never forget."

55
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,147
"Love, Graham."

56
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,547
Graham is...

57
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,388
Someone I've been dating
for a few months.

58
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,595
- Wow. A few months? That's a record, Mo.
- Shut up.

59
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,652
Ta-da!

60
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,154
Montana! Buongiorno!

61
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,731
Buongiorno, Taylor.

62
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,561
It's zeppole. Italian donuts.

63
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,898
Thank you, but I'm
watching my figure.

64
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,835
Okay, but if you
change your mind, there's plenty.

65
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,899
- Aw!
- Ciao bella.

66
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,909
- Ciao bella.
- I'll get you some milk.

67
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,743
Sounds great.

68
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,018
She's so sweet.
What's with the Italian?

69
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,585
She planned a trip to Rome
for our one-year anniversary.

70
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,645
William!

71
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,088
How do you turn your oven off?

72
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,761
Oh! Okay, babe, I'll be right there.
I just put in a new oven.

73
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,192
Of course you did.
Are you ever going to finish that place?

74
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,196
- William?
- Hey?

75
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,257
Got it.

76
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,462
Aw, I'm coming.

77
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,027
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

78
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,364
I got to go.

79
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,599
Yes, you do.

80
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,864
Good luck in Rome.

81
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,877
If it were me,
I would have chosen Paris.

82
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,968
Hmm.

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,446
So romantic.

84
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
Good luck in Chicago.

85
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,211
You think just because someone...

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,946
sends me a rose, I'm just going
to fly off to whatever town he's in?

87
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,621
Absolutely.

88
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,291
According to my mother, you're not
a lady unless you're married...

89
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,455
on or before your 30th birthday,

90
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,558
and you're not a woman
until you've had at least two kids.

91
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,463
If you Te not a lady
and you Te not a woman...

92
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,960
you're like my best friend, Gail.

93
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,466
Warm nuts?

94
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,981
Oh, I'm so sorry.

95
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,143
I got your nuts all messy.

96
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,487
Sorry about that.

97
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,325
That all better?

98
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,592
Good.

99
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,935
Happy Thanksgiving. Welcome.

100
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,833
I could have been late, too.

101
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,009
Remember 9F?
Boston to Cleveland?

102
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,438
He invited me to his cabin in Vermont.
But I couldn't go.

103
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,673
Why? Because I had to
be at work on time.

104
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,507
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

105
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,618
Why are you working?
I thought you were off.

106
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,017
I was. And now I'm not.

107
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,347
Hello.

108
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,516
Sam.

109
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,720
I misplaced my badge.
Gail, could you check your cleavage?

110
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,865
Trolling for men again, I see.

111
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,294
Hi. Welcome aboard.

112
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,634
So check this out.
A friend of my cousin's...

113
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,343
bought a penthouse
on top of the Water Tower

114
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,708
and he's having a party tonight.

115
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,108
Lots of celebrities.
Oprah's supposed to be there.

116
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,732
And Stedman.
How often does that happen?

117
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,946
I have a plus one...
it has your name on it.

118
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,488
Don't thank me, it's no problem.

119
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,046
Wow, Sam.

120
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,658
That sounds amazing.
I'd love to... but I can't.

121
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,657
A person would need a hell of a
reason not to party with Oprah.

122
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,996
Like dying or giving birth
or getting married.

123
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,569
Cranberry juice.

124
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,076
You're getting married?

125
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,177
Montana is not getting married.

126
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,577
If she was, being her best
friend, I'd know first.

127
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,751
- I'm not getting married.
- See?

128
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,010
Not yet.

129
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,357
See? Does Mr. Not Yet have a name?

130
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,186
Graham.

131
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,925
Graham Jackson.

132
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,357
5C, Philadelphia
to Chicago Graham Jackson?

133
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,261
Blue Label on the rocks,
seven figures a year Graham Jackson?

134
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,936
He could have invited
me for any holiday.

135
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,763
Christmas, New Year's Eve.

136
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,373
But Thanksgiving?

137
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,436
Thanksgiving feels like... forever.

138
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,704
- Yes, it does.
- You think so?

139
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,142
There'll be more than
turkey getting stuffed.

140
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,551
Such a hooker.

141
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,619
Shut up. Does your mother know?

142
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,983
No, and she won't
until I have a ring on this finger,

143
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,993
which may be this weekend.

144
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,123
I just have a feeling.

145
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,791
I'm sorry.
Be right there with your vodka.

146
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,261
Montana...

147
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,501
when my grandmother
was very sick, she gave me this.

148
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,074
I couldn't understand
what she was saying...

149
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,342
she was in and out of
consciousness, but...

150
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,649
I want you to have it.
It'll help you find true love.

151
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,187
Aw! Thank you, Sam.
That's so sweet.

152
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,083
I'm about to go.

153
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,520
But before I do,
I want you to have these.

154
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,088
Cranberry flavored
for the holidays.

155
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,232
Go get 'em, girl.

156
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,700
Thanks, Gail.

157
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,565
These waters

158
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,277
Can get a little busy

159
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,307
But I've got experience

160
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,278
Don't mind trekking
through the storm

161
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,549
Wow.

162
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,556
Graham, you've talked
about this for so long.

163
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,887
I can't believe I finally got to see it.
It's absolutely beautiful.

164
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,330
This is the first
time we're together

165
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,231
in the city where I actually live.

166
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,405
I wanted this to be special.

167
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,635
It is.

168
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,406
I wanted you to see a part of
me that most people don't.

169
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,747
Look at that water.

170
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,423
It just seems like it could go
on and on, forever and ever.

171
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,760
That's what I felt
the day you walked into my life.

172
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,159
And I was hoping...

173
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:54,602
that we could go on and
on and on and on. Forever.

174
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,604
Really?

175
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,275
And ever since we first met

176
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:08,848
I knew that I,
I knew I was ready baby

177
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,353
To take that dive

178
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,016
I'll be inside when
the tides are rolling baby

179
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,598
You'll be at my place tonight,
all night

180
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,766
All night, baby

181
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,465
I'm not afraid to try

182
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:33,073
And knew I, don't mind
playing in the rain

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,379
And I was hoping that I'd get to

184
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,549
Take that dive

185
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:47,284
It's raining and I don't mind
if I get wet, baby

186
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:54,321
Lovin' made you so wet,
your legs, your thighs

187
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,433
And ever since we first met

188
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,767
I knew that I

189
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,328
I knew I was

190
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
ready, baby

191
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,009
To take that dive

192
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,174
Sweetie?

193
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,347
We're here.

194
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,584
I thought we were
going to your house.

195
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,848
We were. But I got an
emergency phone call.

196
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,024
I have to fly to New York.

197
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,696
There's tons of paperwork
I have to look over.

198
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,526
I have to prepare for a meeting.
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,202
I booked you in the
best suite in town.

200
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,600
I'll make it up to
you when I come back, I promise.

201
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,008
I could help you.
I could come with you.

202
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,476
That's sweet.

203
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,215
Let me just take care
of this business.

204
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,011
I'll be back in a couple days.

205
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,875
Then it's just me and you.

206
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,382
- All right?
- Okay.

207
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,555
Yes?

208
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,066
Are you guys doing it?

209
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,635
No. If we were doing it,
I would not be answering my phone.

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,304
I would. So, how was it?

211
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
None of your business.

212
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,309
That bad, huh?

213
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,569
I didn't say it was bad.

214
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,908
You didn't say it was good.

215
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,108
It was good.

216
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,411
- Damn good.
- Then why are you on the phone?

217
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,087
If you must know,
Graham had an emergency...

218
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,655
business call and had to
fly out for an early meeting.

219
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,989
Being a gentleman...

220
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,253
he put me up at this amazing
hotel in one of the best suites.

221
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,658
Girl, please.

222
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,531
Montana, that man did not ask
you to fly all the way...

223
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,731
to Chicago on
Thanksgiving to insist...

224
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,001
that you stay in a hotel.
I smell a rat.

225
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
I don't want to hear it.

226
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,942
Hear what?

227
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,943
That he dropped you off

228
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,505
so he can dip his turkey neck
in another woman's gravy?

229
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,445
Graham is not seeing another woman.

230
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,117
- Prove it.
- How?

231
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,016
Go to his house and
see for yourself.

232
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,487
Gail, I am not
going over to that man's house.

233
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,349
Do you know how crazy
that would make me look?

234
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,193
Gail, I'm here.

235
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,125
- Where?
- Graham's house.

236
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,728
He came back and picked you up.

237
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,129
Sort of.

238
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,136
You went to his house uninvited?

239
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,534
You told me to.

240
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,367
I didn't think you'd do it.

241
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,035
Are you kidding me?

242
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,507
- What are you doing now?
- Going to his front door.

243
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,046
Umm-umm. Do not knock
on that man's door.

244
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,141
You'll look like a stalker.

245
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,735
Right now you just look desperate.

246
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,318
What am I supposed to do?

247
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,648
Go to the back.

248
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,991
Oh!

249
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,664
Okay.

250
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,506
What the hell was that?

251
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,737
Hello?

252
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
He's at the back door.
What do I do?

253
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,846
Do you see a trash can?

254
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,848
- Yeah. Why?
- Get in it.

255
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,350
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting in a trash can.

256
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,025
If I'm wrong about Graham...

257
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,591
- ...and he catches you...
- Hello?

258
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,194
At his house,
forget any future together.

259
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,020
Get in the can!

260
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,767
What are you doing?

261
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,101
I'm in the trash can.

262
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,036
Are you nuts?

263
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,205
You told me to.

264
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,610
Hello?

265
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Montana?

266
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,449
I have to go.

267
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,854
Yes?

268
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,264
What are you doing now?

269
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,262
Looking thru his window.

270
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,762
Gail... it's beautiful.

271
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,337
Any panties on the floor?

272
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,903
No.

273
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,680
He's preparing for his meeting,
just like he said he was.

274
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,948
Gail was wrong.

275
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,120
Graham was alone.

276
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,289
And I was...

277
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,455
right where I wanted to be.

278
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,298
Sipping from the same mug.
Resting on the same rug.

279
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,296
Just the two of us.

280
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,298
And the kids.

281
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,129
And friends.

282
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,312
Toasting to our wonderful life.

283
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,544
What was that noise?

284
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,813
The sound of us toasting.

285
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,556
No, that is the sound of
somebody coming in the house!

286
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,987
Duck!

287
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,016
Un-break my heart

288
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,925
Say you'll love me again

289
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,921
Undo this hurt you caused

290
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,934
Oh my God.

291
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,967
When you walked out the door

292
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,733
And walked out of my life

293
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,537
Un-cry these tears

294
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,441
Montana? You want to talk about it?

295
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,376
Go away.

296
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,883
Hey.

297
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,218
You've been playing
that song all day.

298
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,889
Let's get something to eat.

299
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,457
I don't want to get dressed.

300
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,057
Okay, you don't have
to get dressed.

301
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,561
But you got to get out
of this apartment.

302
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay?

303
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,457
I don't have to get dressed?

304
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,234
My cooking always cheers you up.

305
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,105
A little wine.

306
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,241
- Mo, you love avocado.
- All right.

307
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,620
Look at that.

308
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,154
Hey, vegan!

309
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,995
We are so excited. We wanted
you to be the first to know.

310
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,258
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

311
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,493
After me.

312
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,629
I'm engaged!

313
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,831
Derrick proposed
with a two-carat diamond ring!

314
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,838
I didn't get my first carat
until my third marriage.

315
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,445
Montana, does this single rose mean
you're not single anymore?

316
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,681
It's nothing.

317
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,113
Sheree's fiance is taking us
all out to dinner tonight.

318
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,288
I'm borrowing those earrings
I bought you for Christmas.

319
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,859
Oh, yes, honey. I should
have bought them for myself!

320
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,993
He's on track to break
the college record

321
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,928
for most receptions in a season,

322
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,194
maybe win a Heisman.

323
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,200
You know I'm happy for
you, right, Sheree?

324
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,536
But...

325
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,702
you're just a
sophomore in college.

326
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,308
You barely
know what you want to major in...

327
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,310
much less, who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

328
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,807
Why now?

329
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,317
Why not now? He's a great guy.

330
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,886
And I don't want
to wait until I'm all old, like...

331
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,045
Like me.

332
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,155
I didn't mean it like that.

333
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,883
What do you think?

334
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,727
Yes? Fabulous? I hate them.

335
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,992
Mom's letting me wear
her wedding dress.

336
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,067
You can pick
whichever one you want.

337
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,739
Only one thing that would make
this the best wedding ever.

338
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,910
A bridesmaid again?

339
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,911
I can't go to
my little sister's wedding single.

340
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,413
I'll be the laughingstock
of my entire family.

341
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,246
If you need a man,
I can get you one.

342
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,625
Hey!

343
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,849
Don't embarrass me.
It's not a man I need...

344
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,759
it's a husband,
or a potential husband, in a month.

345
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,520
Marry Gail.

346
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,467
If she goes a week
without waxing her moustache,

347
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,768
they'll think it's Steve Harvey.

348
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,931
I'm serious.

349
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,536
Why is it so hard to
find the right guy?

350
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,729
Tell me about it.

351
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,272
Tell me about it.

352
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,942
A girl could have everything...

353
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,976
an MBA, a J-O-B, but no M-A-N.

354
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,608
That's because
men are intimidated by strong women.

355
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,285
I never tell guys
that I have a degree.

356
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,384
That's because you
don't have a degree.

357
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,059
Sam, you keep missing
the damn point.

358
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,793
I should give this back to you.

359
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,395
It's hopeless with me.

360
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,464
You won't show up single.
Give me your phone.

361
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,732
Uh, uh, uh!

362
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,967
Hang on. Now, look.

363
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,232
She hasn't got time
to meet someone new.

364
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,403
So why not revisit somebody old?

365
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,478
But I don't even know...

366
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,214
Picky is single.

367
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,048
If we're lucky, one of these guys
has blossomed into Mr. Right.

368
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,251
Let me see.

369
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,321
She hasn't talked
to any of these guys in years.

370
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,584
If she bumped into
one of them on a plane, she might.

371
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,989
How would I know if
they were traveling?

372
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,425
It's the holiday season...
everyone's traveling.

373
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,866
And when someone
wants to fly, what do they do?

374
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,991
Book a flight.

375
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,660
There's Tanya in ticketing.

376
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,338
I'm Tanya. Welcome to
TransAlliance. May I see your I.D.?

377
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,508
Frankie in the Frequent
Flyer program.

378
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,110
Thank you for choosing
TransAlliance.

379
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,535
I turned them on to my hook-up

380
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,776
at Louis Vuitton so
they owe me biggies.

381
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,613
There's Calvin at
curbside check-in.

382
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,348
Hi, I'm Calvin at curbside.

383
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,351
Welcome to TransAlliance,
a flight you can afford...

384
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,287
where your soul and bag
can be on one accord.

385
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,019
And there's Cedric in security.

386
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,529
First name, Cedric. Last name, take
everything out of your pockets!

387
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,531
I need your pockets
out of your pockets!

388
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,635
For the next few weeks,
any ex of yours

389
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,637
who flies anywhere, we'll know.

390
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,706
We just arrange your schedule
so you're on that flight.

391
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:19,278
First of all, this is the stupidest
idea ever. Secondly of all...

392
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,339
There's the degree.

393
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,381
Assuming you could find out
when these guys are flying...

394
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,317
which I doubt,
because it's your dumb-ass idea...

395
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,414
Gail!

396
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,553
These are all men you've dated
before, and it didn't work out.

397
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,492
So what is going to
make this any different?

398
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,496
Because this time, she's different.

399
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,227
Same action, same outcome.
New actions, new outcome.

400
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,167
Clearly, we have all
had too much to drink.

401
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:49,846
This is illegal. We can all get
fired, and we can go to jail.

402
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,246
Or we could come to the aid of
the sweetest...

403
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,349
and most romantically
deserving human being alive...

404
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,580
and help her find the truest
and fastest love of her life.

405
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,092
We have thirty days
and 30,000 miles.

406
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,261
To be brought up on federal charges.

407
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,521
To find me a husband.

408
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,602
I don't understand why you guys
think this is a good idea.

409
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,777
It's the 21st century.
You don't need a man to define you.

410
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,113
Everyone I know
is getting married and having kids.

411
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,548
So what?

412
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,122
I want someone to love me, too.

413
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,928
Someone who thinks I'm the best.

414
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,860
Who only sees me in the room.

415
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,957
I know it might sound corny
or unrealistic, but...

416
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,631
I know he's out there.

417
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,300
And I don't want to
wait any longer.

418
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,743
And you think you can
find him in 30 days?

419
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,805
Of course not!

420
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,644
Maybe?

421
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,246
Hey Sam.

422
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,314
- It actually worked.
- What worked?

423
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,390
Our plan.
He's flying from Los Angeles

424
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,325
to New York, connecting in Houston.

425
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,928
- Who?
- One of your exes.

426
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,757
Damon Diesel.

427
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,823
One second!

428
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,329
You've got to be kidding me.

429
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,734
Damon Diesel
could barely take care of himself,

430
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,101
much less a family.

431
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,368
Google him. He's produced three

432
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,670
number-one singles
in the last year.

433
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,173
And he's Essence?
"Bachelor of the Month".

434
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,907
He is looking for Mrs. Diesel.

435
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,140
Hey! I'm on the toilet!

436
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,513
Sam? I love you,

437
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,182
- but I'm not getting on that flight. Okay?
- Montana!

438
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,357
Oh, God, my mother
came over uninvited again.

439
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,027
I will jack you up!
I will jack you up hard!

440
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,355
I got to go.

441
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,364
Montana.

442
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,360
Honey, Mama's having a rough day.

443
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,472
All this planning for
your sister's wedding...

444
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,042
it's making me feel
like such a failure.

445
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,812
Mom, five marriages
doesn't make you a failure.

446
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,639
I wasn't talking about me.

447
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,978
I started thinking...

448
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,583
my youngest
daughter is marrying a wonderful...

449
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,715
handsome, athletic young man.

450
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,389
Yes, she is.

451
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,720
And I might not even be alive to
see my oldest do the same.

452
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:26,062
Anyway, we have to discuss your
sister's rehearsal dinner...

453
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,395
seeing you are a
maid of honor again.

454
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,666
I would love to talk about this,
but I have a flight to catch.

455
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,743
Why didn't you tell me
you had a flight to catch?

456
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,346
If you had called, I
would have told you.

457
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,074
Make sure you call me when you land.

458
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,083
I will call you whenever
I get to wherever I'm going.

459
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,085
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you.

460
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,765
Sam? What's the flight number?

461
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:04,203
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

462
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:10,176
My eyes shot out like a fish out
of water and I'm jumpin' in it

463
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,309
Oh, don't get scared for me

464
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,744
Just be prepared for me

465
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:22,814
'Cause I'm in love with love in love

466
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,620
Taxi!

467
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,452
Taxi! Taxi!

468
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,288
William! William!

469
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,636
Sorry!

470
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,137
I have to get to the airport
fast... it's an emergency.

471
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,810
- Somebody's looking good.
- Yeah?

472
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,579
I almost didn't recognize you.

473
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,649
Some of us like to update our
image every decade or so.

474
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,218
This was the truck my father bought

475
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,654
before he started his business.
It's vintage.

476
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,088
I wasn't talking about the truck.

477
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,420
You want to get to the airport?

478
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,659
So what's the occasion?

479
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,761
Oh,

480
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,671
I'm meeting a friend in Houston,
then we're flying to New York.

481
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,342
Why fly all the way to Houston

482
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,844
to meet a friend
when New York is just an hour away?

483
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:22,542
He doesn't exactly know I'm meeting him.
It's a surprise.

484
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,115
Would this have anything to
do with Sheree's wedding?

485
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,881
It has nothing to do with it.

486
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,552
Okay, maybe it does. A little.

487
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,389
My parents were together
almost 40 years...

488
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,891
before my dad passed away.

489
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,062
He kept the same job.
Drove the same truck.

490
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,740
And stayed in love
with the same woman.

491
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,409
Every night at six, there was an
oven-cooked meal waiting for him.

492
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,838
The same one?

493
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,816
Poor woman.

494
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,911
You know, Mo...

495
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,816
the magic isn't
in getting married.

496
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,817
It's in the staying married.

497
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,419
Yeah.

498
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,760
William, I can't thank you enough.
Bye.

499
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,262
Wish me luck, okay?

500
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,938
I got my bag.

501
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,838
I know, I know.

502
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,949
- Your phone.
- I'm sorry. Bye.

503
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,649
Hey! Hey!

504
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,286
- Your earpiece.
- I'm sorry. You know me.

505
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,123
Okay, see you later!

506
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,452
- Thank you!
- Mo!

507
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,455
Mo! Your lipstick!

508
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,295
She's always forgetting something.

509
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:52,964
Cedric!

510
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,809
Nobody move! Back up! Nobody move!

511
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,478
Sorry. Excuse me, it's an emergency.

512
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,550
I have no life! Which gives
me all day to ruin yours!

513
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,917
Welcome aboard
TransAlliance flight 143.

514
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,099
Sam, I'm on the plane in a dress

515
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,335
I can barely breathe in.
But he's not here.

516
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,806
- Who?
- Damon Diesel. He's not on the flight.

517
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,002
He is.

518
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,579
No, he's not.

519
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,407
This is ridiculous.

520
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,883
I don't know how
you convinced me to do this,

521
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,283
but I'm leaving. I love you, bye.

522
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,584
I'd love to be the
stitches in that skirt.

523
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,849
Montana Moore.

524
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,425
Damon Diesel.

525
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,857
- Wassup?
- Wow. Not much.

526
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,865
You look great.

527
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,102
You're in first class?

528
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,363
That's the only way to ride.

529
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,210
Okay, I'll be sitting down.

530
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,281
Usually, I don't really
write about jewelry

531
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,182
It's foolery, But something
about the way you look on my arm

532
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,448
An arm on my neck
like you're my charm

533
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,490
So, so fresh when we
step out at midnight

534
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,583
Up to the spat we
chill and sit tight

535
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,594
How long are you in town?

536
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,061
Two or three days.

537
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,600
I have meetings and family to see.

538
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,896
How long are you in town?

539
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,300
Long enough.

540
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,565
Long enough for what?

541
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:34,237
Long enough for us to spend some
quality time, if I'm allowed.

542
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,976
You're allowed.

543
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,579
Great. Let's go.

544
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,981
Let's go.

545
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,241
After you.

546
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,785
I can't believe we
ran into each other. It's crazy.

547
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,758
I'm busy.

548
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,487
Damon Diesel.

549
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,653
What's up, baby?

550
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:55,954
Can I get you something to drink?

551
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,088
The usual.

552
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,097
A bottle of Chateau Margaux
'66, coming right up.

553
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,171
You should think way
larger than that.

554
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,931
- London, Dubai.
- Your check.

555
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,607
Thank you.

556
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,277
See you next time.

557
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,446
Damon, I should
probably get back to my hotel.

558
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,673
I have an early morning, and...

559
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,610
a girl does need
her beauty rest.

560
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,120
Real talk?

561
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:25,789
You could stay awake the rest of
your life and still be beautiful.

562
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,457
Thank you, Damon.

563
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,688
Being with you tonight...

564
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:34,368
you got a brother on
some till-death-do-we-part shit.

565
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,300
Don't laugh. Why are you laughing?

566
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,805
Damon. I've been
trying to reach you.

567
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,670
Janine, Montana. Montana, Janine.

568
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:44,970
Hi.

569
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,380
Janine and her
husband work with me at the label.

570
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,448
Can you call me when
you get a moment?

571
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,383
I want to wrap up a few things.

572
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,889
Have a good evening.

573
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,420
It was really nice
to meet you, Janine.

574
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,821
You, too.

575
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,986
Where were we?

576
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,187
To us.

577
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,837
So this is it.

578
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,164
Work hard, play hard, baby.

579
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,000
Clearly.

580
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,510
I want to show you something.

581
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,508
Check this out.

582
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,610
A little different
than the last time you saw me.

583
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,086
You think?

584
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,017
Hope you like it. Come on.

585
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,850
Okay, coming.

586
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,190
It's sexy, right?

587
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,530
Yeah. Wow.

588
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,358
Damon, you're doing big things.

589
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,194
I'm impressed.

590
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,535
I'm not getting in the hot tub.

591
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,206
You know you want to.

592
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,537
Maybe, but I'm not getting in.

593
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,113
Okay.

594
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,183
Will you stop acting silly?

595
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,016
Is that meant to be inviting?

596
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,582
Damon?

597
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,290
Damon! Damon, I know you hear me!

598
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,896
Who is that?

599
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,894
You said you weren't
seeing anybody.

600
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,124
That's Janine.

601
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,734
From the restaurant?

602
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,960
Damon!

603
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,229
Damon, you better open up!

604
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,410
It's your house.
Tell her you're busy.

605
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,407
- I can't.
- Why not?

606
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:28,413
This ain't my house.
It's hers. I can't afford this shit.

607
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,812
Damon, open this damn door!

608
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,748
- You can afford a Range Rover.
- Uh-uh.

609
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,480
You have a titanium
American Express card.

610
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,090
That's hers, too.

611
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,487
You said she's married.

612
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,593
She is. Sometimes she not.

613
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,094
I know you got that ho
from the restaurant there!

614
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,925
Who's she calling a ho?

615
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,093
Shh!

616
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,159
- I'm not shushing!
- You better shush.

617
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,427
She crazy.

618
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,436
I'll shoot you and that bitch,
'cause you know I'm crazy!

619
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,269
I told you. She crazy.
Crazy! She crazy.

620
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,443
Why are
you doing this to me?

621
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,618
Open, open, open, open, open.
Open, open, open!

622
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,051
When she come through the door...

623
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:09,455
when she break the door
down, you don't want to be here.

624
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,460
Well, where should I be?

625
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,625
I am not getting on
that fire escape.

626
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,459
Damon, open this damn door!

627
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,565
Damon, I got something for you!

628
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,995
- Where is this bitch?
- Nobody's here.

629
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,870
Is Sam's
dumb-ass idea working?

630
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,804
Did he pop the question?

631
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,477
I'm on a fire escape!

632
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,214
I'll assume that's a no.

633
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,644
Anyway, bachelor number two...

634
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:40,219
is on the flight
in the morning from Atlanta to D.C.

635
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,321
You need to be at JFK in an hour

636
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,324
to catch the last
commuter flight out...

637
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,551
to make his morning
connecting flight.

638
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,320
You've now got...

639
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:54,167
sixty-nine...
I mean, fifty-nine minutes, honey.

640
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,335
You got fifty-nine minutes.

641
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,669
I'm looking
for the bitch, too!

642
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,398
Bitch, where are you!

643
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,838
Could this get any worse?

644
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,517
Hey, Montana, it's your mother.
Listen.

645
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,848
Sheree decided to have a
bridesmaid slumber party.

646
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,926
We're all here in our pajamas
and we want you to come over.

647
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,857
All right, sweetie, I love you.

648
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,920
Uh-uh!

649
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,866
You know you don't
need that cookie. Sit down.

650
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,944
This is your pilot speaking.

651
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,877
The flight time today
to Reagan International Airport

652
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,714
is 1 hour, 40 minutes.

653
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,385
Sit back and enjoy the short flight.

654
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,588
Sir, may I offer you a blanket?

655
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,148
No, thank you.

656
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,887
Montana.

657
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,557
Langston.

658
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:55,855
Montana.

659
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,394
Curtis. Hi.

660
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,066
- Would you like a blanket?
- I'm okay.

661
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,334
Hey!

662
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,402
Two of m y exes are on the plane.

663
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,412
I know about Langston.
Who's the other guy?

664
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,641
Curtis.
He and Langston are both here.

665
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,080
I'll get Sam.

666
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:20,946
Curtis is here, too.

667
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,079
You said he got married.

668
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,758
I thought he did, but I don't think
he is now. No wedding ring.

669
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,122
None of the married guys I
date wear wedding rings.

670
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,529
It's tacky.

671
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,159
Go with Langston. He's running for
Congress, so he needs a running mate.

672
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,796
Curtis.

673
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,932
Langston.

674
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,268
You know Montana?

675
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,271
Yeah, we're old friends.

676
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,104
Flight attendants,
prepare the cabin for takeoff

677
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,778
You know, I'm running
for Congress now.

678
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,785
And I'm having dinner tonight
with some potentially major...

679
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,849
campaign contributors.

680
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,290
Would you know a young lady
- -Gorgeous, intelligent...

681
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,364
that would be so
gracious as to join me?

682
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,897
If asked, I might.

683
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,298
Consider yourself asked.

684
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,028
Consider yourself answered.

685
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,809
Right over here, this is me.

686
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,947
Wow. Langston,
you've done very well for yourself.

687
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,011
Thank you. This is probably my
favorite room in the house.

688
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,820
I can see why.

689
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,053
Oh, you have a dog!

690
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,320
Montana, this is Juicy.
Juicy, this is Montana.

691
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,564
She's so cute. Can I pet her?

692
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,994
Juicy. Stop that, shame on you.

693
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:47,776
I'm sorry. She's jealous.
She likes to mark her territory.

694
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,108
- Sorry about that.
- I understand.

695
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,671
If you were around more,
Juicy wouldn't have these problems.

696
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:57,511
So my being around
more often would be just for Juicy?

697
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,844
Yes, strictly for Juicy.

698
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,183
I hope it's okay... I had my assistant
pick you out something to wear.

699
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,192
I'm assuming your
size is the same as I remember.

700
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,762
I hope so.

701
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,200
It's hanging in the bathroom
- -Two doors down to the left.

702
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,198
Great. Okay.

703
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,866
Bye, Juicy. We're going to be friends.

704
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,039
I certainly hope so.

705
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,211
See you shortly.

706
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,539
Juicy, pee.

707
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,784
God, I love that Juicy.

708
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:51,129
Montana, allow me to introduce
you to Howard Donaldson...

709
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,965
and his beautiful wife, Estelle.

710
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,404
Mr. Donaldson is the owner and
founder of Donaldson Steel...

711
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:00,912
the largest contractor
in the Washington metropolitan area.

712
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,915
And who might this
stunning young lady be?

713
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,089
She is too pretty to be your date.

714
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,588
You got that right.

715
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:14,263
This is Montana Moore,
my very significant other...

716
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:18,160
who was gracious enough to
fly here to join us for dinner.

717
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:23,269
Well, young lady, I hope you're
prepared to withstand the heat...

718
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,598
which this coming
election will surely bring.

719
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,107
Montana comes from a long line of

720
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,509
flame-retardant women.
She'll be just fine.

721
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,444
All right. I got a
great table, let's go.

722
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,280
Flame retardant.

723
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,619
He surprised me.

724
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,288
How you doing, sir?

725
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,321
May I take your drink order?

726
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,190
I'll have a scotch,
single-malt, on the rocks...

727
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,126
and a Shirley Temple
with extra cherries for my wife.

728
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,700
That sounds good. I'll have
what the gentleman's having.

729
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,633
The lady will also have a
Shirley Temple, extra cherries.

730
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,864
Oh, no, actually, I'd like a...

731
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,371
it's okay, I got it.

732
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,701
A Shirley Temple, please.

733
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:14,051
Actually, would you excuse us?
Lam dying to show Montana...

734
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,924
the breathtaking
view of the atrium.

735
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,982
Excuse us.

736
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,996
Sweetheart, listen.

737
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,682
These are the kind of contributors

738
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,795
who want to know the candidate
they're investing in is a leader.

739
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,204
A take-charge type of man.

740
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,903
Now, if I sit there
and let you order your own drink,

741
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,276
then that would be
like you're leading.

742
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,837
Please, just bear with me.

743
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,277
I promise, when this
thing is over...

744
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,953
I'll take you anywhere and you can
order for the entire restaurant.

745
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,352
But can you just do me this solid?
For me?

746
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,684
Of course.

747
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,520
- I'll do it for you.
- Thank you.

748
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,857
You look great tonight.

749
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,967
Langston?

750
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,870
Your record in
the city council is impeccable.

751
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,204
Well, thank you.

752
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,474
If you're not elected to
Congress, it won't be because of...

753
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,381
insufficient financial support.

754
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,585
I like that sound.

755
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,726
Mr. Donaldson.

756
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,599
I can't tell you how
much this means to me. Us.

757
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,667
There is no reason you can't
do something for your people.

758
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,576
You could do something really great.
Historic, maybe.

759
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,074
I mean, we're talking the Obamas.

760
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,680
The Williams sisters.

761
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,909
And like Tiger Woods.

762
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,245
Well, if, uh...

763
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,419
you're referring to
the American people...

764
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,853
then, yes, I have
every intention of

765
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,089
making the American
people very proud.

766
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,699
Well, I was thinking specifically
of your people, the black people.

767
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,530
Well, I live in
Georgetown, so I guess

768
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,766
these... these would be my people.

769
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,943
And Tiger Woods lives in Florida,
so those would be his people.

770
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,114
Are you saying that where
Tiger Woods lives...

771
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:25,443
makes him irrelevant to
people of the same skin color?

772
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,950
You'd first have to
determine Tiger Woods' skin color.

773
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,791
He's black.

774
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,458
Well, I think...

775
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,563
what would make
Tiger Woods black...

776
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,133
would be his
passion for things, uh, that...

777
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,631
are related to the
African-American race as a whole.

778
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,310
Which he has not yet proven to have.

779
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,648
What I think would make
Tiger Woods black...

780
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,254
is the fact he drives an Escalade
and his daddy's name is Earl.

781
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,509
An Escalade? Why...

782
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,508
A daddy named Earl?

783
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,244
It was a joke.

784
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,837
Things were getting heavy

785
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,644
and I was just trying to lighten them up.

786
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,909
Juicy, no!

787
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,446
This is Langston.

788
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,450
Good evening, sir.

789
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,693
Yes, she is quite the funny lady.

790
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,892
I'm sorry?

791
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,391
Of course, I accept.

792
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,727
Thank you again, sir.

793
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,231
Good night.

794
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,476
That was Mr. Donaldson.
He just doubled his contribution.

795
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,978
Apparently your little
Tiger Woods joke...

796
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,080
was the highlight
of his evening.

797
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,647
Juicy! Go pee.

798
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:16,258
Then the dinner was a success.
Langston, we should celebrate.

799
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:19,761
Okay.

800
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,437
Sweetheart.

801
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,607
You're so pretty.

802
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,944
There's a saying.

803
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,948
Behind every great man...

804
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,015
there is an even greater woman.

805
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,954
I want that for you.
I want you to be greater.

806
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,954
But sometimes being greater...

807
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,120
means being quiet.

808
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:51,922
Hmm.

809
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,863
I always thought the saying
was, Beside every great man...

810
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,898
Beside, behind, between...
it's all semantics. The point is...

811
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,468
that if she is
to be great, wherever she is...

812
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:09,148
she must follow.
And he must lead.

813
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,314
Well, when I led...

814
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,483
I got you twice as much money.

815
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,988
- It's not just about money.
- What is it about?

816
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,660
I'll tell you, Juicy.
I'm running for office.

817
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,988
Did you just call me "Juicy"?

818
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,164
- Did I?
- Yeah, you did.

819
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,658
Well, I apologize.

820
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,167
I don't know how I
could confuse you two,

821
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,570
because Juicy knows how to obey.

822
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,070
Juicy, come!

823
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,010
See that?

824
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,903
You know what?

825
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,011
"New actions, new outcome."

826
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,344
Same asshole, same outcome.

827
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,746
You haven't changed a bit.

828
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,684
And I'm keeping the outfit and
the shoes. I earned them.

829
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,361
Get off, you little rat.

830
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,033
Juicy.

831
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,203
Juicy!

832
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,637
Hello?

833
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,206
Hey, it's me.
I didn't wake Taylor, did I?

834
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,546
No. Her grandma got sick,
so she went out of town to see her.

835
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,951
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope she feels better.

836
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,390
- You doing anything?
- Not anymore.

837
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,720
Want to watch a movie?

838
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,229
Sure.

839
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,291
Great. Can you pick me up?

840
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,967
You live across the hall.

841
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,898
I'm not at home, silly.
I'm in Georgetown.

842
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,396
Hello?

843
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,135
William?

844
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,737
Hello?

845
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,408
Hello?

846
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,644
Sorry. I guess we got cut off.

847
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,081
No, I hung up.

848
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,087
Yeah, sure, of course.

849
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,762
I guess a 25-year
friendship doesn't give

850
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,331
me the right to call
you or expect you...

851
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,159
to drive less than an
hour when I'm stranded

852
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,328
at midnight in the crime
capital of the world.

853
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,004
Wait, stop, don't! I don't have any
money, or any real friends, either!

854
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,609
Stop!

855
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,114
So cold out there.

856
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,282
Yeah? Comfortable?

857
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,881
Why didn't you get one of your
friends to pick you up?

858
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:34,960
Oh, that's right. He
lives in Chicago.

859
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,062
Or was it Houston?

860
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,631
No, no, no. New York City, right?

861
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,804
I know this all seems
very silly to you.

862
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,633
I'm sorry you had a rough night.

863
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,138
It has been a very rough night.

864
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,303
God, it's cold in here.

865
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,649
Does "vintage" mean you don't
have any heat in this car?

866
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,481
I'm so cold.

867
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,314
Come sit next to me.
I'll keep you warm.

868
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,925
Thank you for coming.

869
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,326
You're welcome.

870
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,825
You give me hope that there's
still some good men out there.

871
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,341
Are you ever going to
finish this place?

872
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,951
- It'll be finished...
- When it's finished, I know.

873
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,190
I can't believe you're making me
watch a movie at two A.M.

874
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,684
On VHS.

875
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,529
All righty.

876
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,693
Our choices.

877
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,028
- Enter the Dragon.
- Uh-huh.

878
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,200
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

879
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,969
Or The Last Dragon. Whoo!

880
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,030
You have Misery?

881
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,873
The Last Dragon?

882
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,541
There you go.
Get it started. I'll make us some drinks.

883
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,150
Mo?

884
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,710
What color in
the dining room? Cherry or Espresso?

885
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,387
Espresso.

886
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,889
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

887
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,559
Wait. Is this our
high school yearbook?

888
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,257
Yeah. My mom was cleaning
the garage and found it.

889
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,892
I'm surprised your photo
didn't slide off the page.

890
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,737
You'd be walking around
with that activator...

891
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,840
Funny.
You must have forgot how you looked.

892
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,570
There wasn't a tube of gel in a
thousand miles that was safe.

893
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,083
Oh, my gosh. Look at our prom.

894
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,852
We were gettin' down.

895
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,753
No, I was getting dumped.
My date got jealous and left.

896
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,427
It's not my fault
she couldn't dance.

897
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,929
What was that song
we were dancing to?

898
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,838
I don't love her

899
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,310
I tried to tell myself

900
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,839
But you can see it in my eyes

901
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,479
So don't deny

902
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,119
I can't fool no one else

903
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,525
The truth is in the tears I cry

904
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,892
Cause if it isn't love

905
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,530
Why do I feel this way

906
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,461
Why does she stay on my mind

907
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,772
And if it isn't love

908
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:34,307
Why does it hurt so bad

909
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,403
Why does she stay on my mind

910
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,277
If it isn't love

911
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,647
Oh, my God.

912
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,321
I'll get us a drink.
This is for you.

913
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,818
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

914
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,158
Here we go.

915
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,493
This is a toast...

916
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,563
to us never dancing...

917
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,763
or dressing...

918
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,134
like that ever again.

919
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,195
Cheers.

920
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,773
Know what else my mom found?

921
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,840
Some DVD's? A couple romantic
comedies, hopefully?

922
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,175
Stop talking about a
black man's mama.

923
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,511
Remember this?

924
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,190
Please don't tell me
you still have that.

925
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,189
Paging Dr. William Wright.

926
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:31,856
If not for this, you wouldn't have
known you had a heartbeat.

927
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,999
You didn't know, either,
because you were

928
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,229
always trying to put
it on my booty.

929
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,295
You saying your booty
ain't got a heartbeat?

930
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,300
I don't think it does.

931
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,534
You don't?

932
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:42,969
Let me check.

933
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,204
Can you check it?

934
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:45,640
Oh, my God.

935
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,315
I can tell, young lady,
you're of African heritage.

936
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,048
Thank you.

937
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,653
I'm starting to hear something.

938
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,493
Be glad you know a doctor
who makes house calls.

939
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,887
Is that all you can make?

940
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,913
William...

941
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,250
Montana?

942
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,751
William?

943
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,087
Montana, we're here.

944
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,928
We sure are.

945
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,599
You still up for a movie?

946
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,452
Mo, you forgot...

947
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,291
She's always
forgetting something.

948
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,235
Ahh!

949
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,147
That was quite the dream you
were having, little girl.

950
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,385
You were sleeping so
peacefully, I decided

951
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,921
to clean that nasty
little kitchen of yours.

952
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:39,989
The way a woman keeps her kitchen
is the way she keeps her man.

953
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,423
I ought to know.

954
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,159
Mom...

955
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,166
in the interest of
me keeping my sanity...

956
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:52,735
I think we should establish
some clear-cut boundaries.

957
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,172
Boundaries.

958
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,873
After 74-and-a-half hours in labor,

959
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,447
struggling to give you life.

960
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,843
This is how you thank me?

961
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,676
Well, you're welcome.
And I am leaving.

962
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,682
Mom?

963
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,358
And do me a favor, Pig-pen.

964
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,685
That funky little attitude you got?

965
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,856
Don't bring that to
your sister's wedding.

966
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,861
We don't need it, okay?

967
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,124
Uh-huh.

968
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,969
Maybe I want to have a
funky little attitude.

969
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,876
Maybe because I'll have
someone of my own.

970
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,441
And I'm bringing
him to the rehearsal dinner.

971
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,045
What do you think about that?

972
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,208
Really, Montana?

973
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,716
You told your mother what?

974
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,721
I had to get her
off my back. You know how she is.

975
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,225
She got off your back, but a
10,000-pound gorilla jumped on.

976
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,225
You'll see.

977
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,897
- I'll see?
- You will.

978
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,328
- Montana.
- Weisha!

979
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,928
It's so good to see you.

980
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,562
Good to see you.

981
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,738
This is my good friend, William.

982
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,670
Hello.

983
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,408
For bridesmaid.

984
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,838
Again.

985
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,080
Try on.

986
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,082
Thank you, Weisha.

987
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,913
For the groom.

988
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:17,850
Try on.

989
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,891
Um, I'm not the groom.

990
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,094
But you're same size as groom.
Try on.

991
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,593
I need measurement.

992
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,262
This could have been you.

993
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,533
I proposed to you
and your answer was, "Eaugh!"

994
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,704
You proposed to me in elementary
school during recess...

995
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,712
"because you wanted my cupcake...

996
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,112
and the only way to get it...

997
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,447
was by giving me the toy ring
from your Cracker Jack box.

998
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,122
At least I offered
you a ring for it.

999
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,127
That's more than I can say for
the men you've dated since.

1000
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:59,957
Touche. If I had known the
proposals would be so infrequent...

1001
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,463
I would have accepted.

1002
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,299
And then we'd be married.

1003
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,322
Mo, you look amazing.

1004
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,826
You don't look half bad yourself.

1005
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,327
I have to get this.

1006
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,434
Taylor.

1007
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,769
How's your grandmother doing?

1008
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,274
I miss you, too.

1009
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:59,452
Got one... flight 1763 headed to
Houston, sitting in seat 3A.

1010
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,120
Houston, we got a problem!

1011
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,728
Move, move, move!

1012
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,459
Feet can't touch the ground

1013
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,296
And I can't hear a sound

1014
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,867
But you just keep on
running up your mouth, yeah

1015
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,770
Walk, walk on over there

1016
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,309
'Cause I'm too fly to care

1017
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,777
Oh, yeah

1018
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:21,538
He's on his way to D.C. Right
there with my President.

1019
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,718
This boy got some Frequent Flyer miles.
He's going to Miami.

1020
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,887
Got another one, Sam,
on his way to Detroit. Motown!

1021
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,325
Just one second.

1022
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,552
One minute, please.

1023
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:36,686
One second.

1024
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,394
Don't let what they say
keep you up at night

1025
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:47,202
And they can't detain you
'Cause wings are made to fly

1026
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:51,401
And we don't let
nobody bring us down

1027
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,911
No matter what you
say, it won't hurt me

1028
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,085
Don't matter if I fall from the sky

1029
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,552
These wings are made to fly

1030
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,917
She like light-skinned dudes?

1031
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,853
I got Leo DiCaprio up here.

1032
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,255
Do her husband have to be a man?

1033
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,027
Now is not the time to get
down on yourself, Montana.

1034
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,462
In a week, maybe.

1035
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,001
Thank you.

1036
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,937
Don't mention it.

1037
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,334
Ohh!

1038
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,275
Taylor?

1039
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,447
Montana. What a...

1040
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,673
Ho-ho-ho.

1041
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,010
Surprise?

1042
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,448
How's your grandmother?

1043
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:40,746
William is better looking.

1044
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:44,122
And he's a great guy.
And she's here being a two-timing...

1045
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,523
Whore.

1046
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:49,364
- Montana.
- Taylor.

1047
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:51,466
I know this looks really bad.

1048
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:56,037
But what you don't know is
me and William broke up.

1049
00:58:56,296 --> 00:59:00,904
It's a long story. I'd appreciate
it if you don't mention it.

1050
00:59:01,368 --> 00:59:05,043
You know how it is when you break up.
The wound's still open.

1051
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:08,209
Sure, yeah.

1052
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:10,886
Thank you.

1053
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:16,718
Could you get me a hot tea?
Two sugars, no cream.

1054
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:19,391
Ciao!

1055
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:28,235
Flight 901 is headed to New Mexico.
Feliz Navidad.

1056
00:59:30,397 --> 00:59:33,071
Got another one, Sam, 506...

1057
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,507
coming straight
to Los Angeles. You want him?

1058
00:59:40,173 --> 00:59:42,744
Do you mind if I...
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

1059
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:47,084
Sorry.

1060
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:16,778
No, Gail, there's
four days left before the wedding.

1061
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:20,118
I'm just going to get
some rest and...

1062
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:22,620
hop on the first
flight in the morning.

1063
01:00:23,617 --> 01:00:25,119
Thanks for trying.

1064
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:28,463
Yeah. I love you, too.

1065
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:31,466
Okay. Bye.

1066
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:53,319
Montana Moore.
Do you know what time it is?

1067
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,150
It's ten o'clock in L.A.

1068
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:57,417
it's one A.M. in Baltimore.

1069
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:00,362
I know.

1070
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:03,691
I'm sorry, I just thought
maybe you might want to...

1071
01:01:04,024 --> 01:01:05,367
you know...

1072
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:06,927
talk.

1073
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:09,096
About?

1074
01:01:09,363 --> 01:01:11,036
Come on, William.

1075
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:14,869
How long have we
known each other? You can tell me.

1076
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:16,206
What are you talking about?

1077
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:17,437
I'm talking about...

1078
01:01:18,105 --> 01:01:19,209
Montana.

1079
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,941
Taylor.

1080
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:22,207
I was thinking about you, too.

1081
01:01:22,876 --> 01:01:24,446
Oh, you got another call.

1082
01:01:24,678 --> 01:01:26,248
Taylor, don't do that.

1083
01:01:26,546 --> 01:01:29,220
And Merry Christmas to you, too.
Bye.

1084
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:31,551
What happened to the Italian guy?

1085
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:41,069
What are you working on?

1086
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:44,731
Just trying to figure things out.

1087
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:48,068
I like this little thing here.

1088
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:49,745
Oh. yeah?

1089
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:12,828
Anybody in a holiday spirit?

1090
01:02:13,093 --> 01:02:14,936
Come on, it's open mike.

1091
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:19,137
A cottage small is all I'm after

1092
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:22,844
Not one that's spacious and wide.

1093
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,111
A house that's filled...

1094
01:02:25,272 --> 01:02:27,445
What are you guys whispering about?

1095
01:02:27,774 --> 01:02:30,618
Hey, I'm singing right now.

1096
01:02:32,946 --> 01:02:35,790
Sam e people like the high life.
I like the low life.

1097
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:43,460
Sounds corny and seedy,
but yes, indeed-y,

1098
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:47,435
Give me the simple life

1099
01:02:49,129 --> 01:02:50,972
You know? Okay.

1100
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:56,311
Bravo, bravo. That was amazing.

1101
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:57,810
Quinton!

1102
01:02:58,638 --> 01:02:59,981
Montana.

1103
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,551
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

1104
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,153
Oh, please. Don't be.

1105
01:03:05,979 --> 01:03:07,322
You were wonderful.

1106
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:09,649
- Really?
- Well, no.

1107
01:03:12,652 --> 01:03:14,325
it's so good to see you.

1108
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:17,658
You, too. I'm so pleased
you still remember me.

1109
01:03:17,891 --> 01:03:21,896
Of course I remember you. You
were on my route for over a year.

1110
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:25,336
L.A. to New York.
Let me see if I can remember.

1111
01:03:25,565 --> 01:03:28,671
Columbia graduate,
top of your class, of course.

1112
01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:33,178
Hobbies-racquetball,
skiing and art.

1113
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:37,512
I guess it's obvious how much I enjoyed
talking to you during our flights.

1114
01:03:37,744 --> 01:03:41,590
Luckily, there was always an empty
seat next to you so we could talk.

1115
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:44,692
It wasn't luck.
I paid for both seats.

1116
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:46,859
You didn't.

1117
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:48,430
Of course.

1118
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,362
Excuse me.

1119
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:01,706
I have no idea
what you just said, but you don't...

1120
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:03,608
Please. I insist.

1121
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,713
Let's go have a drink.

1122
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,882
Okay, if you insist.

1123
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:12,212
So you've been a maid
of honor nine times.

1124
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:15,215
I should call
the Guinness Book of World Records.

1125
01:04:15,448 --> 01:04:17,450
More like Ripley's
Believe It or Not.

1126
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:20,220
It could have been ten, actually...

1127
01:04:20,453 --> 01:04:22,933
but my cousin called off her
third wedding the day before.

1128
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:25,265
So it's really nine
with an asterisk.

1129
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:27,565
Yeah, I know.

1130
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,637
As you requested, Mr. Jamison.

1131
01:04:29,896 --> 01:04:32,069
Oh, Quinton, this is too much.

1132
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:36,475
You can never have too much of a good
thing. Besides, it's on the house.

1133
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,414
You work for the hotel?

1134
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,913
I own the hotel.

1135
01:04:45,412 --> 01:04:46,755
This hotel?

1136
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:48,748
Yes.

1137
01:04:51,184 --> 01:04:56,065
It's a lovely day for going nowhere

1138
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,308
It's a lovely day for being in love

1139
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:15,251
It's a lovely day
Feel like chasing the clouds away

1140
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:23,658
To a perfect place I'm dreaming of

1141
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:32,630
It's a lovely day for going nowhere

1142
01:05:36,296 --> 01:05:39,470
Have you ever imagined
what it would feel like...

1143
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:43,144
to take off a year
and travel the world?

1144
01:05:44,304 --> 01:05:48,650
What woman hasn't?
But without the means or the time...

1145
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:52,487
it remains just that,
a thought, a dream.

1146
01:05:54,648 --> 01:05:57,151
So if you were given the means...

1147
01:05:57,984 --> 01:05:59,827
would you find the time?

1148
01:06:01,821 --> 01:06:03,994
I don't know what you mean.

1149
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:06,993
Oh.

1150
01:06:07,994 --> 01:06:10,338
You think this sunrise is beautiful?

1151
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:13,838
Wait till you
see the sunrise in the Serengeti.

1152
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:17,008
Or the view from the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

1153
01:06:17,837 --> 01:06:19,839
We could shop in Milan.

1154
01:06:20,073 --> 01:06:22,576
Cruise the Greek Isles
on a private yacht.

1155
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:27,018
Wow, that... that sounds incredible.

1156
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:31,526
Quinton, I'm so flattered.
I don't know what to say.

1157
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,857
Say... "I accept your invitation."

1158
01:06:35,188 --> 01:06:37,862
You mean... your proposal?

1159
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:41,031
If that's what you want
to call it, then yes.

1160
01:06:41,428 --> 01:06:43,430
What do you want me to call it?

1161
01:06:44,197 --> 01:06:46,404
I'm taking time off
to travel the world

1162
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:47,945
and I'm asking you to join me.

1163
01:06:51,037 --> 01:06:52,209
Montana...

1164
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:55,042
if you thought
I was talking about marriage

1165
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,548
I've tried it, twice...

1166
01:06:57,877 --> 01:07:00,881
and all it did
was ruin two very good friendships.

1167
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:03,416
Listen.

1168
01:07:03,717 --> 01:07:05,924
If marriage is what
you need, you should

1169
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:08,225
find someone willing
to give you that.

1170
01:07:08,555 --> 01:07:11,092
But if passion and
adventure are what you want,

1171
01:07:11,424 --> 01:07:13,563
you'll never want it again.

1172
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:18,798
I'm passing through D.C.
in a couple of days

1173
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:21,173
on my way to Rome, then London...

1174
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:22,907
and then to Greece.

1175
01:07:23,236 --> 01:07:24,840
I'll have my assistant book you

1176
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:26,651
a ticket to all three places,
just in case.

1177
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:30,585
Okay.

1178
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:34,589
If you're going to be in D.C...

1179
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:37,918
I'd really like you to come
to my sister's rehearsal dinner.

1180
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:41,425
If won't be anything fancy,
like you're used to, but...

1181
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:43,658
we could talk about it then.

1182
01:07:43,923 --> 01:07:45,163
Okay.

1183
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:51,098
Now you get some rest
and think about it. Yes?

1184
01:07:53,266 --> 01:07:54,609
Okay.

1185
01:07:59,939 --> 01:08:01,782
It's been a great night.

1186
01:08:39,312 --> 01:08:43,488
Now I realize why it's
so hard to find the perfect guy.

1187
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:47,161
Maybe he just doesn't exist.

1188
01:08:55,461 --> 01:09:00,001
From the first time we met

1189
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,615
Saw a glow I can't forget

1190
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:09,115
Felt the sun rise and set

1191
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:14,025
In your eyes

1192
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:19,160
I knew that I wanted

1193
01:09:19,385 --> 01:09:22,855
You near me

1194
01:09:23,156 --> 01:09:27,332
Is it love I feel?

1195
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:32,310
Tell me, is it real?

1196
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:39,616
Is it love, please tell me

1197
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:45,217
Now

1198
01:09:50,717 --> 01:09:51,718
What you doing?

1199
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:54,890
About to
get ready for the rehearsal dinner.

1200
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,623
It's your mailman.

1201
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:59,165
From your mailbox.

1202
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,566
You didn't have to do that.

1203
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:06,066
And that's from me.

1204
01:10:06,966 --> 01:10:08,639
Early Christmas gift.

1205
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:10,072
Thanks.

1206
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:11,307
It'll help get your
mother off your back.

1207
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:13,244
That's no longer a problem.

1208
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:15,248
Tonight at Sheree's
rehearsal dinner,

1209
01:10:15,308 --> 01:10:18,255
after my sister
introduces her soon-to-be husband...

1210
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,818
I'll make an
introduction of my own.

1211
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:23,252
What's so funny?

1212
01:10:23,483 --> 01:10:25,156
You're turning into your mother.

1213
01:10:25,418 --> 01:10:29,764
No. I'm just realizing that maybe
fairy tales don't come true.

1214
01:10:30,423 --> 01:10:34,599
We weren't all lucky enough
to have parents like you...

1215
01:10:34,928 --> 01:10:38,933
that ate dinner every night
together for 40 years.

1216
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:41,642
I never said my
parents were perfect.

1217
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:44,010
They went through
it just like any other couple.

1218
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,444
But when they took those
vows, they meant it.

1219
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:50,778
My mom loved my dad.
And my dad loved her back.

1220
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,854
Well, my mom loved my dad.

1221
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:55,820
And then she loved another man.

1222
01:10:55,949 --> 01:10:58,327
And another man and another man.

1223
01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:02,464
People get married and divorced.
That's just what people do.

1224
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,795
You spent your life being your own
woman. Why change now?

1225
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,628
Who said I wouldn't be my own woman?

1226
01:11:08,695 --> 01:11:11,801
I just would really like to
be somebody else's, too.

1227
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:14,634
Somebody's? Or anybody's?

1228
01:11:18,972 --> 01:11:21,316
You know what? William...

1229
01:11:22,809 --> 01:11:26,313
why don't you save your
really great relationship advice

1230
01:11:26,546 --> 01:11:29,891
for someone
who really needs it? Like Taylor...

1231
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,720
when she's kissing some
Italian dude at 30,000 feet.

1232
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:35,727
Wow.

1233
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,494
That's my cue.

1234
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:42,996
Merry Christmas, Mo.

1235
01:11:45,665 --> 01:11:47,076
I thought you should know!

1236
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:50,074
Thank you, I know.

1237
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:54,173
William?

1238
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:01,850
I'm sorry.

1239
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:17,037
Montana, it's your mother.

1240
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:21,209
I have told everybody
about your announcement...

1241
01:12:21,534 --> 01:12:23,536
so don't let me down!

1242
01:12:43,389 --> 01:12:45,232
Good evening.

1243
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:48,402
As you all know,
my youngest daughter...

1244
01:12:48,728 --> 01:12:52,073
is marrying a
handsome young man...

1245
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:54,071
from Rhoda Island.

1246
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,176
Rocky Mountains.

1247
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:57,407
Rocky Mountains.

1248
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,083
What are you doing here?

1249
01:13:02,408 --> 01:13:04,410
Same as you, just being nosy.

1250
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:06,679
This is to welcome
him to the family.

1251
01:13:07,413 --> 01:13:10,257
And give him a last
chance to back out.

1252
01:13:12,085 --> 01:13:15,259
But before I bring you
my youngest daughter...

1253
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:17,761
I'd like to present my oldest...

1254
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,765
who has an announcement
that is lovely...

1255
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:24,602
and long overdue.

1256
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:27,439
I give you Montana!

1257
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:29,942
Montana, come up.

1258
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:31,543
Come up here.

1259
01:13:38,778 --> 01:13:40,621
So, um...

1260
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:43,950
...I have an announcement..

1261
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:47,457
...as I am sure you are all aware.

1262
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:51,466
The tricky thing about
announcements is...

1263
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:54,632
you need to have
something to announce...

1264
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:57,397
in order for it to
be an announcement.

1265
01:13:58,631 --> 01:13:59,974
What is she doing?

1266
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:01,234
I don't know.

1267
01:14:02,802 --> 01:14:04,645
So, here it is.

1268
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:07,918
Friends... family...
fellow Americans.

1269
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:09,142
Langston.

1270
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,696
Langston?

1271
01:14:11,644 --> 01:14:14,648
Montana, I was flipping
through the newspaper...

1272
01:14:14,914 --> 01:14:18,259
and saw the notice
for your sister's wedding.

1273
01:14:18,484 --> 01:14:21,158
Congratulations.
You look ravishing.

1274
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:22,761
Thank you.

1275
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:24,669
- Montana...
- Who is he?

1276
01:14:24,824 --> 01:14:27,430
I thought about what you said.
You were right.

1277
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:30,004
A woman can lead.

1278
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:32,439
Under the right
circumstances, of course.

1279
01:14:33,332 --> 01:14:35,744
One of which is a campaign brunch

1280
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:38,280
next week, with a very
influential senator.

1281
01:14:39,005 --> 01:14:40,678
A senator.

1282
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:43,348
This is to beside...

1283
01:14:43,809 --> 01:14:44,810
behind...

1284
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:48,352
and to nothing...

1285
01:14:48,948 --> 01:14:50,450
coming between us.

1286
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:57,527
Montana...

1287
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:00,637
would you...
- Oh, yes, she will!

1288
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,529
No, I won't.

1289
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:05,706
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.

1290
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:07,308
- Will.
- Won't.

1291
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:09,206
What's gotten into you?

1292
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:10,640
What's gotten into you?

1293
01:15:11,537 --> 01:15:13,539
You don't even know this man.

1294
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:16,312
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you?

1295
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,376
Fine, thank you.

1296
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:21,819
You're just going to marry me off
to the first person you see?

1297
01:15:22,381 --> 01:15:24,054
Unbelievable.

1298
01:15:25,384 --> 01:15:27,557
This is a man...

1299
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:29,389
who I would...

1300
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:30,990
never marry.

1301
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:35,232
I wouldn't even vote for you.

1302
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:39,740
I don't trust black
Republicans, I'm sorry.

1303
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:42,076
I'm actually a Libertarian.

1304
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:46,340
You know, I spent the
last thirty days...

1305
01:15:47,406 --> 01:15:49,909
looking for somebody, anybody...

1306
01:15:50,243 --> 01:15:51,916
to come here tonight.

1307
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:54,919
So I could... fit in.

1308
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:57,690
Be part of the club.

1309
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:02,764
So all of you would say,
"We love you, Montana."

1310
01:16:03,089 --> 01:16:06,593
"You did it. We're so proud of you.
You're a lady."

1311
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,532
But...

1312
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:10,771
marriage doesn't
make you a lady...

1313
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:15,603
any more than standing in
a garage makes you a car.

1314
01:16:16,936 --> 01:16:18,609
That's a weird analogy.

1315
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:21,782
So, um...

1316
01:16:22,942 --> 01:16:24,944
where's my announcement.

1317
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,118
I'm not getting married.

1318
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:30,216
I don't even have any prospects.

1319
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:32,956
No, none, zero.

1320
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:34,562
I'm all alone.

1321
01:16:36,789 --> 01:16:39,133
But I did meet somebody...

1322
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:42,629
have been really,
really needing to meet.

1323
01:16:44,463 --> 01:16:45,635
Me.

1324
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:50,572
And it turns out...

1325
01:16:52,638 --> 01:16:54,311
I like me.

1326
01:16:56,142 --> 01:16:57,485
A lot.

1327
01:16:58,311 --> 01:17:00,587
With or without a husband.

1328
01:17:03,816 --> 01:17:07,821
And I say this, from
your older sister...

1329
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:09,926
that...

1330
01:17:11,157 --> 01:17:14,832
if you are really in
love with Derrick...

1331
01:17:15,328 --> 01:17:16,932
and you can't imagine...

1332
01:17:16,996 --> 01:17:19,840
spending another
day without him...

1333
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,939
then you two should
absolutely get married.

1334
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:26,005
And I'm so happy for you.

1335
01:17:27,273 --> 01:17:28,274
But...

1336
01:17:29,508 --> 01:17:32,853
if you're making this
decision for any other reason...

1337
01:17:33,346 --> 01:17:37,021
sweetie, you're making the
biggest mistake of your life.

1338
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:45,866
A really good friend once told me...

1339
01:17:47,693 --> 01:17:49,036
the magic...

1340
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,869
the magic isn't
in getting married.

1341
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:55,703
It's in staying married.

1342
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:05,378
I don't know.

1343
01:18:08,047 --> 01:18:11,221
What are you saying?
You don't want to get married?

1344
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:12,827
Do you?

1345
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:16,723
I was just doing
this 'cause your mom said we had to.

1346
01:18:20,393 --> 01:18:24,068
Baby, we can wait until
after we graduate.

1347
01:18:24,397 --> 01:18:27,503
Maybe get to
know each other a little better.

1348
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:29,744
Are you sure?

1349
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,243
Yes. I am.

1350
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:35,074
That's okay. Give me a kiss.

1351
01:18:36,742 --> 01:18:38,915
- I'm fine with that. I love you.
- I love you, too.

1352
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,418
I feel so much better.

1353
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:43,591
Let's get out of here.

1354
01:18:47,253 --> 01:18:48,596
Thank you.

1355
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:50,260
I love you.

1356
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:05,613
Hello. My name is Langston
Jefferson Battle Ill...

1357
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,943
and I am running for
the United States Congress.

1358
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,254
You met someone? You met yourself?

1359
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:17,921
I had to say I was
introducing someone.

1360
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:24,324
Whatever you need, we are here
for you. Right by your side.

1361
01:19:24,924 --> 01:19:26,096
Montana!

1362
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:27,601
From way over there.

1363
01:19:27,827 --> 01:19:29,670
Way, way over there.

1364
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:31,272
Wait for me, okay?

1365
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:32,598
Not now, Mom.

1366
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,039
Montana, wait.

1367
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:38,104
Listen, Mom. I need a few
days. Weeks. Maybe even a month.

1368
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:40,840
I can't give you that.

1369
01:19:42,274 --> 01:19:45,619
I can risk losing another
husband, but not my daughter.

1370
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:51,283
I was proud of you in there.

1371
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:57,465
That woman in there was the
woman I raised you to be.

1372
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,634
Confident. Smart.

1373
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:02,628
Independent.

1374
01:20:03,629 --> 01:20:04,972
A lady.

1375
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:13,477
I'm sorry.

1376
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,149
I was scared.

1377
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:22,219
I put all that pressure
on you and your sister...

1378
01:20:22,481 --> 01:20:26,554
'cause I didn't want you to go
through five husbands like I did.

1379
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:28,056
Do you mean that?

1380
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:29,222
Of course I do.

1381
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:32,165
And you know I do.

1382
01:20:33,158 --> 01:20:36,230
I don't know if I
ever told you this...

1383
01:20:39,665 --> 01:20:41,576
but your father...

1384
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:44,841
was my first...

1385
01:20:45,838 --> 01:20:47,511
and only...

1386
01:20:49,008 --> 01:20:50,351
true love...

1387
01:20:52,344 --> 01:20:54,017
And I loved him...

1388
01:20:54,513 --> 01:20:56,515
until the day he died.

1389
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:00,429
You're too young to
remember, Montana.

1390
01:21:00,686 --> 01:21:04,361
But every Sunday,
your father would let me sleep.

1391
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,034
He'd rush downstairs...

1392
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:09,032
to make pancakes.

1393
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:13,609
He'd rattle his pots and pans
and carry on down there.

1394
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,577
And then he'd yell up the stairs,

1395
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:19,707
"Catherine, you come on down
here and eat these pancakes!"

1396
01:21:21,206 --> 01:21:22,480
I wouldn't move.

1397
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:27,388
And then he'd come
and kiss me on my cheek.

1398
01:21:29,048 --> 01:21:31,392
So sweet.

1399
01:21:34,553 --> 01:21:37,227
And he'd say,
"Get up, baby. Come and eat."

1400
01:21:42,394 --> 01:21:44,567
That was thirty years ago, Montana.

1401
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:49,568
And some Sundays...

1402
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:52,746
I still close my eyes...

1403
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:57,145
and I can smell those
pancakes like it was yesterday.

1404
01:22:00,412 --> 01:22:01,413
So, yeah.

1405
01:22:02,081 --> 01:22:04,425
Love does matter.

1406
01:22:08,754 --> 01:22:10,756
And when you find love...

1407
01:22:12,424 --> 01:22:13,767
and you will, baby...

1408
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:15,436
No, no.

1409
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:19,936
Don't ever let it go.

1410
01:22:29,108 --> 01:22:30,109
I love you, Mom.

1411
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:31,277
I love you, too.

1412
01:22:34,947 --> 01:22:35,948
Mom.

1413
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:37,016
Come on, let's go.

1414
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,623
I just want to make you proud of me.

1415
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:48,637
I don't think I'm
ever going to meet somebody.

1416
01:22:48,861 --> 01:22:52,365
Who knows? But you can have
really great sex while you look.

1417
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:54,967
She can.

1418
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,373
We get it, Gail. You like to bone.

1419
01:23:09,648 --> 01:23:10,820
Montana!

1420
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,291
Did you enter the Publisher's
Clearing House Sweepstakes?

1421
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:18,831
Who is that?

1422
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:20,663
Montana!

1423
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:24,898
Montana, I think the King of
Zamunda might be here to see you.

1424
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:32,574
Oh. That's Quinton.

1425
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:35,184
That is Quinton.

1426
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:38,081
That's who you were supposed
to meet at the rehearsal?

1427
01:23:38,677 --> 01:23:40,350
That's the one that gave you...

1428
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:42,022
Those diamonds are...

1429
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:44,016
Those diamonds are real?

1430
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:45,623
Montana!

1431
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:49,097
Get ready, go down there.

1432
01:23:49,354 --> 01:23:50,856
No. I'm not.

1433
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,262
What are you doing?

1434
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:53,597
Gail, move.

1435
01:23:53,859 --> 01:23:54,929
Put the bracelet down.

1436
01:23:55,194 --> 01:23:56,400
Let her go.

1437
01:23:56,528 --> 01:23:58,008
Don't do something
we will all regret!

1438
01:23:58,697 --> 01:24:00,540
We can all retire off that bracelet!

1439
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:03,706
Quinton!

1440
01:24:05,537 --> 01:24:09,883
I apologize for being late. I had an
event that ran longer than expected.

1441
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:12,111
I hope I didn't ruin
anything for you.

1442
01:24:14,046 --> 01:24:17,391
Look. I thought
about what you said in Los Angeles.

1443
01:24:17,616 --> 01:24:19,027
I said a lot.

1444
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:20,562
And I listened.

1445
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:26,062
I want more than
extravagant trips and...

1446
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:28,401
expensive gifts.

1447
01:24:28,727 --> 01:24:31,901
They're nice. They're really nice.

1448
01:24:33,065 --> 01:24:34,066
But...

1449
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,573
I want a lifetime.

1450
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:42,251
And as silly as it may sound, I'm not
going to settle for anything less.

1451
01:24:43,575 --> 01:24:45,919
And as silly as it sounds...

1452
01:24:46,745 --> 01:24:48,088
I don't think you should.

1453
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:54,155
Thanks.

1454
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:01,268
I can't see! I can't see!

1455
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:14,376
That was super brave.

1456
01:25:14,506 --> 01:25:15,610
Thanks.

1457
01:25:15,941 --> 01:25:18,285
That was super stupid.

1458
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:22,414
Uh, uh, uh!

1459
01:25:24,783 --> 01:25:25,784
I just...

1460
01:25:27,452 --> 01:25:30,126
I want a commitment. Real love.

1461
01:25:30,455 --> 01:25:33,800
He just wanted international
travel booty.

1462
01:25:34,126 --> 01:25:37,972
That man could have
intergalactic travel booty.

1463
01:25:39,965 --> 01:25:41,569
So who gave you this?

1464
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,304
William.

1465
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:45,478
Did William wrap that himself?

1466
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:47,782
He can wrap a gift.

1467
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,141
You going to open it?

1468
01:25:49,641 --> 01:25:50,642
No.

1469
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:51,744
Okay, I will.

1470
01:25:51,877 --> 01:25:55,051
Hey, hey. She said she
doesn't want to open it.

1471
01:25:55,214 --> 01:25:56,989
That's why I'm opening it.

1472
01:25:57,216 --> 01:25:58,559
- You want it?
- Yes.

1473
01:25:58,817 --> 01:25:59,852
I would.

1474
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:00,986
Don't you touch my...!

1475
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,563
I'll open it!

1476
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:05,825
God! I have had enough
drama for one night.

1477
01:26:06,058 --> 01:26:08,060
- You said you didn't want to open it.
- Stop it!

1478
01:26:08,327 --> 01:26:09,738
I'll open it.

1479
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:16,768
Really.

1480
01:26:25,677 --> 01:26:28,351
Is William going through a bit
of a financial situation?

1481
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:35,358
When we were seven, he proposed
to me with a toy ring...

1482
01:26:36,855 --> 01:26:38,528
and I laughed at him.

1483
01:26:39,691 --> 01:26:42,194
And he said, "Someday."

1484
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:46,707
it's a plane ticket.

1485
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:48,775
Is it? Hey, now.

1486
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:54,611
Okay.
This is a plane ticket to France.

1487
01:26:57,276 --> 01:26:59,449
He wants you to marry a Frenchman.

1488
01:26:59,711 --> 01:27:00,712
Gail.

1489
01:27:01,713 --> 01:27:04,159
He was going to take his
girlfriend to Italy

1490
01:27:04,283 --> 01:27:06,729
for their one-year
anniversary and I said...

1491
01:27:07,052 --> 01:27:11,398
if it was me,
I would have chosen... France.

1492
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:16,731
What date is the ticket for?

1493
01:27:19,398 --> 01:27:20,741
Today.

1494
01:27:22,901 --> 01:27:24,471
At 11:45 P.M.

1495
01:27:26,738 --> 01:27:29,082
Here we go, looking for a taxi!

1496
01:27:29,574 --> 01:27:30,917
That one!

1497
01:27:31,143 --> 01:27:32,264
Stop in the name of the law!

1498
01:27:33,412 --> 01:27:34,755
We need to get to the airport!

1499
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,425
I'm off duty!

1500
01:27:36,982 --> 01:27:38,154
What are you doing?

1501
01:27:38,283 --> 01:27:39,421
Sir, you must!

1502
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:45,997
Hey, my brother, I'm Calvin.
Let me help you with your bag.

1503
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:47,196
I'm good, bro.

1504
01:27:47,259 --> 01:27:50,604
You can't go in there with
liquids and gels. You got any?

1505
01:27:50,829 --> 01:27:52,502
Cabbie, cabbie!

1506
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,343
Stop!

1507
01:27:57,102 --> 01:27:59,446
Brother, you don't have
no lotion or nothing?

1508
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:00,608
No, I don't.

1509
01:28:00,672 --> 01:28:04,279
So you out here for the
holidays just ashy?

1510
01:28:04,509 --> 01:28:07,615
You already dark-skinned.
Brother, we got a black President.

1511
01:28:07,846 --> 01:28:10,793
I am not sitting bitch!
I resent the implication!

1512
01:28:11,116 --> 01:28:13,118
I want the seat by the window!

1513
01:28:13,352 --> 01:28:14,854
Happy holidays, brother.

1514
01:28:19,124 --> 01:28:20,467
I couldn't hold him.

1515
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,635
Drive, drive, drive!

1516
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:25,130
How may I help you, sir?

1517
01:28:25,263 --> 01:28:26,298
I'm going to Paris.

1518
01:28:26,498 --> 01:28:27,499
I need your passport.

1519
01:28:28,033 --> 01:28:29,376
Here you go.

1520
01:28:30,635 --> 01:28:33,980
Calvin couldn't stop him.
I'll text Tanya and Cedric.

1521
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,483
Here you go.

1522
01:28:40,045 --> 01:28:41,149
Actually!

1523
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:46,056
These computers are always doing
something weird. Just one second.

1524
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:47,456
Enjoying the holidays?

1525
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:48,554
Is it snowing?

1526
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:50,792
Paris sounds amazing.
Is the Eiffel Tower there?

1527
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,573
I'm stuck here!

1528
01:29:00,832 --> 01:29:01,872
Where are you going?

1529
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,901
I have to try!

1530
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:04,745
Is there...?

1531
01:29:05,003 --> 01:29:07,074
Sorry, Mr. Wright, just one second.

1532
01:29:07,839 --> 01:29:09,512
Good luck! We love you!

1533
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:11,348
I love you! Thanks, guys!

1534
01:29:11,843 --> 01:29:13,845
Text me Quinton's number!

1535
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:15,854
- Really?
- Really.

1536
01:29:16,181 --> 01:29:18,787
Finally, I got it.
Here's your ticket.

1537
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:22,354
Enjoy your trip to Paris.
Your gate is that way.

1538
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:25,363
Have a safe flight, Mr. Wright!

1539
01:29:52,117 --> 01:29:53,221
What are you doing?

1540
01:30:18,577 --> 01:30:22,753
- Please, please, please!
- It's too late. I'm sorry.

1541
01:30:41,266 --> 01:30:42,438
William.

1542
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:43,602
Montana?

1543
01:30:44,102 --> 01:30:46,104
William, oh, my God.

1544
01:30:46,938 --> 01:30:51,444
I just saw your plane leave
and I thought you were gone.

1545
01:30:51,943 --> 01:30:55,083
The agent entered
the wrong gate on my boarding pass.

1546
01:30:55,147 --> 01:30:57,423
But I thought you...

1547
01:30:57,782 --> 01:30:59,455
I thought you got your proposal.

1548
01:31:00,652 --> 01:31:01,926
I said no.

1549
01:31:03,288 --> 01:31:04,289
No husband?

1550
01:31:06,525 --> 01:31:07,526
No Taylor?

1551
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:09,966
Not anymore.

1552
01:31:11,796 --> 01:31:15,209
The only baggage I've got is on
the way to France right now.

1553
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:18,137
It's just me.

1554
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:23,317
What are you trying to say
with the Cracker Jack box?

1555
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:24,816
I don't understand.

1556
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:26,217
Mo, listen.

1557
01:31:29,981 --> 01:31:32,985
I was standing alone
in my apartment.

1558
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:35,658
And I realized...

1559
01:31:37,989 --> 01:31:40,162
why wasn't it finished?

1560
01:31:41,326 --> 01:31:43,397
It wasn't finished
because you weren't in it.

1561
01:31:45,664 --> 01:31:50,511
And I realized that little Cracker Jack
box ring wasn't gonna fit no more.

1562
01:31:50,835 --> 01:31:51,905
So...

1563
01:31:54,005 --> 01:31:56,246
I found one that would.

1564
01:32:07,018 --> 01:32:09,191
Montana Christina Moore...

1565
01:32:14,693 --> 01:32:16,536
for the second time...

1566
01:32:16,928 --> 01:32:19,101
and this time for all
the right reasons...

1567
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:24,377
would you marry me?

1568
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:27,047
Yes, yes, yes.

1569
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:29,211
William.

1570
01:32:32,711 --> 01:32:35,783
After thirty days
and 30,000 miles

1571
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:38,054
of searching the skies
for Mr. Right...

1572
01:32:38,116 --> 01:32:42,121
it turns out he was living
across the hall the whole time.

1573
01:32:42,387 --> 01:32:45,561
And with any luck,
he'll work the same job...

1574
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:49,394
drive the same truck
and love the same woman...

1575
01:32:49,728 --> 01:32:52,072
for the rest of his life.

1576
01:32:57,736 --> 01:32:59,238
- We did it!
- Yes!

1577
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:01,581
We did it.

1578
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:04,144
I am so glad that's over.

1579
01:33:04,409 --> 01:33:07,583
Now I can finally get
back to my life.

1580
01:33:10,248 --> 01:33:14,253
Which starts this weekend.

1581
01:33:14,753 --> 01:33:17,927
I have a date with an
amazingly gorgeous man.

1582
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,091
Oh!

1583
01:33:20,492 --> 01:33:22,165
Looks like I got a hot date, too.

1584
01:33:22,427 --> 01:33:24,270
Oh, Sam.

1585
01:33:24,596 --> 01:33:26,598
He works at the Renaissance.

1586
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:30,006
Well, mine's the manager.

1587
01:33:32,504 --> 01:33:33,574
No.

1588
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:41,521
You bitch! Why?

1589
01:33:41,946 --> 01:33:44,290
That's my man!
I had him first!

1590
01:33:44,616 --> 01:33:46,220
He's mine! I'm going to...

1591
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:53,091
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

1592
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:59,102
My eyes shot out like a fish out of
water and I'm jumpin' in it

1593
01:33:59,497 --> 01:34:02,444
Oh, I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

1594
01:34:02,534 --> 01:34:05,208
I never stay within the lines

1595
01:34:05,537 --> 01:34:08,450
I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

1596
01:34:08,506 --> 01:34:11,112
I'm gonna take what's mine

1597
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:15,050
Oh, don't get scared for me

1598
01:34:15,413 --> 01:34:17,518
Just be prepared for me

1599
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:23,691
'Cause I'm in love with love

1600
01:34:23,755 --> 01:34:29,865
'Cause I'm in love with love

1601
01:34:29,928 --> 01:34:31,532
In love
