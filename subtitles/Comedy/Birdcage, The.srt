1
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,633
We are family

2
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,801
l got all my sisters with me

3
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:00,475
We are family

4
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,975
Get up, everybody, and sing

5
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:08,649
We are family

6
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,988
l got all my sisters with me

7
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,151
Agador, where is Starina?
She goes on in 5 minutes.

8
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,092
Get up, everybody, and sing

9
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,834
Everyone can see we're together

10
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:30,334
As we walk on by

11
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:35,172
And we fly just like birds of a feather

12
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,004
l won't tell no lie

13
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,514
All of the people around us they say

14
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:46,016
Can they be that close

15
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,516
Let me state for the record

16
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,691
We're giving love in a family dose

17
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,395
Armand.

18
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:33,627
The Kennedys are
here again for supper.

19
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,730
Third time this week.
Do we pick up their tab?

20
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:36,865
Ted?

21
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,909
No, just the younger ones.

22
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,239
Wish we'd get Ted.
Give them free coffee.

23
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,351
Leave room for coffee.

24
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,247
Where's Starina?

25
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,188
Agador said she'd be down in five.

26
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,928
We are family

27
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,262
Get up, everybody, and sing

28
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,769
We are family

29
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,967
Starina won't go on.
She's still in her robe.

30
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,068
Damn!

31
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:43,137
l don't know what happened.

32
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,071
Go upstairs. Try to get her ready.
l'll be right up. Go!

33
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,643
She won't.

34
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:52,909
Merde! Have Carmen get ready to do
Starina's number, just in case.

35
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,322
Honey, please. You got to
get dressed for me. Please!

36
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,753
No, Agador.

37
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:07,055
Victoria Page will not dance
the Dance of the Red Shoes tonight.

38
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:08,462
Or any other night.

39
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,694
How about just your stockings?
Okay?

40
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,926
Victoria Page is dead.

41
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,332
Watch how nice
l'm gonna put it for you.

42
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,873
You know how she died?

43
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,433
Alone...
weeping for her lover.

44
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:23,439
Darling, have you eaten?
You look haggard.

45
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:26,343
Please!
You got to help me a little.

46
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:28,845
-What is this?
-Supplements.

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,453
l bought them for Armand, but...

48
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,189
that's all over now.

49
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,024
Okay.

50
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,797
Albert!

51
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:51,303
Where are you?
Albert, come on!

52
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,601
-Open up, baby.
-Get out!

53
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,279
-Open it, Albert!
-Go away!

54
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,872
l don't want him to see me.
l'm hideous!

55
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,149
Fuck!

56
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,814
l'm calling 911!

57
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:09,617
Abre la puerta!

58
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,621
-Open the door!
-l'm trying, but he's crazy.

59
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,631
Albert!

60
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,727
Are you trying to ruin me?

61
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,165
Don't look at me.
l'm hideous!

62
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:25,069
Hideous!
Fat and hideous.

63
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,401
Agador, l'm in such pain.

64
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:30,236
l know, honey.
lt's gonna pass.

65
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:33,072
No! lt will never pass.
l hate my life.

66
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,841
Are you crazy?

67
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,648
There is a packed house
out there.

68
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:39,121
That's all l am to you--
a meal ticket.

69
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,750
-l can't stand this.
-Forget about my feelings.

70
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:45,523
Never mind about my suffering.
lt's just about your show.

71
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,928
Not even our show.
Your show.

72
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,030
l want a palimony agreement.
Now!

73
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,102
l don't have one on me now.
ls tomorrow all right?

74
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,703
-Don't use that tone to me.
-What tone?

75
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,240
That sarcastic, contemptuous tone
that means...

76
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,301
you know everything
because you're a man...

77
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,370
and l know nothing
because l'm a woman.

78
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:06,440
-You're not a woman.
-Oh, you bastard!

79
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,043
Everybody, take it easy.

80
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:12,449
Whatever l am, he made me.

81
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,216
l was adorable once--
young and full of hope.

82
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,953
Now, look at me.
l'm this short...

83
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,224
fat, insecure,
middle-aged thing!

84
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:25,800
l made you short?

85
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,930
What do l do?
The number is nearly over.

86
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,442
Do l send Carmen on?

87
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,474
We have no choice.

88
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,537
-Yes.
-No! Not Carmen!

89
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:38,946
How dare you?

90
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:40,507
-Do it!
-No! No!

91
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,576
-Cyril, go.
-Please.

92
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,312
l will go on.
The people have come to see Starina.

93
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,492
Starina will not disappoint them,
even in this state.

94
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,255
Put on the mambo number.

95
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,662
Tell Beatrice and Dante to get
the staircase ready. Go!

96
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:56,766
-My hands are shaking.
-That's okay.

97
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,268
Agador, l need some Pirin tablets.
Quickly!

98
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:01,328
-What are you taking?
-Nothing.

99
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,602
Just one, okay?
One before the show...

100
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,174
and one after.
No more, so don't ask.

101
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,276
Thank you, my darling Agador.

102
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:12,176
l'm gonna put
this here for you.

103
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,678
Breathe.
lgnore the bad things.

104
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,184
This room is so crowded. Can l have
a moment to myself to prepare?

105
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,515
Let's leave her.
Come on.

106
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,222
-What are you doing?
-What?

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,962
Why are you giving him drugs?
What the hell are Pirin tablets?

108
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,698
lt's aspirin
with the 'a' and 's' scraped off.

109
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,701
-What a brilliant idea.
-l know.

110
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:43,708
l don't believe it.
You're shaving your chest now?

111
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,879
l didn't have time to wax.

112
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:51,382
lndifference is the most awful thing
in the world.

113
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,155
l've done everything l could
to make myself attractive for you.

114
00:08:56,561 --> 00:09:00,725
l've lost and gained
over a hundred pounds in the last year.

115
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,726
l've yo-yoed from a 16
to a 10 to a 16...

116
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,402
and you've never said a word.

117
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:13,733
Not one hint of encouragement.
Not one scrap of validation.

118
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:18,075
lf not for the Pirin tablets,
l don't think l could go on.

119
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,674
lf you don't finish making up,
l'm going to kill myself.

120
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,685
You don't love me anymore.

121
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,245
Oh, shit.

122
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,451
-There's a man in your life.
-What?

123
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,857
l sense it.

124
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,860
And l saw
a bottle of white wine...

125
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,088
chilling in the refrigerator.

126
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,594
l only drink red.

127
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,527
And so do you.

128
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,539
There's no man.

129
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:49,041
l'm switching to white
because red has tannins.

130
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:54,108
Now there are 150 people out there,
half of them Kennedys, waiting for you.

131
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,944
Waiting to applaud you.
To applaud the great Starina.

132
00:09:58,289 --> 00:09:59,620
Tannins!

133
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,055
-What do you do while l'm onstage?
-Nothing. l lie here.

134
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:08,224
Where do you go while l'm killing
myself onstage? l know that look.

135
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,794
Go ahead, hit me.
Go on.

136
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:13,797
That's what you want to do.
Do it. Hit me.

137
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,802
Go on, hit me.

138
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:46,825
Ladies and gentlemen...

139
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,169
the one, the only...

140
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,502
the incomparable Starina.

141
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:34,882
Thank you
and welcome to The Birdcage.

142
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,052
As you see, l've just gotten back
from safari. l picked up a new muff.

143
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,820
Look, it comes with accessories.

144
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:49,396
Don't look at me like that.
l didn't kill him.

145
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,567
He died and left me everything.

146
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:58,474
Where are the adorable couple
celebrating their anniversary?

147
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,408
Mon congrats, you sweeties.

148
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,244
l may have something
to celebrate myself very soon.

149
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,351
l think l have found the one.

150
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:12,982
Yes.

151
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,592
You know l hate to brag, but...

152
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:20,920
l know this grocery clerk

153
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,764
Unprepossessing

154
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,431
Some think the boy's a jerk

155
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,289
Excuse me.

156
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:53,122
Hello.
What do you think?

157
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:55,455
You look like Lucy's stunt double.

158
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,793
l'm a combination
of Lucy and Ricky.

159
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,439
And it's terrifying. Get out
the white wine and an ice bucket...

160
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,907
chill two glasses
and take the night off.

161
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:09,139
Why do you talk to me
like l'm your servant?

162
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,574
Because you're
our faithful houseman. Go!

163
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,478
My father was the shaman
of his tribe. Okay?

164
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,151
My mother was
the high priestess.

165
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:19,516
Then why the hell did
they move to New Jersey?

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,356
l don't know. They were stupid.
They want me to have a career.

167
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:28,091
Hello? A career? When will you
let me audition for you again?

168
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:32,428
When you have talent. Take that wig off,
or l'll tell Albert you wore it.

169
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:37,001
You do that, l'll tell him you're
seeing someone while he's onstage.

170
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,175
l have two words for you:
green card.

171
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,442
Now go! And leave
the front door unlocked.

172
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:46,172
You're such a beast to everybody.

173
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,841
Come on, Gloria.

174
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:34,895
You keep getting better looking.

175
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,657
Thank you.
So do you.

176
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:39,893
Oh, no. Really?

177
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,233
l feel bloated.

178
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,407
-You think l look good?
-You look great.

179
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,009
That's very sweet.

180
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,080
l'm glad you cut your hair.

181
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,582
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

182
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,845
Something to drink?

183
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,924
-Beer, if you have it.
-l do not. Talk about bloat.

184
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,089
White wine.

185
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,419
Swell.

186
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:11,360
-How long has Albert been on?
-He just went on.

187
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,261
l gave Agador the night off.

188
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,606
So we're all alone.

189
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,767
As requested.

190
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,108
Since when do you like beer?

191
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:29,282
l have something to tell you.

192
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,453
But l don't want you to get
how you get.

193
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:34,556
Oh, God.

194
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,388
l'm getting married.

195
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,295
l didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

196
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,635
lt's a girl.
l met her at school.

197
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:52,306
lt's wonderful...
Are you upset?

198
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,304
Let me tell you why.

199
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,470
First, you're only twenty.

200
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,806
Pop, l know, l'm young.

201
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,985
But you've always said l was
a very levelheaded guy. And l am.

202
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,920
l have job offers. l know what l want.
And l have an incredible role model.

203
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,491
-Oh, please.
-lt's true.

204
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,322
l'm the only guy l know
who isn't from a broken home.

205
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,657
Stop flattering me.
lt's cheap.

206
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,270
ls it all right, Dad?

207
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,235
Does it matter?

208
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,932
Of course it does.

209
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:30,669
Say it's okay, before Albert arrives
and starts screaming.

210
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:34,010
l can't.
And l won't.

211
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,779
This is too crazy.

212
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,353
You do this, you're on your own.
Got that, sport?

213
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,454
Don't come back.
Don't ask me for anything.

214
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,354
-l want nothing to do with it.
-Okay.

215
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,289
-lf that's how you feel.
-l do.

216
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,862
-Fine. Good-bye, Pop.
-Good-bye, Son.

217
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,193
You called my bluff.

218
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,636
lt was good.

219
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:56,695
-Really?
-Not bad.

220
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:58,605
l backed off a little bit.

221
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:00,635
Tell me it's all right.

222
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:07,214
lt's all right. l always dreamed
you would. Just not so soon.

223
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:11,047
Come on. Drop your bags.
Stay a while.

224
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,058
Let's drink a toast
to this catastrophe.

225
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:19,218
l'm kidding.

226
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,561
lt's all right.

227
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,063
What's the young lady's name?

228
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:25,628
Barbara.

229
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,796
Are you crazy?
lt's out of the question.

230
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,862
Married?
You're not even 18!

231
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,704
Who is this boy, Barbie?
When did you last see him?

232
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,266
Please, don't call me Barbie.

233
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,508
This afternoon at 2:00. We've been
sleeping together for a year.

234
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,414
Oh, God!
Has he been tested?

235
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:42,141
Oh, Kevin!

236
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,243
Yes, and so have l.

237
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,485
This has to wait until after
the election. l can't deal with this.

238
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:53,530
Where does the young man come from,
Barbie...ra? Who is his father?

239
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:58,659
His father is in the arts.
He's on the Council of Cultural Arts.

240
00:17:58,736 --> 00:17:59,725
Really?

241
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,498
Did they fund
the Mapplethorpe exhibit?

242
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:06,271
No! Goodness, no.
He's a cultural attaché to Greece.

243
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:07,937
Really?

244
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,602
What the hell is that?

245
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:15,547
That's kind of a diplomatic post.
lt's sort of an ambassador.

246
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:17,447
What does the mother do?

247
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,378
She's a housewife.

248
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,289
That's really refreshing.
lsn't it, Kevin?

249
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,720
l can't talk about this now.

250
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,458
-Hello?
-You okay?

251
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,457
Yes.
l just told them.

252
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,134
Me too.
And my father is...

253
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:38,464
very excited. He's raising
his glass to toast us right now.

254
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,972
l'm going to put him on.
Yes. Take it.

255
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,215
-You said his parents were in Greece.
-Dad, get off the phone!

256
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,409
Take it.

257
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:48,982
Hello, Barbara.

258
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,743
To your future.

259
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,222
Shit! No, dear,
that was not my toast.

260
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,486
l just broke my glass.
l'm sorry.

261
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:57,987
That's okay.

262
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,322
lt was nice talking to you.
We'll talk again soon.

263
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,997
How dare you eavesdrop!

264
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,701
You said his parents were
in Greece.

265
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,604
You saw this boy at 2:00 today,
and now he's in Greece with his parents?

266
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,835
No.

267
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:15,834
Greece?

268
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,611
They're back for the winter.

269
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,581
They're at their home
in South Beach.

270
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,816
ls that like Palm Beach?

271
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:28,352
lt's close. lt's about two minutes
from where Jeb Bush lives.

272
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,357
Really?

273
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:49,672
Aha!

274
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:51,544
-Wait.
-Who is he?

275
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,106
Who?
Where's your little chippie?

276
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:57,178
Will you stop screaming?
lt's Val.

277
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,315
Val?

278
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:02,786
He's asleep in his room
if you don't believe me.

279
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:07,226
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:08,791
Surprise.

281
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,906
Good morning!

282
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,345
What beautiful flowers.

283
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,244
Good morning, Albert.

284
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:07,918
We have nice, fresh lobster
this morning, Albert.

285
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:13,760
No, thank you, Mr. Lopez.
Not today. The piglet is home.

286
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,029
You want the cake delivered?

287
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,035
Yes, please. And remember to write
'To my Piglet, from his Auntie' on it.

288
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:22,435
You got it.

289
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:26,374
Thank you, Mr. Boynton.
l want to get back before he wakes up.

290
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,601
l'll just try this sample.

291
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:30,607
Chocolate schnecken.

292
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:36,112
A triumph.
Well, bye-bye.

293
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,012
Perhaps one more schnecken
for the road. Do you mind?

294
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,320
When the schnecken beckons...

295
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,622
-Good morning.
-Not yet.

296
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,628
What is this, sludge?

297
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:55,133
Yes. l thought it would make
a nice change from coffee.

298
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,965
Why didn't you say Val was coming,
you bad man?

299
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,800
l would not have been
so sassy to you.

300
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:04,136
Will you put some clothes on?

301
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:06,905
Why don't you let me
be in the show?

302
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,584
Are you afraid
of my Guatemalanness?

303
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:10,984
Your what?

304
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,488
My Guatemalanness.
My natural heat.

305
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,990
You're afraid l'm too primitive, right?
To be on the stage...

306
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,755
with your little,
estrogen Rockettes.

307
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,161
You're right.
l'm afraid of your heat.

308
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,762
Here l am.

309
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,992
The bag lady.
Good morning, Agador.

310
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:29,737
Wash those, will you?
They're delivering the rest at noon.

311
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,968
Good morning.

312
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:34,503
My God, that beard!

313
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,473
-Here you go.
-Thank you, dear.

314
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:43,009
Turkish coffee.
Delicious.

315
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:44,447
See?

316
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:46,619
ls Val still asleep?

317
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,024
He must be exhausted, poor baby.
You should have told me he was coming.

318
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:55,354
l'm so ashamed of how l acted.
But how could l know?

319
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,962
The truth is, you can't stand
sharing your son with me.

320
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:00,970
You're always pushing me away.

321
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,032
Oh, will you look at this shirt?
lt's a rag!

322
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:10,210
No matter how many shirts l send him,
he only wears this one.

323
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:13,038
You look awful.
What's wrong?

324
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:14,714
Val's getting married.

325
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,649
Don't be silly.
l got pork roast for dinner.

326
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:21,881
l wanted to get filet mignon,
but it's so expensive.

327
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:24,557
What do you mean, married?

328
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,459
You know what l mean.

329
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:29,663
-l don't understand.
-Yes, you do.

330
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,396
To some girl he met at school.

331
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:37,730
Oh, no!
Oh, but...

332
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,072
he's just a baby.
He'll ruin his life!

333
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:44,678
We've been through all that, okay?

334
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:47,439
Bottom line is he's getting married,
no matter what we say.

335
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:49,678
So the less said, the better.

336
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,744
Oh, my God.

337
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:56,418
l woke up feeling so good.

338
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,592
Now, all of a sudden, l feel...

339
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,421
so funny.

340
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,424
Let it go.
Breathe.

341
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,259
Oh, you've heard.

342
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:12,035
Oh, Vallie! Oh, my God,
this is such a shock.

343
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:15,267
l'm not saying anything.
l promised your father.

344
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,045
But at 20, if you throw yourself away
on some dormitory slut...

345
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:22,483
you'll be sorry the rest
of your life. There!

346
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:25,020
That's all. No more.
Subject closed.

347
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:29,115
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a kiss!

348
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:32,726
Or are you
too grown-up for that now?

349
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:35,287
Hello, Albie.

350
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,293
Our baby is going to leave us.
And we won't have any others.

351
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,232
Not without a miracle.

352
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:48,578
When l and Senator Keeley founded
the Coalition for Moral Order...

353
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:52,979
it was to express moral,
rather than political, views.

354
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,076
What Senator Jackson is trying
to say is that...

355
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:58,087
morality is political.

356
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,983
Abortion, same-sex marriage...

357
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:02,985
lt's a wonderful show.

358
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:05,487
lt's the most intelligent show
on television.

359
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,723
...pornography would not exist...

360
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,266
if politicians didn't make laws
to protect them.

361
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,500
That's why both houses
are now Republican.

362
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,803
Bravo.
lt's the perfect platform.

363
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:21,702
Yes, l'm so glad l got on
Jackson's bandwagon instead of Dole.

364
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:23,268
Dole is just too...

365
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:24,335
Dark.

366
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:27,014
l was going to say liberal,
but he's dark too.

367
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,145
l have to fire this woman.

368
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,684
This young man
Barbie wants to marry...

369
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:33,853
Miss Porter, page two...

370
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:36,785
paragraph two.
lt's 'porno,' not 'pronto.'

371
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:41,964
...l wonder if he's old money.
l mean, a cultural attaché.

372
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:46,358
Your campaign manager is calling.
He says he has to talk to you.

373
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,034
Thank you, Bridget.

374
00:25:58,482 --> 00:25:59,813
Hello, Ben.

375
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,874
Ready for what?

376
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:05,376
What?

377
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:07,053
What's wrong, Kevin?

378
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,552
Jackson's dead.

379
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:09,814
Oh, my God.

380
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,722
He died in bed?
Whose bed?

381
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:14,727
A prostitute?

382
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,561
A minor?
And black?

383
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,733
l don't believe this. l don't fucking
believe this! l'm ruined!

384
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:28,842
You cannot be held responsible
for Senator Jackson's private life.

385
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,742
l'm the vice president
of the Coalition for Moral Order.

386
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:36,850
My co-founder just died in the bed
of an underage black whore!

387
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,521
Wait until the media finds out!

388
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:40,578
Bridget!

389
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:43,419
l could really use some candy!

390
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,354
You want one of these?

391
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,093
Oh, this.

392
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,760
My baby.

393
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:53,763
Why does it seem...

394
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:57,266
so real to me...

395
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,940
Albert, you're driving me crazy.

396
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:05,613
l know, but...

397
00:27:09,953 --> 00:27:12,285
Track-and-field award.

398
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,952
There's the bar mitzvah.

399
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:21,954
Time passes so quickly.

400
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:26,963
Well, he looked kind of funny,
but he was smiling, so l didn't worry.

401
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,301
How do they get them on so quickly?

402
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:31,131
They pay.

403
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:33,571
They're not mentioning you much.

404
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,075
lt's early.

405
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,812
Senator Jackson's last words.
Tonight, on 'lnside Edition.'

406
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,478
Can you get a shot of the house?

407
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,482
We may not make the live shot.
lf we must, l'll do a stand-up.

408
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:47,916
'He looked kind of funny...

409
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:50,752
but he was smiling,
so l didn't worry.'

410
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:55,996
Yeah, we got a good spot.
l don't know if he's going to--

411
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,324
Why don't you set up there?

412
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,392
Figure you'll get part
of the house in the--

413
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:03,496
l don't know if he'll come out.

414
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:09,267
Where's Dad?

415
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,843
He snuck out to meet with his advisors.
They refused to come here.

416
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:17,018
l never should have let him go.
How will he get back in?

417
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,955
Mom, l have something to tell you
about Val's parents.

418
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,521
They can't blame us for this.

419
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,530
Eli Jackson was a common redneck.
We never saw him socially.

420
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:38,638
They can understand that, can't they?
Thank goodness they're not snobs.

421
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,479
What are you doing here?

422
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,655
l came through the orchard,
over the barn.

423
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,324
lt's so dangerous.
You could have fallen.

424
00:28:56,393 --> 00:29:00,887
l did! l'm a wreck.
This thing is all anyone can talk about.

425
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,564
Kevin?
There may be a solution.

426
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:08,167
What, death?
lt didn't work for Jackson.

427
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:12,739
What about a wedding?
A big, white wedding.

428
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:15,909
What wedding?
Who's getting married?

429
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:17,736
No, no!

430
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:21,177
Why not?
lt would restore your image.

431
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:23,249
A wedding is hope.

432
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,256
And a white wedding is
family and morality and tradition.

433
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,622
And it would be
such a special marriage.

434
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:33,925
The son of a cultural attaché,
a sort of diplomat, really...

435
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:38,428
who doesn't look down on us
because of Senator Jackson.

436
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,568
Who's willing to join our family.

437
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:43,629
There's the cover of 'People'
and 'Time' and 'Newsweek.'

438
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:47,270
Love and optimism versus
cynicism and sex!

439
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,335
lt would be an affirmation!

440
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,245
lf necessary, we'll get
the Pope's blessing. lt's not hard.

441
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:57,446
No, he's too controversial.
What about Billy Graham?

442
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,814
He's too liberal.

443
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:01,784
-Where's the candy?
-You've had enough candy.

444
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,549
This boy--
What's his father's name?

445
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:06,225
Armand...

446
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,585
Coleman.

447
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:11,297
l wonder if they're related
to Tish and Bobo Coleman.

448
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:14,036
-Are they from Boston?
-l don't think so.

449
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:16,498
l think we should go
to South Beach immediately.

450
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:17,904
We should have dinner--

451
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:22,740
We'll have dinner with them
and stay with the Bushes.

452
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:28,140
Mr. and Mrs. Armand Coleman
of Greece and South Beach.

453
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:50,166
What is this dream l see

454
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:55,505
Why does it seem so real

455
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:57,506
To me

456
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:02,511
What if this dream turns out to be

457
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:06,186
More than a dream

458
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,180
Fairy dust, fairy dust, fairy dust.

459
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:15,695
Come, little dream, and play

460
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,194
Don't be afraid

461
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:21,868
Don't fade away

462
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,866
Quick, little dream

463
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,699
Before you're gone

464
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:30,376
Let's get it on

465
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:35,047
l saw that.

466
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:38,477
Well, this is impossible.
Either l'm an artist...

467
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:42,079
or l'm just some cheap drag queen
trying to get laughs.

468
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:43,648
Let's just get through it.

469
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:46,991
l have to understand
every nuance of a song.

470
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:50,055
l have to give my all.
Everyone else can just 'get through it.'

471
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:51,930
He's chewing gum.

472
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,491
Chewing gum helps me think.

473
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,567
You're wasting your gum.

474
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,831
Let's keep going.
And no more talking. From anyone.

475
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:00,341
-l need to talk to you.
-Sit.

476
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:02,841
-lt's important.
-Quiet. He's rehearsing.

477
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,574
Each night anew

478
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:14,587
Tell me, my dream

479
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:17,256
Are you a dreamer too

480
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,950
What is it?

481
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:22,862
-Can you come upstairs with me?
-No, not right now.

482
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:29,428
Did you see what he just did?
Hello, Vallie, darling.

483
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:35,100
He blew a bubble while l was singing.
He can't do that while l'm singing!

484
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:37,106
This may be a drag show...

485
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:41,042
but it should be a good drag show.
lf possible, a great one.

486
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:42,982
Just because you're 22 and hung--

487
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:44,383
l'll do this, Albert.

488
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:46,384
-You're the director.
-Thank you.

489
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:50,048
This is a complex number,
full of mythic themes.

490
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:52,955
The woman who is singing
invented you.

491
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:56,125
You are her fantasy.
Suddenly, you...

492
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,302
the fantasy, see her, your inventor,
and she becomes your fantasy.

493
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,707
-l don't get it.
-Try more gum.

494
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,140
-Albert.
-l hear you.

495
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,902
Thank you.
l know you do.

496
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:12,808
Celsius,
let's start with the premise...

497
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:16,574
that when you see this stunning,
smoldering creature...

498
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:20,482
she transcends your desire to chew.
She electrifies you!

499
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:24,090
Something starts in your pelvis
and goes to your heart...

500
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,818
where it becomes
heart-slash-pelvis.

501
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:28,824
Yes?
Coming!

502
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,759
What do l do?
Stand here like an object?

503
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:34,834
You do an eclectic celebration
of the dance!

504
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:39,336
You do Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! Or Martha
Graham, Martha Graham, Martha Graham!

505
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:44,273
Or Twyla, Twyla, Twyla! Or Michael
Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd!

506
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:48,348
Or Madonna, Madonna, Madonna!
But you keep it all inside.

507
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:53,019
Work on that. l'll be right back.
lt's looking wonderful.

508
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:55,454
Barbara's coming with her parents.

509
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,516
-When?
-Tomorrow.

510
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,125
That's plenty of time.

511
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:02,695
No, there's more.
There's a lot more.

512
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:07,692
Wine?

513
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:12,203
No. Let's hear it.
l have to get back to rehearsal.

514
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:19,208
Barbara's father is a senator,
a conservative senator.

515
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:23,816
He's running for reelection.
And she told him...

516
00:34:26,556 --> 00:34:30,390
you're the cultural attaché
to Greece, and Albert is a housewife.

517
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,024
What?

518
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:36,729
She had to. He founded
the Coalition for Moral Order.

519
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,999
l don't care.
l don't want to be someone else.

520
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:41,567
Do you want me to be?

521
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,831
No, no. Of course not.
And neither does she. But...

522
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,570
Dad, he's Kevin Keeley.

523
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,572
Who's Kevin Keeley?

524
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:53,014
Do you read the newspaper?

525
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:57,242
Of course. 'Variety,' the Arts
and Leisure section of the 'Times'...

526
00:34:57,587 --> 00:35:00,920
What don't l know?
Are you marrying some Nazi?

527
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,092
No. He's conservative,
like half of America is conservative.

528
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,419
And l'm marrying her, not him.

529
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,031
-l need your help.
-Not for this.

530
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,255
You've done it before.

531
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,762
Lied about who l am?
Never.

532
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:16,767
When l started Edison Park,
remember what you said?

533
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:21,941
You said if Miss Donovan asked,
l should say you were a businessman.

534
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,977
You were a baby,
and she was a small-minded idiot.

535
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,710
l didn't want you to get hurt.

536
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:30,442
lt's different now.
You're a man.

537
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:32,614
l can still get hurt.

538
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:38,125
lt would mean everything to me
if you would help us.

539
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,053
lt's just for one night.

540
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,393
This is insane.
What do l do, close the club...

541
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:49,071
so l can pretend to be
a cultural attaché? Whatever that is.

542
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:53,298
And what about Albert? How do you
make Albert into a housewife?

543
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,736
Well, you'd have to send him away.

544
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:57,468
You try sending Albert away.

545
00:35:57,747 --> 00:36:02,582
We'd never get him past the Keeleys.
Dad, we have to get rid of a few things.

546
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,650
What things?

547
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,649
Well, that, for example.

548
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,322
Neptune?
That's a classic.

549
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,651
And this.

550
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,826
The Kirby?
That's art!

551
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,995
And how about that?

552
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,504
That better?

553
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:41,179
Look, it's not just one
or two things, okay? lt's everything.

554
00:36:41,524 --> 00:36:44,857
We're going to have
to tone this down a little.

555
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:47,961
Just make it a bit more
like other people's homes.

556
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:50,888
l see.
So we need a total redecoration...

557
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,299
so we can be
more like other people.

558
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:56,702
And you're going to
have to try to...

559
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,703
...you know--
change your mannerisms a little.

560
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:04,535
-What are you saying?
-Just be a little less obvious.

561
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,542
l'm obvious.

562
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:21,552
l just had the walls
sponge painted, Val.

563
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:28,497
You better come downstairs.
She's trying to take his gum away.

564
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:32,238
l'll be right down.

565
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:40,071
Yes, l wear foundation.
Yes, l live with a man.

566
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:42,908
Yes, l'm a middle-aged fag.

567
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,353
But l know who l am, Val.
lt took me 20 years to get here.

568
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,354
l won't let some idiot senator
destroy that.

569
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:53,687
Fuck the senator.
l don't give a damn what he thinks.

570
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,104
Still outside the home of
Senator Kevin Keeley...

571
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:04,368
Still outside the home of
Senator Kevin Keeley...

572
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,772
the co-founder of
the Coalition for Moral Order...

573
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,706
...waiting for Senator Jackson's
colleague, Senator Kevin Keeley.

574
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:15,615
At this point, we don't know
if the senator is at home...

575
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:20,687
Earlier reports placed him
at the home of Senator Robert Dole.

576
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:23,753
We're here at what
they're calling Camp Keeley...

577
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:26,226
waiting for the senator
to put in an appearance.

578
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:29,924
The senator was co-founder
of the Coalition for Moral Order...

579
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,126
with Senator Eli Jackson.

580
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:36,461
The senator has been besieged here,
outside his palatial estate...

581
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:39,004
by a virtual army of media,
waiting for...

582
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:42,044
some comment
on the unfortunate events of late.

583
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:49,707
Where you driving him?

584
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,051
South Beach, Florida.

585
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:01,822
Folks, there have been a lot
of tasteless jokes going around...

586
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,498
about the death of Senator Jackson.

587
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:05,990
And here's another one.

588
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:11,730
Join Jay on 'The Tonight Show'
with guests Yasser Arafat and Kate Moss.

589
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:13,564
This is unbearable.

590
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,417
Kevin, no!

591
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:28,918
l'm going down the ladder.
l can't face the press.

592
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:31,853
Have the chauffeur
pick me up by the orchard.

593
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:34,426
No! l don't want to go
out there alone!

594
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:38,690
Barbara will be with you.
lt's not you they're after.

595
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:41,267
Daddy!

596
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,099
l'm going down the back way.

597
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,768
What about your announcing
Barbara's wedding to the Coleman boy?

598
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:51,207
Not before we meet them.
What if they change their mind?

599
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,881
Let go of me.
l'll meet you in the car.

600
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,953
-He's leaving his home.
-Senator Keeley!

601
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:07,388
Senator, will this cost you votes?

602
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,962
What's the future
of the Coalition?

603
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,064
What about the rumors
Senator Jackson was on lithium?

604
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,966
Uh, gentlemen...and ladies...

605
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:21,242
l am, as are all my colleagues...

606
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:26,308
Republican and Democrat,
liberal and conservative alike...

607
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:30,141
stunned and saddened
by the circumstances surrounding...

608
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:34,651
the death of Senator Jackson,
as well as the death itself.

609
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,152
My family and l...

610
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:42,328
are leaving town for a few days, uh,
for reasons that l cannot, uh...

611
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,099
To, um, plan an event.

612
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,333
An event which...

613
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:49,498
l cannot, uh...

614
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,171
Which may perhaps heal some of the...

615
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:55,103
bad, uh, things, that...

616
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:59,178
Senator Jackson's demise
has made us all...

617
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,608
feel.

618
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:03,117
Where are you going, Senator?

619
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:07,686
Where? To our farm. That's all
l'm going to say at this time.

620
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,686
-Did you know the girl?
-Where is the farm?

621
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,413
Agador?
Goddamn it.

622
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,081
What did l do?

623
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:13,344
We're redoing the apartment
for tomorrow night. Goddamn it.

624
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:16,422
This is for the in-laws, right?

625
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:21,093
Right. We have to get rid
of everything that's over the top.

626
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:23,925
That's a lot.

627
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:27,429
You'll have to get a uniform
and dress like a butler.

628
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,034
No.
l'll look like a fag.

629
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:32,433
But you'll look like
a fag in a uniform.

630
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,539
'Don't ask, don't tell.'

631
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:38,042
Start tomorrow morning.
l'll get Albert out early.

632
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:39,775
Where will l get a uniform?

633
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,044
l'll say, 'Albert, you must go
for a few days.'

634
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:43,273
Ay, Dio.

635
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:44,883
lt'll be hard.

636
00:42:45,054 --> 00:42:46,954
l got so much to do.

637
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,017
Pop.

638
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:53,058
Thank you.

639
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:57,292
Do me a favor, Val.
Don't talk to me for a while.

640
00:43:11,814 --> 00:43:14,146
Kevin, please,
let's charter a plane.

641
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,976
No!
We can't get out of the car.

642
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,543
The second we get out of the car,
we'll be spotted.

643
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:42,504
How l love the sun.

644
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:44,836
Yes, it's glorious, isn't it?

645
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:50,175
You know, you could use some more sun.
Take a few days off. You look tired.

646
00:43:51,687 --> 00:43:53,018
What do you mean?

647
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:54,682
Nothing.

648
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,861
Don't kill yourselves
with this thing.

649
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,634
Who put 'Playboy'
in the bathroom?

650
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:13,538
Leave it.
lt's what they read.

651
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:17,478
Don't add.
Just subtract.

652
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:21,706
Please hurry. This place has
to look respectable by six.

653
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:23,712
Cyril, that's too short.

654
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:27,478
l want that nice Armani break
in the front.

655
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:32,391
But don't just pull it. Do it
down there. l got high-waters here.

656
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,161
That's it.

657
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:40,061
-But you must have meant something.
-l meant you looked tired.

658
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:43,499
Tired means old. 'You look tired'
means you look old.

659
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,900
'You look rested'
means you had collagen.

660
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:48,837
You look wonderful.
Let's go shopping.

661
00:44:49,078 --> 00:44:50,841
No, l want to go home.

662
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,072
On a day like this?
l'll buy you anything you want.

663
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:57,078
Anything?
l'll have to change my shoes.

664
00:44:57,353 --> 00:44:58,752
-l'll buy you some.
-l need peds.

665
00:44:59,021 --> 00:45:04,015
-l'll buy you sandals.
-What's going on? Why can't we go home?

666
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:06,917
Nothing.
Nothing.

667
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:09,520
Then l'll see you upstairs.

668
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:11,930
What?

669
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:14,259
-l hurt my thing.
-Your what?

670
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:17,936
My ankle. l don't think
l can make it upstairs.

671
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,032
Wait here.
l'll bring down some ice.

672
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:21,235
No, no!

673
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:23,775
Why not?
Oh, my arm!

674
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:27,378
My arm.
l hate it when you get hysterical.

675
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:28,780
Don't leave me!

676
00:45:32,288 --> 00:45:33,448
What is that?

677
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,453
l got it from the antique store
next door. Too butch?

678
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:39,954
Don't add.

679
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:42,287
You're blocking my way.

680
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,623
Put the moose on the patio.

681
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:48,968
Don't be such a baby.
Be careful!

682
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:50,294
l can't move any faster.

683
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:51,903
Lean on me.

684
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,472
l need a doctor.

685
00:45:53,742 --> 00:45:56,074
Don't be silly.
lt isn't even swollen.

686
00:45:56,312 --> 00:45:58,644
We should go to the emergency room.

687
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:03,817
You're overreacting. Don't be
such a baby. Just sit down on...

688
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:08,979
We've been robbed.

689
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:13,659
Albie, no.
l've just taken a few things out.

690
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,090
They'll be returned
by the time you're back.

691
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:18,830
Back?

692
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:21,700
Where am l going?

693
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:25,003
You didn't tell him.

694
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:28,174
What?
Tell me what?

695
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:34,171
Val's fiancée is coming tonight
with her parents.

696
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:36,507
We thought it would...

697
00:46:37,953 --> 00:46:40,114
be better if you weren't here.

698
00:46:49,198 --> 00:46:50,529
l see.

699
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,762
l see.

700
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:57,032
lt's just for tonight.

701
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,472
l understand.
Just while people are here.

702
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:02,006
lt's all right, my darling.

703
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:05,203
lt's nothing.
lt's painful...

704
00:47:06,548 --> 00:47:08,539
but it's not important.

705
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:11,642
l'm leaving.

706
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,381
lt's just one night, Albert.

707
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:15,379
The monster...

708
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:19,717
the freak is leaving.

709
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:22,887
You're safe.

710
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:34,565
That went well.

711
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,141
Albert!

712
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,109
Will you listen?

713
00:47:45,187 --> 00:47:49,521
Go away. l hate you!
l never want to see you again.

714
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,590
My heart is breaking.

715
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,753
Please, don't cry.
lt's okay. You can stay.

716
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:58,259
l won't stay
where l'm not wanted.

717
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:01,697
Where l can be thrown out
on a whim without legal rights.

718
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:03,427
l have the palimony papers.

719
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:06,538
You're lying again.
This is too much for me.

720
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,767
Too much ugliness.
Too much pain.

721
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:12,444
Feel my pulse.
Am l all right?

722
00:48:12,781 --> 00:48:17,115
My goodness, it's very fast.
Let's get you out of the sun.

723
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:29,454
-Waiter! Water.
-Right away.

724
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:31,892
lt's the end.
l know it is.

725
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:34,125
No, it isn't.
Just breathe.

726
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:36,964
Thank you, Rodrigo.
And the usual.

727
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,968
Right away, Señor Goldman.

728
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:40,969
There you go.

729
00:48:41,477 --> 00:48:43,468
Thank you.
That's better.

730
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:49,815
This is not about you.
The girl's parents are assholes.

731
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:51,575
Val is crazy about you.

732
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,811
ls he?
Oh, that helps.

733
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:56,818
Oh, you're so sweet.

734
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:59,984
That water is so cool.

735
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:05,490
Maybe it is a bit much to introduce me
as his mother on the first visit.

736
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:09,001
Could you say
l was a visiting relative?

737
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:11,000
Val's uncle?
Uncle Al?

738
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,337
What's the point?
To be Val's gay uncle?

739
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:15,270
l could play it straight.

740
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:18,674
Oh, please.
Look at you, at how you hold your glass.

741
00:49:18,947 --> 00:49:20,938
Look at your pinky, your posture.

742
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:25,847
What about you? You're obviously
not a cultural... whatever it is.

743
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:28,679
You've never been to a museum,
and you eat like a pig.

744
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:33,791
These conservatives don't care
if you're a pig, just if you're a fag.

745
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:45,203
Oh, fuck them.
Of course you can pass as an uncle.

746
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:47,873
You're a great performer.
l'm a great director.

747
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:49,804
Together we can do anything.

748
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:51,376
Oh, Armand.
Really?

749
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:54,309
Absolutely.
We've got five hours.

750
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,883
First, get your pinky down.
lt's up again.

751
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,651
And your posture.

752
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:04,056
My God! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

753
00:50:04,393 --> 00:50:05,724
Stop screaming!

754
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:08,052
l'm teaching you to act like a man.

755
00:50:08,497 --> 00:50:10,488
All right, all right.

756
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,565
lt's a dinner party.
Let's work with food.

757
00:50:14,903 --> 00:50:16,996
Spread some mustard on the toast.

758
00:50:19,408 --> 00:50:22,741
Don't use the spoon.
And don't dribble dots of mustard.

759
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:24,906
You take your knife...

760
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:29,073
and you smear.
Men smear.

761
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:31,750
Smear. Yeah.

762
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:40,084
Get the goddamn pinky down! Make your
fingers like iron. Stop trembling!

763
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:42,694
Hold the knife boldly, with strength.

764
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:45,422
Oh, God!
l pierced the toast!

765
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:50,261
So what? Just remember not
to go to pieces when that happens.

766
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:52,767
React like a man, calmly.

767
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:58,035
You say to yourself, 'Albert, you
pierced the toast. So what?'

768
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,612
lt's not the end of your life.

769
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:04,942
'Albert, you pierced the toast.
So what?'

770
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:08,387
Of course.
There's no need to get hysterical.

771
00:51:08,624 --> 00:51:11,286
All l have to remember is,
l can always get more toast.

772
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:14,118
That's the spirit.
Let's try walking.

773
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:18,122
-Holding the sandwich?
-lt doesn't matter. Just walk.

774
00:51:19,968 --> 00:51:21,299
Down!

775
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:45,924
Too swishy?

776
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:49,657
Let me give you an image.

777
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:53,490
lt's a cliché, but it's an image:
John Wayne.

778
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:56,326
Couldn't we start
with someone easier?

779
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:58,333
Come on.
You're a big fan.

780
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,608
He has a very distinctive walk.

781
00:52:00,842 --> 00:52:05,006
Very easy to imitate.
And if anyone was a man... Now try it.

782
00:52:05,347 --> 00:52:09,010
Now just get off your horse
and head into the saloon.

783
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:14,352
Nice touch.

784
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:31,369
Howdy, ma'am.

785
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:40,212
No good?

786
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:45,649
Actually, it's perfect. l never
realized John Wayne walked like that.

787
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:03,896
Hang on.

788
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,571
This guy's a fucking maniac.

789
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:13,837
What's in South Beach?

790
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,413
Armand Goldman,
you old so-and-so.

791
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:20,244
How about those Dolphins?

792
00:53:22,457 --> 00:53:23,856
Screaming queen?

793
00:53:24,593 --> 00:53:27,391
Stick your hand out sideways,
not palm down.

794
00:53:27,462 --> 00:53:29,589
-l'm going to shake it, not kiss it.
-Right.

795
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,097
And tighten your wrist.

796
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,158
No, straighten it,
then tighten it.

797
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,298
Al, you old so-and-so.

798
00:53:37,372 --> 00:53:39,033
-l just said that.
-Now l'm saying it.

799
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:41,936
Okay.
Straighten, tighten.

800
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:53,114
Al, you old son of a bitch!
How do you feel about that call today?

801
00:53:53,388 --> 00:53:58,121
The Dolphins, in the fourth on their
30-yard line with only 34 seconds to go.

802
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,793
How do you think l feel?
Betrayed. Bewildered.

803
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,262
Wrong response?

804
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,891
l'm not sure.
Take it from the top.

805
00:54:08,136 --> 00:54:09,467
This is very exciting.

806
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:12,070
-lt is, fella.
-Right on, amigo!

807
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:14,639
-Damn straight.
-Damn straight!

808
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:18,476
-Fuckin' a!
-Fuckin' a, right!

809
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:21,813
Swing that by me again,
little buddy.

810
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,640
l'm terribly sorry.

811
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,379
Take it easy.

812
00:54:25,453 --> 00:54:27,284
You take it easy, pilgrim.

813
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:30,415
-He bumped into me.
-Tough gazongas.

814
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:32,323
Why are you being a prick?

815
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,487
Why are you being an asshole?

816
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:41,594
Are you calling me an asshole?

817
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:45,170
Actually, l'm talking
to the asshole behind you.

818
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:52,007
See, the swelling's already gone down.
lt's nothing.

819
00:54:52,347 --> 00:54:56,181
You were magnificent, marvelous,
very masculine.

820
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:57,849
l'm so proud of you.

821
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:00,451
That big gorilla looked ridiculous
when he sat on you...

822
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:04,117
and banged your head on the ground.
He didn't even know how to box.

823
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:06,683
Thank you, Vallie.
You're a dear.

824
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:11,530
l'll get you some more ice.
Be right back, love.

825
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,034
Dad, could we hire a straight maid
for tonight?

826
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:25,869
There are no straight maids
in South Beach.

827
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:29,376
And l have more bad news for you.

828
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:31,481
l told Albert he could stay.

829
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:35,212
You did what?
Why?

830
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,682
Why? Because he told me
his heart was breaking...

831
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,058
and he's my friend and companion.

832
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:43,561
Who will we say he is?

833
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,997
Your uncle.

834
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,564
My uncle?

835
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:49,393
Let's just forget the whole thing.

836
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:53,664
Don't be so negative!
Have a little hope!

837
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:57,902
About what? Once they see you
and Albert together...

838
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,914
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
l was feeling so good, and now...

839
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:05,079
God, what a mess.

840
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:07,444
What we really need is a woman.

841
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:10,514
We could get away with Albert as
an uncle if we had a woman as a mother.

842
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:13,254
lronic, isn't it?
When you need a woman...

843
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:17,254
Why don't l ask your mother?

844
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,261
My mother wouldn't do it.
Would she?

845
00:56:20,468 --> 00:56:21,799
How do we know?

846
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,862
Because she hasn't seen me in 20 years.
That's a good indication.

847
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,274
No, 20 years ago she was a young girl--
scared, broke, but now...

848
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:31,876
You can't be serious!

849
00:56:32,781 --> 00:56:36,774
lt's very unfair of you
to try to talk Val into this. He--

850
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:38,383
She'd do it?

851
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:42,045
My mother?

852
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:46,621
Oh, my God.
Armand?

853
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:50,797
l don't believe it. lt's been
a hundred years. Where are you?

854
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:52,897
l'll be there in 5 minutes.

855
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:54,963
l can hardly wait.

856
00:56:55,303 --> 00:56:57,464
Me too.
Bye-bye.

857
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:00,907
She's going to see me.

858
00:57:01,977 --> 00:57:04,639
Why don't l drop you off
at a café?

859
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,814
No, l'll come up with you.
l'm sure there's a waiting room.

860
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,593
Katharine Archer, please.
lt's Armand Goldman.

861
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:27,424
Go right in.

862
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:35,770
Just sit down.

863
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:37,938
Excuse us.

864
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:44,615
Army Goldman.

865
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:47,548
Katie Archer.
Or is it Mrs. something?

866
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:51,452
No. l'm between husbands.
Sit down.

867
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:56,787
l've thought about you
so many times.

868
00:57:57,132 --> 00:58:01,068
Whenever l saw an ad for The Birdcage.
Are you still with Albert?

869
00:58:01,302 --> 00:58:03,634
Yes, we're still together.

870
00:58:03,972 --> 00:58:05,132
And you...

871
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:07,296
you've done well.

872
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:11,140
Because of you. The money
you gave me started this place.

873
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:13,009
You should have
gotten stock for it.

874
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:15,242
l got Val for it.
lt was a fair trade.

875
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:17,811
ls he...?

876
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:20,518
How is he?

877
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:23,747
He's fine.
He wants to get married.

878
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:25,857
Married?
How old is he?

879
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:27,087
Twenty.

880
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:31,764
My God, twenty years.

881
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,159
And today, for the first time,
he really needs you.

882
00:58:51,953 --> 00:58:53,113
Shiny.

883
00:58:57,025 --> 00:59:00,119
lmelda, cancel my appointments
for tonight.

884
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:10,701
l normally drink vegetable juice
during business hours, but for this...

885
00:59:11,372 --> 00:59:15,706
let's drink to Senator Keeley's daughter
and our Val.

886
00:59:15,977 --> 00:59:18,878
l haven't done much for him
in the last 20 years.

887
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:20,978
Don't worry about that.

888
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:23,714
l'm not exactly maternal.

889
00:59:24,052 --> 00:59:25,542
l am.

890
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:28,048
l'm very maternal.

891
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:30,484
And Albert's practically a breast.

892
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:41,399
Do you remember
the show where we met?

893
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:43,067
Very well.

894
00:59:43,571 --> 00:59:45,562
Love is in the air

895
00:59:45,907 --> 00:59:47,238
Different kinds

896
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:50,501
Quite clearly
People everywhere

897
00:59:50,745 --> 00:59:52,076
Out of their minds

898
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,178
Act queerly

899
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:56,906
Wait, wait.

900
00:59:57,252 --> 01:00:00,085
Wives are at
their husbands' service

901
01:00:00,421 --> 01:00:02,912
Virgins are distinctly nervous

902
01:00:03,258 --> 01:00:06,250
Virgins are distinctly nervous

903
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:10,928
Love is going around

904
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:14,591
Ah, for the gypsy.

905
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:16,426
How handsome you were.

906
01:00:16,704 --> 01:00:20,435
How unavailable,
and what a body.

907
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:22,599
You're embarrassing me.

908
01:00:22,944 --> 01:00:25,708
You were so terrified.
lt was so sweet.

909
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:30,441
l nearly died. l walk into my room,
and there's a woman in my bed!

910
01:00:30,785 --> 01:00:33,117
l paid the doorman twenty dollars.

911
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:35,115
Twenty dollars in those days.

912
01:00:35,456 --> 01:00:36,445
Oh, God.

913
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,622
l thought, 'What the hell?'

914
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:43,287
'l'll try it once and see what
those straight guys are raving about.'

915
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:46,464
How long did we last?

916
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:50,226
l know exactly.
From 2:30 till 3:45 a.m. Two times.

917
01:00:57,979 --> 01:00:59,310
Love is in the air

918
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:00,570
Round and about

919
01:01:00,815 --> 01:01:03,477
This morning
Bachelors beware

920
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:05,979
-Maidens watch out
-Fair warning

921
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:10,918
lf you stop to feel a tingle
And you like remaining single

922
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:12,490
That's your part.

923
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,160
Stay home
Don't take a breath

924
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:18,829
You could catch your death

925
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,829
'Cause love is around

926
01:01:28,843 --> 01:01:30,174
Sorry.

927
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,013
 

928
01:01:32,013 --> 01:01:35,847
You're in incredible shape.
And you can still dance.

929
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:38,345
So can you, Armand.

930
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:40,517
Thank you.
That's so cool.

931
01:01:40,855 --> 01:01:45,189
Where did all this hair come from?
Wasn't your chest smooth?

932
01:01:45,526 --> 01:01:48,359
l shaved it for the show.
l wanted to look young.

933
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:52,122
lt's much nicer this way--
much more masculine.

934
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,358
So much hair.

935
01:01:54,702 --> 01:01:56,533
Let me touch it.

936
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:58,532
What a beautiful chain.

937
01:01:58,873 --> 01:02:02,536
Look how it glitters
in that thick, black nest of hair.

938
01:02:02,877 --> 01:02:04,208
Unbutton your shirt.

939
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:06,470
-Careful, it's silk.
-Let me touch that chest.

940
01:02:06,714 --> 01:02:09,376
-Don't snag it.
-Your beautiful, hairy chest.

941
01:02:11,152 --> 01:02:12,983
l'm sorry.
l couldn't stop him.

942
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:13,983
Albert?

943
01:02:51,926 --> 01:02:53,257
ls Albert here?

944
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:54,817
No.

945
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:58,863
Great. Then he's driving back
from Miami at 20 miles an hour...

946
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,536
with the parking brake on.
l had to take the fucking bus.

947
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:08,769
Are we crucifying someone tonight?

948
01:03:09,043 --> 01:03:11,876
You like it?
l traded that stupid moose for it.

949
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:15,879
And they threw in books.
lt all goes back tomorrow.

950
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:17,950
ls my mother coming?

951
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:19,886
Yes, she's coming.

952
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:22,620
Yes.
Thank you.

953
01:03:22,957 --> 01:03:24,788
There. You see?

954
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:26,788
lt all worked out.

955
01:03:27,462 --> 01:03:30,397
l'm only here to get my toothbrush.
Agador...

956
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:33,065
will you?
lt's in the usual place.

957
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:39,566
l would have loved
to see your children.

958
01:03:40,074 --> 01:03:43,475
Why don't you hold the crucifix?
lt's the prop for martyrs.

959
01:03:46,147 --> 01:03:50,641
Oh, yes. Another gibe,
another joke at my expense.

960
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:54,485
You and Katharine were
probably laughing at me too.

961
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:59,487
Well, why not?
l'm not young, l'm not new...

962
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:02,155
and everyone laughs at me.

963
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:05,159
l'm quite aware
of how ridiculous l am.

964
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:09,496
The only solution is to go
where nobody is ridiculous.

965
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:12,103
Where everyone is equal.

966
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:14,600
Good-bye, Armand.

967
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:17,675
Wait, Miss Albert!
Don't forget this.

968
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:20,674
Listen, l don't want you to go.

969
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:24,515
My poor, devoted Agador.

970
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,514
l'm leaving you my stereo...

971
01:04:28,022 --> 01:04:30,013
-my red boots...
-l don't want them.

972
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:32,953
-and my wigs.
-Which wigs?

973
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:36,686
My best wigs.
l won't need them where l'm going.

974
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,764
Okay, l'll bite.

975
01:04:41,102 --> 01:04:42,592
Where are you going?

976
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:44,702
To Los Copa.

977
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,203
There isn't anything
in Los Copa but a cemetery.

978
01:04:50,545 --> 01:04:53,537
l know.
That's why l'm packing light.

979
01:04:54,482 --> 01:04:55,642
l see.

980
01:04:55,983 --> 01:05:00,716
You're going to the cemetery
with your toothbrush. How Egyptian.

981
01:05:03,057 --> 01:05:04,388
Good-bye, Armand.

982
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:07,321
Miss Albert, wait!
Don't!

983
01:05:09,397 --> 01:05:10,728
Shit!

984
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:12,989
lt'll be better without an uncle.

985
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:15,896
What did you do to him?
He goes to a cemetery!

986
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,501
-Calm down!
-Why?

987
01:05:17,738 --> 01:05:20,730
Because you have to
start cooking dinner.

988
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:23,407
l'm going after fucking Albert.

989
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,072
Can you...

990
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:32,575
You can cook, right?

991
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:36,245
Your father seems to think so.

992
01:06:01,616 --> 01:06:04,107
My cemetery is in Key Biscayne.

993
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,611
lt's one of the prettiest
in the world.

994
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:12,619
There are lovely trees,
the sky is blue, there are birds.

995
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:17,620
The one in Los Copa
is really shit.

996
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,962
What a pain in the ass you are.

997
01:06:24,805 --> 01:06:28,138
lt's true. You're not young,
and you're not new...

998
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:30,467
and you do make people laugh.

999
01:06:30,978 --> 01:06:33,811
l'm still with you
because you make me laugh.

1000
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:37,573
So now l have to sell my plot
in Key Biscayne...

1001
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:40,883
so l can be next to you
in that shithole Los Copa...

1002
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:43,750
so l never miss a laugh.

1003
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:50,327
What's this?

1004
01:06:51,165 --> 01:06:52,496
Read it.

1005
01:06:56,504 --> 01:06:58,096
l don't understand.

1006
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:02,105
lt's the palimony agreement.
l told you l had it.

1007
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:08,171
lt says l have the right to give you
half of everything l own.

1008
01:07:08,516 --> 01:07:11,508
lt's safer,
if something happens to one of us.

1009
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,182
But who owns it now?

1010
01:07:15,523 --> 01:07:16,683
You do.

1011
01:07:24,198 --> 01:07:25,187
l don't want it.

1012
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:26,956
Then give me half.

1013
01:07:27,201 --> 01:07:31,194
Quick, give me a pen.
l don't want all of this, Armand.

1014
01:07:32,373 --> 01:07:33,704
Sign it.

1015
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:52,882
There. We're partners.

1016
01:07:53,227 --> 01:07:56,719
You own half my life,
and l own half of yours.

1017
01:07:57,064 --> 01:07:58,395
Half the club?

1018
01:07:58,733 --> 01:08:01,725
What does it matter?
Take it all.

1019
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,693
l'm 50 years old.

1020
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:07,434
There's only one place l call home,
and it's because you're there.

1021
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:12,736
What difference does it make if l say
you can stay, or you say l can stay?

1022
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:16,572
lt's ours.

1023
01:08:33,768 --> 01:08:36,862
She's gone, Mr. Goldman.
But she always checks in.

1024
01:08:37,104 --> 01:08:38,765
Sure, l'll take a message.

1025
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:41,264
Go ahead.

1026
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,601
Don't come...

1027
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:47,607
The Reverend Al Sharpton
said today that...

1028
01:08:47,882 --> 01:08:52,444
Jackson's last words, 'Your money's
on the dresser, Chocolate.' were racist.

1029
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,712
The prostitute's given name
was Natumbundra.

1030
01:08:55,956 --> 01:08:58,891
That idiot Jackson!
Now the blacks will start.

1031
01:08:59,126 --> 01:09:02,459
Barbara's wedding will
disassociate us from all this.

1032
01:09:02,797 --> 01:09:07,632
The Colemans are a perfect family.
They've never been divorced, have they?

1033
01:09:08,803 --> 01:09:11,966
See?
We're on our way to salvation.

1034
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,304
And it was a question of Albert
or your mother.

1035
01:09:17,645 --> 01:09:19,636
So l had to choose.

1036
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:22,141
And l chose Albert.

1037
01:09:23,818 --> 01:09:25,809
You understand that, don't you?

1038
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,651
l knew you would.

1039
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:32,990
l can't get this damn tie even.

1040
01:09:33,661 --> 01:09:35,492
Well, the jacket will cover it.

1041
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:39,663
l look like my grandfather
in this suit.

1042
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:44,100
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself at 30.

1043
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:46,996
Any last instructions?

1044
01:09:47,341 --> 01:09:50,504
Just don't walk unless you have to.

1045
01:09:51,378 --> 01:09:52,868
And don't gesture.

1046
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,308
That all?

1047
01:09:55,616 --> 01:09:57,277
Don't talk...

1048
01:09:57,618 --> 01:09:58,949
too much.

1049
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:02,519
Who cares?
This won't work.

1050
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:07,851
Come on! Don't be so negative.
l think we can pull this off.

1051
01:11:05,753 --> 01:11:07,084
What?

1052
01:11:09,356 --> 01:11:10,846
No good?

1053
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:16,919
Why?
l'm dressed just the way you are.

1054
01:11:18,432 --> 01:11:20,593
l took off all my rings.

1055
01:11:21,268 --> 01:11:23,259
l'm not wearing any makeup.

1056
01:11:25,105 --> 01:11:26,436
l'm just...

1057
01:11:28,609 --> 01:11:30,099
a 'guy.'

1058
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:33,443
What about those?

1059
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:41,615
Those?
Well, one does want a hint of color.

1060
01:11:48,963 --> 01:11:52,126
You're thinking
that dressed this way...

1061
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:55,299
l'm even more obvious,
aren't you?

1062
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:04,474
You're right.

1063
01:12:15,322 --> 01:12:18,655
l just wanted so much to help you.

1064
01:12:22,997 --> 01:12:24,487
And you hate me.

1065
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,161
You both hate me.

1066
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:35,669
We don't hate you.

1067
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:41,278
...better treat me right

1068
01:12:43,017 --> 01:12:45,508
She works hard for the money

1069
01:12:47,021 --> 01:12:49,512
So hard for it, honey

1070
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:56,019
l work hard for the money
So you better treat me right

1071
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,858
That's right

1072
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:00,128
Better put your shoes on.
lt's late.

1073
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,692
There's no point
in my putting shoes on, sir.

1074
01:13:04,038 --> 01:13:07,530
l never wear shoes
because they make me fall down.

1075
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:09,799
Just put your shoes on!

1076
01:13:10,044 --> 01:13:14,378
And talk in your normal voice.
Give me a break.

1077
01:13:16,717 --> 01:13:17,877
Okay.

1078
01:13:28,062 --> 01:13:30,053
Armand?
lt's Katharine.

1079
01:13:30,397 --> 01:13:32,228
l'm in the car, and l got...

1080
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:35,161
a message telling me not to come.

1081
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:40,063
No, that was a mistake.
He said not to come late. l was there.

1082
01:13:40,407 --> 01:13:43,240
l thought my secretary got it wrong.

1083
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,172
l should be there in half an hour.

1084
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:49,071
ls this Val?

1085
01:13:52,086 --> 01:13:55,078
Val, l want you to know how...

1086
01:13:56,256 --> 01:13:59,020
happy l am that
l can do this for you.

1087
01:13:59,426 --> 01:14:01,417
l know it's a little late.

1088
01:14:01,762 --> 01:14:03,593
No, it's fine.

1089
01:14:04,932 --> 01:14:06,923
Thanks for this.

1090
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:12,602
So, um, see you in half an hour...

1091
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,771
Mom.

1092
01:14:18,946 --> 01:14:22,609
Did you just say,
'See you in half an hour, Mom'?

1093
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:24,548
-Was that?
-Yes.

1094
01:14:24,785 --> 01:14:26,753
You can't call her back.
She's in the car.

1095
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,980
Are you crazy?

1096
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:31,388
Albert is hysterical now. You know
what he'll do if Katharine comes?

1097
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,289
Nothing.
He won't embarrass me.

1098
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:36,562
lt was my mother.
l couldn't tell her not to come.

1099
01:14:37,131 --> 01:14:40,567
Pop, without her l'm screwed.
You know that.

1100
01:14:46,974 --> 01:14:51,138
So this is hell.
And there's a crucifix in it.

1101
01:15:11,498 --> 01:15:14,990
This is less like Palm Beach
than l imagined.

1102
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:17,597
lt was all sand
when they bought here.

1103
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:21,171
This grew up around them
while they were in Greece.

1104
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:31,943
He's locked himself in. lf we're lucky,
he won't come out at all.

1105
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:39,524
l'm not religious, and l'm Jewish. But
if things go well, l'd appreciate it.

1106
01:15:40,861 --> 01:15:45,355
Speaking of Jewish, Barbara told
her parents our last name is Coleman.

1107
01:15:47,034 --> 01:15:48,194
Thanks.

1108
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:51,201
Coming.

1109
01:15:52,706 --> 01:15:53,866
Perfect.

1110
01:15:56,977 --> 01:15:58,638
lt's the shoes.

1111
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:08,878
Good evening.
l am Spartacus, the Goldmans' butler.

1112
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:11,880
Please, come--
Come in.

1113
01:16:14,228 --> 01:16:15,991
ls that Goldman?

1114
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,222
Coldman, Coldman.
Spartacus is, uh...

1115
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:20,897
-Guatemalan.
-new.

1116
01:16:21,568 --> 01:16:24,332
Val, this is my father
and my mother.

1117
01:16:25,072 --> 01:16:26,733
This is Val Coleman.

1118
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:29,565
Coleman or Coldman?

1119
01:16:29,843 --> 01:16:31,071
Coleman.

1120
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:33,343
The 'd' is silent.

1121
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,740
My father.

1122
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,874
My daughter, Barbara.

1123
01:16:39,253 --> 01:16:40,413
Delighted.

1124
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:43,345
My husband.

1125
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:45,914
Extremely honored.

1126
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:48,425
You have a very forceful handshake.

1127
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:50,094
You have to in Greece.

1128
01:16:54,434 --> 01:16:57,426
My mother won't be here
for another 15 minutes.

1129
01:16:57,704 --> 01:17:00,036
She's with my grandparents
in Palm Beach.

1130
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:02,937
Oh, isn't that nice?

1131
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,872
Having contact
between the generations.

1132
01:17:06,113 --> 01:17:08,274
Yes.
Won't you come in?

1133
01:17:11,118 --> 01:17:14,110
How's the leg?
My father has an old football injury.

1134
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:16,549
A fellow sufferer.
Where did you play?

1135
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:18,621
-Greece.
-Miami U.

1136
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:20,786
What an interesting room.

1137
01:17:21,128 --> 01:17:23,392
Don't you think this room is nice?

1138
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,292
Well, yes.
A very, very...

1139
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:31,297
pleasant vacation house.
l like it's, uh, severity.

1140
01:17:31,638 --> 01:17:36,075
Dad uses this place more for work and...
reflection than anything else.

1141
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:39,643
So it's not so much
a vacation house as a--

1142
01:17:39,913 --> 01:17:41,244
Monastery.

1143
01:17:41,982 --> 01:17:44,473
Well, it's just charming.

1144
01:17:44,818 --> 01:17:48,310
And look at these lovely old books.

1145
01:17:49,323 --> 01:17:50,654
Look at this.

1146
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:54,491
'Nancy Drew and the Case
of the Burning Candle.'

1147
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:56,489
You have the whole series.

1148
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,320
Uh, they're my mother's.

1149
01:17:58,665 --> 01:17:59,825
Sit down!

1150
01:18:01,335 --> 01:18:02,666
Please.

1151
01:18:18,852 --> 01:18:21,184
Shall we have champagne to celebrate?

1152
01:18:21,521 --> 01:18:23,182
Oh, how nice.

1153
01:18:23,523 --> 01:18:24,854
-Agador!
-Spartacus!

1154
01:18:25,192 --> 01:18:29,959
Agador Spartacus! He insists
on being called by his full name.

1155
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,801
We'd like the champagne now.

1156
01:18:53,086 --> 01:18:55,418
Over there?
Okay, thanks.

1157
01:18:56,923 --> 01:18:58,254
God bless you.

1158
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:00,423
They went in around the corner.

1159
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,356
That's the side entrance
to this building. The club?

1160
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:04,928
Let's check it out.

1161
01:19:05,932 --> 01:19:09,265
You have such a responsibility,
two houses.

1162
01:19:09,603 --> 01:19:11,434
When did you buy this one?

1163
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:15,368
About 15 years ago.
The area was mostly Jewish then.

1164
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:18,772
Really? Barbara told us
it was mostly sand.

1165
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:24,607
Yes. Well, you know the old saying,
'Where there's sand...'

1166
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:29,282
Here we go.
Champagne for everyone.

1167
01:19:30,123 --> 01:19:32,216
And a scotch, if you have it.

1168
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,559
ls someone else home?

1169
01:19:37,631 --> 01:19:41,965
Just our dog, Piranha. We always lock
her in when there's company.

1170
01:19:44,971 --> 01:19:47,633
l'll finish pouring.
Go finish dinner.

1171
01:19:57,317 --> 01:20:01,754
He's a brilliant chef. He just has
a lot to learn about serving.

1172
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:05,588
Where could the wife be?

1173
01:20:28,181 --> 01:20:31,014
He was so weird.

1174
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:33,342
No, l really was.

1175
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:35,518
l was like,
'Will you marry me?'

1176
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:39,522
She was like,
'Didn't you say no way before thirty?'

1177
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,350
lt was so funny.

1178
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:44,858
Yes, it does sound funny.

1179
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:51,360
How was your trip, Senator?

1180
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:55,034
A nice trip.
Very nice.

1181
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:59,806
We decided to drive down
to see the seasons change.

1182
01:21:01,214 --> 01:21:05,048
lt was a long trip, though:
Virginia, Kentucky...

1183
01:21:05,385 --> 01:21:06,716
Tennessee...

1184
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:09,052
Georgia.

1185
01:21:09,556 --> 01:21:14,220
lt was just so magical to come
from the North, where it's cold...

1186
01:21:14,895 --> 01:21:17,227
to the South,
where it's warm...

1187
01:21:17,898 --> 01:21:21,732
and see the tremendous differences
from region to region...

1188
01:21:22,068 --> 01:21:24,559
in this incredible country
of ours.

1189
01:21:27,407 --> 01:21:30,069
My wife and l
used to go to Virginia...

1190
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,903
every autumn
to see the foliage turn.

1191
01:21:33,747 --> 01:21:35,908
Virginia has amazing foliage...

1192
01:21:36,249 --> 01:21:40,413
although l do think that
the foliage in Ohio is underrated.

1193
01:21:43,256 --> 01:21:46,248
lt's just dazzling along l-75.

1194
01:21:51,431 --> 01:21:52,921
Just dazzling.

1195
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,093
We would go down to Virginia,
to get away for a while.

1196
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:02,432
To see the wonderful farms,
the countryside.

1197
01:22:02,776 --> 01:22:06,109
l'm stuck in traffic.
Start dinner without me.

1198
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,271
The hills, the mountains.

1199
01:22:11,284 --> 01:22:14,117
Talk about
'purple mountains' majesty.'

1200
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:17,112
Just fantastic.

1201
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:21,792
Red leaves, purple mountains...

1202
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:25,222
green fields.

1203
01:22:27,634 --> 01:22:30,296
And the roads.
Black...

1204
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,569
cutting through the green.

1205
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,402
All the colors.

1206
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:38,641
The trees.

1207
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,740
Pennsylvania's nice too.

1208
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:47,750
Was that my wife?

1209
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:50,149
Just now on the phone?

1210
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:53,085
l think it was.
l was just so caught up.

1211
01:22:53,326 --> 01:22:55,317
Val, was that Mom?

1212
01:22:55,662 --> 01:22:57,994
Yeah. She's stuck.

1213
01:22:58,331 --> 01:23:00,265
We're to start dinner without her.

1214
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,334
l would have picked up, but l was
so interested in the senator's...

1215
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,098
story.

1216
01:23:06,339 --> 01:23:08,170
Oh, it wasn't that good.

1217
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:09,839
lt was wonderful.

1218
01:23:10,677 --> 01:23:15,341
Will you excuse me? l should tell
Agador Spartacus this news.

1219
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,361
Would you excuse us?

1220
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,297
l've never had so much
go so wrong so quickly.

1221
01:23:38,371 --> 01:23:39,861
This is like a curse!

1222
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,535
Dad, what do we do?
Do we wait for her or do we--

1223
01:23:43,877 --> 01:23:45,071
You're soaking!

1224
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,976
l'm sweating
like some farm animal.

1225
01:23:47,213 --> 01:23:50,876
-l can't do this.
-We can do this! Work with me.

1226
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:53,883
Something very odd is going on.

1227
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,145
lt's this thing with Jackson.

1228
01:23:56,389 --> 01:24:00,155
The wife doesn't want to see us,
and the father's a wreck.

1229
01:24:00,393 --> 01:24:02,054
l'm sure that's not it.

1230
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:06,491
No, it's something else. Something
about the father and the butler.

1231
01:24:07,233 --> 01:24:08,894
-lt's nothing!
-lt is something.

1232
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,569
lt's not!
You always think the worst.

1233
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:13,830
-l don't!
-You always do!

1234
01:24:13,907 --> 01:24:16,137
-Val's mother is just late.
-Listen, young lady!

1235
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:17,403
She's late!

1236
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:20,237
-Watch yourself, young lady!
-Here they come.

1237
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:22,574
Excuse me.

1238
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:25,578
Well, we'll...

1239
01:24:26,753 --> 01:24:29,745
give her a half hour,
and if she isn't--

1240
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,357
Here l am!

1241
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:33,915
Oh, please...

1242
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:38,521
forgive me for being so late,
but traffic was unbelievable!

1243
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:41,594
Senator Keeley, Mrs. Keeley...

1244
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:45,098
l'm so happy
to meet you at last.

1245
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:47,937
You must be Barbara.

1246
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:50,436
What a pretty child.

1247
01:24:50,777 --> 01:24:52,210
Come give me a hug.

1248
01:24:52,946 --> 01:24:55,039
Don't be afraid.

1249
01:24:55,148 --> 01:24:57,912
Oh, how adorable.
She's shy.

1250
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,214
How nice to meet you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1251
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:01,613
Goldman.

1252
01:25:01,855 --> 01:25:03,322
lsn't the 'd' silent?

1253
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:07,292
lt is pronounced Coleman, isn't it?
We've had some confusion.

1254
01:25:07,794 --> 01:25:09,955
Oh, yes.
Coleman.

1255
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:12,958
The 'd' is silent in America.

1256
01:25:13,299 --> 01:25:17,565
lt's Cole d'isle au Man,
or Cole of the lsle of Man in France...

1257
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:20,295
where Armand's chateau is...

1258
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:24,070
Cole d'man in Greece
where Armand's work is...

1259
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:28,644
and finally, the vulgar Coleman
in Florida, where Armand's home is.

1260
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:33,750
So, we never know where we are
until we hear our last name pronounced.

1261
01:25:36,156 --> 01:25:37,817
That explains it.

1262
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,418
At last.

1263
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,151
l would like to hug you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1264
01:25:43,329 --> 01:25:45,490
Oh, my dear child!

1265
01:25:45,999 --> 01:25:47,330
Welcome.

1266
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,094
Look at this.

1267
01:25:49,836 --> 01:25:53,670
This is our footage for the show
on Jackson. Pump up the sound.

1268
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,774
We're here at what
they're calling Camp Keeley...

1269
01:25:58,011 --> 01:25:59,501
Where you driving him?

1270
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:03,012
South Beach, Florida.

1271
01:26:04,517 --> 01:26:05,779
Where is this?

1272
01:26:06,019 --> 01:26:09,182
Keeley's house last night.
The fat guy...

1273
01:26:09,522 --> 01:26:13,686
is with the 'National lnquirer.'
Harry Radman.

1274
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:18,964
Oh, yeah. My God, he's put on so much
weight since the Simpson case.

1275
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:21,958
This should go to the network.

1276
01:26:22,535 --> 01:26:25,026
lt's so wonderful
what you've done here.

1277
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,138
Everything is
so simple and uncluttered.

1278
01:26:28,374 --> 01:26:32,037
Our house is a sea of papers.
You men.

1279
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,475
You're the biggest babies.
They can run the world...

1280
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:37,546
but can't pick out a tie.

1281
01:26:37,884 --> 01:26:42,048
l know. l can't get
this big lug to buy a new suit.

1282
01:26:42,388 --> 01:26:44,049
Armand, they're picking on us.

1283
01:26:45,225 --> 01:26:46,556
Oh, well...

1284
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:50,056
bless them.
That's the way nature made them.

1285
01:26:50,396 --> 01:26:52,728
Maybe l'm just
an old-fashioned girl...

1286
01:26:53,066 --> 01:26:57,400
but l pity the woman who's too busy
to take care of her man.

1287
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:01,003
Hear, hear! lt's so nice
to meet people like you.

1288
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,672
Our kind of people.

1289
01:27:05,245 --> 01:27:09,579
C-o-l-e-m-a-n.
There's no first name on the bell.

1290
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,744
Sure?
They can't find them.

1291
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:16,182
What about the name in front
of the club? Goldman? That's close.

1292
01:27:16,422 --> 01:27:19,084
You're right.
Wouldn't that be something?

1293
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,350
Try Goldman.
What was it?

1294
01:27:21,594 --> 01:27:22,925
Armand Goldman.

1295
01:27:23,596 --> 01:27:27,430
lt's so odd to me,
this fuss over school prayer.

1296
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,362
As if anyone--
Jews, Muslims, whatever...

1297
01:27:30,603 --> 01:27:33,367
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom.

1298
01:27:33,606 --> 01:27:35,267
lt's insane.

1299
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:39,772
Thank you, Agador Spartacus!
You may go.

1300
01:27:42,782 --> 01:27:45,615
He's very nice, but such a problem.

1301
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:48,284
We never know what makes him laugh.

1302
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:50,950
At least he speaks English.

1303
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,716
We have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months.

1304
01:27:54,961 --> 01:27:58,624
And the maids we've been through
in the last six years!

1305
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:00,559
Rodney, Bruno, Chuck--

1306
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,961
Look!
You all need more ice.

1307
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:05,568
l have a good feeling
about you people.

1308
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:09,798
Not a lot of clever books on
the shelves, no fancy art on the walls.

1309
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:13,910
Just the crucifix and a lot
of good, warm, family feeling.

1310
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,141
This is what Clinton
didn't understand...

1311
01:28:16,216 --> 01:28:18,878
when he started in on school prayer
and gays in the military.

1312
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:20,476
More ice for you.

1313
01:28:20,653 --> 01:28:23,918
There's an idiotic issue.
Gays in the military!

1314
01:28:24,157 --> 01:28:27,320
l mean, those haircuts,
those uniforms. Who cares?

1315
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:30,427
Mom, don't talk about things
you don't know about.

1316
01:28:30,663 --> 01:28:33,325
Don't patronize your mother.
She's amazingly intelligent.

1317
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,931
l think homosexuality--

1318
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:36,400
A lot more ice for you!

1319
01:28:36,469 --> 01:28:37,766
More for me, Dad.

1320
01:28:37,837 --> 01:28:39,828
is weakening this country.

1321
01:28:40,173 --> 01:28:44,837
That's what l thought until l found out
Alexander the Great was a fag.

1322
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,942
Talk about gays in the military!

1323
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,341
How about those Dolphins?

1324
01:28:53,686 --> 01:28:54,846
l'll get it.

1325
01:29:00,026 --> 01:29:02,517
l think we're skirting
an issue here...

1326
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:04,786
that has Mr. Coleman
very nervous.

1327
01:29:04,864 --> 01:29:06,695
And l don't blame him.

1328
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:11,197
You must have heard
about how Senator Jackson died.

1329
01:29:12,872 --> 01:29:14,703
Oh, that.

1330
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:18,208
Yes, what an ugly story.

1331
01:29:18,878 --> 01:29:21,369
Of course, we don't believe
a word of it.

1332
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:22,803
What do you mean?

1333
01:29:23,049 --> 01:29:24,710
He was obviously framed.

1334
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:27,383
l, for one,
would like an autopsy.

1335
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:28,814
Uh, Mom...

1336
01:29:29,889 --> 01:29:32,153
That's just what
Rush Limbaugh said.

1337
01:29:34,727 --> 01:29:35,887
Excuse me.

1338
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:44,728
The tension. lt's like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable.

1339
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:47,905
Dinner is going to be late, okay?

1340
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:51,404
'Cause you give me
so little time to shop.

1341
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:53,442
The girl is nice.

1342
01:29:53,913 --> 01:29:56,677
l owe it to Val. Growing up the way
he did, it can't have been easy.

1343
01:29:56,749 --> 01:30:00,344
l'm sorry to laugh at Miss Albert,
but what is that hairdo?

1344
01:30:00,586 --> 01:30:04,249
Fuck it! lt's one night.
l can live through it.

1345
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:09,089
Of course, it's wrong to kill
an abortion doctor.

1346
01:30:09,562 --> 01:30:11,120
-Many pro-lifers...
-Dad?

1347
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,893
l don't agree with them,
but many sincerely feel...

1348
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:15,457
l'm here, son.

1349
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,867
stop the doctors,
you stop the abortions.

1350
01:30:18,104 --> 01:30:21,596
That's ridiculous.
The doctors are only doing their jobs.

1351
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:24,934
Better to kill the mothers.
That will stop them.

1352
01:30:25,611 --> 01:30:27,272
May l see you a moment, dear?

1353
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:31,608
l know, l know. lf you kill
the mother, the fetus dies too.

1354
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:35,877
But the fetus is going to be aborted,
so let it go down with the ship.

1355
01:30:36,122 --> 01:30:38,283
l really must see you now.

1356
01:30:39,959 --> 01:30:41,290
Excuse me.

1357
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:50,132
l assure you...

1358
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,962
Mother is just following a train
of thought to a logical...

1359
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,969
yet absurd, conclusion.

1360
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:58,066
Very much the way
Jonathan Swift did...

1361
01:30:58,144 --> 01:31:01,238
when he suggested that lrish peasants
feed their babies to the rich.

1362
01:31:02,482 --> 01:31:05,144
Well, l know one thing
about your mother.

1363
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:09,411
She's a passionate woman who follows
her heart. And l love her.

1364
01:31:11,991 --> 01:31:13,982
So Goldman owns the club...

1365
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:17,819
lives above it,
owns the building, and he's gay.

1366
01:31:19,332 --> 01:31:21,664
We are in 'lnquirer' heaven.

1367
01:31:25,004 --> 01:31:27,666
l could have danced all night

1368
01:31:28,007 --> 01:31:30,999
l could have danced all night

1369
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:36,008
And still have begged for more

1370
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:37,947
You have a beautiful voice.

1371
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:40,675
l could have spread my wings

1372
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:43,853
And done a thousand things

1373
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:48,684
l've never done before

1374
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,196
Your mother should know
l want a career and marriage.

1375
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,628
Barbara, Albert isn't my mother.
He's a drag queen.

1376
01:31:55,868 --> 01:31:59,201
That's right.
l keep forgetting.

1377
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:02,531
He just sounds
so much like a mother.

1378
01:32:03,042 --> 01:32:07,445
l only know when he

1379
01:32:07,513 --> 01:32:10,812
Began to dance with me

1380
01:32:10,883 --> 01:32:15,217
l could have danced, danced, danced

1381
01:32:15,888 --> 01:32:18,220
All night

1382
01:32:23,963 --> 01:32:25,123
Bravo!

1383
01:32:29,068 --> 01:32:32,060
What a lovely voice you have,
Agador Spartacus.

1384
01:32:32,405 --> 01:32:36,899
Thank you. Thank you, all.
Dinner is served.

1385
01:32:37,743 --> 01:32:42,737
Wonderful. This way, Senator.
You know, l played Eliza in high school.

1386
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:44,674
l'll bet you were lovely.

1387
01:32:47,753 --> 01:32:51,086
Go inside. l'll tape a note
to Katharine to the door.

1388
01:32:51,757 --> 01:32:55,090
Mrs. Keeley over there,
and the senator on my right.

1389
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:58,853
Val over here.
And Barbara, dear, please sit.

1390
01:32:59,098 --> 01:33:00,963
You are the most gracious hostess.

1391
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:03,263
Oh, thank you so much.

1392
01:33:03,603 --> 01:33:06,094
l'm having such a wonderful time.

1393
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:08,771
This is what
l've always dreamed of...

1394
01:33:09,108 --> 01:33:12,942
a big, loving family gathered
around the table...

1395
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:15,042
the way it was
when l was a girl.

1396
01:33:15,281 --> 01:33:17,442
That's the way we grew up too.

1397
01:33:17,783 --> 01:33:22,413
lt was a wonderful world then,
wasn't it? Happy families and...

1398
01:33:22,488 --> 01:33:26,117
everyone speaking English
and no drugs and no AlDS.

1399
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:27,381
Easy on the wine, Mom.

1400
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:29,390
What interesting china!

1401
01:33:30,129 --> 01:33:33,121
lt looks like young men
playing leapfrog.

1402
01:33:33,466 --> 01:33:34,956
ls it Greek?

1403
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:39,961
l-- l...

1404
01:33:40,306 --> 01:33:41,898
l have no idea.

1405
01:33:42,308 --> 01:33:44,299
l've never seen these bowls before.

1406
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:47,637
Really?
Barbara, get me my glasses, dear.

1407
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,905
They're in my purse by the chair.

1408
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:52,811
Where are my glasses?
lt is Greek.

1409
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:57,851
Greek boys, actually.
Uh, naked Greek boys.

1410
01:33:57,924 --> 01:34:00,859
And girls!
Doesn't your bowl have girls?

1411
01:34:01,327 --> 01:34:04,262
-l have one.
-So do l! Oh, look!

1412
01:34:04,664 --> 01:34:07,155
There.
l think that's a girl.

1413
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,933
Then you haven't seen one
in a long time. That's a boy.

1414
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:14,003
l may need glasses,
but l can see that.

1415
01:34:14,674 --> 01:34:18,110
l couldn't find your glasses.
Maybe they're in the car.

1416
01:34:18,344 --> 01:34:20,335
l have mine.
Here.

1417
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,110
Hurry, you idiot!
They're looking at the bowls.

1418
01:34:25,184 --> 01:34:27,948
What kind of moron puts out bowls
without looking at them!

1419
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,352
Stop ladling!
Give me the pot!

1420
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,284
-You can't serve out of that!
-Move!

1421
01:34:32,525 --> 01:34:34,618
Wait!
There's shrimps.

1422
01:34:35,027 --> 01:34:36,358
Let's see what they're doing.

1423
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,690
Here we go.

1424
01:34:40,032 --> 01:34:45,026
Agador's superb soup. We're in luck.
He doesn't make this for everyone.

1425
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:48,704
This is his specialty,
seafood chowder.

1426
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:51,373
lsn't that an egg?

1427
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:54,544
Why, yes, it is.
lt is a huevo.

1428
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,212
This is so Guatemala.

1429
01:34:57,550 --> 01:35:00,383
They put eggs in everything
down there...

1430
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:03,816
because chicken is
so important to them.

1431
01:35:04,056 --> 01:35:06,718
lt's their only real currency.

1432
01:35:07,059 --> 01:35:09,994
A woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens.

1433
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:13,892
A man's wealth is measured
by the size of his cock.

1434
01:35:14,233 --> 01:35:15,894
Will you excuse me?

1435
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:20,832
What the hell is this?

1436
01:35:21,073 --> 01:35:24,839
Sweet-and-sour peasant soup.
Why'd you say it was seafood chowder?

1437
01:35:25,077 --> 01:35:28,569
-What the hell is that?
-l don't know. l made it up!

1438
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:30,679
God, this is a nightmare.

1439
01:35:42,762 --> 01:35:45,094
Where are you staying in Florida?

1440
01:35:45,765 --> 01:35:49,098
With the Jeb Bushes,
on Fisher lsland.

1441
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:52,860
Fisher lsland.
Such a lovely spot.

1442
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:57,203
My parents lived on Fisher lsland
until they died.

1443
01:35:58,277 --> 01:36:01,110
l thought you were visiting
your parents in Palm Beach.

1444
01:36:01,947 --> 01:36:02,936
What?

1445
01:36:05,284 --> 01:36:07,775
Yes, uh... now...

1446
01:36:08,621 --> 01:36:10,282
that they're dead.

1447
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:12,113
They moved...

1448
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:15,458
were moved... because...

1449
01:36:17,797 --> 01:36:19,128
well...

1450
01:36:19,632 --> 01:36:23,295
my mother always said,
'Live on Fisher lsland...

1451
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:25,560
get buried in Palm Beach...

1452
01:36:25,805 --> 01:36:29,138
that way you'll
have the best of Florida.'

1453
01:36:30,643 --> 01:36:33,976
Dad, get in there.
Everything is going to hell.

1454
01:36:34,313 --> 01:36:36,304
He didn't make an entree.

1455
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:39,482
What?
You mean we just have soup?

1456
01:36:39,985 --> 01:36:42,920
Peasant soup is an entree.
lt's like stew!

1457
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,819
Why do you think l put
so much in it?

1458
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,323
Shut up!

1459
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,254
Put Katharine's note
on the downstairs door.

1460
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:52,158
l have to go back before
they get to the bottom of the bowls.

1461
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:55,764
l had so much to do.
You give me no time to shop!

1462
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:57,161
Shut up!

1463
01:36:57,503 --> 01:36:59,835
lt's okay!
We're all right!

1464
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:03,098
Shut up, goddamn you!
Stop crying! Goddamn you!

1465
01:37:03,342 --> 01:37:06,675
Don't just stand there!
She'll be here any minute! Go!

1466
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:09,176
Goddamn it!
Fuck the shrimp!

1467
01:37:13,886 --> 01:37:15,217
Oh, my God.

1468
01:37:16,389 --> 01:37:19,222
That's it. That's it.
That's the Lincoln.

1469
01:37:19,492 --> 01:37:21,653
Park here.
The street's jammed.

1470
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:23,225
This is an intersection.

1471
01:37:23,496 --> 01:37:25,327
So? We're the press.

1472
01:37:36,909 --> 01:37:41,175
'Katharine, do not go upstairs.
l'll call you tomorrow. Armand.'

1473
01:37:42,181 --> 01:37:43,842
This is going to be great.

1474
01:37:44,917 --> 01:37:49,251
From that day on, they looked
for a cemetery they really loved...

1475
01:37:49,522 --> 01:37:51,012
instead of eating tofu.

1476
01:37:51,257 --> 01:37:53,919
Daddy favored Key Biscayne, but--

1477
01:37:54,193 --> 01:37:56,354
Time for dessert.
You get everything done?

1478
01:37:57,430 --> 01:38:00,422
Shall we have our coffee
in the living room?

1479
01:38:04,603 --> 01:38:08,266
No, it's his town car.
l am looking at it.

1480
01:38:08,941 --> 01:38:12,934
We're in the middle of a bunch
of drag clubs. l don't know.

1481
01:38:13,779 --> 01:38:15,440
We got authorization.

1482
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:17,112
So, three?

1483
01:38:19,718 --> 01:38:21,049
So, where are they?

1484
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:23,380
They went around the corner, there.

1485
01:38:31,897 --> 01:38:34,559
So what do you think
of these kids getting married?

1486
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,635
Well, she's only eighteen,
and he's only twenty, so l--

1487
01:38:40,906 --> 01:38:44,069
Good God. That sounds like
it's coming from downstairs.

1488
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:47,802
lt must be coming
from that nightclub around the corner.

1489
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,980
This must be the same building.

1490
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:54,983
You're joking! l always thought
that was someone's television set.

1491
01:38:55,254 --> 01:38:58,417
Now, Mother, you know
we live above a nightclub.

1492
01:38:58,824 --> 01:39:01,657
She's traveled around the world,
but deep down...

1493
01:39:01,927 --> 01:39:04,327
she's still a girl
from Grover's Corners.

1494
01:39:04,597 --> 01:39:07,930
l'm afraid l am a bit naive.

1495
01:39:08,334 --> 01:39:10,768
Don't be ashamed
of Grover's Corners.

1496
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:15,104
lt's not a chateau,
but it's a darn good place to call home.

1497
01:39:15,508 --> 01:39:19,000
Thank you.
l will remember that.

1498
01:39:19,345 --> 01:39:24,009
Of course, Armand is
much more sophisticated than l am.

1499
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:28,844
But then,
he comes from such good stock.

1500
01:39:29,188 --> 01:39:32,180
Just like
these two adorable youngsters.

1501
01:39:32,525 --> 01:39:34,356
Don't you agree?

1502
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:37,192
-Where's the bathroom?
-l'll show you.

1503
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:41,364
-No, l want Mother Coleman to show me.
-My dear child!

1504
01:39:41,634 --> 01:39:42,965
One kiss, darling.

1505
01:39:43,202 --> 01:39:45,636
-l'm only going to the bathroom.
-We'll all go.

1506
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:47,702
l think you're all crazy.

1507
01:39:47,973 --> 01:39:49,804
My men!

1508
01:39:50,042 --> 01:39:52,704
lsn't this wonderful?
All of us together.

1509
01:39:53,045 --> 01:39:56,708
This is so moving.
l think l'm going to cry!

1510
01:39:57,383 --> 01:40:00,546
Something very strange
is going on.

1511
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,380
l know.

1512
01:40:02,721 --> 01:40:04,211
l mean, that dinner.

1513
01:40:05,224 --> 01:40:08,216
l know there was something
on those bowls.

1514
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:11,553
And the son disappearing
while we were eating.

1515
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,321
-l know just what's going on.
-You do?

1516
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,334
lt's the oldest story
in the world.

1517
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:17,900
What is it?

1518
01:40:20,739 --> 01:40:22,900
She's a small town girl...

1519
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:28,403
and he's a pretentious European--
the worst kind.

1520
01:40:28,747 --> 01:40:30,840
Him and his Cole d' whatever.

1521
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:34,075
And his decadent china.
l've seen it all before.

1522
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:36,752
Aristotle Onassis was like this.

1523
01:40:37,089 --> 01:40:40,581
And all of the French,
especially Mitterand.

1524
01:40:40,759 --> 01:40:43,592
And the English.
Not Margaret Thatcher, of course.

1525
01:40:43,862 --> 01:40:47,855
But l bet John Major has something on
the side. And she can't handle it.

1526
01:40:48,033 --> 01:40:49,694
-Who?
-Mrs. Coleman.

1527
01:40:49,935 --> 01:40:52,096
Why should she care
about John Major?

1528
01:40:52,438 --> 01:40:55,430
No.
Mrs. Coleman can't handle him.

1529
01:40:55,774 --> 01:40:59,107
Coleman and his nasty little
European traditions.

1530
01:41:00,112 --> 01:41:03,878
And his snobbery.
And that dig about Grover's Corners.

1531
01:41:04,116 --> 01:41:05,777
Kevin, you're rambling.

1532
01:41:06,051 --> 01:41:10,044
Well, it makes me furious.
The contempt he has for her.

1533
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:14,123
Did you see him when she talked?
He looked almost frightened.

1534
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:18,794
He won't let her run the house.
He's in the kitchen. He serves.

1535
01:41:19,064 --> 01:41:21,624
He tells that beige savage
what to do.

1536
01:41:27,139 --> 01:41:28,299
What?

1537
01:41:28,974 --> 01:41:32,637
l'm so sorry.
l've ruined everything!

1538
01:41:32,978 --> 01:41:36,744
Don't be silly. No one noticed the wig.
Where's the spirit gum?

1539
01:41:36,982 --> 01:41:38,472
They took everything away.

1540
01:41:38,751 --> 01:41:42,482
l have a barrette. lf you don't
move your head, it might work.

1541
01:41:42,755 --> 01:41:45,417
Thank you.
You're a very sweet girl.

1542
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:48,319
l'm so sorry, Val.

1543
01:41:48,994 --> 01:41:52,828
You didn't have this kind
of sympathy for poor Bessie Jackson!

1544
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,594
Bessie Jackson is
an insensitive cow.

1545
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:59,497
This woman is a lady.
You know, she'll be your in-law too.

1546
01:41:59,772 --> 01:42:04,436
lf he's so terrible, maybe your daughter
shouldn't marry his son!

1547
01:42:04,677 --> 01:42:09,171
He's not terrible in that way.
He won't get mixed up in some scandal.

1548
01:42:09,448 --> 01:42:11,848
l've never really seen
you before.

1549
01:42:12,685 --> 01:42:14,846
l don't even know who you are!

1550
01:42:15,187 --> 01:42:18,850
You're not worried about Barbara.
You only think of your career.

1551
01:42:19,124 --> 01:42:21,456
And poor little Mrs. Coleman!

1552
01:42:21,694 --> 01:42:26,188
You're as worried about my career
as l am. You pushed for the marriage.

1553
01:42:26,465 --> 01:42:30,629
Barbara can handle that boy.
She's modern, tough as nails.

1554
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:35,203
Poor Mrs. Coleman cries if you call
her 'Mother.' She's that vulnerable.

1555
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:39,033
lt breaks my heart.
They don't make women like that anymore.

1556
01:42:41,714 --> 01:42:43,875
Hello!
l'm home!

1557
01:42:44,383 --> 01:42:45,714
l forgot my key.

1558
01:42:45,984 --> 01:42:46,882
Who is it?

1559
01:42:47,219 --> 01:42:49,050
Val's mother, Mrs. Goldman.

1560
01:42:49,655 --> 01:42:51,316
ls Armand there?

1561
01:42:53,058 --> 01:42:54,218
Val's mother?

1562
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,891
Mrs. Goldman?

1563
01:42:57,563 --> 01:43:01,397
So this is the whole story.
The bastard has a live-in mistress.

1564
01:43:01,734 --> 01:43:03,395
l'll get the door.

1565
01:43:03,736 --> 01:43:05,897
No, you're in the wrong house!

1566
01:43:06,405 --> 01:43:11,399
Good evening. May l take your purse,
as usual? Or...

1567
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,075
for the first time.

1568
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,571
You must be Senator and Mrs. Keeley.

1569
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:22,012
Katharine Goldman. Delighted to
meet you. l'm sorry l'm so late--

1570
01:43:22,254 --> 01:43:26,588
Sorry to take so long, but Barbara--
What is she doing here?

1571
01:43:26,925 --> 01:43:27,914
Let me explain.

1572
01:43:28,193 --> 01:43:30,525
Please do.
Explain to all of us.

1573
01:43:30,763 --> 01:43:33,254
l don't want to embarrass
this lovely lady...

1574
01:43:33,532 --> 01:43:36,023
but how many mothers
does Val have?

1575
01:43:37,536 --> 01:43:39,527
This woman introduced herself...

1576
01:43:39,772 --> 01:43:43,606
as Val's mother.
How many mothers does he have?

1577
01:43:47,613 --> 01:43:48,944
Just one.

1578
01:43:53,452 --> 01:43:54,942
This is my mother.

1579
01:43:56,288 --> 01:43:59,780
My father owns the club downstairs.
My mother is the star.

1580
01:44:00,993 --> 01:44:02,460
What?

1581
01:44:03,295 --> 01:44:07,288
We lied to you, Barbara and l.
And everyone lied for us.

1582
01:44:07,966 --> 01:44:09,558
These are my parents.

1583
01:44:11,136 --> 01:44:12,967
This is my wife.

1584
01:44:13,806 --> 01:44:16,297
This is the lady who had Val.

1585
01:44:16,742 --> 01:44:18,403
Nice to meet you, Katharine.

1586
01:44:19,478 --> 01:44:20,911
Very nice, Val.

1587
01:44:21,647 --> 01:44:23,308
You've done a good job.

1588
01:44:23,816 --> 01:44:26,478
Thank you.
We're very proud of him.

1589
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:28,150
l don't understand.

1590
01:44:28,487 --> 01:44:32,821
Barbara, the nightclub downstairs,
he owns it?

1591
01:44:34,927 --> 01:44:36,758
He's not a cultural attaché?

1592
01:44:38,831 --> 01:44:42,665
No. And he isn't married
to a housewife.

1593
01:44:43,001 --> 01:44:45,993
And their name is Goldman,
not Coleman.

1594
01:44:46,505 --> 01:44:47,995
They're Jewish.

1595
01:44:48,507 --> 01:44:49,997
l don't understand.

1596
01:44:51,343 --> 01:44:54,005
He's a man.
They're both men.

1597
01:44:54,279 --> 01:44:56,270
No. You can't be Jewish.

1598
01:44:56,515 --> 01:44:58,346
No, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

1599
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:01,684
Kevin, this is a man.

1600
01:45:03,021 --> 01:45:04,010
What?

1601
01:45:04,523 --> 01:45:06,684
Don't you see?
They're gay.

1602
01:45:07,025 --> 01:45:10,517
They own the drag club downstairs.
They're two men.

1603
01:45:14,466 --> 01:45:15,797
Senator Keeley...

1604
01:45:16,535 --> 01:45:21,472
this may not help, but l want you
to know l meant every word l said...

1605
01:45:21,707 --> 01:45:26,371
about a return to family values
and a stricter moral code.

1606
01:45:26,712 --> 01:45:28,145
l feel like l'm insane.

1607
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,041
lt's really very simple.

1608
01:45:30,315 --> 01:45:32,146
She called you Mother Coleman.

1609
01:45:32,384 --> 01:45:35,876
Kevin, nothing has changed.
lt's still me.

1610
01:45:36,221 --> 01:45:39,054
With one tiny difference.

1611
01:45:40,559 --> 01:45:42,390
Well, not tiny.

1612
01:45:47,566 --> 01:45:48,897
l don't understand.

1613
01:45:49,234 --> 01:45:52,897
l'll explain in the car.
Come on, Barbara. Let's go.

1614
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:55,229
l'm not coming.

1615
01:45:56,074 --> 01:45:59,237
Barbara, please don't do this to me.

1616
01:45:59,745 --> 01:46:03,909
l may not be as vulnerable
as Mrs. Coleman...

1617
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,577
but l still have feelings.

1618
01:46:07,252 --> 01:46:10,244
Somebody has to like me best.

1619
01:46:12,925 --> 01:46:17,419
Take it easy, Louise.
Barbara, we're leaving now.

1620
01:46:18,764 --> 01:46:21,426
-You're coming with us.
-Daddy, please.

1621
01:46:22,601 --> 01:46:25,934
l've made your mother cry.
l'm up for reelection.

1622
01:46:26,138 --> 01:46:27,799
We're in the middle
of a scandal.

1623
01:46:27,873 --> 01:46:31,365
l'm in the home of a gay couple
who own a drag club.

1624
01:46:31,443 --> 01:46:35,436
You want to get married, but how many
lives must you ruin to do it?

1625
01:46:44,456 --> 01:46:45,616
l...

1626
01:46:46,124 --> 01:46:49,059
l would have liked to have
had you as my family.

1627
01:46:55,467 --> 01:46:59,130
l just want to say,
Mr. and Mrs., uh, Mr....

1628
01:46:59,805 --> 01:47:04,139
whatever your name is,
l hope this doesn't influence your vote.

1629
01:47:06,812 --> 01:47:08,302
Senator Keeley!

1630
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,880
Oh, no.

1631
01:47:12,784 --> 01:47:14,274
Did you get him?

1632
01:47:14,353 --> 01:47:16,344
No, l would have
if you hadn't said his name.

1633
01:47:16,421 --> 01:47:18,412
l wanted to make him turn.

1634
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,661
Those vultures.

1635
01:47:31,837 --> 01:47:36,501
Another television van just arrived.
And a car. lt says 'Florida Eagle.'

1636
01:47:36,842 --> 01:47:38,833
Oh, that's just print news.

1637
01:47:38,977 --> 01:47:40,808
lt'll have a great headline:

1638
01:47:40,879 --> 01:47:44,713
'Senator Jackson and His Women;
Senator Keeley and His Men'

1639
01:47:44,783 --> 01:47:46,614
lt's perfectly innocent.

1640
01:47:46,685 --> 01:47:50,951
You came to meet the parents
of the boy Barbara wants to marry.

1641
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:54,681
Louise, people in this country
don't care about details.

1642
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,292
All they trust are headlines.

1643
01:47:57,529 --> 01:48:02,364
But what do they have? lt's their word
against yours that you're even here.

1644
01:48:02,701 --> 01:48:06,034
Yes, but at some point,
l'll have to leave.

1645
01:48:06,304 --> 01:48:08,636
People will notice
if l'm never seen again.

1646
01:48:08,874 --> 01:48:12,469
Another television crew.
And they're going into the club!

1647
01:48:12,711 --> 01:48:16,374
Wouldn't you know it?
The one night l don't perform.

1648
01:48:16,715 --> 01:48:18,376
Can l get anyone some soup?

1649
01:48:18,884 --> 01:48:20,215
No.

1650
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,210
Daddy, l'm sorry.

1651
01:48:23,488 --> 01:48:24,477
l know.

1652
01:48:24,723 --> 01:48:26,054
Senator?

1653
01:48:27,225 --> 01:48:28,886
Another shot for you?

1654
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:30,492
l don't really drink.

1655
01:48:30,729 --> 01:48:33,892
Yeah, but...
now is the time to pretend.

1656
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:37,732
Give me some candy, Louise.

1657
01:48:38,570 --> 01:48:41,733
Couldn't the Keeleys slip out
at the end of the show?

1658
01:48:42,007 --> 01:48:44,908
No, they're waiting for that.
They'd be recognized.

1659
01:48:47,913 --> 01:48:49,904
Not necessarily.

1660
01:49:18,276 --> 01:49:20,267
A big hand for our girls.

1661
01:49:20,545 --> 01:49:25,278
As we come to the end of our show,
you are family, too, so sing along.

1662
01:49:25,784 --> 01:49:28,116
We are family

1663
01:49:29,621 --> 01:49:32,283
l got all my sisters with me

1664
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:35,957
We are family

1665
01:49:37,629 --> 01:49:40,291
Get up, everybody, and sing

1666
01:50:34,686 --> 01:50:36,176
Will they keep waiting?

1667
01:50:36,454 --> 01:50:40,356
They have to. There's no story
if they don't get him coming out.

1668
01:50:40,859 --> 01:50:43,521
Get up, everybody, and sing

1669
01:51:00,879 --> 01:51:03,211
We are family

1670
01:51:04,883 --> 01:51:07,545
l got all my sisters with me

1671
01:51:08,887 --> 01:51:11,219
We are family

1672
01:51:12,891 --> 01:51:15,553
Get up, everybody, and sing

1673
01:51:25,237 --> 01:51:27,569
We are family

1674
01:51:33,245 --> 01:51:37,238
Work it. Sell it.
Own it. Go, girlfriend.

1675
01:51:40,585 --> 01:51:41,574
Come on.

1676
01:51:48,927 --> 01:51:51,259
We are family

1677
01:51:56,935 --> 01:51:59,267
We are family

1678
01:52:08,446 --> 01:52:11,108
l've never danced with a man before.

1679
01:52:12,117 --> 01:52:14,108
There's always a first time.

1680
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,951
Perdóname.

1681
01:52:19,257 --> 01:52:21,248
No one will dance with me.

1682
01:52:21,326 --> 01:52:24,386
lt's this dress.
l knew white would make me look fat.

1683
01:52:24,462 --> 01:52:27,295
What about me?
l'm as pretty as these other guys.

1684
01:52:27,565 --> 01:52:28,554
Dance?

1685
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,357
Not you.
Barbara.

1686
01:52:30,402 --> 01:52:33,735
Don't go. l don't want to be
the only girl not dancing.

1687
01:52:33,972 --> 01:52:37,305
Just head for the door.
We'll be out of here soon.

1688
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:41,472
Care to dance, baby?

1689
01:53:37,035 --> 01:53:40,698
Meet me in 20 minutes
at the corner of El Dorado and Palm.

1690
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:44,031
Lady, not for a million dollars.

1691
01:54:49,607 --> 01:54:52,440
Bob Dole is gorgeous!

1692
01:55:00,285 --> 01:55:02,446
Which one is the mother?

1693
01:55:05,123 --> 01:55:06,954
l just don't know.

1694
01:55:08,293 --> 01:55:09,624
Mazel tov.

1695
01:55:09,961 --> 01:55:12,896
As a sign of your union,
you may kiss the bride.

1696
01:55:22,307 --> 01:55:23,968
l'm sorry.
