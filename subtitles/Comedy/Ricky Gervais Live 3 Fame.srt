1
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,963
A one, two, three.

2
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,513
"O, pardon me,
thou bleeding piece of earth,

3
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,777
"that I am meek
and gentle... "

4
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,495
Quiet! Quiet down, please!

5
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,876
You got big dreams.

6
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,023
You want fame?
Well, fame costs.

7
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:04,050
And right here is where
you start paying, in sweat.

8
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,694
Remember,
remember, remember

9
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:22,040
Remember, remember,
remember, remember

10
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,689
Fame!

11
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,305
Sorry!

12
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,105
Excuse me!

13
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:57,867
Sorry.

14
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,974
Oh! Excuse me.

15
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,930
Excuse me.

16
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,916
Hey,
good luck, Victor.

17
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,106
Thanks, Papa.

18
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,465
You'll see my face on
the cover of a magazine one day

19
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:23,915
You'll hear my voice blaring
out your car radio

20
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,485
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma do big things

21
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:28,902
I'ma, I'ma do big things

22
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,318
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma do big things

23
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,734
I'ma, I'ma do big things

24
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,227
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma do big things

25
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,799
I'ma, I'ma do big things

26
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,138
Big, big, big,
big, big things

27
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,358
Hey! I'ma, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma do big things

28
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,773
I'ma, I'ma do big things

29
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,216
Malik, is that you?

30
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,395
I'ma do big things

31
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,458
Group Six, you're up.

32
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,760
Where do you train?

33
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,331
Cedar Falls, Iowa.

34
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,827
My mom has a studio there.

35
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,210
You're a long way
from home.

36
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,894
Well, I'm hoping to get into
a professional ballet company.

37
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,461
We don't have a school like this
there, so my mom put me on a plane.

38
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:04,416
Well, don't worry.

39
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,605
You might be back in Iowa
sooner than you think.

40
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,905
All right, thank you.
That's enough.

41
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,087
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma,
I'ma do big things

42
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:15,503
I'ma, I'ma do big things

43
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,925
All right. Group
Eight, let's go. Right away.

44
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,619
"You cataracts
and hurricanes,

45
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:48,110
"spout till you have drench'd
our steeples, drown'd the cocks!"

46
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,663
"Chickity China
the Chinese chicken

47
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,237
"You have a drumstick
and your brain stops tickin'

48
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,656
"Chickity China
the Chinese chicken

49
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:01,497
"You have a drumstick
and your brain... "

50
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,752
Okay. I'm sorry.
Actually, one more second.

51
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:10,053
"Chickity China the Chinese chicken
Chickity China the... " Okay.

52
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,006
You talking to me?

53
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,883
You talking to me?

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,141
There's nobody else here.
You talking to me?

55
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,288
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

56
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,509
Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay.
Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

57
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:28,578
Boom! And cut real wide,

58
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,340
like a, you know,
a Scorsese wide shot.

59
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,450
I'm really, really angry.
Like, really angry.

60
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,172
And scene.

61
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:43,616
Well, Neil, I take it that
filmmaking is your number one passion.

62
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,261
Now, you wanna tell me why
you want to study acting?

63
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,788
Well, you know,
I'm a method director.

64
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:56,197
And I believe that actors
are the heart of any film.

65
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,612
And in order to speak
the language of an actor,

66
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,717
I must become an actor.

67
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:05,981
You'll do well.

68
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:24,315
Next group of
musicians, please.

69
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,392
That's enough.

70
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:41,732
I can play better.
I just need to...

71
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,495
I doubt it.
That was superb.

72
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,335
Next!

73
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,613
Five, six, seven, eight!

74
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,310
Okay, that was good. Group
Two on the floor, please.

75
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,297
My God, I can't stand
any more of this!

76
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,404
First, you spurned me
for Eddie.

77
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:50,434
Then you throw him off like
an old overcoat for Rocky!

78
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:53,081
You chew people up and then
you spit them out again!

79
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,579
I loved you.

80
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,801
Do you hear me? I loved
you! And what did it get me?

81
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,908
Yeah, I'll tell you.
A big nothing!

82
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:02,555
You're like a sponge.
You take, take, take!

83
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:06,123
Come on, babe
why don't we paint the town

84
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,844
And all that jazz

85
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,833
I'm gonna rouge my knees
And roll my stockings down

86
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,746
And all that jazz

87
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,930
Start the car
I know a whoopee spot

88
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:24,344
You've got to choose
between me or Rocky,

89
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,914
so named because of
the rocks in his head!

90
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,289
Where there's a nightly brawl And all

91
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:32,477
that

92
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:38,116
jazz

93
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,030
That jazz

94
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:45,942
Wow. You're fearless,
aren't you?

95
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,242
Some say "annoying. "

96
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:51,119
Well, you know,
it's possible to be both.

97
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:16,053
And you composed
this track as well?

98
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,927
Yep. I didn't get a chance to add the
guitar stuff yet, though. Let me show you...

99
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,156
No. No.

100
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,073
You've got talent.

101
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,755
Let's see what
we can do with it.

102
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,250
Nice.

103
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,052
Do you know
where Room 310 is?

104
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,281
If you have
already auditioned...

105
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:33,852
Thanks.
... and have been cut,

106
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,882
please leave immediately. We
have a lot of people to see today.

107
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,725
You lost?
Thank you.

108
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:45,168
Uh, yeah, actually. I'm looking for
Room 310. Mr. Dowd's class. Acting?

109
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,316
Yeah. Actually, I
think they're that way.

110
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:50,502
I saw somebody with a wig
and cape going down the hall.

111
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,650
Okay. Thanks.

112
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:53,801
Yeah.

113
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,179
Good luck!

114
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,288
Hope you get in.

115
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:01,167
Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

116
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,234
My theory is...

117
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,032
Um...

118
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:11,292
Parents are given a...

119
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,747
Jenny, Jenny, it's okay.
It's okay.

120
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:17,775
There are a lot of things in this
world to be nervous and afraid of.

121
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,884
And this
isn't one of them.

122
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:23,989
So just relax,
take a deep breath,

123
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:28,170
and then when you're ready,
I want you to talk to us

124
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,702
and not at us.

125
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,352
Okay?
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,763
My theory is that

127
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:55,905
when parents get divorced, they're
given some kind of a handout.

128
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:01,350
When my parents told me that they were
splitting, they told me three things.

129
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,424
One, "It's not your fault. "

130
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,801
Two, "It's not your fault. "

131
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:08,832
And three,
"It's not your fault. "

132
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,391
Problem is,
I don't buy it.

133
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,421
No kid does.

134
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:23,870
I've seen the pictures
of when you got married.

135
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:29,507
When you were good-looking,
and you smiled at each other.

136
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,575
Hell, when you even
just looked at each other.

137
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,990
So what happened
between then and now?

138
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,214
Me.

139
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,238
I... I came along,

140
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:49,303
and I made you tired
and cranky and anxious

141
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:55,555
and I made you lose your hair
and gain 20 extra pounds and...

142
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:01,922
Somewhere in all of that, I...
You stopped loving each other.

143
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,059
So I have my own idea
for a handout.

144
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:14,313
Next time tell me,
"One, happiness is hard.

145
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:20,682
"Two, don't make the
same mistakes we did.

146
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:28,657
"And three, okay, so maybe
it is your fault a little. "

147
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,683
You want me
to be honest?

148
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,097
You go first.

149
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:43,849
"... death, destruction
around every corner

150
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,801
"Another dead body and
you wanna keep running"

151
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:52,366
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes

152
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,780
And we both still
got room left to grow

153
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:59,462
"And all you could do
is stay alert

154
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,456
"and try to stay out
of the searchlight"

155
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,758
And we'll make
this thing work

156
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:07,440
But I think
we should take it slow

157
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,585
"No prison,
nobody make bail"

158
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:14,422
We don't know
which way to go

159
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,340
"Everybody gotta go,
but see... "

160
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,678
'Cause we're
ordinary people

161
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,287
"... it ain't no jail

162
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,119
"Think about death taking your last
breath Heart beating like a... "

163
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it. Hold it.

164
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:33,334
And this time
we'll take it slow

165
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,324
This is
the theater, Malik.

166
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,549
Not the street.

167
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,620
The theater.

168
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:43,652
Sacred.

169
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,261
This is not
a place of anger.

170
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,597
Oh, yeah, you get to
play angry characters.

171
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,319
But there are
no angry actors.

172
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:56,464
And do you know the
difference between the two?

173
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,305
All righty.

174
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,221
Marco.
Yeah.

175
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,177
Uh, where have you trained?

176
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:06,056
Um, I sing at my dad's
restaurant every once in a while.

177
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,552
That's pretty much
about it.

178
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:08,856
Really?

179
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,850
Well, that's
pretty impressive.

180
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,270
Thank you.

181
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,571
So, did I get in?

182
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,440
Welcome.

183
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,889
This year we received
over 10,000 applications

184
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:28,496
for the 200 openings from
students all across New York City.

185
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,107
And you got in.

186
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,986
Congratulations!

187
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:42,880
For the next four years, you
have the unique opportunity

188
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:45,219
to immerse yourselves
in the arts.

189
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,829
You can be spontaneous,

190
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:50,860
original, maybe even
a little outrageous.

191
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,084
You got it made, right?

192
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:54,888
Wrong.

193
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,071
You're gonna have it twice
as hard as everybody else.

194
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,217
In the mornings, you're gonna
have all your arts classes.

195
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:05,590
After lunch, you will cram
in a full day of academics.

196
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,967
Drop below a C average and
you're out. No exceptions.

197
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:11,766
Now, let me
make this very clear.

198
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,639
We don't care
about your headshot.

199
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:17,750
Or your dress size.

200
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:21,087
Or your dreams of being
in OK! Magazine,

201
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,968
on talk shows,
on the red carpet.

202
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,497
Here, you will learn
a discipline.

203
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,644
Here, you will come
to understand

204
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,675
what being a performing
artist really means.

205
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,699
Here, you will dedicate
yourself to your craft.

206
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,689
Now, if you're looking
for shortcuts,

207
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:43,680
if you want fame,

208
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,714
if you want easy rewards,

209
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,626
I highly recommend that
you get up and leave now.

210
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,196
There are many very
talented young people

211
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:55,075
who would be thrilled
to take your place.

212
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,217
So, have a great year.

213
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:05,126
Five, six, seven,
eight, go!

214
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:08,002
Extend that leg. Travel!

215
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,679
Rosie, you're getting dizzy because
you're not spotting. Now, spot!

216
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,020
I'm trying.
Yeah, not hard enough.

217
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:18,435
Shoulders down.
Press them down.

218
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,937
Stay with her, Kevin.

219
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,537
No, no. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

220
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,262
Kevin, you're a mess. Look.

221
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,986
She does passe fifth position.
Let her get a real good plie,

222
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:46,015
so you both have a good
preparation for the pas de chat.

223
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:50,197
On her next lift, you've got to
use your stomach and your back.

224
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,882
Stay strong.
You have to support her.

225
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,375
All right, take a minute.

226
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:58,331
Jeremy and Alice.

227
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,515
Kevin, you're not gonna be
a professional ballet dancer

228
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,239
unless you learn
how to partner.

229
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:05,808
And...

230
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,702
Kevin, watch Jeremy.

231
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,502
See that?

232
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:30,321
Lovely.

233
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,662
Beautiful, Alice.

234
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,306
All right. I don't want
you to think about it.

235
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:38,876
Get out of your head
and let it be spontaneous.

236
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,904
This exercise is about honing
in on your natural instincts.

237
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,741
Free your inhibitions and
physically inhabit your own body.

238
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:50,958
Otherwise, you'll never be in touch
with any characters you're playing.

239
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:53,070
Here we go.

240
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:55,140
Zip-Zip!
Zip-Zip!

241
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,330
Whoom!
Whoom!

242
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:57,405
Pow!
Pow!

243
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:00,780
Be!
Be!

244
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:01,929
Booga-Booga!
Booga-Booga!

245
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,004
Bam!
Bam!

246
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,616
Che-Whe-WoW!
Che-Whe-Wha!

247
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:11,060
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,
get out of your brain!

248
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:12,593
You got to learn
to loosen up

249
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,705
and go with the first thing
that pops in your head.

250
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:16,622
Okay, everybody folloW me.
Come on. Shake it out.

251
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:19,652
Shake it out. Shake it out.
Come on, shake, shake, shake!

252
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,149
Come on, it's the
only body you got!

253
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,989
You gotta be loose!
Loose, loose!

254
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,869
Jenny, is that loose?

255
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,128
You gotta learn not to be
embarrassed and you better do it noW.

256
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,659
All right, loose, folks!
Loose. Loosen your bodies up.

257
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,287
Keep your eyes on
the sheet music.

258
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,289
If you holdin'
my money then pay me

259
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,820
Just another day in
the life of the queen MC

260
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:29,390
Can't stop, Won't stop
Until I cop a Bentley

261
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:31,538
No, no, throW the dice.

262
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,418
Where you been, man?

263
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,723
I had to get this out
of the storage room.

264
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,875
We gotta get rollin'.

265
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,484
Yo, plug this in.
Are you serious?

266
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,058
Rosie, plug it in. Come on. Right noW?

267
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,497
Your action
is "to give love. "

268
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:49,800
Or "to seduce. "
Let's try "to seduce. "

269
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,483
All right, what does that look
like? What does that look like?

270
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,593
Okay. No, that Was awful.

271
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,123
Can I sit doWn?

272
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,313
Sure.

273
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:00,117
Thanks.

274
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:02,264
I just met these agents,
like, a month and a half ago,

275
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,647
and they've been
sending me out,

276
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:06,715
and I guess these casting directors are
really excited to see me for this pilot.

277
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,248
You didn't like
the shaking?

278
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:10,897
See, I didn't see that as
fun. It was more of a hassle.

279
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,469
It doesn't really have
anything to do with acting.

280
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:16,728
I can maybe introduce you guys to
the agents if you Want. You knoW?

281
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,071
But it loosens you.

282
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,333
Okay, what happens if your
character's, like, really tense?

283
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,826
BOY: Joe, does it Work?

284
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,161
Today?

285
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:28,236
No.

286
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,537
I keep telling her to just
relax. It's nothing big.

287
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,722
But I have too much Work
to do after school.

288
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,371
I have vocal exercises
and memorizing monologues,

289
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:37,596
and that's all before I even
start on my normal homeWork.

290
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:40,011
You actually do
all that stuff?

291
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:42,353
Huh?

292
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:44,615
There's a drum set over
there. I dare you to go on it.

293
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:45,920
HoW many years
have you been rapping?

294
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,262
She Won in
the last round.

295
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,372
You are retarded. Your
brain is not working right.

296
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,405
Yeah?
Is that so?

297
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:03,105
Hi.
Hi.

298
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,561
This is Marco.
HoW you doing?

299
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,126
You knoW I'm gonna eat you
up in front of everybody.

300
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,160
You can never...

301
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,277
Whoa!

302
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:41,964
Oh, yeah!

303
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:52,436
You need to get your
life straight for Christ's sake

304
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,545
Because your mind state ain't
moving as fast as my pace

305
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,692
You're spending cheese
every other day on neW kicks

306
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,535
It's useless, sometimes
I Wonder if you're stupid

307
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,528
Yo, I'm a real boss
chick You better believe it

308
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:02,524
I buy what I Want
whenever I need it

309
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,593
A girl like me don't Worry about
haters and all that light stuff

310
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,050
I'll Worry about it later

311
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,892
You're acting like a
dummy and I'm mad Mad?

312
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,387
You think We don't knoW you
get your money from your dad

313
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:11,538
What?
It's obvious

314
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:12,958
You never even
had a job before

315

00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,086

00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:06,623

331
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:46,363
Hey.

332
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,892
Not your thing?

333
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:52,731
Not really.

334
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:57,719
My parents Would die
if they saw that.

335
00:23:57,796 --> 00:23:59,521
They think it's
a conservatory.

336
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,170
Everyone practicing
cello all day.

337
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,423
Hey, I'm Denise.

338
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:12,411
Malik.

339
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:13,675
Mind if I sit doWn?

340
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,650
You knoW, if it makes
you feel any better,

341
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,989
my mom doesn't
even knoW I go here.

342
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,217
Seriously?

343
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,096
She thinks I'm doWn
at the public high school.

344
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:33,124
She Works three jobs.
She's never gonna check.

345
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:36,309
Why don't you
just tell her?

346
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:41,371
She doesn't want me to be
an actor or a rapper.

347
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,468
Look, what about you?

348
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:52,036
I mean, I see you playing the piano
like you're Beethoven and everything.

349
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,916
Is that your thing?

350
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,141
Yeah.
Cool.

351
00:24:56,218 --> 00:25:00,170
Well, actually,
I don't knoW.

352
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,392
I mean, I guess,
I think it...

353
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,197
Okay, truth is,

354
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:07,955
I've never tried
anything else.

355
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:10,410
Oh.

356
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,783
What's up, man?
What you looking at?

357
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,777
I'm just Watching
this girl dance.

358
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,235
Yeah, I've seen her.

359
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:35,959
But she thinks she's, like, the
most talented kid in the school.

360
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,453
Maybe she is.

361
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,251
Well, I gotta go. You Want to
keep staring, go right ahead, man.

362
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:42,557
See you.

363
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:43,746
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:47,582
But I will Wait
for you to figure it out

365
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:53,221
Soon you'll be chasing me through
the out door onto the street

366
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:56,827
I will be kneeling
on the ground

367
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:09,522
Can I help you?

368
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:16,466
You knoW,
you can really dance.

369
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,808
Thanks
for the newsflash.

370
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:23,602
But I think you could dance a little
better, though, if your music Wasn't so Wack.

371
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,592
I'm just saying.

372
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,936
Excuse me?

373
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:32,540
Yeah. I mean,
if you really Wanna dance,

374
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:35,263
you need something
way better than that.

375
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:37,833
And you knoW
just what that is.

376
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:40,020
Yeah.

377
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,936
Here, listen.

378
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,576
That's just a demo, too.

379
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:50,416
I mean, I'm adding, like,
a lot more bass and effects.

380
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:52,411
The second,
the second bar,

381
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,021
that's not even the final
part, let me tell you.

382
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:57,128
I got more stuff that
I can shoW you. Not bad.

383
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,697
I got more tracks.

384
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,383
I'm sure you do.

385
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,547
There's a
somebody I'm longing to see

386
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:16,614
I hope that he

387
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:19,684
Turns out to be

388
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:23,826
Someone who'll watch

389
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,626
Over me

390
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:36,484
I'm a little lamb
who's lost in the Wood

391
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,899
I knoW I could

392
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:42,316
AIWays be good

393
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:46,806
To one who'll watch

394
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,144
Over me

395
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,011
Okay. Very good, Jenny.

396
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,429
Thank you.

397
00:27:57,506 --> 00:28:01,841
Except for the fact that you have
no idea what you're singing about.

398
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:06,483
Well, it's about a girl who gets her heart
broken and is looking for another guy.

399
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:10,318
Yeah. I Was
not feeling that from you.

400
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:13,504
That is technically what the song is
about. Okay, this is very important.

401
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:15,036
Jenny, for your
homework tonight,

402
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:18,910
I Want you to go home and write
out all the lyrics to that song

403
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:22,631
and then Work on them like
they're an acting monologue. Okay?

404
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:26,084
Because there's really
no point in singing a song

405
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,541
if you don't understand
what it is you're saying.

406
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,996
Okay, go sit doWn. Thanks.

407
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:36,480
It Was pretty. I just wasn't
getting a lot out of it. All right?

408
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,475
Okay.
Okay.

409
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,162
Life will go on.

410
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:42,389
Okay, next.

411
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:43,884
Uh...

412
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:46,416
Let's see. Marco.

413
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,602
That's right.

414
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,057
I Want you to sing
the same song,

415
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,665
but I want us to all
really understand

416
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:55,738
what the song is about.
Do you knoW it?

417
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,500
Yeah. A little bit.

418
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:58,615
A little bit?

419
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:01,874
All right, well, this should
be interesting. Come on.

420
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:04,406
Hurry up. Grass isn't
getting any greener.

421
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:12,040
Could you change it
to E-flat?

422
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:25,926
There's a
somebody I'm longing to see

423
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,879
I hope that she

424
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,294
Turns out to be

425
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:37,089
Someone who'll watch

426
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,465
Over me

427
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:51,013
I'm a little lamb
who's lost in the Wood

428
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,121
I knoW I could

429
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,574
AIWays be good

430
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:04,094
To one who'll watch

431
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:07,969
Over me

432
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:12,764
Yes. That's what I
was talking about, everybody.

433
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,027
Very good, Marco.
Thank you.

434
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,513
So you live in Long Island, right? Yep.

435
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,619
And stay with my dad enough days
to meet the residency requirement.

436
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,459
I'd like to stay with
my mom more, but...

437
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,571
Yeah. Is it Worth it?

438
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:28,568
Of course.

439
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:32,596
It's what I want. AIWays
Wanted. You understand.

440
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,048
I mean, not everyone
is like you, Jenny.

441
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,231
You knoW, as committed and focused
as you are. All the damn time.

442
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:41,917
Yeah, but you're the
best singer in our class.

443
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:44,334
With that kind of a talent,
you have a responsibility.

444
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,326
I mean, the only thing
I gotta do is be happy.

445
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:50,586
What?

446
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,387
Do you alWays take
things this lightly?

447
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:56,379
I Would give anything in order
to stand up in front of class

448
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,797
and sing a song and
be completely in tune.

449
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:00,023
Or whiz through
a monologue

450
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,674
and have everybody laughing. Jenny...

451
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:05,355
And there are so many kids in this city
that Would love to be going to this school.

452
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,843
You Wouldn't understand.
See you in class, Marco.

453
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,705
These are not diaries.

454
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,196
They're journals.

455
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:28,946
I'm not interested in
what you had for breakfast,

456
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,243
or what you think of
your stepmom's boob job.

457
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,078
Not even your
latest breakup.

458
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:40,877
I wanna knoW about
the World you inhabit.

459
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,716
The people around you.

460
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,708
Who are they?

461
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,194
HoW do they behave?

462
00:31:56,603 --> 00:32:02,051
Language and behavior, that's
all the actor's got to Work with.

463
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:05,772
So keep your eyes open.

464
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,763
Observe. Record.

465
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,605
Mr. Bazinska,
this is disgraceful.

466
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:27,752
It's unhealthy, it's unsanitary.
No, it's fine. It's clean.

467
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,823
No, it's not unsanitary. It's...
The only thing missing from it

468
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,660
is a finger on the scale. Your
finger on the scale. You're the Worst.

469
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:39,375
HoW is emotion
expressed through action?

470
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,791
Gesture?

471
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,359
That's disgusting.
What can I say.

472
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:47,239
Look, it's clean.
So they got all the...

473
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:48,581
NoW what are you doing?

474
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:51,652
Taking my pictures without
asking! Sorry. Homework.

475
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:54,183
You're supposed to get me to write
off something before you do that.

476
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,292
I could sue you,
and I could sue you.

477
00:32:58,364 --> 00:32:59,821
Dad, you home?

478
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:13,938
Understand other people. And
you'll begin to understand yourself.

479
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:47,657
Bye, Mr. Cranston.

480
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,846
Ms. Dupree.

481
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:51,491
Yes?

482
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:54,715
You practice more than any
other student here at P.A.

483
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,399
You are a very talented
classical pianist.

484
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:59,394
Thank you, Mr. Cranston.

485
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,692
I happen to be looking
for an accompanist

486
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,302
for our spring production
of Chicago.

487
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:08,448
It might serve you Well
to branch out a bit.

488
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:10,288
Expand your horizons.

489
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,163
Okay, so what
does this entail?

490
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,771
It's just a couple rehearsals.
It might go a little late...

491
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,344
Okay, what's "late"?

492
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,571
Midnight.

493
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:23,176
Midnight? Only on the
nights it performs.

494
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,865
That's what
Mr. Cranston said.

495
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:28,778
Daddy, it's a big honor for a freshman to
be asked to play for one of the musicals.

496
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,311
And it's Chicago!
Do you realize...

497
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,883
You are training to be
a classical pianist.

498
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,685
Can you tell me hoW
playing honky-tonk songs

499
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,336
till all hours of the night
is gonna help with that?

500
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:39,980
It Won't, but it
would be fun. Fun!

501
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:42,972
Something neW! Daddy, I Want to do
something different for a change.

502
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,234
"Something different" was
never part of the deal, Denise.

503
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,569
You will be saying "no" or I will be
pulling you out of that school. Period.

504
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:56,933
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,496
Ma, I Was gonna tell you.

506
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:04,107
Performing Arts?

507
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,217
Do you have any idea
hoW risky that is?

508
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:07,368
As a career?

509
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,482
Of course I do.

510
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:11,244
Malik, you're trying to do
something everyone Wants to do.

511
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:14,236
Every teenager on this block thinks
they can make it as the next rapper...

512
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,534
Look, Ma. You have to let me stay
there. It's everything I have noW.

513
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,719
I just don't knoW
about this.

514
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:24,208
Look, they're good grades!
Did you even look at it?

515
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:27,429
Look, Ma.

516
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,921
I'm talented.

517
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:33,260
If somebody's gotta make it
out there, why can't it be me?

518
00:35:33,336 --> 00:35:36,446
And who in the World told
you you Were so special?

519
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:38,785
You did.

520
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:49,142
I just can't deal with this
right noW. I'm late for Work.

521
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:36,019
All right. Bobby.

522
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,006
Okay. Kevin!

523
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,785
Look out!

524
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,472
Yeah?
Master Tavares,

525
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:39,848
you play with elan,
brio, gusto, panache

526
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,189
and a host of foreign adjectives
that indicate excessive style.

527
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:45,450
What you neglect to do is
play the music as written.

528
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:48,481
And though your interpretation
may be entertaining,

529
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,204
it is of no value
in my class.

530
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:53,888
May I suggest that the only thing of
value you could possibly bring to Bach

531
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,615
is your respect.

532
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,532
And unless you devote
yourself to study,

533
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,682
drill and mastery
of technique,

534
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:03,938
you will be of little or no value
to anyone. Including yourself.

535
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:07,276
NoW let's try this
again, as written.

536
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:10,230
Parenthetically,

537
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:15,177
study, drill and technique
do not stifle talent.

538
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:19,129
They free it. Once more.

539
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:22,812
Mr. Cranston.
This music, it's boring.

540
00:38:23,732 --> 00:38:24,808
It's just not my thing.

541
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,878
No, it's Bach's thing.

542
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:28,642
Stubby little German guy.
Wore a wig.

543
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,252
Yeah, and he died
1,000 years ago.

544
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:35,354
His teachers told him to stop
playing music his Way. He said no.

545
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:37,120
Really?

546
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:40,649
Well, if his teachers told
him that, then they Were wrong.

547
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:42,873
And should your music

548
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,445
survive for
the next 350 years,

549
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:48,552
please alloW me to
apologize in advance.

550
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:51,888
Proceed. We will suffer
through it with you.

551
00:38:55,611 --> 00:38:57,375
She was
eight years old.

552
00:38:58,143 --> 00:38:59,869
Her name Was Ayanna.

553
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,745
Means "beautiful floWer. "

554
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:08,652
She Was alWays
on the street, playing,

555
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,836
jumping rope.

556
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,133
Happiest girl
you ever saw.

557
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:19,547
She didn't see
the man in the car

558
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,654
or the man running past,
until the bullets fleW.

559
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:25,799
The day after
she Was buried,

560
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,744
I got this.

561
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,311
I Was only 13
at the time.

562
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:37,960
I thought my mom
would whup my ass.

563
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:41,681
But she didn't.

564
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:48,816
Said I should remember
every single day

565
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:55,987
what happened to
my little sister.

566
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,244
HoW did
her death affect you?

567
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,656
I mean, you've
given us the facts.

568
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:10,487
And you Waited till the end to let
us knoW that Ayanna Was your sister,

569
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:13,404
which Was very dramatic.

570
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:17,546
But I want to knoW
hoW you felt.

571
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:22,304
And I think you need
to knoW hoW you felt.

572
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,595
HoW do you think I felt?

573
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:32,237
Well, I have no idea.
Why don't you tell us?

574
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:37,686
You knoW what?
ScreW this.

575
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:43,325
I ain't gonna cry for you.
I gave you the truth.

576
00:40:43,862 --> 00:40:47,161
Is that what happened? Did
you cry the night she died?

577
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:51,650
Did you blame yourself? Do you
think you could have prevented it?

578
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,981
Listen, I'm
gonna be famous.

579
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,550
And I don't need you
or your therapy bullshit!

580
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,045
So screW this and
screW this class!

581
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:07,070
The theater is not a
place for cowards, Malik.

582
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:02,998
Sometimes I Wonder

583
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:06,527
Where I've been

584
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,670
Who I am

585
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:14,162
Do I fit in?

586
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,997

Do I fit in?

Attention, students.

626

After-school rehearsal will be canceled
due to the dance performance class.

You keep asking me out

733
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,530
Why do you keep trying?

734
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:01,907
I don't knoW. I feel
like if I keep asking,

Do you think you'll

742
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:30,869
Will it be enough to get you
into a professional company?

743
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,249
HoW am I
supposed to knoW?

You knoW, Alice,

745
00:53:33,437 --> 00:53:36,966
Dr. Malamed thinks
that your aloofness

746
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:39,730
is a sign of subclinical depression.

747
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:41,763
So, are you depressed?

748
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,025
No, Dad. I'm bored
like I alWays am.

749
00:53:45,446 --> 00:53:46,559
Alice!

750
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:51,238
Excuse me, sir.
Huh? Oh, I'm with them.

751
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,075
May I take your hat?

752
00:53:54,152 --> 00:53:55,381
No, no...

753
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:56,762
Are you sure I
can't take your hat?

754
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:58,258
Who is that?

755
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,829
The opposite of boring.

756
00:54:01,748 --> 00:54:03,935
Hey, baby. HoW are you?

757
00:54:04,012 --> 00:54:05,277

These your parents?

759
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:11,836
I knoW,
I knoW, it's just that...

760
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,827
I've never had to Work
this hard in my entire life.

761
00:54:15,943 --> 00:54:19,202
And they don't really tell
you what it's gonna be like.

762
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,189
I don't knoW why I'm
telling you all of this.

763
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:28,831
Everything seems to come
so easily to you.

764
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:31,247
No, that's not true.

765
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,699
I've just... I've been
performing my whole life.

766

I mean, as soon as I could,
I Was out there singing.

I will tell you this,

768
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,833
no one makes as much in
tips as a first grader.

769
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,552
So, you play
the piano, too?

00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,676
I mean, you see me sing all the
time at school. There's no need to...

773
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,514
Yeah, I Want to hear something
different. Come on, Marco.

774

00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,916
If I Walk,
would you run?

788
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:55,793
If I stop,
would you come?

789
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,785
If I say
you're the one

790
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:01,393
would you believe me?

791
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,999
If I ask you to stay

792
00:56:05,076 --> 00:56:07,953
would you shoW me the Way?

793
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,485
Tell me what to say

794
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,901
So you don't leave me

795
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:16,968
The World is
catching up to you

796
00:56:17,045 --> 00:56:19,919
while you're running aWay

797
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:23,411
To chase your dreams

798
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:28,550
It's time for us
to make a move

799
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:33,577
'Cause We are asking
one another to change

800
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:36,339
And maybe I'm not ready

801
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:41,672
But I'll try for your love

802
00:56:42,092 --> 00:56:47,501
I can hide up above

803
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:53,447
I will try for your love

804
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:59,010
we've been hiding enough

805
00:57:00,006 --> 00:57:05,416
I will try for your love

806
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:11,938
I can hide up above

807
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,310
If I Walk,
would you run?

808
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:19,379
If I stop,
would you come?

809
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:22,371
If I say
you're the one

810
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:27,396
would you believe me?

811
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:41,206
So I'm guessing
you liked it?

812
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,468
You could say that.

813
00:58:05,872 --> 00:58:08,786
Okay, that Was good, but let's take
it again from bar four-twenty. Okay?

814
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:09,975
Denise!

815
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:12,122
We got in
with the label.

816
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:14,080
They Want us to come in
and talk about our stuff.

817
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:15,845
Can you go?
TomorroW, after school.

818
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,684
I'm supposed to have extra
piano... No, no, cancel it.

819
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,830
No, no. Cancel it, cancel it. Meet
me out front at 3:00, all right?

820
00:58:20,906 --> 00:58:23,823
Sorry. This is it, Denise.
Our big break. I can feel it!

821
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:31,994
Okay. Sorry,
let's... Sorry.

822
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:35,601
What
a mighty God we serve

823
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:39,551
What a mighty God We serve

824
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:43,617
Angels boW before him
Heaven and earth adore him

825
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:47,751
What a mighty God
What a mighty God

826
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:51,280
What a mighty God
we serve

827
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:53,198
He's mighty
He's mighty

828
00:58:53,274 --> 00:58:55,155
He's a mighty God
He's a mighty God

829
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,995
He's mighty
He's mighty

830
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:59,256
He's a mighty God
He's a mighty God

831
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:02,517
What a mighty God
What a mighty God

832
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:09,536
What a mighty God
we serve

833
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:12,761
So, I have
an audition later today,

834
00:59:12,835 --> 00:59:15,062
but I don't think I'll go
because I'll never get it.

835
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,479
But you're Working with
a casting director. That's huge.

836
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,894
See, that's what
I thought, too.

837
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:21,583
And they do get me
some auditions,

838
00:59:21,698 --> 00:59:23,730
but I'm up against
the same 15 girls.

839
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:25,341
And they alWays
get the part.

840
00:59:25,457 --> 00:59:27,758
Yeah, maybe,
but they're not Joy.

841
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:32,515
Yeah, Well, me, I've got a lot of good
shit happening off of my YouTube page.

842
00:59:32,744 --> 00:59:34,740
In fact, I'm meeting
with a producer today

843
00:59:34,856 --> 00:59:37,538
about putting together
an independent film.

844
00:59:37,768 --> 00:59:38,843
What?

845
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,110
Yeah. Uh...

846
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:45,557
I have an idea
for a short.

847
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:48,433
It's about
a legendary director

848
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,967
who suddenly dies
while filming his movie.

849
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:54,763
So his inadequate son decides to
honor his father by finishing the film,

850
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,482
but the only help he has is
this misfit cast of characters,

851
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,018
like, straight out
of a Wes Anderson.

852
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:03,279
It's The Life Aquatic meets
The Bad and the Beautiful.

853
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:05,655
Sounds really
artistic, Neil.

854
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,306
Well, I think so.

855
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:09,915
Hopefully,
Sundance agrees.

856
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:30,782
Small place.
Yeah.

857
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,353
You want some coffee
or some water?

858
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,388
I'm all right. You don't
want to see me on coffee.

859
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,500
Wired enough as is.

860
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:36,917
Take a seat.

861
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:39,029
The script is good.

862
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,215
Thank you.

863
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:45,358
It's, you knoW, a labor of love of
mine and it's not quite there yet.

864
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:47,696
I Would be honored
to take it on.

865
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:52,685
We don't often do shorts, but, in
your case, we'll make an exception.

866
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,409
Eddie, that's...
That's amazing!

867
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,399
NoW... NoW, let's talk about the budget.

868
01:00:58,476 --> 01:01:00,894
Yeah, let's talk about it.
Let's talk about the budget.

869
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:03,386
HoW are you gonna
raise the money?

870
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,755
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.

871
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,557
I don't understand. Shouldn't
he be giving you the money?

872
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:12,939
Isn't that what
producers do?

873
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:16,467
He's not the financier. He's the
producer. And there's a difference.

874
01:01:16,544 --> 01:01:18,462
All I need you to do is
kick in, like, five grand.

875
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:19,534
And I knoW. I'm aware.

876
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:21,837
I'm aware that's a lot of
money. I really get it. I get it.

877
01:01:21,914 --> 01:01:24,791
But, you knoW, Eddie says
we could even, you knoW...

878
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:27,514
We could sell it to
television and make a profit.

879
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:28,934
You gotta trust me
on this one, Dad.

880
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:31,388
I'd be shooting on a
real film and everything.

881
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:34,764
I mean, Dad... I mean,
this is the real deal, Dad.

882
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:37,527
The real deal, huh?
You think so?

883
01:01:41,554 --> 01:01:42,973
Come on, Dad.

884
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,043
Help a brother out.

885
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:52,601
So this is what it's like
to have a social life?

886
01:01:52,945 --> 01:01:54,595
Yeah, Well, it beats memorizing
Shakespeare, doesn't it?

887
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:55,746
Yeah.

888
01:01:57,624 --> 01:01:59,198
HoW long do We
have to stay here?

889
01:01:59,274 --> 01:02:01,153
I don't knoW. Come on,
let's just have fun.

890
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,574
We haven't been
out in a while.

891
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:03,763
Okay.

892
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,946
I'll get us some drinks. Okay.

893
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:22,981
Well, look who it is.

894
01:02:23,135 --> 01:02:25,398
Andy! Hey!
Hey! Um...

895
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:27,967
Jenny. Jenny. That's right. Of course.

896
01:02:28,082 --> 01:02:29,385
I remember you
from last year.

897
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:32,034
You did the shoW with
the monologue from...

898
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,144
From Proof, right?

899
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:34,143
Yeah!

900
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,673
Yeah, you Were
really good.

901
01:02:37,556 --> 01:02:39,552
Thank you.
You're Welcome.

902
01:02:39,742 --> 01:02:42,159
So hoW is P.A.?
I kind of miss it.

903
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,423
It's the same-old,
same-old.

904
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:46,915
But I've been watching you on your shoW.

905
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:48,106
Oh, really?
Yeah.

906
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:51,060
Well, thanks. Yeah,
it's going pretty Well.

907
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:53,131
I got a big storyline
right noW, so...

908
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,971
Andy.
It's kind of bloWing up.

909
01:02:55,048 --> 01:02:56,813
We're slamming shots, bro. Yeah. Shots.

910
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,497
Give me one second. I'm
talking to Jenny. Um...

911
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:00,685
You want to take shots?

912
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:01,800
I'm good, thanks.

913
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:03,870
Are you sure? Okay.
Yeah.

914
01:03:05,137 --> 01:03:08,280
You knoW, they're looking
for day players on the shoW.

915
01:03:08,396 --> 01:03:10,546
Would that be something
you might be interested in?

916
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,806
Seriously? Yeah. I mean,
I could put in a good Word.

917
01:03:13,883 --> 01:03:17,872
Yeah! That Would
be perfect. Thank you.

918
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:20,670
Okay. So hoW should we do this?
Do you Want to give me your number?

919
01:03:20,747 --> 01:03:22,435
Yeah, I don't think
I have a pen or a...

920
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:25,465
No, no, don't Worry about it.
Just put it right in here.

921
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:26,963
Okay.

922
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:29,494
Um...

923
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,142
I think that's it.

924
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:33,713
Yeah, I can do this.
Yeah, I don't... Yeah, okay.

925
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:37,127
Perfect. Well, it's so good
to see you. You look great.

926
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:38,432
Thanks. You, too.

927
01:03:38,509 --> 01:03:39,543
All right.
I'll see you later.

928
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,386
Okay.

929
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:43,456
Bye.
See you.

930
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,136
See you.

931
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:51,704
Shots up.
Ready to go.

932
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:54,081
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

933
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:58,110
All We Were doing
was talking, okay?

934
01:03:58,187 --> 01:03:59,874
He saw my monologue
from P.A.

935
01:03:59,951 --> 01:04:02,521
That's all We were talking
about. He Wants to help me.

936
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:04,746
God, could you possibly
be that naive?

937
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:06,165
He's trying to hook up
with you, Jenny.

938
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,005
That's ridiculous.
He's a big-time actor.

939
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:09,809
He can hook up
with whoever he wants.

940
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:12,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, he loves
your talent. That's what he loves.

941
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:16,789
So it's that preposterous that somebody
might actually like me for my talent?

942
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:19,590
No, of course not.

943
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:23,120
Look, no one believes in you
more than I do, and you knoW that.

944
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:26,226
Honestly, it's just the
Way he Was looking at you.

945
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:28,297
Fine.

946
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:33,131
If it means that much to you, I
Won't talk to him ever again. Promise.

947
01:04:34,973 --> 01:04:36,776
NoW let's get
out of here.

948
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,383
We can go to my
dad's apartment.

949
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,727
What, noW?
Mmm-hmm.

950
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,951
He's on a date.

951
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:45,560
He Won't be back
until later.

952
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,504
There's definitely
something there.

953
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,997
Something that
could be interesting.

954
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:13,905
Check it out. We've got
an A&R meeting next Week.

955
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:15,787
What I'd like to do
is play it for the team,

956
01:05:15,863 --> 01:05:17,626
see what kind of
feedback We get,

957
01:05:17,702 --> 01:05:19,162
and I'll get
back to you.

958
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:20,235
Nice.

959
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:23,074
Yo, yo, did you see him
bobbing his head?

960
01:05:23,188 --> 01:05:25,529
He Was bobbing his head to
himself. He Was bobbing...

961
01:05:25,605 --> 01:05:28,098
Guys, guys. He didn't say he wanted us.

962
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,900
Did you not hear what he
said? He said, "Interesting. "

963
01:05:30,977 --> 01:05:32,319
Interesting!
Man, We are so in.

964
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:35,041
Yo, I'm gonna give my moms a
house in the Hamptons on the beach.

965
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:36,769
Guys?
It's gonna be crazy.

966
01:05:41,295 --> 01:05:43,212
You're not
even trying, Rosie.

967
01:05:43,289 --> 01:05:47,356
Ballet is a requirement for every
student dancer in this school.

968
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:49,309
But, Ms. Kraft,
I'm good at hip-hop!

969
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:54,336
My job isn't to cast music videos.
It's to train serious dancers.

970
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:57,596
P.A. Isn't about just
doing whatever you Want.

971
01:05:57,673 --> 01:06:00,436
It's about becoming
a complete performer.

972
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,812
I... I don't knoW
where you fit in here.

973
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:06,075
Fit in here? What's
that supposed to mean?

974
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:08,720
It means you're gonna keep flailing
around and you're not gonna...

975
01:06:08,796 --> 01:06:10,561
This isn't about me,
is it?

976
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:12,403
You don't like my body.
Admit it!

977
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,392
Don't be ridiculous. Modern companies
are full of girls who don't have the...

978
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:19,421
Oh, really? Then hoW come this department
is filled with skinny little girls

979
01:06:19,498 --> 01:06:23,067
with no titties and tight little butts,
Walking around drinking Diet Coke?

980
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:25,753
I ain't never gonna be like
them. And I don't wanna be.

981
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:27,822
You Want girls who've
been starving themselves,

982
01:06:27,899 --> 01:06:30,509
and look like they're 11
and have so little body fat

983
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:33,156
they can't even get a period
to dance parts for real Women.

984
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:34,461
And that sucks!

985
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:38,102
You're part of a machinery of
oppression, Ms. Kraft. Just admit it.

986
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,514
Hey! First of all, don't
speak to me like that.

987
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:45,505
Don't speak to any teacher
like that. It's very rude.

988
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,926
It's also very ugly.

989
01:06:47,577 --> 01:06:49,458
And second of all,
you knoW that's not true.

990
01:06:49,535 --> 01:06:51,223
I Want my dancers
to be healthy,

991
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,176
and I talk to you all
about that all the time.

992
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:56,670
You don't have
a good technique,

993
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,661
and you're not Working
toward a technique.

994
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:02,002
And yet,
I Wanna keep you here.

995
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:04,226
Shit.

996
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:11,130
Jenny! Guess what.

997
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:12,281
What?

998
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:13,391
I got a job.

999
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:14,544
You're kidding!

1000
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:17,460
I've been trying to find you to tell
you that it's the best shoW ever,

1001
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:19,032
and I'm only
semi-regular at first,

1002
01:07:19,108 --> 01:07:20,488
but then they said
I could get a lead,

1003
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:22,522
and it's so amazing
you Won't believe it.

1004
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:24,556
Yay! Okay.
So what shoW is it?

1005
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:25,975
Sesame Street.

1006
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:27,471
Holy shit.
That shoW's still on?

1007
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:29,351
I'm gonna
get paid to act.

1008
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:30,578
That's incredible!

1009
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:31,921
You bitch.

1010
01:07:31,998 --> 01:07:34,835
I Wonder if they need any hot,
young, neW, macho director types.

1011
01:07:34,912 --> 01:07:37,749
I mean, I knoW they're alWays
looking for neW talent on that shoW.

1012
01:07:37,826 --> 01:07:39,093
I don't think so.

1013
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:41,854
But if you're really nice
and give me back rubs,

1014
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,696
I might let you be
part of my entourage.

1015
01:07:43,773 --> 01:07:45,768
Ooh, back rubs.
You mean like...

1016
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:49,335
Oh, I'm sorry, did that hurt? I'm sorry.

1017
01:07:58,005 --> 01:07:59,193
Yeah. You knoW what?

1018
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,956
Singing in front of all of
your friends in the classroom

1019
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:04,257
is one thing,
but noW We're here.

1020
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,636
And you guys
are gonna sing

1021
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:09,395
in front of this lovely
group of total strangers,

1022
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:12,963
who actually are sort of hoping
that you'll be really bad.

1023
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:15,266
It's gonna be great.

1024
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:19,637
Also, try to have fun, because
it's part of your grade.

1025
01:08:22,324 --> 01:08:25,010
I get knocked
doWn But I get up again

1026
01:08:25,086 --> 01:08:26,696
You're never
gonna keep me doWn

1027
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,306
I get knocked doWn
But I get up again

1028
01:08:29,382 --> 01:08:31,644
You're never
gonna keep me doWn

1029
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:40,084
Pissing the night aWay

1030
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,155
I have a tendency
to Wear my mind on my sleeve

1031
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:44,225
I have a history
of losing my shirt

1032
01:08:44,302 --> 01:08:46,414
It's been one Week
since you looked at me

1033
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,522
Cocked your head to the
side and said, "I'm sorry"

1034
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,902
Five days since
you laughed at me

1035
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,124
Three days since
the living room

1036
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,384
It'll still be two days
till We say We're sorry

1037
01:08:58,456 --> 01:09:00,951
Two days till... Sorry

1038
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:05,898
All right! WoW. Thank
you. You guys are aWesome.

1039
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,504
So tonight, I Would
love to donate my time.

1040
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,500
I'm gonna do a little
something special.

1041
01:09:11,577 --> 01:09:14,991
I'm gonna give my time over to
someone very important to us.

1042
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,871
Our teacher and hero...
No.

1043
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:19,976
...Ms. Fran Rowan!

1044
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:21,282
No!

1045
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:24,733
Yes! It's all you.
You brought us here.

1046
01:09:24,848 --> 01:09:26,380
That's our teacher!

1047
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:28,070
Yeah, thank you.

1048
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:29,489
Shake it.

1049
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:34,476
Oh, God.
HoW did this happen?

1050
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,661
Okay, you're expelled.
Hope it Was Worth it.

1051
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:40,727
Oh, no. All right,
I don't even knoW...

1052
01:09:42,608 --> 01:09:46,252
Do you have You Took Advantage
of Me by Rodgers and Hart?

1053
01:09:46,637 --> 01:09:48,133
Say no. Please say no.
Yep. We have it!

1054
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:49,666
They have it!

1055
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:51,778
Good. Perfect!

1056
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,305
Yeah, Rodgers and Hart.

1057
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,256
A mental deficient

1058
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:00,100
You will grade me

1059
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:04,665
I've given you
plenty of data

1060
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:11,263
You came, you saw,
you slayed me

1061
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:17,783
And that-a is that-a!

1062
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:29,942
I'm a sentimental sap,
that's all

1063
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:35,198
What's the use of
trying not to fall?

1064
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:38,306
I have no will

1065
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:41,298
You've made your kill

1066
01:10:41,681 --> 01:10:45,632
'Cause you took
advantage of me

1067
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,661
She's amazing!

1068
01:10:48,737 --> 01:10:49,927
Of course she is.

1069
01:10:50,043 --> 01:10:53,111
I'm so hot and bothered,
that I don't knoW

1070
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:57,062
My elboW from my ear

1071
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:04,198
I suffer something awful
every time you go

1072
01:11:06,423 --> 01:11:08,917
It's Worse
when you're near

1073
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:15,665
Here am I with all
my bridges burned

1074
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,075
Just a babe in arms
where you're concerned

1075
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,836
So lock the doors

1076
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,484
Lock that door!

1077
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:31,125
And call me yours

1078
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:36,570
Because you took

1079
01:11:37,148 --> 01:11:43,283
You took advantage of me

1080
01:11:50,957 --> 01:11:52,644
Oh, my God,
that Was amazing!

1081
01:11:52,759 --> 01:11:54,255
Why are you guys
so boring in class

1082
01:11:54,332 --> 01:11:56,173
and so great at
karaoke tonight?

1083
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:58,589
Why didn't you ever bring us
there before? That was so much fun.

1084
01:11:58,666 --> 01:11:59,971
I knoW. I should've
done it before.

1085
01:12:00,048 --> 01:12:02,158
You knoW, that Was so great,
because it's not about you.

1086
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,342
It's about the audience, and I
really saw that. It Was great.

1087
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:05,763
I knoW. You knoW what else is great?

1088
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,872
That girl gave me her
number. That Was a guy, Neil.

1089
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,484
Irregardless,
I was flattered.

1090
01:12:09,599 --> 01:12:11,978
Joy, you Were on fire. It
was unbelievable. Thank you.

1091
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:14,506
I mean,
it Was so cute and good.

1092
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:17,155
And completely
ambushed by Kevin.

1093
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,189
Hat's off.
Wait, one thing.

1094
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:19,802
HoW come you never sang in
front of us until tonight?

1095
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:21,374
Oh, my God. Because I'm
the teacher. Seriously.

1096
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:24,405
You should more often,
because you Were stellar, man.

1097
01:12:24,482 --> 01:12:26,975
I mean, I'm inspired.
Speaking of...

1098
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:29,122
So do you ever perform,
ever? Like...

1099
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,236
Do I what?

1100
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:31,617
Recently, any of these
days, do you ever perform?

1101
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:33,305
No, no. No, no, no.
You should.

1102
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,646
Yeah.
Gosh.

1103
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:37,370
Especially for your
students. Well, why...

1104
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:38,829
No, no. Too much.
Can't...

1105
01:12:38,905 --> 01:12:40,554
Why did you quit?
Huh?

1106
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,242
Why did you quit?

1107
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:45,002
It's... Why did I...
Um...

1108
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:46,999
She's like, "What... "

1109
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:50,257
It's not a good... It's a boring
story. It's long and boring.

1110
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:52,407
No, really.
Why did you quit?

1111
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:56,778
Um... Well, let's see.

1112
01:12:56,855 --> 01:13:01,383
You knoW, I Went to college and I
Was a little, happy theater major

1113
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,186
and all bright and
shiny and everything.

1114
01:13:03,263 --> 01:13:07,787
And graduated from college
and moved to the big city

1115
01:13:07,865 --> 01:13:10,855
and started getting out there and
auditioning, and I did the whole thing.

1116
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:15,920
You knoW, I did all the cattle
calls and the whole nine yards.

1117
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:20,293
I don't knoW, after a while I
just kind of started feeling like

1118
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,480
it really Wasn't
meant to be.

1119
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,125
But, you knoW, I mean,

1120
01:13:25,202 --> 01:13:28,081
sometimes when I go see
a BroadWay musical,

1121
01:13:28,156 --> 01:13:30,650
I just kind of
sit there and think,

1122
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,332
"You knoW,
I could've done that.

1123
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:36,021
"I totally could've
done that. "

1124
01:13:36,098 --> 01:13:38,627
I think. I think.
I think I could've.

1125
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:41,314
NoW, look, man, you said there Was
something interesting about it, though.

1126
01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:42,846
Yes. There is.

1127
01:13:43,807 --> 01:13:44,843
Her.

1128
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:49,063
Look, you don't come across
a voice like that every day.

1129
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:51,863
Hold up, man. She
didn't even want to sing!

1130
01:13:52,477 --> 01:13:55,200
Look, you need to find
different producers.

1131
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:58,077
You knoW? Work with
Pharrell, Ronson, Timbaland.

1132
01:13:58,154 --> 01:14:01,145
No, look, I'm the producer, man.
I make the tracks, right? Me.

1133
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:03,177
And I found her. She Wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for me.

1134
01:14:03,254 --> 01:14:06,247
Look, guys, I'm sorry. That's
just the Way this business Works.

1135
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,743
Look, you're young.

1136
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:08,894
All right, you're
just getting started,

1137
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,119
but right noW this is her time to shine.

1138
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:15,530
Look. Give me an opportunity
to do this for you.

1139
01:14:16,027 --> 01:14:17,985
We're doing 360 deals
that will bloW your mind.

1140
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:19,405
We just joint ventured
with Live Nation.

1141
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:22,550
Clear Channel's giving us 1,000
spins of anybody that We Want.

1142
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:24,198
Listen, I Worked on
Alicia Keys' record.

1143
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:25,504
I Worked on
Lauryn Hill's record.

1144
01:14:25,581 --> 01:14:29,492
I knoW what to do for you. But
you gotta trust me. Let's do this.

1145
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:33,596
Come on, let's go.

1146
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,008
This is bullshit.
And you knoW it.

1147
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:53,965
Wait, Wait.
Hold, hold on.

1148
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:55,729
NoW, you Were born to
do this. You knoW that.

1149
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:57,647
You knoW what, thank you,
but I can't. I just can't...

1150
01:14:57,724 --> 01:14:58,722
I knoW they're
your friends.

1151
01:14:58,799 --> 01:15:01,175
But what I'm trying to do
for you could make you a star.

1152
01:15:01,252 --> 01:15:06,163
Look. Just take my card and
think about it, all right?

1153
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:10,767
Denise!
You coming?

1154
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:34,546
So, this is all I've been able
to come up with for the moment,

1155
01:15:34,623 --> 01:15:37,846
'cause my financiers
were slightly shalloW...

1156
01:15:37,923 --> 01:15:40,687
Don't Worry about the money. I
mean, we'll shoot some scenes.

1157
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:41,759
Okay.
We'll cut a mini-trailer.

1158
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:43,908
We'll use that
to get more money.

1159
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,553
I'm feeling it. I mean, I've already
got this storyboard thing going with...

1160
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:48,931
I've got some
visuals here.

1161
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:50,544
I thought I could run this
by you. Right, right. Yeah!

1162
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:53,267
I have a shot list in my bag
someWhere if you'd like to see it noW.

1163
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,338
You just get into your process. Sure.

1164
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:57,294
I've already talked to
my friends at Sundance.

1165
01:15:57,371 --> 01:16:00,133
This is exactly what
they're looking for.

1166
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:05,696
That's incredible. Let's make
a movie. Let's make a movie.

1167
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:18,890
Excuse me.

1168
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:21,231
Hi, I'm looking for
Andy Matthews' trailer.

1169
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:22,304
Is he expecting you?

1170
01:16:22,381 --> 01:16:23,493
Yeah.

1171
01:16:23,685 --> 01:16:25,181
Right this Way.

1172
01:16:28,903 --> 01:16:30,588
So what's going on?

1173
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,163
Um...

1174
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:36,882
We Were gonna go see your
casting director, right?

1175
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:39,451
At least that's what
you said on the phone.

1176
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:43,134
Right. Yes. No, no, no. Totally.
She's actually out today.

1177
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,167
She has a flu.

1178
01:16:45,589 --> 01:16:48,388
WoW. I'm so sorry. Well, then I
should come back another time...

1179
01:16:48,464 --> 01:16:52,456
No, no, no, no. She said that We
could put a scene on tape for her.

1180
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:56,175
Yeah. No, that's fine.
That's great.

1181
01:16:56,751 --> 01:16:58,247
Okay. Perfect.

1182
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,316
So, I have a scene coming up this
afternoon if you Want to run that one.

1183
01:17:01,392 --> 01:17:03,233
Yeah, sure,
that'd be good.

1184
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:06,724
Okay.

1185
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:10,675
Um...

1186
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,821
It's...
Yeah, it's a scene where

1187
01:17:12,898 --> 01:17:16,774
we're coming back from a party
and We're just at my apartment.

1188
01:17:17,044 --> 01:17:18,576
Just relax. Here.

1189
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:21,032
You're gonna be great.

1190
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:22,490
Thanks.

1191
01:17:23,025 --> 01:17:26,515
So I told her a lot of
stuff about you, you knoW.

1192
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:30,199
I told her you're the prettiest
girl at Performing Arts.

1193
01:17:31,044 --> 01:17:32,616
Thanks.
It's true.

1194
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:36,760
So, what We're
gonna do here,

1195
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,137
we're just gonna slate.
Okay.

1196
01:17:39,252 --> 01:17:41,707
Okay. It's like name and age, and
then We'll get going with the scene.

1197
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:42,857
Okay.

1198
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:49,992
And go.

1199
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,597
Hi, I'm Jenny Garrison
and I'm 17 years old.

1200
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:56,629
Perfect.

1201
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:05,910
And action.

1202
01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:10,054
"The music Was so loud,
I had to get out of there. "

1203
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:13,813
"Well, Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

1204
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:16,307
"You knoW hoW
I feel about you.

1205
01:18:16,383 --> 01:18:19,105
"Or at least
I hope you do. "

1206
01:18:21,945 --> 01:18:25,090
Andy, you actually have
still another line. Right.

1207
01:18:25,206 --> 01:18:29,654
Yeah, that line. I like to
improvise. It's kind of my thing.

1208
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:30,806
You knoW?
I'm sorry.

1209
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:33,413
No. It's okay. Just don't
stop the scene again.

1210
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:35,870
Okay. You want to be an actress, right?

1211
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:37,442
Right, of course.

1212
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,590
You gotta be ready for
whatever they throW at you.

1213
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:41,087
I mean, ourjob,
as actors,

1214
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:43,274
is to make the audience
believe what's really going on.

1215
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,229
Right. I remember learning that at P.A.

1216
01:18:45,344 --> 01:18:47,836
Am I wrong? No, not at
all. That's exactly... Yeah.

1217
01:18:47,913 --> 01:18:50,024
No, that's it. Perfect.
Okay.

1218
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:51,713
Let's try it again?

1219
01:18:51,788 --> 01:18:53,246
Yep. Let's do it.

1220
01:18:53,783 --> 01:18:54,741
Okay.

1221
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:57,771
And action.

1222
01:18:57,925 --> 01:19:00,381
The music Was so loud,
I had to get out of there.

1223
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:03,258
Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

1224
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,480
I mean, you knoW
hoW I feel about you.

1225
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,548
Or at least
I hope you do.

1226
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:22,398
Andy.
Jesus, Jenny.

1227
01:19:23,052 --> 01:19:25,430
Look, I don't understand it.
You're not getting it.

1228
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:29,073
I mean, do you knoW hoW many girls
Would die for this opportunity with me?

1229
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,792
Yeah. And I'm sure you've had
every one of them in this trailer.

1230
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,673
No, probably not
every one of them.

1231
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,547
Look, is this even an audition or do
you have a collection of these tapes?

1232
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:41,271
I might have a feW.

1233
01:19:41,846 --> 01:19:44,110
Look, Jenny.
No. You came here.

1234
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,143
Okay, what did you think
was gonna happen?

1235
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:49,057
We Were gonna talk
about our craft?

1236
01:19:49,134 --> 01:19:50,629
I don't do that.

1237
01:19:50,706 --> 01:19:52,933
Okay, you don't, but I do. Right.

1238
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:54,235
No, look.
Stop it, okay!

1239
01:19:54,274 --> 01:19:55,578
Can you just leave me alone? Jenny.

1240
01:19:55,656 --> 01:19:57,380
Just leave me alone!

1241
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:09,887
Wait. Andy?
What about Andy?

1242
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,986
Andy invited me to set
to meet a casting director.

1243
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,975
And We Went into
his trailer. And...

1244
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:21,891
Well, I...
Jenny.

1245
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,961
Well, did he try
something on you?

1246
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:26,956
Kind of.

1247
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:29,295
I kneW it! I kneW
this Was gonna happen.

1248
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:30,600
Marco!
I told you

1249
01:20:30,715 --> 01:20:32,251
about this asshole
from the beginning.

1250
01:20:32,325 --> 01:20:33,784
But you still Went
behind my back.

1251
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:35,969
I knoW. And I'm sorry,
but I...

1252
01:20:36,046 --> 01:20:39,116
Look, I thought that maybe if he
did Want to flirt, just a little bit,

1253
01:20:39,193 --> 01:20:40,612
that it Would be
fine if I...

1254
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:42,722
What, if you got the job?

1255
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:43,912
You knoW what, Jenny?

1256
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:46,903
If becoming famous
is so important to you,

1257
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:49,396
then go for it.
I'm done with this.

1258
01:20:50,315 --> 01:20:52,195
Marco, I...
Hey, you knoW what?

1259
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:55,226
I hope you really get
the role. I really do.

1260
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,902
What do you mean, I
can't have my camera equipment?

1261
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,206
You see, I already gave
the check to my producer.

1262
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:04,740
So, this is a matter
of... Sir, there's no...

1263
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:06,158
You are not registered
on the computer. Right.

1264
01:21:06,311 --> 01:21:07,691
Neither you nor your
producer are here. Okay.

1265
01:21:07,768 --> 01:21:08,729
I cannot do that.

1266
01:21:08,805 --> 01:21:10,608
At the same time, this
film is fully funded.

1267
01:21:10,723 --> 01:21:12,680
I don't care. It may
be. He just called me.

1268
01:21:12,795 --> 01:21:15,096
He goes, "Earl's gonna help you out.
"You're not helping me out, Earl.

1269
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:17,474
I Would love to help you out, but
there's nothing I can do. I cannot...

1270
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:18,855
You knoW what, let's
check the name again.

1271
01:21:18,932 --> 01:21:20,888
I've checked the name
already three times...

1272
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:23,420
Please just check the name
again. Let's do it again. Come on.

1273
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,220
B- A-C-Z-Y-N-S-K-Y.
I knoW hoW to spell it.

1274
01:21:26,297 --> 01:21:27,563
I tried it three times.
Earl, please help me here.

1275
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:30,631
I Would love to help you, but it's
not there. There's nothing I can do.

1276
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,784
Eddie, it's Neil.

1277
01:22:16,392 --> 01:22:19,347
You remember hoW you asked me to write
you that letter of recommendation?

1278
01:22:19,424 --> 01:22:20,459
Of course.

1279
01:22:21,263 --> 01:22:22,492
Well...

1280
01:22:23,183 --> 01:22:26,405
I'm sorry, but I can't
write you that letter.

1281
01:22:31,123 --> 01:22:35,302
Sometimes We get students
who are promising,

1282
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:40,136
but they never progress
past that early promise.

1283
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:58,127
If the fish
swam out of the ocean

1284
01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:00,774
I knoW you Want to
be a ballet dancer,

1285
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:05,491
but I don't believe that's
going to happen for you.

1286
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,330
Not on a professional level.

1287
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:11,590
And the stars
fell out of the sky

1288
01:23:11,705 --> 01:23:13,546
And my tears
rolled into the...

1289
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:15,274
I Work harder
than anyone else.

1290
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,655
I'm sorry, Kevin.

1291
01:23:16,731 --> 01:23:18,956
You're just not
a strong enough dancer.

1292
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:21,718
...set my World
into motion

1293
01:23:21,795 --> 01:23:24,748
'Cause if you're
not really here

1294
01:23:25,095 --> 01:23:27,165
You will never,
in my opinion,

1295
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:31,075
be able to support
yourself as a dancer.

1296
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,261
It's my responsibility
to tell you that.

1297
01:23:34,835 --> 01:23:36,754
Black and gold

1298
01:23:48,569 --> 01:24:01,994
Black and gold
Black and gold

1299
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,103
Black and gold

1300
01:24:15,957 --> 01:24:18,297
'Cause if you're
not really here

1301
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:21,327
You should continue
your year here at P.A.

1302
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:23,475
But you need
to be prepared.

1303
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,653
Black and gold
Black and gold

1304
01:24:28,921 --> 01:24:32,719
Kevin, there are students
who are going to get picked up

1305
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:36,593
by Ailey, City Ballet,
Complexions.

1306
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:41,887
And there are other students who are
going to have to pursue other options.

1307
01:24:44,535 --> 01:24:45,724
Like,

1308
01:24:48,446 --> 01:24:50,365
you might make
a Wonderful teacher.

1309
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:59,992
Maybe you're right.
I knoW, I'm so proud of you.

1310
01:25:00,068 --> 01:25:02,907
It's Sesame Street. Okay, who
doesn't knoW Sesame Street?

1311
01:25:02,984 --> 01:25:06,321
Everybody greW up with it at
some point. Cookie Monster!

1312
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:08,432
Okay, okay...

1313
01:25:08,585 --> 01:25:11,961
You made me Want you

1314
01:25:14,147 --> 01:25:20,129
And all the time
I guess you alWays kneW

1315
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:25,424
You made me
happy sometimes

1316
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:30,371
You made me glad

1317
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:32,176
No.
No?

1318
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,900
See, there are some people
that like crispy cookies

1319
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:35,359
and some people that like
gooey... I don't like...

1320
01:25:35,436 --> 01:25:38,620
And so, if I could create my
perfect Sesame Street cast...

1321
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:48,284
No, see, you see, if I could make
my ideal Sesame Street cast...

1322
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:58,488
The puppets...

1323
01:26:20,277 --> 01:26:21,504
Kevin!

1324
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:03,047
Did he call you again?

1325
01:27:03,124 --> 01:27:05,041
Yeah, he called me again.

1326
01:27:06,691 --> 01:27:08,877
So does he Want you to
record an album or something?

1327
01:27:08,954 --> 01:27:13,902
Yeah. He wanted me to Work with Damon
and Poyser, whoever those people are.

1328
01:27:16,894 --> 01:27:18,467
What'd you say?

1329
01:27:18,544 --> 01:27:19,810
I told him no.

1330
01:27:19,925 --> 01:27:21,651
Because of your pops?

1331
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,339
No.

1332
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:25,602
What? Because of us?

1333
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,290
Yes, because of us.

1334
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,857
It's you, me and Malik.
That's it. Package deal.

1335
01:27:36,572 --> 01:27:40,713
Denise, look, I... I don't Wanna
keep you from your dreams, all right?

1336
01:27:41,175 --> 01:27:43,246
That man's right,
you Were born to sing.

1337
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:45,548
Jesus, Victor!
Enough already.

1338
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,572
Before you and Malik,

1339
01:27:50,648 --> 01:27:52,530
I didn't even realize
I could sing that music.

1340
01:27:52,607 --> 01:27:54,562
That I loved that music.

1341
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:58,897
I didn't even
knoW who I was.

1342
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,432
You guys
believed in me,

1343
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:03,193
so I'm not gonna
sell you out.

1344
01:28:03,271 --> 01:28:04,880
And that's that.

1345
01:28:07,259 --> 01:28:09,637
NoW, can We get
back to practice?

1346
01:28:11,056 --> 01:28:12,130
Yeah.

1347
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:24,176
I've been calling you
and texting you.

1348
01:28:24,252 --> 01:28:26,784
Left a feW messages and
you don't even respond.

1349
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:30,773
And I didn't see you at
school. What's up with that?

1350
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:35,184
I'm sorry. It's been crazy. I've
been so busy getting ready and stuff.

1351
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,713
Busy? Doing what?

1352
01:28:41,168 --> 01:28:42,856
I got into Complexions.

1353
01:28:43,546 --> 01:28:45,157
Complexions?
What's that?

1354
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:49,454
Only the greatest modern
dance company in the World.

1355
01:28:50,488 --> 01:28:52,676
They Want me
for a World tour.

1356
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:55,783
What?

1357
01:28:57,316 --> 01:28:58,468
Wait, are you serious?

1358
01:28:58,545 --> 01:28:59,542
Yeah.

1359
01:29:02,073 --> 01:29:03,531
Oh, my God.

1360
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,021
That's what I'm talking
about. What did I tell you?

1361
01:29:07,098 --> 01:29:08,747
It's gonna be
a lot of Work.

1362
01:29:08,824 --> 01:29:11,278
I bet. What's it like?
Give me details.

1363
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:14,234
Twenty-two cities. We
start rehearsing next Week.

1364
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,420
Next Week?
What about school?

1365
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:18,606
I'm dropping out.

1366
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:21,866
Your parents
will let you?

1367
01:29:21,943 --> 01:29:25,395
Are you kidding? They've put me
in dance class since I was five.

1368
01:29:25,472 --> 01:29:26,508
They're thrilled.

1369
01:29:26,739 --> 01:29:27,775
Oh.

1370
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:31,071
That's great.

1371
01:29:32,031 --> 01:29:34,755
I knoW I should have told
you sooner, Victor. I'm sorry.

1372
01:29:36,174 --> 01:29:39,357
We'll still, like... We'll
still see each other, right?

1373
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:43,039
When you come back to
visit your parents. Right?

1374
01:29:44,652 --> 01:29:47,031
Alice, baby, come on.

1375
01:29:47,108 --> 01:29:50,675
Victor, listen.
It's not just us.

1376
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,743
A lot of my friends
say that after P.A.,

1377
01:29:55,507 --> 01:29:57,156
you just go on
your separate Ways.

1378
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,606
It's just the Way
the World Works, Victor.

1379
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:04,367
That's just
hoW it Works?

1380
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:36,780
Hey, Malik.

1381
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:39,542
What happened
to your dad?

1382
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:42,648
What?

1383
01:30:43,724 --> 01:30:45,755
Your dad. Where is he?

1384
01:30:48,404 --> 01:30:49,785
Mrs. Simms?

1385
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,895
Joy. Come in.

1386
01:30:54,732 --> 01:30:56,418
Have a seat, dear.

1387
01:30:56,495 --> 01:30:57,609
Come here.

1388
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:02,020
Come and have a seat.
I Want to talk to you.

1389
01:31:02,096 --> 01:31:04,974
I think We both knoW
why I asked to see you.

1390
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,621
Your grades.

1391
01:31:10,305 --> 01:31:13,491
I'm your teacher, Malik.
And I want an ansWer.

1392
01:31:17,212 --> 01:31:20,280
The oldest story in the
book, all right? He left.

1393
01:31:22,772 --> 01:31:26,876
After Ayanna Was born. Didn't
even come back for her funeral.

1394
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:32,899
Was there anyone there
to take his place?

1395
01:31:34,243 --> 01:31:37,695
I tried to make it work for
as long as I possibly could.

1396
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:38,768
I knoW.

1397
01:31:38,845 --> 01:31:40,878
You knoW hoW I
feel about P.A.

1398
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,986
But I'm Working on the
shoW all the time noW.

1399
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,284
And I... I just...

1400
01:31:49,816 --> 01:31:51,810
I don't knoW
what to do.

1401
01:31:52,537 --> 01:31:54,686
Everything you're
ashamed of,

1402
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:58,445
all the parts of yourself
that you keep secret,

1403
01:31:58,523 --> 01:32:02,283
everything you Want to
change about yourself,

1404
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:04,277
it's who you are.

1405
01:32:05,312 --> 01:32:06,962
That's your power.

1406
01:32:08,343 --> 01:32:10,953
Deny it
and you're nothing.

1407
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:15,170
And you'll never be
much of an actor.

1408
01:32:16,895 --> 01:32:20,272
This school is here to
develop you as an artist.

1409
01:32:20,349 --> 01:32:23,494
And when you're ready, send
you out there to go to Work.

1410
01:32:24,645 --> 01:32:26,064
Are you ready?

1411
01:32:29,747 --> 01:32:32,318
NoW, you're good, Malik.

1412
01:32:32,394 --> 01:32:36,575
But you've got to start
breaking doWn those Walls

1413
01:32:36,652 --> 01:32:41,025
and accept
your circumstances.

1414
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:45,627
Just tell the truth.

1415
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:49,541
Nobody cares
about that shit.

1416
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,340
Yeah, maybe so.

1417
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,869
But I do.

1418
01:33:35,723 --> 01:33:36,721
You all right?

1419
01:33:36,798 --> 01:33:38,448
Why the hell are
you so nervous?

1420
01:33:42,015 --> 01:33:43,012
Cool.
You invited them.

1421
01:33:43,088 --> 01:33:44,967
No, not exactly.

1422
01:33:45,467 --> 01:33:47,231
What does that mean?

1423
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,260
I told them some kids
from school were performing

1424
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,715
who Were, I don't
knoW, musically gifted.

1425
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:56,361
Wait, so they don't knoW
you're singing tonight?

1426
01:33:56,438 --> 01:33:57,549
No.

1427
01:33:58,661 --> 01:34:00,887
But do they knoW
it's hip hop?

1428
01:34:01,884 --> 01:34:04,185
I told them,
"Classical jazz. "

1429
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,592
Oh, it's gonna be
good tonight.

1430
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:11,972
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:34:13,161 --> 01:34:14,963
You sure you don't Want
anything to drink?

1432
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:18,148
I'd love one, but I'm gonna be
paying my dad back till I'm 30.

1433
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:20,028
I can't afford a drink.

1434
01:34:20,104 --> 01:34:22,675
You don't mind if I have a
sip of yours, though, right?

1435
01:34:22,752 --> 01:34:23,941
Look who it is.
Look who it is.

1436
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,009
Mr. Dowd.

1437
01:34:36,484 --> 01:34:38,748
Yeah, sorry, guys,
I gotta go.

1438
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,417
HoW've you been?

1439
01:34:47,532 --> 01:34:48,682
I've been okay.

1440
01:34:50,062 --> 01:34:51,520
That's good.

1441
01:34:53,899 --> 01:34:56,353
I've been thinking
a lot about you.

1442
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:59,384
Yeah, I have, too.

1443
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:02,645
I think about
hoW I hurt you

1444
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:05,904
and it kills me.
I'm so sorry.

1445
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:10,086
I Went there for all the wrong
reasons and I knoW that noW.

1446
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,576
Things will probably never
be the same between us, but...

1447
01:35:14,881 --> 01:35:17,259
Mike check,
one-two, one-two.

1448
01:35:17,335 --> 01:35:19,752
Do you think you'll ever
be able to forgive me?

1449
01:35:19,829 --> 01:35:21,786
Hey, guys, the shoW's
about to start.

1450
01:35:21,863 --> 01:35:23,281
Coming.

01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,044
Listen.

1452

Let's just talk about this later. Okay?

1453
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:31,298
All right.

1454
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,630
Yo, what up,

Come on, y'all can
do better than that.

1458
01:35:42,038 --> 01:35:45,260
Look, look, look. We got a
special group for y'all tonight,

1459
01:35:45,337 --> 01:35:47,369
straight out of the
Performing Arts High School.

1460
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:49,481
HoW y'all feel
about that?

1461
01:35:49,557 --> 01:35:50,669
I got a question for y'all.

1462
01:35:50,744 --> 01:35:53,776
HoW many people here have
gone to the Performing Arts?

1463
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:55,924
Okay, raise your hands.
Let me see. Let me see.

1464
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:59,838

So look, look, tonight is
their first performance ever...

1466
01:36:02,982 --> 01:36:05,897
Good luck, girl... so try
not to be too mean, all right?

1467
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:08,774
Just give it up, people.
Give it up.

1468
01:36:12,803 --> 01:36:13,839
You Want
to knoW my life?

1469
01:36:13,915 --> 01:36:15,563
Well let me give you
a backdrop

1470
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,711
I was born in
the era of the flattop

1471
01:36:17,788 --> 01:36:19,937
Low-cut Air Jordans
with the black socks

1472
01:36:20,013 --> 01:36:22,124
When Run-DMC was
chilling with Ad-Rock

1473
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:24,348
Mom was broke and
Dad did crack rock

1474
01:36:24,425 --> 01:36:27,686
So I hit the streets to keep the
padlock off our apartment door

1475
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:29,295
Me and my mans
holding the 'four

1476
01:36:29,372 --> 01:36:30,908
Standing in front
of the stash spot

1477
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,131
Until one day
my little sister got popped

1478
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,395
It took aWay my
whole life in a snapshot

1479
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:38,693
And it might sound gory But
that's the unfortunate story

1480
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:40,343
Between the "haves"
and the "have-nots"

1481
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,955
Between the "gots"
and the "ain't-gots"

1482
01:36:42,032 --> 01:36:44,334
I was tired of not
getting so I got on the go

1483
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:46,557

got to get it for sure

1544
01:39:51,139 --> 01:39:52,098
I thought it Was
a school event.

1545
01:39:52,175 --> 01:39:53,364
I had to. There was
no other choice.

1546
01:39:53,441 --> 01:39:54,860
And who Were those boys
you Were up there with?

1547
01:39:54,936 --> 01:39:56,050
They're my friends. I...

1548
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:58,811
And when the hell
did you start singing?

1549
01:39:58,888 --> 01:40:01,688
I just Want you to knoW that
this is completely unacceptable.

1550
01:40:01,764 --> 01:40:05,140
You knoW what? If you can't accept
this, then you can't accept me.

1551
01:40:05,217 --> 01:40:06,981
Because this is who I am.

1552
01:40:07,058 --> 01:40:09,360
Playing piano isn't enough
for me anymore, Daddy.

1553
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:11,584
Sitting in an orchestra,
invisible. I hate it!

1554
01:40:11,661 --> 01:40:13,311
That's it! I'm pulling
you out of that school.

1555
01:40:13,426 --> 01:40:14,654
I don't care if there's
three months left.

1556
01:40:14,732 --> 01:40:16,148
But... What?
No.

1557
01:40:16,379 --> 01:40:20,636
I have been Watching Denise play the
piano all her life and she is good.

1558
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:24,587
And she practices and she's done
everything we asked her to do.

1559
01:40:24,702 --> 01:40:26,122
But she doesn't love it.

1560
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:28,001
She Went to school
to be...

1561
01:40:32,336 --> 01:40:36,479
You will stay at that school and
We will support you no matter what.

1562
01:40:36,556 --> 01:40:37,554
NoW, Wait...

1563
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,894
There will be no
more discussion.

1564
01:40:51,324 --> 01:40:54,086
There are some things
success is not.

1565
01:40:54,162 --> 01:40:57,500
It's not fame.
It's not money or power.

1566
01:40:59,571 --> 01:41:02,218
Success is Waking up
in the morning

1567
01:41:02,294 --> 01:41:04,634
so excited about
what you have to do

1568
01:41:05,133 --> 01:41:07,665
that you literally
fly out the door.

1569
01:41:08,509 --> 01:41:11,348
It's getting to Work
with people you love.

1570
01:41:13,225 --> 01:41:17,408
Success is connecting with the
World and making people feel.

1571
01:41:18,404 --> 01:41:20,629
It's finding a Way to
bind together people

1572
01:41:20,706 --> 01:41:23,161
who have nothing in
common but a dream.

1573
01:41:23,468 --> 01:41:26,882
It's falling asleep at night knoWing
you did the best job you could.

1574
01:41:27,995 --> 01:41:31,946
Success is joy and
freedom and friendship.

1575
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,358
And success is love.

1576
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:41,265
What are you doing here?
You're not graduating.

1577
01:41:41,341 --> 01:41:44,220
True, but my best friend is.
I bought you a present.

1578
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:46,329
Oh, my God!
Where did you find this?

1579
01:41:46,406 --> 01:41:49,207
I thought the Gucci print might be a little
too much, but I thought you'd like it.

1580
01:41:49,284 --> 01:41:50,895
No, it's perfect.

1581
01:41:57,607 --> 01:41:59,833
What happened to
all your stuff?

1582
01:42:02,556 --> 01:42:04,590
It all Went home already.

1583
01:42:05,357 --> 01:42:06,968
What do you mean?

1584
01:42:08,693 --> 01:42:10,534
I'm going back to Iowa.

1585
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,372
But I thought We talked
about you staying here,

1586
01:42:13,449 --> 01:42:14,945
doing dance class
and BroadWay...

1587
01:42:15,021 --> 01:42:16,594
Joy, Joy, Joy.

1588
01:42:16,978 --> 01:42:19,664
I'm lucky.
I have a place to go.

1589
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,653
I'm gonna take over
my mom's dance studio.

1590
01:42:24,113 --> 01:42:27,873
And I'm gonna be the best goddamn
dance teacher there ever was.

1591
01:42:36,157 --> 01:42:39,035
Four years of
ups and doWns,

1592
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:43,368
of Wonderment
and disappointment,

1593
01:42:44,213 --> 01:42:46,246
of ennui and joy.

1594
01:42:47,512 --> 01:42:51,156
It Was everything
I'd ever hoped for.

1595
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:55,337
And scene.

1596
01:42:57,870 --> 01:43:00,746
Congratulations!
Can I take a picture?

1597
01:43:07,037 --> 01:43:08,148
Over here.

1598
01:43:08,953 --> 01:43:10,296
Hi.
Hi.

1599
01:43:10,565 --> 01:43:13,135
Welcome, everyone, to the
NeW York High School of Performing Arts

1600

I got us seats right here.

1601
01:43:14,899 --> 01:43:17,317
We ask that you noW turn
off all your cell phones

1602
01:43:17,393 --> 01:43:19,578
and please refrain from
any flash photography

1603
01:43:19,657 --> 01:43:21,037
during the performance.

1604
01:43:21,114 --> 01:43:23,839
Thank you very much
and enjoy the shoW.

1605
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:06,300
Countless hours
of learning more

1606
01:44:06,376 --> 01:44:10,175
Countless hours
of knoWing less

1607
01:44:10,405 --> 01:44:12,129
Can't look behind you

1608
01:44:12,245 --> 01:44:17,003
You have to look ahead

1609
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:22,602
So many doubts
running through your mind

1610
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:26,669
All the excuses
Don't have the time

1611
01:44:26,746 --> 01:44:33,304
All the rejection you
have to leave behind

1612
01:44:34,762 --> 01:44:38,866
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind

1613
01:44:38,943 --> 01:44:41,782
Hold your dreams

1614
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:46,808
Don't ever let it go

1615
01:44:47,075 --> 01:44:50,030
Be yourself

1616
01:44:50,107 --> 01:44:55,018
And let the World
take notice

1617

You'll find strength

1618
01:44:58,237 --> 01:45:03,224

If you Would only

01:45:09,401 --> 01:45:14,657

And let the World
take notice

1636
01:48:25,605 --> 01:48:28,597
You'll find strength

1637
01:48:28,674 --> 01:48:33,700
when people bring you doWn

1638
01:48:33,775 --> 01:48:36,767
They will see

1639
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:39,798
If you Would only

1640
01:48:39,874 --> 01:48:46,395
Only believe

1641
01:49:26,903 --> 01:49:29,395
Remember, remember

1642
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:35,457
Baby, look at me
and tell me what you see

1643
01:49:35,534 --> 01:49:38,985
You ain't seen
the best of me yet

1644
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:43,434
Give me time I'll make
you forget the rest

1645
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,580
I got more to me

1646
01:49:46,657 --> 01:49:49,650
And you can set it free

1647
01:49:49,725 --> 01:49:53,561
I can catch the moon
in my hand

1648
01:49:53,638 --> 01:49:55,824
Don't you knoW who I am?

1649
01:49:55,939 --> 01:49:58,471
Remember my name
Fame

1650
01:49:58,548 --> 01:50:01,962
I'm gonna live forever

1651
01:50:02,038 --> 01:50:05,567
I'm gonna learn hoW to fly High

1652
01:50:05,643 --> 01:50:09,173
I feel it coming together

1653
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:12,664
People will see me and cry
Fame

1654
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:16,193
I'm gonna make it
to heaven

1655
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:19,683
Light up the sky like a flame Fame

1656
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,290

1657

01:50:39,284 --> 01:50:42,775
You can shoot me

01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:50,484
Baby, I return

01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:53,400
Too much is not enough

1666
01:50:53,476 --> 01:50:57,237
I can ride your heart
till it breaks

1667
01:50:57,313 --> 01:50:59,461
Ooh, I've got

I'm gonna learn hoW to fly High

1683
01:51:58,763 --> 01:52:02,484
I feel it coming together

1684
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,974
People see me and cry
Fame

1685
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:09,581
I'm gonna make it
to heaven

1686

Baby, remember my name
My name

1689
01:52:24,501 --> 01:52:27,071
Remember my name

1690
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:37,468
NoWhere to run
NoWhere to hide

1691
01:52:37,775 --> 01:52:41,724
No time for games
Time to decide

1692
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:43,643
The pressure's on

1693
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,484
It's got to be right

1694
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,167
Won't be detoured
by foolish pride

1695
01:52:50,586 --> 01:52:52,351
Gotta Work just a little

1696
01:52:52,427 --> 01:52:54,154
Just a peek
for something committal

1697
01:52:54,269 --> 01:52:55,917
Got to find
someWhere in the middle

1698
01:52:55,994 --> 01:52:58,180
So confusing with my feelings

1699
01:52:58,257 --> 01:53:00,099
I'm just lost in the fever

1700
01:53:00,175 --> 01:53:02,054
It takes time
for true feelings

1701
01:53:02,131 --> 01:53:03,704
But I can't seem to fight it

1702

No matter hoW I try

1703

You can't push and shove

1705
01:53:10,071 --> 01:53:13,140
'Cause no matter what
Love will alWays catch you

1706
01:53:13,947 --> 01:53:15,787
You try your best to speed up

1707
01:53:15,864 --> 01:53:17,820
But you don't measure up

1708
01:53:17,897 --> 01:53:21,157

I'm on the spot
Today's the day

1717
01:53:43,674 --> 01:53:47,780
Decision time
What should I do?

1718
01:53:47,857 --> 01:53:51,077
Should I deny
or give in to?

Gotta Work just a little

1720
01:53:54,337 --> 01:53:56,294
Just a peek
for something committal

1721
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:57,866
Got to find
someWhere in the middle

1722
01:53:57,943 --> 01:54:00,207
So confusing
with my feelings

1723
01:54:00,322 --> 01:54:01,896
I'm just lost in the fever

1724
01:54:01,973 --> 01:54:03,774
It takes time
for true feelings

1725
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:05,539
But I can't seem to fight it
