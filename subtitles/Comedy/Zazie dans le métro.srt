1
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,786
Holifart whatastink!

2
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,664
Don't these people ever wash?

3
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,628
The papers say under 11%
of Paris apartments have bathrooms.

4
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,923
Okay, but people could wash
all the same.

5
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,843
This bunch doesn't make
much of an effort.

6
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,639
They're not even
Paris's prize stinkers.

7
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,226
No, they're gathered here by chance.

8
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,562
People at the East Station

9
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,690
can't smell worse
than those at the Lyons Station.

10
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,984
No reason they should.

11
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,737
Still, what a stench!

12
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,824
Who stinks like that?

13
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,412
That, little lady, is "Bodyguard,"
a perfume by Fior.

14
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,917
There oughta be a law
against fouling the air!

15
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,892
Jeanne!

16
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,958
I'm Zazie. You my unc?

17
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,003
Me in person. I'm your unc.

18
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,340
- You smell funny.
- It's "Bodyguard" by Fior.

19
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,760
- Dab some behind my ears?
- It's for men.

20
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,804
Hi, little bro.

21
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,681
You're sweet to baby-sit.

22
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,058
She's in good hands.

23
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,564
I'll meet you right here
day after tomorrow

24
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,525
for the 6:60 a.m. train.

25
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,777
NatÃ¼rlich!

26
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,237
How's your wife?

27
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,072
Fine. Come see us?

28
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,200
No time!

29
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,579
When Mom's got a new squeeze,
it's so long, family!

30
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,624
Bye, honey! Bye, Gaby!

31
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,542
Bye, Mom!

32
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,461
She's got it bad.

33
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,130
Let's get going.

34
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,387
We taking the metro, Unc?

35
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,891
Whaddya mean?
- I mean no! We got Charlie's hack.

36
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,393
I got a confession
stuck in my craw.

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,146
It's confessionitis.

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,607
I'll say nothing of my youth.

39
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,282
It ain't free, I tell ya!

40
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,993
I'm waiting for my pal.

41
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,579
Here's my pal, Gabriel. See?

42
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,248
Hi there, kid.

43
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,126
What a crummy old heap!

44
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,170
If you don't like it -

45
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,131
- Get in and don't be snotty.
- Snotty, my ass!

46
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,093
Your niece is a hoot.

47
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,138
Oh, damgoddit!

48
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,156
ON STRlKE

49
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,080
Bastards!
To pull this on me!

50
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:34,126
- It's not just you.
- Don't care!

51
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,546
I was all excited
to ride the metro!

52
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,299
Hell and damnation!
- That's life.

53
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,844
- When's the strike over?
- Dunno. I don't do politics.

54
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,096
It ain't politics.
It's about bucks.

55
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,350
- Mister, you ever go on strike?
- Gotta, to get fares hiked.

56
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:55,105
You oughta pay people
to ride in this stinking crate!

57
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,217
Ah, Paris! What a beautiful town!

58
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,135
Look, Zazie!

59
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,262
The Panthéon.
- Come off it!

60
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,597
That's not the Panthéon?

61
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,517
No, that is not the Panthéon!

62
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,728
- Then what?
- Dunno, but it's not the Panthéon.

63
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,564
- We'll ask a passerby.
- They're all morons.

64
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,650
That's for sure.

65
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,448
I got it!
That was the Madeleine.

66
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,409
Maybe, but it's ancient history now.

67
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:54,081
Now there's a swell piece
of architecture!

68
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,375
The lnvalides.

69
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,337
You're way off.
It might be the Gendarmerie.

70
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,758
Say, Unc, when you guys spout crap,
you do it on purpose?

71
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,511
All the better
to make you laugh, my child.

72
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:12,641
Truth is, sometimes it's on poipose,
sometimes not.

73
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,854
Pull my leg, will ya?
You're two old farts!

74
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,817
- Hear that?
- It's the new wave!

75
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,069
Take your new wave and -

76
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:31,660
Zazie, if you really
wanna see the lnvalides

77
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,872
and the true tomb
of the real Napoleon, I'll take you.

78
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,209
Napoleon, my ass!
That dumb cluck and his stupid hat!

79
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,129
- Whatcha wanna see, then?
- Yeah, what?

80
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,464
The metro!

81
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,261
There's your metro!

82
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,849
The metro's underground!
Who ya tryin' to kid?

83
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,810
- That's the el.
- Then it's not the metro.

84
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,645
Lemme eggsplain.

85
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,482
Sometimes it comes up,
then it re-returns under.

86
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,278
- Bull. You never tell the truth.
- The truth?

87
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,823
As if you knew what truth was.

88
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,159
As if anybody knew.

89
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,912
It's all a lot of hooey.

90
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,917
The Panthéon, the lnvalides,
the Gendarmerie, the Madeleine -

91
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,336
all a lot of hooey!

92
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,297
What a shame!

93
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,508
A crying shame!

94
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,676
What's that?

95
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,803
Search me.

96
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,722
lsn't she a doll?

97
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,980
So, kid, glad to be in Paris?

98
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,069
Well, I never!

99
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,323
Mr. Charles, you're a melancholic.

100
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,576
Melancholic, my ass!

101
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,161
Goddammit to hell!

102
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,748
I won't stand
for a little bitch who spouts

103
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,376
"obscelenities" like that!

104
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,795
She'll corrupt the neighborhood!

105
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:55,262
Yackety-yak!
All you do is yak!

106
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,444
Dinner's ready.

107
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,779
Consommé!

108
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,781
Don't let's exaggerate.

109
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,050
So, child...

110
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,471
aren't we tired?
Aren't we sleepy?

111
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,805
Who's we?

112
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,183
You, naturally.

113
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,061
When's bedtime at home?

114
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,523
Home and here
are two different things, right?

115
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,819
You just saying yes,
or do you mean it?

116
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,492
Hear that, Albertine?

117
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,286
See how kids her age reason?

118
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,248
Why send 'em to school?

119
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,959
I'll go to school till I'm 65.

120
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,127
Sixty-five?

121
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,547
Sure, I'll be a teacher.

122
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,675
Not a bad job.
You get a pension.

123
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,845
Pension, my ass.
It's not for the pension.

124
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,015
Then why do you wanna teach?

125
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,726
To drive those brats nuts.

126
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,606
The ones who'll be my age
in 10, 20, 100, 1,000 years!

127
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,984
I'll make their lives hell!

128
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,027
Make 'em eat chalk!

129
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,737
Jab compasses in their rear!

130
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,322
I'll kick their behinds!

131
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,033
I'll wear boots with spurs

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,369
to tear their butts to shreds!

133
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,873
From what the papers say,

134
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,670
the trend in modern education
is more towards gentleness...

135
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,007
kindness...

136
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,009
understanding.

137
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,137
lsn't that so, Albertine?

138
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,264
They treat you bad at school?

139
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,224
Just let 'em try!

140
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,644
In 20 years,
there won't be teachers anymore.

141
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,899
They'll all be replaced
by movies, TV,

142
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,611
electronics, stuff like that.

143
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,239
That was in the paper
the other day too.

144
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,450
Wasn't it, Albertine?

145
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,868
Yes, it was.

146
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,828
Then I'll be an astronaut.

147
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,788
That's more like it.

148
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,999
I'll drive the Martians nuts!

149
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,293
The kid's got ambition.

150
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,088
- Take me to the Cinemascope?
- Can't. I start work at 11:00.

151
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,175
- I can go with Auntie.
- I say no.

152
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,844
She never goes out without me.

153
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,097
You got soft skin.

154
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,855
She dropped right off to sleep.

155
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,241
But tomorrow -

156
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,701
She'd better not wake me.

157
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,287
Kids get up early,

158
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,832
but I need my beauty sleep.

159
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,085
Ten hours minimum is essential.

160
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,882
Yackety-yak!
All you do is yak!

161
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,552
Yackety-yak, my ass!

162
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,308
Wanna repeat that?

163
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,103
I said, "Yackety-yak, my ass!"

164
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,984
What are you insinuating,
if I may ask?

165
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:41,989
I'm insinuating that
I don't like that kid here!

166
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:45,200
Whether you like it
or like it not,

167
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,162
I don't give a crap!

168
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,123
Don't you start talking

169
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,708
like your niece!

170
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,712
How can anyone be
as unintelligent as you!

171
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,090
Know what "unintelligent" means,
you moron?

172
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,967
- Here we go!
- Go where?

173
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,428
You've become real foul-mouthed!

174
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,514
He's starting to get on my nerves.

175
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,978
I won't have a brat like that
in my house!

176
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,521
How's that?

177
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,692
I won't have that little bitch
in my house!

178
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,739
Can't a body get any sleep?

179
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,702
What's all this mess?

180
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,122
Yackety-yak.

181
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,211
All you do is yak.

182
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,506
It's ruined.

183
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,759
- I'll buy you a new one.
- That's sweet.

184
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,969
But not pigskin.

185
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,389
What would you like? Box calf?

186
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,518
Shagreen?

187
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,728
Russian leather?

188
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,731
Lizard?

189
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,903
Alligator?

190
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,030
That's expensive.

191
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,282
But durable and smart.

192
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,453
See your aunt?
She's kindness itself.

193
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,580
What's he doing here?

194
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,499
He's the landlord.

195
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,044
A great landlord. A real pal.

196
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,505
He's kindness itself.

197
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,758
- Kindness, my ass!
- I heard that "my ass"!

198
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,469
Move it, and no "obscelenities"!

199
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,263
It's not me, it's her!

200
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,098
Tattletale!

201
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,688
You forgot your lipstick.

202
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:46,859
Hey, kid!

203
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,789
Zazie!

204
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,710
Come back here!

205
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,088
Come back here right this minute!

206
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,174
Where are you off to?

207
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,801
Get down here right now!

208
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,431
I said get down here!

209
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,100
Help! Help!

210
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:07,314
Don't let that nasty man take me!
I don't even know him!

211
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,400
He said things to me!
- Like what?

212
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,655
The child is a runaway.
I'm taking her home.

213
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,826
Tell me what the naughty man said.

214
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,118
I'm afraid to.

215
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,162
What did he want?

216
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,667
Scum!

217
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,837
What did he want?

218
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,048
That's a new one on me!

219
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,551
Can you believe it?

220
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,137
A real bastard!

221
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,951
I don't get it.

222
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,637
One day my husband
wanted me to -

223
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,392
I don't know
where he got that idea.

224
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:31,273
So I says, "If you expect me to...

225
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,233
go take a flying -"

226
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,532
Damgoddit!

227
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,370
I just got the fright of my life!

228
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,915
Quit playing the St. Bernard.

229
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,458
Damgoddit!

230
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,585
Well, they didn't kill you.

231
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,212
Damgoddit!

232
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,107
The kid skedaddled.

233
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,779
The kid skedaddled?

234
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,116
- They took me for a lech!
- Scared?

235
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,828
More than during the air raids.

236
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,622
Air raids never scared me.

237
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,126
British bombs weren't meant for me.
I rooted for the Brits.

238
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,254
They didn't scare me either.

239
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,632
No, so they never hit me.

240
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,635
I went out to enjoy the fireworks.

241
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,389
Wham! Bull's-eye!
A munitions dump up in smoke!

242
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,600
- A station blown sky-high!
- A factory in smithereens!

243
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,437
The whole town in flames.
A helluva show!

244
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,649
The good old days.

245
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,603
What is it, little girl?
Somebody hurt you?

246
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,650
Is it that bad?
- Oh, yes, sir!

247
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,654
You poor, poor child.

248
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,283
Tell me what's wrong.

249
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,410
Your parents beat you?

250
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,538
Lose something
you'll catch hell for?

251
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:03,800
Tell me all about it.
You can trust me.

252
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,303
Why should I trust you?

253
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,388
Because I love children.

254
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,391
Little girls and little boys.

255
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,393
You're a dirty old man!

256
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,978
Not at all.

257
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,231
During the occupation,

258
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,192
the black market
got me nothing but trouble.

259
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,195
I got hit with everything:

260
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,907
fines, inspections, requisitions.
Just my luck!

261
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,159
But I inherited this joint.

262
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,287
Then stop whining.
You've got it made.

263
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,082
- What's this?
- The flea market.

264
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,416
This where you buy

265
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,754
"rembrans" cheap, peddle 'em to Yanks
and go home loaded?

266
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,049
Not only Rembrandts.
Soles, lavender, nails too.

267
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,593
- And US army surplus?
- Sure.

268
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,222
And good French fries.
Made the same morning.

269
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,267
- I like army surplus.
- They got mussels, too.

270
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,979
That don't make you sick.
- And blew-genes?

271
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,357
- Sure. Compasses too.
- Screw compasses.

272
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,317
I want blew-genes.

273
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,944
Let's go take a look.

274
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,947
You're subtle as a bulldozer.

275
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,618
Got any blue jeans for the kid?

276
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,496
Sure do.

277
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,625
SECONDHAND

278
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,503
I got everything here...

279
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,673
from rubber dinghies
to fishing rods.

280
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,971
Here's a pair
she'll never wear out.

281
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,725
So what?
She'll outgrow them by next year.

282
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,352
- Then her kid sister?
- She's got none.

283
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,271
Next year she might.

284
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,024
Don't joke.
Her poor momma's dead.

285
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:53,660
If I understand correctly,

286
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,580
these are US army surplus
blue jeans?

287
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,332
NatÃ¼rlich!

288
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,800
The Yanks had little tykes
in their army?

289
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:13,055
Sure they did.
It takes all kinds to fight a war.

290
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,516
How much are these?

291
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:22,564
I'll throw 'em in free
with the blue jeans.

292
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,318
MUSSELS AND FRlES

293
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,910
Hungry?

294
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,329
Want a bite to eat?

295
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,373
Some mussels? Or fries?

296
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,707
Both.

297
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,212
A glass of white wine.

298
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,221
lncredible!

299
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,478
What a slowpoke!
My Pop would've downed

300
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,397
ten glasses by now.

301
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:07,526
- Your Pop drink a lot?
- He did. He's dead.

302
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,196
Were you sad when he died?

303
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,366
No time,
with all that was going on.

304
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,784
Like what?

305
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,244
Hey, my mussels!

306
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:20,247
Remember the dressmaker
from Saint-Montron

307
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,500
who hit her husband
over the head with a hatchet?

308
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,919
Don't you read the papers?

309
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:29,047
Pathetic! And you wanna
have a conversation?

310
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,592
The dressmaker was Mom.

311
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,469
And the husband,
naturally, was Pop.

312
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,932
It made a big stink.

313
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,144
Mom hired
a hotshot lawyer from Paris.

314
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,689
Someone who don't talk natural.
A real asshole.

315
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,274
But he got her off, easy.

316
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,776
They even gave Mom an ovation.

317
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,615
Almost paraded her
through the streets.

318
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,410
Not interested?
- Not particularly.

319
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,121
You're a shifty one.

320
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,290
Don't sulk.

321
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,792
I'll tell you my story.

322
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,127
I'm all ears.

323
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:11,423
Well, Mom couldn't stomach Pop.

324
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,552
It got Pop down,
and he started hitting the bottle.

325
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,138
You following me?

326
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,015
Good. I'm getting there.

327
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,976
It happened last year.

328
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,271
One Sunday in October.

329
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,774
I remember it well.

330
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,985
I was just back from soccer.

331
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:36,406
Pop was alone in the house.

332
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,992
All alone, waiting.

333
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,912
Not waiting
for anything in particular.

334
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,331
Just waiting.

335
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,835
Î—e was all alone, just waiting.

336
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:53,841
So I come in.

337
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,593
Pop is drunk as a skunk.

338
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,055
He starts kissing me.

339
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,016
Why not? He's my Pop.

340
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,162
It was terrific.

341
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,918
Suddenly, the door opens softly.

342
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,380
You see, Mom had told him,

343
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,550
"I'm going out
to buy spaghetti and pork chops."

344
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,760
But it was to trick him.

345
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,221
Smart cookie, eh?

346
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,058
So she slips in, real quiet.

347
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,561
Pop's mind is elsewhere.

348
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,898
And that's how
he ended up in heaven!

349
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,233
Still, Mom got off scot-free.

350
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,073
They congratulated her.

351
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:02,534
Don't that take the cake?

352
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,038
Don't it?
- Oh, sure!

353
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,409
Help! Help!

354
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:39,538
Don't let the nasty man take me!

355
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,498
- What'd he say?
- Things.

356
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,167
You little thief!

357
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:47,671
She swiped these blue jeans
from my shop.

358
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:50,591
- Little crook!
- Disgusting!

359
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:54,094
Didn't she ever learn
property is sacred?

360
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,764
What if I take you to the police?

361
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,434
You'll end up in jail!

362
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,853
Sir, have pity on the child.

363
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:06,398
She's not responsible
for the bad upbringing she likely had.

364
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,693
Perhaps hunger drove her to it.

365
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,113
Do not be too hard -
not too hard - on her.

366
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,949
Haven't you ever been hungry?

367
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:19,995
Hungry?
Lady, I was an orphan.

368
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,999
We'll see what your parents say.

369
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,216
Unc, a cop wants to see you.

370
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:41,308
So you're a cop?

371
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,937
Not on your life.
I'm just a simple peddler.

372
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,024
They call me Pedro Surplus.

373
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:57,324
Don't believe him.
He's a cop.

374
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,618
The child is joking.

375
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,329
Don't talk without your lawyer.

376
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,207
She thinks I'm dumb.
Kids today!

377
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,376
No respect for their elders.

378
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,754
The crap you have to listen to.
I'd rather leave.

379
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,853
- So you exploit little girls?
- Me, sir?

380
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,730
Yes, you.
She was working the flea market.

381
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,108
Well, I'll be!

382
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,489
What's your line of work?

383
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,199
Entertainer.

384
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:44,037
The kid said you were
a night watchman.

385
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,874
I told the kid a white lie.

386
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,672
What kind of entertainer?

387
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,091
Spanish ballerina.

388
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,802
- So you're a -
- Not at all.

389
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:03,223
Okay, so I dance in drag
in a nightclub. That means nothing.

390
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,184
Strictly for laughs.

391
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,728
With my build, you see -

392
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:12,065
How do I look, Albertine?

393
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,902
...and hormosessuality, to boot!

394
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,070
What's a hormosessual?

395
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,573
A man who wears blue jeans.

396
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,408
You're spoofing me.

397
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,288
- Take those off.
- No way. They're mine.

398
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,708
Throw him out.
- Suppose he's a cop?

399
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,960
That a reason to be scared?

400
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:00,280
Love can bloom in a gaze.

401
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:06,620
Ma'am, we'd like
some information on you too.

402
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:07,746
Like what?

403
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,623
Occupation?

404
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:12,876
- Housewife.
- Which involves?

405
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,295
Which involves, for instance,

406
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,840
throwing out the garbage.

407
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,641
One steak, pronto!

408
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,031
Hello, you!

409
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,285
- Eating with us?
- Wasn't it planned?

410
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,787
Just reminding you.

411
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,999
I didn't forget.

412
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,877
Then I'm confirming my invite.

413
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,505
No need. It was all set.

414
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,465
Okay, hurry up.

415
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,681
23 MlNUTES LATER...

416
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,237
- So what'd this guy say?
- Nothing.

417
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:25,616
- Is he eating?
- Shoveling it down.

418
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:28,535
Did he start with the sardines?

419
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,370
Same as you.

420
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,706
- What did he drink?
- Red wine.

421
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,501
- How much?
- He downed half a bottle.

422
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,004
Hey, my plate!

423
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,923
What's on your mind?

424
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,052
I was thinking of Charles.

425
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,304
He's a decent fellow.

426
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,890
He's got a job. A good one.

427
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,725
Taxi driver.

428
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,894
Not too old, not too young.

429
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,730
Healthy. He saves his money.

430
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,733
Not too old, not too young.

431
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,902
Healthy and strong.

432
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,239
Must have a nest egg.
He's got what it takes.

433
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,867
Only thing is, he's too romantic.

434
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,079
Oh, Mr. Charles!

435
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:31,265
Would you have a shoelace?
I just broke mine.

436
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,726
- I'm out to lunch. Come back at 2:00.
- Aren't those laces?

437
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,812
Hands off, mister!

438
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,232
It's like refusing bread
to a starving man.

439
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,944
Don't give me a sob story.
Cop! Lecher!

440
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:49,658
The thanks I get for returning
a child to her folks. And what folks!

441
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,828
Whatcha got against them?

442
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:55,372
- The uncle is a -
- I forbid you!

443
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:58,584
Don't tell me what to do.

444
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,962
Gabriel is an upright citizen.
He's well-liked.

445
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:03,213
A vamp!

446
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:06,967
You and your haughty airs.
I tell you, Gabriel is -

447
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,468
Prove it.

448
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:10,304
It's simple. He's married.

449
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,681
That proves nothing.

450
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,058
Henri lll was married too.

451
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,477
- To who?
- Louise de Vaudemont.

452
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:21,857
If that dame was queen of France,
we'd know about her.

453
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,652
Give me the other one.
What are you doing here?

454
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,865
Returning a lost child
to her parents.

455
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:37,998
Now I'm the one who's lost.

456
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,501
The metro's that way.

457
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,629
You don't understand.
It's me I lost.

458
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:47,341
- I don't get it.
- Just ask me something.

459
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,928
My name, for example.

460
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,013
Okay, what's your name?

461
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,182
I don't know.

462
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,144
- What?
- I never learned it by heart.

463
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,688
Why learn your name by heart?

464
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,815
- What's yours?
- Gridoux.

465
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,153
- See, you learned yours by heart.
- You're right.

466
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:12,533
Worse - I don't know
if I ever even had one.

467
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:14,451
That can't be!

468
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:18,038
What do you mean,
"that can't be"?

469
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:20,499
You know how old you are?

470
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,167
Of course not.

471
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,253
That's awful.

472
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:29,800
So when people
ask me what I do,

473
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,052
I'm not just being difficult.

474
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,096
I get you.

475
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:43,105
The metro still that way?

476
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,899
That way... or this way.

477
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,403
But the metro's on strike.

478
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:52,573
On strike!

479
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,833
What a swell town!

480
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,257
I wonder why Paris
is always pictured as a dame.

481
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,106
Shpritski nai ekerch!

482
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,487
I didn't know you spoke
Black Forest talk.

483
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:14,988
I didn't mean to.

484
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,867
It was a sudden stroke of genius.

485
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,038
Us artistes are like that.

486
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:29,044
Paris will always be Paris!

487
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,839
lsn't this gorgeous, Zazie!

488
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,007
The Panthéon.

489
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,677
The lnvalides.

490
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:39,263
The cabaret.

491
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:41,723
The metro.

492
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,977
Damgoddit, it makes me dizzy.

493
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:46,687
It isn't all that high.

494
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,605
But still.

495
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,399
I can see your taxi!

496
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,985
My glasses!

497
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:06,665
I got a confession
stuck in my craw.

498
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,918
It's confessionitis!

499
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:12,838
I'll say nothing of my youth.

500
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,716
As for my upbringing,
I had none.

501
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:19,553
Of my education,
there's little to tell.

502
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:22,347
On this score,
there's no more to say.

503
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,601
Now I come to my military service

504
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,228
on which I won't dwell.

505
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,856
A bachelor from early on,

506
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,442
I am what life has made me.

507
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,569
Rise, descend,

508
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,738
descend, rise,

509
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:39,239
come, go -

510
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:41,909
so does Man
until he finally vanishes.

511
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,703
A taxi bringeth him.

512
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,372
An elevator taketh him away.

513
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:50,792
Neither the Tower
nor the Panthéon take any note.

514
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:54,421
All Paris is a dream,
Zazie is a reverie,

515
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:55,881
and all this

516
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,925
is a reverie within a dream...

517
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,845
a reverie within a dream...

518
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,106
I haven't been up here in 20 years.

519
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,650
How old are you?

520
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,068
How old d'ya think?

521
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,779
You're no spring chicken... 25?

522
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,280
Plus 10.

523
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,617
You don't look too old.
And Uncle Gabriel?

524
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,994
- He's 32.
- He looks older.

525
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,747
Don't tell him or he'll cry.

526
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:31,124
Why?
'Cause he's a hormosessual?

527
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:35,337
- Where'd you hear that?
- The guy said that.

528
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,506
- It ain't so.
- No, he really did.

529
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,801
I mean, it ain't so about Gabriel.

530
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:44,471
What makes him a hormosessual?
'Cause he wears perfume?

531
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,306
You got it.

532
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,309
- That's no crime.
- Of course not.

533
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:52,646
- Are you a hormosessual?
- I look like a fruit?

534
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:55,440
- No, you're the driver.
- You see?

535
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,234
See what?

536
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,528
So why aren't you married?

537
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,488
Can't find my dream girl.

538
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,492
You're a snob.
Do you like me?

539
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:08,912
- You're just a kid.
- Some girls marry at 12.

540
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,832
- Do you like me?
- 'Course not.

541
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,544
- You got screwy ideas.
- Wonder where I get 'em.

542
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:21,175
And there, way out yonder,

543
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,595
the cemetery is piled high

544
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,598
with former Parisians...

545
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:32,686
who went up and down
countless steps,

546
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,731
to and fro along endless streets,

547
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,983
until in the end

548
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,986
they went and were no more.

549
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,447
Pleasure bringeth them,

550
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:47,075
a hearse taketh them away.

551
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,871
Meanwhile, the Tower rusts,
the Panthéon cracks,

552
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,373
quicker than their bones rot...

553
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,715
...and melt away

554
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,551
in the humus
of the woeful metropolis.

555
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:07,638
But I am alive!

556
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,766
And there my knowledge ceases.

557
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,024
For of the cabbie
and my niece,

558
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,860
1 ,000 feet up in the air,

559
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:24,321
and of my sweet spouse,

560
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:27,241
Albertine, back at the hearth,

561
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,953
at this precise moment,
I know only this:

562
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:34,540
They are almost dead

563
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,917
since they are not here.

564
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:49,096
Created in a flash...

565
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:52,099
animated in a splash...

566
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,477
negated in a dash.

567
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,903
Get a move on!
Schnell , schnell!

568
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:15,956
Well, well!

569
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:18,458
- Hi, Fedor!
- Gabriel, you here?

570
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,344
What's keeping my Gretchens?

571
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:49,531
Want a lift to Sainte Chapelle,
that jewel of Gothic art?

572
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,325
I'm with Charles.

573
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:54,870
S'long, Fedor.
Good-bye, my Gretchen ladies.

574
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,581
Hey, answer me!

575
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,459
You wear me out!
What questions!

576
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:04,254
They're good questions.
You just don't know the answers.

577
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,008
Where were we?

578
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,302
I'm not the marrying kind.

579
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:14,348
Not all women
ask questions like me.

580
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,934
"Women"! You're just a kid.

581
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,895
- I'm developing.
- Don't get dirty.

582
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,523
- Dirty? That's life.
- Life's clean.

583
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,150
You oughta know, in your racket.

584
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,568
Whaddya mean?

585
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:31,365
I read that cabbies
see all types of sessuality.

586
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:32,866
Cut it out!

587
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,411
That all you can say?
You must be repressed.

588
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:40,165
Wait for me.
Tell me about your hang-ups.

589
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:42,793
Scared of women, huh?

590
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,380
There she goes again!

591
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:50,592
Sessuality all over the place,
all the time!

592
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,345
Excrementation! Putrefaction!

593
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,098
People have such one-track minds!

594
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,230
- Where you going?
- I'm splitting.

595
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,524
- What about us?
- Take the metro.

596
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:08,694
I've had it with that brat.

597
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:26,086
Unc, I want an ice cream too.

598
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:30,382
- Where we going?
- I've got a rehearsal at 6:00.

599
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:33,886
- Take a taxi.
- During a metro strike?

600
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:36,096
Look at this.

601
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,895
- Why'd Charles take off?
- No reason.

602
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,355
- That's no answer.
- He just did.

603
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:50,277
- You won't tell me?
- You talk too grown-up for him.

604
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:54,448
- What if I talk grown-up to you?
- Try me.

605
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:58,243
Okay. Are you a hormosessual?
Is that too grown-up?

606
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,287
Poor Charles!

607
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:01,663
Yes or no?

608
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,708
Dearie, you're hurting the poor man.

609
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:08,128
One mustn't mistreat grown-ups.

610
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,130
He won't answer me.

611
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,509
That's no reason.

612
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:18,972
We must never resort
to violence in human relations.

613
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:22,809
It is eminently reprehensible.

614
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,896
My ass!
Did I ask you the time of day?

615
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:28,857
- 4:15.
- Leave the child alone.

616
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,455
- Some educator you are!
- Educator, my ass!

617
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,500
What a foul mouth she has!

618
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,669
Mind your own ass!

619
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:51,046
I have my own ideas on education.

620
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:56,009
- For instance?
- First, understanding.

621
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,387
You gonna answer my question?

622
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,349
Shit! That wasn't funny.

623
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,936
Be understanding.

624
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,273
Quit making eyes at my uncle.

625
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:10,899
He's married, you know.

626
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,360
I'm a real young lady,

627
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,362
and a widow, on top of it.

628
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,866
My rehearsal!

629
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,995
I'll never make it in time.

630
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:08,123
- Unc, will you answer me?
- What?

631
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:12,419
- Is he a hormosessual?
- No doubt about it.

632
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:18,467
- There's no talking to you!
- That was mean.

633
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,470
You don't educate children
by not answering.

634
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:24,306
She's right.
So you gonna tell me, yes or no?

635
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,683
- What?
- What's a hormosessual?

636
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,116
Damn! To do this to me!

637
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,911
Help!

638
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,247
Kidnappers!

639
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,790
Albertine?

640
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,211
Tired?

641
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,463
No, disappointed.

642
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:01,260
Officer, a fine gentleman
has just been kidnapped!

643
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:03,095
It's my uncle!

644
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,763
- Who's she?
- Nobody.

645
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,641
I've got a car.
Get the kidnappers!

646
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:10,227
- She's not so dumb.
- Thank you.

647
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:12,104
- Don't mention it.
- It's sweet of you.

648
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,816
- You finished?
- Who asked you?

649
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:20,362
Dames! You asked me!
Words don't make sense!

650
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:23,448
- You coming or not?
- That's a cop for you!

651
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:27,452
Judges are even worse.
- Bastards all.

652
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,496
I've seen you somewhere.

653
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:31,832
- I doubt it.
- Why not?

654
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,168
Maybe the child's right.

655
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:36,628
- Thank you, my dear.
- A pleasure, my dear.

656
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,173
- Too kind.
- All right, all right.

657
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,008
They're putting me on.

658
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:43,010
- Come on!
- The kidnappers!

659
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:03,071
Just look at this.

660
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,700
I don't believe it!

661
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:09,620
A fine officer like you
must know tricks.

662
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,456
Within the limits of the law,
of course.

663
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:16,210
You'll see what stuff
Trouscaillon's made of!

664
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,753
His name's Trouscaillon.

665
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,339
My name is Mrs. Mwack.
Like everyone.

666
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,792
Christ! My rehearsal!

667
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,510
He's terrific!

668
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,596
- He's a clod.
- lsn't he cute?

669
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:53,557
First it was my uncle.
You want 'em all!

670
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:02,816
- Is Sainte Chapelle far?
- A jewel of Gothic art.

671
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:05,444
Of my education,
there's little to tell.

672
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:07,279
Never mind.

673
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,577
Come with us!

674
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:28,175
This is Captain Fedor Balanovich
welcoming you aboard.

675
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:31,678
We are now cruising over the Trocadéro,
famous for its cheeses.

676
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:35,432
We're flying at an altitude of 5'11".
Speed: six knots.

677
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:40,312
On your left, the Social Security building,
apex of our civilization.

678
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,670
Step on it, Fedor.
I can't take anymore.

679
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,880
I'll take a shortcut.

680
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:25,501
O madam, could you perhaps
have lost your way?

681
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,629
'Tis the wind and the breeze
have led us astray.

682
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,259
And here is Sainte Chapelle,

683
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,929
a jewel of Gothic art.

684
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,641
Let's move it, gentlemen!

685
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:42,601
Before it closes.

686
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,684
- He's growing on me.
- She's wacko!

687
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,896
- It's a joy to watch you drive, madam.
- Really?

688
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:10,105
Hello, Mr. Gabriel!

689
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:20,866
So there you are!
Rehearsal was at 6:00!

690
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:24,161
Traffic.
Did my wife bring my new dress?

691
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:27,039
Your wife?
That's a new one.

692
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:44,473
Put this call on my tab.

693
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,779
Î—ello, Turandot?

694
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:31,436
The number you dialed
is not in service.

695
01:03:31,562 --> 01:03:32,646
Oh, it's you!

696
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:34,731
Put Turandot on.

697
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,109
It's Gabriel.

698
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:41,697
Mado? Go tell Albertine -

699
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:42,948
I'm all alone.

700
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:45,492
Throw any customers out!

701
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:48,662
I can't throw Charles out.
He's proposing to me.

702
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:51,165
About time! But move it!

703
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,589
So is it yes or no?

704
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:02,426
This is all so sudden,
Mr. Charles.

705
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,553
I have to think it over.

706
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:08,974
- So it's no?
- So it's yes.

707
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:14,062
Gabriel?
Mado Pettifoot and me

708
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,023
just got engaged.

709
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,197
Yep, we're marrying.

710
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:25,824
It won't change nothing,

711
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:29,745
except when we bang away,
it'll be legal.

712
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,664
We gotta celebrate.

713
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:36,126
Come to the club tonight
to see my new number.

714
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,129
But tell Albertine
to hurry with my dress.

715
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,216
Say, did the kid get back?

716
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,684
Enough is enough!
I'll fire you!

717
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,978
Thanks for ditching me!

718
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,023
Leaving me with that old bag!

719
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:03,445
Ready?
One, two, three.

720
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,184
You're all flustered.

721
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:17,311
I just got engaged.

722
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:20,314
Are you pregnant?

723
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,483
Not yet...

724
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:25,694
but we're getting married anyway.

725
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:27,779
This calls for a drink.

726
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:32,159
You mustn't refuse
a drop of grenadine.

727
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:34,578
You sure talk good.

728
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,289
It comes natural.

729
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:39,583
You've hardly touched it.

730
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,877
It goes to my head.

731
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:44,171
Oh, I nearly forgot!

732
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:48,050
Gabriel says to hurry with his dress.

733
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,512
He's invited all of us tonight.

734
01:07:10,823 --> 01:07:12,491
Fire!

735
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,286
My club's on fire!

736
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,390
At their age!

737
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:41,728
I can't just now,
on account of the uniform.

738
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,357
I must be out of my mind.

739
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:47,901
Aren't we all?

740
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:57,953
You saw us?

741
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,415
You two make a wild pair.

742
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,542
Not wild to other eyes.

743
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,419
The hell with the "not wilds."

744
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,970
Say, Madame Albertine,

745
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,514
I simply must get dressed.

746
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:20,142
What should I wear?

747
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:22,644
You don't look naked to me.

748
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,319
Anyway, it's just us girls.

749
01:08:37,409 --> 01:08:39,828
- You alone?
- Out for a stroll.

750
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:42,706
A little girl out alone
at this time of night!

751
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,461
I'm waiting for the others
to go see Uncle dance.

752
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:50,297
- That elephant dances?
- In a tutu, too!

753
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:54,843
Mind if I walk with you?
I feel so alone.

754
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:03,101
Mind if I walk with you?

755
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,647
Do be understanding with grown-ups.

756
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:09,107
Ah, love! If you only knew.

757
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:13,278
Some day you'll know love.
You'll see.

758
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:17,157
More dirty talk? Keep it clean
or I'll call another cop.

759
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:19,326
Heartless child!

760
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:20,577
Poor old hag.

761
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:22,913
Still, a cop! Yuck.

762
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,166
He just happened by.
If only your uncle had -

763
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,294
Lay off my uncle.
I told you he's married.

764
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:32,005
Auntie beats you any day.

765
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,801
Trouscaillon suits me -
or he will suit me.

766
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:37,511
Ah, love!

767
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,054
Can't you change channels?

768
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,724
Then see ya!

769
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:56,196
For an engagement,
a medium white is indispensable,

770
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,742
with a touch of virginal silver.

771
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,036
I'll skip the virginal part.

772
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:06,790
What about that
green-and-yellow skirt you wore

773
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,251
on Bastille Day?
- You noticed?

774
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,461
You looked exquisite.

775
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:14,464
That's really sweet.

776
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,217
So you notice me sometimes?

777
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:18,719
I do.

778
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:22,014
Because I think you're beautiful.

779
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:23,891
Do you?

780
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:29,563
Oh, I do! I really do!
I think you're swell-looking.

781
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:32,941
You're so well-stacked,

782
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:36,236
and so elegant on top of it.

783
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,072
Don't let's exaggerate.

784
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,242
But you are!
You're real swell.

785
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,119
Why don't we see more of you?

786
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,413
I'd like to see more of you.

787
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:49,500
Yes, why don't we?

788
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,253
You, the very picture of health,
which I dare point out,

789
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,631
and so beautiful on top of it.

790
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:58,592
I'm not one to flaunt it.

791
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:00,719
Leave it at that, dearie!

792
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:20,938
Watch this one!

793
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:07,901
Why did you ask us here tonight?

794
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,487
You who hide
behind a veil of ostracism.

795
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:14,408
You who never wanted
our "admirassation" for your art.

796
01:16:14,658 --> 01:16:17,327
We don't understand
the hic of this nunc.

797
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,580
So, cabbie, you're engaged?

798
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:31,175
- I hate parrots!
- See a "psicky-analyst."

799
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,177
I've tried dream analysis.

800
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,971
- What do you dream of?
- Wet nurses.

801
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:40,434
Something wrong, Mr. Gabriel?

802
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:42,478
I have stage fright.

803
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:45,814
Gabriel, you're on!

804
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,413
I have stage fright.

805
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:10,631
- On account of me?
- Nay, Mr. Pedro.

806
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,508
Why Mr. Pedro?

807
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,843
That was your name this morning.

808
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,596
Really? I forgot.

809
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:21,975
Aren't you gonna ask me
why I'm here?

810
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:24,102
No, I'm not.

811
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,481
That's really disgusting.

812
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:31,485
Well, I have
some questions for you.

813
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:35,197
Ask away, but I won't answer.

814
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:38,158
You have to.
I'm lnspector Bertin-Poirée.

815
01:17:38,283 --> 01:17:39,201
My card.

816
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:41,662
A fake, obviously.

817
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:47,835
Never seen gangster movies?
I could have you busted.

818
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,879
No search warrant,
violation of privacy.

819
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:54,675
- And violation of something else?
- Excuse me?

820
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,593
I got you under my skin.

821
01:17:56,802 --> 01:18:00,222
The minute I saw you,
I knew I had to bang you into bed.

822
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:03,600
Better sooner than later.
I can't wait.

823
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,687
I'm the impatient sort.

824
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:12,025
I've got it bad.

825
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:14,403
You must be joking.

826
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:17,156
Admit you're a phony cop.

827
01:18:17,281 --> 01:18:21,201
And you think a cop can't fall in love?
See my daisy?

828
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,500
- Then you're a real jerk.
- Some cops can't cut it.

829
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,882
But my personal charm
won't leave you -

830
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:42,055
My personal charm
won't leave you cold.

831
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:44,266
Tell me another one!

832
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,351
My sex appeal.

833
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:48,562
A few words

834
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,689
and my sex appeal
will go to work.

835
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:54,401
And if it doesn't?

836
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:57,571
Then I'll jump you, just like that!

837
01:18:58,572 --> 01:18:59,948
Earlier, it was Zazie.

838
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:06,538
But a real dish like you -

839
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,749
- Not with the others?
- They bore me.

840
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:10,250
I'll go get your bag.

841
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,085
I'm the fickle type.

842
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:15,130
This morning
it was the kid from the sticks.

843
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,174
At noon, you, baby-doll.

844
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:21,637
After lunch,
it was that society broad,

845
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:23,764
the Baroness Mwack, a widow.

846
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:29,728
In less than five minutes,
her life was turned upside-down.

847
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:32,981
You must think me a snob,
my lovely.

848
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:37,236
Still not under my spell,
my divine Albertine?

849
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:40,531
Getting dresseded?

850
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:44,159
- "Dresseded"? You mean "clothed."
- You can't fool me.

851
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:46,620
Check the dictionary.

852
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,249
An egghead, too! Let's see.

853
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:53,710
"Dreck, dredge, dregs..."
All household words.

854
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:56,129
Here it is: "dress"!

855
01:19:56,255 --> 01:20:00,634
"I dress, I dressed, I am dressed."
She was right!

856
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:04,471
"Undo, undreamed, undress..."
Opposite of "dress"!

857
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:07,641
So undress, my lovely!

858
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:10,477
Take it off, take it all off!

859
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:14,314
There's nothing in town
to top Gabriel's number.

860
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,525
But he's in a rut.

861
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:18,944
Entertainers are like that.

862
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:21,405
Once they find a gimmick,
they stick to it.

863
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,824
But don't we all?

864
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:26,702
Not me.
I keep changing mine.

865
01:20:26,827 --> 01:20:29,830
Because your act's no good.

866
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:34,418
You keep trying stuff.
So far nothing's worked.

867
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,503
You look like a flop.

868
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:39,464
- Even in uniform?
- That doesn't help.

869
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,634
It's the lech!
Recognize him?

870
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:46,847
This calls for an explanation!
- Where's the mustache?

871
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,849
- I left it at home.
- Leave him alone!

872
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:51,393
- Disturbing the peace!
- Moonlight rowdiness!

873
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:53,562
Mezzanoche madness!

874
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:58,484
Look again. I'm a cop.
See my wings?

875
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,751
- Where's Albertine?
- Vanished!

876
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:18,212
Onward to some onion soup!

877
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:31,517
I hereby proclaim and declare,
my dear Gabriel, before all present,

878
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:35,729
that you are
the greatest dancer in town.

879
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:43,153
And here's to you!

880
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:47,241
Cheer up.

881
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:51,119
An old hag like you is sure
to find another sucker.

882
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:54,498
Onion soup, Muscadet wine -

883
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:58,252
This is the life.
Dinner with friends, sincerity, purity.

884
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,255
Not eating your soup, Zazie?

885
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:04,299
Let her sleep. Let her dream.

886
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:07,469
That old crock still here?

887
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:10,139
Pity the unfortunate.
Right, old witch?

888
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:11,807
You're so kind.

889
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:15,144
Unlike her.
Children are so heartless.

890
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,355
How long's she gonna bug us?

891
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,441
The old wreck has a broken heart.

892
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:29,491
You ladies don't like
Alsatian sauerkraut?

893
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:30,784
No, they don't!

894
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:35,747
Who gafe zeez foreigners
ze right to talk kooking?

895
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:42,254
- You know what that costs?
- I sure do. I'm in the trade.

896
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:45,507
The old hag's guzzling all the wine.

897
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:47,676
This stuff isn't bad.

898
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:53,265
She has no class.
She'd never try that with me.

899
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:55,684
People are all jerks.

900
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,936
lncluding you.

901
01:23:03,484 --> 01:23:06,612
Is it the price?
It's fair enough!

902
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:08,530
If it weren't for the taxes!

903
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,376
Don't push!

904
01:23:44,525 --> 01:23:47,361
A spoonful for the parrot!
And for Mado!

905
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:40,080
Revenge!

906
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:30,464
Kill the cops!

907
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,635
But God is dead!

908
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:05,494
What?

909
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,751
Never say die!

910
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:20,801
Yes, it is I,
Haroun el Arachis,

911
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:22,803
prince of this world...

912
01:28:25,264 --> 01:28:27,641
whom you have known

913
01:28:27,808 --> 01:28:30,644
yet little recognized.

914
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:33,939
Trouscaillon! My king!

915
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:40,654
What a shame!

916
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,574
And me with a private income!

917
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,287
Crooked arm of the law,

918
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:50,164
nocturnaut shyster,

919
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:52,833
tormentor of widows and orphans,

920
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,170
I take pleasure
in donning the mask

921
01:28:56,295 --> 01:28:58,130
of confusion and error.

922
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:59,900
Go home to bed.
I'll take her to the train.

923
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:15,791
The strike's over!

924
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,418
And he's so stupid too.

925
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:02,337
If he insists, I may not refuse,

926
01:31:02,463 --> 01:31:06,175
but I won't chase
after him anymore.

927
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:19,897
Good-bye, sir.

928
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,691
Did you have a good time?

929
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:23,817
So-so.

930
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:26,278
Did you ride the metro?
Then what did you do?

931
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:27,654
I got older.
