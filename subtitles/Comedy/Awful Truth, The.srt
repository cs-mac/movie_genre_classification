1
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:39,288
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

2
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,887
<i>... from the beautiful
Carlou Theater...</i>

3
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,324
<i>... in the heart of sunny
Miami Beach, Florida...</i>

4
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,465
<i>... it's the Veterans Day
Polio Telethon!</i>

5
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,191
<i>And now, please
welcome your hosts...</i>

6
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:53,565
<i>... the beautiful, the talented,
Lanny Morris...</i>

7
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:56,708
<i>... and Vince Collins!</i>

8
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,029
Do you realize
we have to present ourselves...

9
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,790
...in front of these lovely
people for the next three days?

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,298
Hello, lovely people
for the next three days.

11
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:25,367
- Look at you. You're a disgrace.
- What?

12
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:29,200
Look, your hair's a mess, your shoes
aren't shined, your shirt's not pressed.

13
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:33,435
- Look at your tie. It's not even straight.
- Look at yours. It doesn't even clip on.

14
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,112
Now...

15
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,041
...I’m upset.

16
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,944
You know what
happens when I get upset.

17
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,748
No, no, no. Please.
Please don't hurt me, Vince.

18
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:48,154
I've had a terrible day already.
All sorts of bad things have happened.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,588
I don't wanna be hurt again.

20
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,320
- You've been hurt already, have you?
- Been hurt real bad.

21
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,725
And what happened,
pray tell?

22
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,766
- Want me to pray or want me to tell?
- I think you better pray.

23
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:59,662
<i>- I saw this stranger
- I don't know whether you're...</i>

24
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,067
<i>...singing or speaking.
- Leave my pad</i>

25
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:05,801
<i>- One thing I do know...
- And I said, "Baby...</i>

26
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,037
<i>- ... what explanation do you have?"
- There's always a woman involved.</i>

27
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:11,614
<i>And she said:</i>

28
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,614
<i>- Next time?
- Next time</i>

29
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,083
<i>And I said, "There will be
No next time"</i>

30
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:19,382
That's what you said last time,
Lanny, and the time before that.

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,853
You have to make sure there's no first
time, then there can't be a next time.

32
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,462
Or a last time.

33
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,397
<i>- That was the last time for me
- Let's hope so, Lanny.</i>

34
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,469
Lanny Morris,
ladies and gentlemen.

35
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,408
My manager sent me over
some of your work.

36
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,911
It's funny how you're
really in them a lot.

37
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,905
Whenever I read these
interviews where the writer says:

38
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:54,108
"This is how I felt the morning
I woke up to meet the pope"...

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,118
..."how I felt when the pope greeted
me, how he reminded me...

40
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:58,722
...so much of my friend Mike"...

41
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:01,586
...I always think,
"Who the fuck is Mike?"

42
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,056
So who are you?

43
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:08,127
<i>I was a young journalist...</i>

44
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,767
<i>... with a few awards...</i>

45
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:13,096
<i>... a couple of cover stories...</i>

46
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:16,274
<i>... and a desperate need
to prove myself.</i>

47
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,445
If you look through my work,
you'll see I try to present...

48
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,411
...a balanced view of my subjects.

49
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,550
I leave the conclusions
to the reader.

50
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:28,049
I'm not sure we like balance.

51
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,050
Or leaving
the conclusions to the reader.

52
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm used to being publicized,
not analyzed.

53
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:33,757
It would be your words.

54
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,291
We'd publish it as a transcript:

55
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:39,089
My questions, your answers.

56
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,957
If you say it, I can use it.

57
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,499
If you don't, I can't.

58
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,603
And they're gonna pay me
a million for this?

59
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,171
An excerpt will be published
in a magazine as a way...

60
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,742
...of amortizing the investment
they'll be making in the book.

61
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,640
They're looking for some...

62
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,782
...provocative stories
for the first issue.

63
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:04,251
Any thoughts on what these
provocative stories might be about?

64
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:08,952
The breakup.
Why Lanny and you split.

65
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:15,157
And the girl.

66
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,194
Maureen.

67
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:21,701
What happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.

68
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,373
<i>No one had ever been able
to pin Lanny Morris...</i>

69
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,979
<i>... or Vince Collins
to the girl's death.</i>

70
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:31,877
<i>All that was clear...</i>

71
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:35,713
<i>... was that Maureen was
found dead in their hotel suite.</i>

72
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,855
<i>It was unthinkable to me
that Lanny and Vince...</i>

73
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>... could have had
anything to do with it.</i>

74
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:45,062
<i>They were my heroes.</i>

75
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,697
"The reason I consider
myself to be a miracle girl...

76
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,732
...is because
I had the good fortune...

77
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:53,530
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick.

78
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:57,403
Their love of life
is what gave me hope...

79
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:01,101
...and it's hope
that gives us the power to live."

80
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:03,948
Thank you, Lanny.

81
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,083
Thank you, Vince.

82
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,665
Come on, let's hear it for her.

83
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:27,202
<i>Denise handled publicity
for the polio foundation.</i>

84
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:30,773
<i>And it was her idea to plug
the girl's story on the telethon.</i>

85
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:36,004
<i>The day before, it was my idea to plug
Denise at the Miami Versailles Hotel.</i>

86
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,514
Don't stop! Don't stop!

87
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,885
Don't stop!

88
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,895
<i>You can tell a lot about a woman
by the way she acts...</i>

89
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,700
<i>... when you're having sex
and room service comes in.</i>

90
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,968
<i>Some girls will sit up
and light a cigarette...</i>

91
00:06:57,177 --> 00:07:01,045
<i>... like there's nothing funny
in the world about her being naked.</i>

92
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,580
<i>"It's obvious we were
in the process of screwing...</i>

93
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,718
<i>... so why not let
a stranger into the room?"</i>

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,182
Come on in.

95
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,856
<i>Then there's the kind that will
pull the sheets up...</i>

96
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,615
<i>... and act like they're asleep.</i>

97
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,816
Where would you like it, sir?

98
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,791
Sweetheart, wherever you'd like it.

99
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:18,624
<i>Then, of course, there's
the ones who scrunch real flat...</i>

100
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,733
<i>... thinking that the bed
will look empty.</i>

101
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:25,497
<i>With Denise, it was kind of hard
to tell which way she'd go.</i>

102
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:36,008
Can I have your autograph,
Mr. Morris?

103
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,881
Sure.

104
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:41,111
Should I make it out to Maureen?

105
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,484
I mean, your autograph on the bill.

106
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,629
Okay.

107
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,596
I mean, I'd love
to have your autograph.

108
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,433
And maybe a few minutes
of your time.

109
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,470
I'm a huge fan and...

110
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,901
...well, I was thinking about...

111
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:08,172
...writing an article on you
for my campus paper.

112
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:09,815
I'm the editor.

113
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:13,214
Any interview requests
go through me, honey.

114
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,352
You know, it's just a college paper.

115
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:32,562
Thank you.

116
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:35,064
No, thank you.

117
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:37,838
Thank you, Maureen.

118
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,775
<i>I say goodbye to Maureen,
knowing I'd see her again...</i>

119
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,245
<i>... close the door and
then turn to look at Denise...</i>

120
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,409
<i>... thinking, "I know this girl from every
college town we have ever played. "</i>

121
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,020
<i>They're called career girls.</i>

122
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,487
<i>The absolute easiest lays...</i>

123
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,456
<i>... in this great nation of ours.</i>

124
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,489
<i>Since you're reading this,
you'd be interested to know...</i>

125
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,965
<i>... that my favorite catches
were the intellectuals.</i>

126
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>They'd be the ones in the straight
black dresses, severe black hair.</i>

127
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:11,740
<i>Your basic neurotic,
eyeglasses, cool jazz, liberal...</i>

128
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,607
<i>..."I'll fuck any black guy as
part of my personal apology...</i>

129
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,079
<i>... for racism in America" type.</i>

130
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:21,680
<i>Anyhow, on this particular night,
we're in a club in New Jersey...</i>

131
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:25,416
<i>... it's the '50s, and I'm mingling
with the crowd.</i>

132
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,951
<i>Now, when I say "mingling,"
what I mean is...</i>

133
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,187
<i>... I was scouting
for who I would sleep with.</i>

134
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,490
<i>Didn't matter if the girls
came with dates.</i>

135
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,965
<i>That was Reuben's job.
Reuben is my valet.</i>

136
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,968
<i>I never figured out how he
helped them get rid of their dates...</i>

137
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,539
<i>... but they were always gone
by the second show.</i>

138
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,835
<i>Reuben could clean up
any situation.</i>

139
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,944
Excuse me, miss.
May I say that I think...

140
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:49,309
...you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

141
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:52,974
Notice I say, "I think you've got the
most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."

142
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:55,849
I haven't seen them yet.
I've been staring at your cans.

143
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,318
Now, Lanny.

144
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:01,294
- I can't believe he just said that.
- That is completely unacceptable.

145
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,929
Madam, I apologize.
I apologize, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,861
...for my friend. You cannot
speak that way to a stranger.

147
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,393
Look, her husband's not offended.

148
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,537
- He's not?
- No, her husband's not offended.

149
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,264
Her husband's not here.
This lucky guy is her boyfriend.

150
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:16,875
And even he's not offended,
and do you know why?

151
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,908
Well, I can certainly hazard a guess.

152
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,980
What the hell is that? For chrissake,
Vince, this is America.

153
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:25,743
We don't say, "hazard a guess."
We say "yes" or we say "no."

154
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,614
Well, I say "no" to you, Morris.

155
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,311
Excuse me?
Could you repeat that?

156
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,753
I don't think
the entire audience heard you.

157
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,427
Go back to where
you came from, bastard!

158
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:37,461
<i>I get hecklers all the time,
but this schmuck came off personal.</i>

159
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,995
<i>Where did he think I came from?</i>

160
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,326
Bastard! Bastard!
He called me a bastard.

161
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,435
Now, it doesn't show
from the front, Lanny.

162
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:47,164
Now, please, would you kindly not
mount me? It's very disagreeable.

163
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:49,638
<i>Vince plunges straight into
quoting lines I wrote...</i>

164
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,834
<i>... from a song
from our first motion picture.</i>

165
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,946
<i>I happen to be honored
to work with this jerk</i>

166
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,116
Is that a compliment?

167
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,874
<i>I never frown with this clown</i>

168
00:10:58,085 --> 00:10:59,052
Never, never, never.

169
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,515
<i>I get a kick from this...</i>

170
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:04,749
<i>... friend of mine</i>

171
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,416
Fine, but don't give
the mike to this kike.

172
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,961
- Well...
- Just relax.

173
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:19,267
It's not often we get topped by
a member of our audience, but...

174
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,304
...this gentleman has
done the impossible.

175
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,237
What is your name?

176
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:25,868
- It's Joe.
- Joe...

177
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,310
...we were just wondering
if you'd be a great sport...

178
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,780
...and help us out on stage.
What do you say, folks?

179
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,616
Go on.

180
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,884
Joe here is going to play
a crazy high school professor...

181
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:44,496
...who's about to give Lanny
and I our final high school exam.

182
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:48,566
So if you'll just excuse us while
we help Joe change into his...

183
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,031
...crazy-professor outfit.

184
00:11:50,237 --> 00:11:52,330
Lanny, a little
costume-changing music...

185
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,473
...if you please.

186
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,147
Step this way.

187
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,353
I'll have a word with him...

188
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,353
...about the way
he spoke to your wife.

189
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,116
Completely unnecessary.

190
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,988
Just this way.

191
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:35,244
You call any Jew on this planet
anything you like.

192
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:40,113
But nobody calls my partner a kike.
Do you understand?

193
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:59,470
<i>Boffing ladies and
bashing gentlemen.</i>

194
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,267
<i>I tell you, there was
nothing under the sun...</i>

195
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,206
<i>... Vince and I wouldn't do
for each other.</i>

196
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:07,307
Are you finished?

197
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,258
Thank you, Mamie.

198
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,394
I'm sorry about that, Miss O'Connor.

199
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:27,795
We just needed to be sure
you didn't take any notes.

200
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,129
Lanny gave me very specific
instructions on that point.

201
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,739
I don't understand why
he'd want me to read this.

202
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,841
Why would he ever want
anyone to see this side of him?

203
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,707
When you contacted us about
meeting Lanny for your book...

204
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:44,714
...it wasn't simply about letting you
know he didn't want to speak with you.

205
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:48,380
I believe my client wanted you
to understand that he, in fact...

206
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,057
...was completing a book
of his own which would serve...

207
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:53,123
...not only as his autobiography...

208
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:57,263
...but also as the definitive account of
the joint careers of Morris and Collins.

209
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:01,400
You've had, at first hand,
a sample of Lanny's writing voice.

210
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,768
Yes, I have.

211
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,734
Such a book, Miss O'Connor...

212
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,430
...this raw, this honest...

213
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,769
...would make your own efforts look...

214
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,343
There's been some very nice...

215
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:15,037
...translations of the Bible
over the centuries...

216
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:18,149
...but they would run
a very poor second in popularity...

217
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:22,118
...to the discovery
of the actual Ten Commandments.

218
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,786
Single best part about teaching
grade two is the difference...

219
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:28,757
...between the bright ones and
the dumb ones isn't so obvious.

220
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,362
- What's so great about that?
- The results of my work...

221
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:33,123
...as a teacher
aren't so depressing.

222
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,996
Also, there's no homework
to correct in the evenings and...

223
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,764
...well, none of the kids
know how to use drugs.

224
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,979
<i>Bonnie had come from New York
to visit me that summer.</i>

225
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,742
<i>We'd been best friends
since kindergarten.</i>

226
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,854
<i>At school we started the
Lanny and Vince Fan Club...</i>

227
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:59,287
<i>... raising almost $200
for that year's telethon.</i>

228
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,358
All of you send in
a bit of your allowance.

229
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:04,689
Just a little bit.
A dime, a nickel, a penny.

230
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:07,423
Every bit helps.

231
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,496
<i>The goal of the telethon that year...</i>

232
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:15,004
<i>... was $3.9 million, which was
a lot of dough at that time.</i>

233
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,974
Thank you, Tom.
You're a prince among men.

234
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,670
Whoa, Lanny. There are
children watching!

235
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,372
Where does he get his energy?

236
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,351
<i>To remind viewers of the goal...</i>

237
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:29,648
<i>... we agreed the telethon
could run 39 hours nonstop.</i>

238
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:34,820
<i>The show would begin at 9 p.m. On
Friday and finish at noon on Sunday.</i>

239
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,360
<i>We paced it so that
Vince and I were together...</i>

240
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:39,657
<i>... for the kickoff,
most of the day Saturday...</i>

241
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:43,358
<i>... then the big finale
on Sunday with us bleary-eyed...</i>

242
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,505
<i>... and weeping as America
got ready to go to church.</i>

243
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:50,073
Lanny, Lanny. What are you doing?

244
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,643
I'm ordering a pizza. I'm starving.

245
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:56,577
No anchovies on mine, Lanny.
Hey, so who are you talking to?

246
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,946
I'm talking to little Suzie
from Whittier, California...

247
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:03,645
...and she is going to donate
three weeks of allowance.

248
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:07,020
- How about that, folks?
- Suzie from Whittier, thank you.

249
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,717
Three weeks of allowance.

250
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,328
That's a challenge for all you...

251
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,760
<i>What you have to understand
is that Vince and me...</i>

252
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,127
<i>... were essentially a boy-girl act.</i>

253
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,895
<i>I was the tramp,
ready for any sort of action...</i>

254
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,696
<i>... and Vince was the gentleman...</i>

255
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,033
<i>... always trying to make me
behave myself.</i>

256
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,733
<i>I was pleasure, and he was control.</i>

257
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:28,138
<i>I was rock 'n' roll,
and he was class.</i>

258
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:32,682
<i>His presence gave America
permission to like me.</i>

259
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:38,148
<i>My deal with the publisher
gave me first-class travel...</i>

260
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,882
<i>... a luxury I'd never enjoyed.</i>

261
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:42,493
Is there any chance of switching
to a window seat?

262
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:44,960
Sorry, we're completely booked
in first.

263
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:48,134
But these center seats
are really wonderful. See...

264
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,462
...if you push here...
Can I show you?

265
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,399
Sure.

266
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:56,735
The chair swivels
to the left and the right.

267
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,241
And this converts
to a full-sized dining table...

268
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,209
...during our
Pan Am platinum service...

269
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,974
...with damask linen
and silverware by Fornari...

270
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,414
...so you don't have to eat off a tray.

271
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,282
Again, that's only
for these center seats.

272
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,554
How does that sound?

273
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,553
<i>At that time, when you
traveled first class...</i>

274
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:18,857
<i>... people would always ask you if you
met someone famous on the flight.</i>

275
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,999
- Mr. Morris.
- Thank you.

276
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,361
You're welcome.

277
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:36,279
<i>Though he would later accuse me
of engineering this, I didn't.</i>

278
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:37,848
<i>It just...</i>

279
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:39,746
<i>... happened.</i>

280
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,119
Reuben. So they...
They record these songs...

281
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,058
...in a studio that I am paying for.

282
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:53,095
Songs that are recorded for me...

283
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,995
...that they are
contracted to provide.

284
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:57,170
- Are you with me here?
- Yes, it's just that...

285
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,567
No, it's just that nothing, Irv.
Please, let me finish. They record...

286
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:04,210
<i>I read an interview where Lanny was
given credit for insisting his butler...</i>

287
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:08,279
<i>... travel in the same class and stay
at the same hotels as his boss.</i>

288
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:12,283
<i>The valet's attentiveness
was impressive.</i>

289
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:16,586
Looks like you'll be having
dinner with Lanny Morris.

290
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,389
- Hello.
- Hi.

291
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:35,504
We should get a waiter to slide
a matchbook under the airplane.

292
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,234
There we go.

293
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,140
That should hold.

294
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:42,875
This is my friend Reuben.

295
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,311
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:47,077
And this is also my friend,
technically speaking...

297
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,255
...and business manager, Irv.
- Hi.

298
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,755
My name is Lanny.

299
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:59,055
And what's your name?

300
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,694
Bonnie. Bonnie Trout.

301
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,234
What do you do, Bonnie?

302
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:06,004
I teach.

303
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:07,833
And what do you teach?

304
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,271
- Second grade.
- Well, we have a lot in common.

305
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,968
You teach second grade,
I went to second grade.

306
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,342
- Irv, you went to second grade too?
- Many times.

307
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,016
Tell me, Miss Trout...

308
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,651
I don't mean to be impolite...

309
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:21,411
...but I was wondering...

310
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:25,182
...how a second-grade schoolteacher
affords to fly first class.

311
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,522
Well, I have a pass...

312
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:33,187
...that allows me free use
of the subway on weekends...

313
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,563
...and the hot lunches
at school are only 50 cents.

314
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:40,405
And I'm the mistress...

315
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,074
...of a wealthy married man...

316
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,903
...and when he and his wife
go on vacation, he treats me...

317
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:48,274
...to a first-class trip
in the opposite direction.

318
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:53,552
But look at me, talking only about
myself. What do you do for a living?

319
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:57,412
I'm a French impressionist
painter out of Tahiti, mainly.

320
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,058
I'm doing that to pay the bills.
My ambition is to be...

321
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,319
...a stockbroker in Paris.

322
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,256
- I don't get it.
- Paul Gauguin.

323
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,432
He gave up being
a successful stockbroker...

324
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,067
...to become a painter
in the South Seas.

325
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,935
You think the average
person knows that?

326
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:15,505
Well, we're not talking about
the average person, Irv.

327
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,112
<i>In some ways...</i>

328
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:23,510
<i>... he had never stopped
being a hero to me.</i>

329
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:28,481
<i>That's why it was impossible
to think he might also be a killer.</i>

330
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:36,753
Well, this has been great.

331
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:39,090
I'm gonna see you
inside your apartment.

332
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,767
- There's really no need.
- Don't be silly.

333
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:43,799
I'm not gonna try to come in.

334
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:45,527
Promise.

335
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,900
You've been away from your
apartment for how long now?

336
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:50,770
- Ages.
- You never know if somebody's...

337
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,569
...broken in while you were gone.

338
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,441
I'll just see you inside your door.

339
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:59,016
Believe me, I'm...
I'm not trying to seduce you.

340
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,187
<i>I have to do the Today show
at 7 a.m.</i>

341
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:03,788
They want me in Makeup at 6:15.

342
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,254
<i>Bonnie had moved to New York
for the teaching job...</i>

343
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,427
<i>... a little over a year ago.</i>

344
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:12,655
<i>I had never visited her and had
no idea if this was the right place.</i>

345
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,366
Which floor?

346
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,834
Why...

347
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,200
- Four-D.
- Forty?

348
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,605
It only goes up to six.

349
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:26,669
Four-D...

350
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,110
Four-D, the fourth floor.

351
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,436
Which way?

352
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:56,238
- Guess.
- Why?

353
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,705
It's a test.

354
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,435
A test?

355
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:02,806
Okay.

356
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,415
This way.

357
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:10,284
So why didn't we take this elevator?

358
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,117
Doesn't work.

359
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:16,794
Well...

360
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,029
...good night.

361
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:21,200
No, I'm going to see you
into your apartment.

362
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,926
And then I'm gonna leave you
alone until tomorrow.

363
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,051
I never get which key goes in
which lock the first time.

364
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,891
Hey, looks like they fixed it.

365
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:01,740
You okay?

366
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,341
Maybe we should turn on a light.

367
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,422
Well...

368
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,151
I'm going to leave you now.

369
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:25,695
I have Reuben and Irv waiting
in the limousine downstairs...

370
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,101
<i>...and I should get some sleep
for the Today show.</i>

371
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:32,770
So...

372
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,774
It was lovely to meet you, Bonnie.

373
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,497
<i>By the end of the telethon,
we had no voices.</i>

374
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:05,296
<i>Thirty-nine hours
of nonstop entertainment.</i>

375
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,338
<i>A telethon was a superhuman feat.</i>

376
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,999
<i>We weren't just heroes,
we were gods.</i>

377
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,612
<i>A couple of the boys were there
to make sure we got out alive...</i>

378
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:20,149
<i>... to make the flight to New York.</i>

379
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,958
Everyone. Listen. Listen.

380
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,253
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.

381
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:32,688
Gentlemen, if I could just
have your attention.

382
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,897
Everyone, Mr. Collins
and Mr. Morris...

383
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:37,365
...will answer questions
at the press conference...

384
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,265
...at the Palace Del Sol.

385
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:41,440
Gentlemen, there will be
plenty of time...

386
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:45,099
...to answer your questions
at the Palace Del Sol.

387
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:48,371
Thank you, we will answer your
questions at the press conference.

388
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:50,549
Thank you for coming.

389
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:59,548
<i>We had a full police escort, along
with bodyguards who were there...</i>

390
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,660
<i>... to protect us from any thoughts
we might have of going AWOI...</i>

391
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,625
<i>... prior to this press conference.</i>

392
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:07,959
<i>A pair of New Jersey's finest
walked on either side of us...</i>

393
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,727
<i>... as we entered
the lobby of the hotel.</i>

394
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:13,667
<i>It was an indication of how
legitimate the Mob had gone...</i>

395
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:16,068
<i>... that they could
bring in the local police...</i>

396
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:18,744
<i>... to guard the façade of their racket.</i>

397
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:23,442
<i>The local chief was a man
named Jack Scaglia.</i>

398
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,551
And of course, the two
gentlemen on my right...

399
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:30,052
...who need no introduction,
have come here directly...

400
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:33,919
...from their record-breaking
polio telethon in Miami, Florida.

401
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:38,452
So the first thing I'd like to announce
is that Mr. Sanmarco...

402
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,193
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

403
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,960
<i>... that Sally Sanmarco
was a slim, 6-foot-6 guy...</i>

404
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,161
<i>... who looked like a prince
and spoke with an English accent.</i>

405
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,738
<i>Then I wouldn't be
falling back on the stereotype.</i>

406
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:52,603
<i>The trouble was, Sally was
straight out of central casting.</i>

407
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:55,471
<i>A gangster
who looked and talked...</i>

408
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,310
<i>... just like you would expect
from the movies.</i>

409
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:01,112
How did it feel to raise
all that money for polio?

410
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,849
It felt great. It felt really great.

411
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:06,924
<i>From a publicity angle, and in
terms of giving him legitimacy...</i>

412
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:09,356
<i>... this was a huge coup for Sally.</i>

413
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:12,030
<i>Like I said, we were gods.</i>

414
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,928
<i>We'd only been in the New York area
for an hour or so, during which time...</i>

415
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:19,900
<i>... we were constantly watched
by police and reporters...</i>

416
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,836
<i>... which ended up being
a good thing for us.</i>

417
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,476
We got you our best bridal suite.

418
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:27,969
Fucking nice, huh?

419
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,811
People talk about having fancy
apartments and hotel rooms...

420
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,111
...on the West Side of Manhattan.
What do they see?

421
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,483
Fucking New Jersey.
Here, you see New York City.

422
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,165
<i>Unfortunately,
Vince and I were acquainted...</i>

423
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:51,666
<i>... with the dead girl in the bathroom
of our hotel suite in New Jersey.</i>

424
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:55,436
<i>Her last name was O'Flaherty.</i>

425
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,003
<i>Her first name was Maureen.</i>

426
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,908
<i>Karen, we decided to trade
apartments, not identities.</i>

427
00:27:03,116 --> 00:27:04,640
<i>Why didn't you make up a name?</i>

428
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:07,376
Bonnie, I was looking
at a five-hour flight.

429
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:10,715
I didn't wanna make up a life story
that wasn't attached to anything.

430
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:14,415
Well, I returned the offense.
I got to pretend I was you.

431
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,185
<i>- What?
- You received a package.</i>

432
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:18,693
Messenger service.
I signed your name.

433
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,526
- Who's it from?
- No address. Want me to open it?

434
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,258
- Sure.
- That's good. I already did.

435
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:24,731
It's a manuscript.

436
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,371
"Excerpt From the Memoirs of...

437
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:29,336
...Lanny Morris."

438
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:33,535
Hey, all your dreams are coming true.
He's writing you love letters already.

439
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,714
Bonnie, I need
to know what he's written.

440
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:39,874
- Well, I'll send it to you.
- Now. Before he calls me tomorrow.

441
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,056
- Please?
- All right.

442
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,290
All right.

443
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:49,927
Here we go.

444
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:56,234
"Let me explain to you why two
very famous guys just finishing...

445
00:27:56,435 --> 00:28:00,565
...a nationally broadcast telethon
ended up in New Jersey."

446
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:10,410
<i>For years, the Palace Del Sol was
one of the centers of Mob prosperity.</i>

447
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:13,608
<i>Needless to say, a major
headliner in the showroom...</i>

448
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,983
<i>... helped legitimize
the entire operation.</i>

449
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,919
Give her a kiss. Yeah, beautiful.

450
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,151
One more, guys. That's it.
That's great. Thank you.

451
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,795
<i>Vince and I needed help
in keeping us up all the time...</i>

452
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,192
<i>... and in the way of thinking
in the '50s...</i>

453
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,630
<i>... anything you didn't take
with a needle was okay.</i>

454
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:33,499
<i>It wasn't "serious" serious.
It was like running a red light.</i>

455
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:38,575
<i>Everyone used bennies. Vince added
them to his morning coffee like sugar.</i>

456
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,608
<i>Not that you could tell.</i>

457
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,411
<i>When we did finally
decide to flatten out...</i>

458
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:53,581
<i>... we'd take two or three Tuinals,
or three or four "Threeinals."</i>

459
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:55,090
<i>They were really good.</i>

460
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:57,592
<i>Between the moment you took them
and passing out...</i>

461
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,960
<i>... it felt really sexy.</i>

462
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,730
Sure.

463
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:40,064
- Enjoyed the show.
- Thank you.

464
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:46,435
<i>The walls of the Blue Grotto...</i>

465
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:49,308
<i>... were made of a mixture
of plaster and Styrofoam.</i>

466
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:52,382
<i>Flammable as all hell. But the boys
had learned it was cheaper...</i>

467
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:56,043
<i>... to give the inspector 200 bucks
and a ringside table to our show...</i>

468
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,486
<i>... than to spend thousands
of dollars on fireproofing.</i>

469
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:02,923
<i>Besides, it was always vital in
a business enterprise of this sort...</i>

470
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:06,826
<i>... to have the option to torch the place
at a moment's notice...</i>

471
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,399
<i>... should the need present itself.</i>

472
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:14,597
<i>One night, after our show,
we were taken to Sally's office.</i>

473
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,365
<i>We wondered
what we had done wrong...</i>

474
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,203
<i>... but what we had done
was done good.</i>

475
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:20,675
<i>Sally started going on about
how much he liked us...</i>

476
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,644
<i>... how he thought we were
a good fit with his crowd...</i>

477
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,579
<i>... meaning that we brought in
an audience of heavy drinkers...</i>

478
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:28,651
<i>... adulterers and gamblers.</i>

479
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:31,345
So, what we want is for you boys
to come back here...

480
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:34,355
...three months from now
and open our new showroom for us.

481
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:38,327
A two-week,
exclusive limited engagement...

482
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:41,432
...that we want you to do for us
for six weeks.

483
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:44,563
<i>God help you when a killer
takes a shining to you.</i>

484
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,707
<i>I looked at Vince and scratched my
nose, which meant our strongest "no."</i>

485
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:51,638
That's a very great honor, Sally.

486
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:54,312
- You're damn fucking right it is.
- The thing is...

487
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:57,573
...we're just trying to cut down on
the nightclub work at the moment.

488
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:00,377
We turned down the Sands
so we could do a TV special...

489
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:04,613
...and the only reason we still work the
Versailles is out of friendship for you.

490
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:11,663
- What dates were you thinking of?
- We open November 15th.

491
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,492
Sally, any other day
we would be here in a flash...

492
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,726
...but, you know, that's the day
right after the next polio telethon.

493
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:20,997
I mean, we always take two weeks off
right after that to recover.

494
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,401
- Right, Vince?
- At least.

495
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,701
- I mean, we're tired.
- That's the way I want you.

496
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,539
After the fucking telethon,
we fly you up from Miami...

497
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:31,444
...hold a press conference,
all fucking exhausted...

498
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,642
...so people know
what heroes you are.

499
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:37,155
I'll keep a suite for you
with the best hookers I got.

500
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,449
Your own personal cathouse.

501
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,126
And I'll have them send you up...

502
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,261
...a shipment of lobsters
and stone crabs.

503
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,896
- You like lobsters?
- Love them.

504
00:31:46,098 --> 00:31:47,793
And a case of these...

505
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,628
...special grapefruits...

506
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:53,669
...that I get special down there.

507
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:57,007
The most delicious thing
you ever tasted in your life.

508
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,473
Juicy, thin skin.

509
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:04,042
<i>Months later, on the night
before the telethon in Miami...</i>

510
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,616
<i>... we got back to our room
and found that Sally...</i>

511
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:10,016
<i>... had been more than good
to his word.</i>

512
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:14,520
<i>Laid out around the room
were various crates...</i>

513
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:17,218
<i>... bearing the addresses
of their destination:</i>

514
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,797
<i>Our suite at the Palace Del Sol
hotel in New Jersey.</i>

515
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,994
"You like lobsters?
See you in New Jersey."

516
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:30,238
"Thin skin, fucking most delicious
fucking thing...

517
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:32,104
...you ever had in your fucking life."

518
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:35,109
"What I thought was a box
of beach balls turned out to be...

519
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:37,578
...the thinnest-skinned,
dripping-wet grapefruits...

520
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,375
...I’d ever tasted in my life.

521
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,179
The 6-foot crate was filled
with fruits of the sea...

522
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:45,221
...slowly shifting over a bed of ice."

523
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:49,019
Yeah, this is Lanny Morris.
Send up three steaks, all right?

524
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:50,559
Yeah. Make them rare this time.

525
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,094
- Yeah, rare.
- Like bloody.

526
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:55,563
Bloody. And a couple of bottles
of that champagne.

527
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,736
- Make that three.
- Three bottles of champagne.

528
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:01,338
And can you make sure
that Maureen delivers them?

529
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,167
Yeah, Maureen.

530
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:05,166
<i>We called down for Maureen...</i>

531
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,208
<i>... the room-service girl
I'd met earlier...</i>

532
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,904
<i>... who wanted the interview
for her school paper.</i>

533
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:12,710
<i>She brought up three steaks,
one for her...</i>

534
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:15,751
<i>... as her last official delivery
of the day.</i>

535
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:17,513
<i>As much as I love lobster...</i>

536
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:20,783
<i>... seeing all that shellfish
nestled on ice in the crate...</i>

537
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:24,952
<i>... put me in the mood
for hooves, not claws.</i>

538
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:39,216
<i>The interview for Maureen's campus
paper went better than expected.</i>

539
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,650
<i>Vince and I popped some Tuinals...</i>

540
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,153
<i>... to insure that
we would sleep like babes...</i>

541
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:49,227
<i>... after we wore off the general
horniness that the pills first give you.</i>

542
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:55,295
<i>Vince bought insurance on his bet
by having a few babes on hand.</i>

543
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:58,665
<i>Well, not exactly on his hand.</i>

544
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,237
<i>That wasn't his preference.</i>

545
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:03,842
"Not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference."

546
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:09,175
"Not exactly on his hand"?
"That wasn't his preference"?

547
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,811
"The Tuinals, coupled with
a nice amount of booze...

548
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,545
...guaranteed us
the sleep of the dead.

549
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:18,224
Late the next morning,
Maureen was sent packing...

550
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:24,364
...and Vince and I prepared ourselves
for that night's broadcast."

551
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:28,924
Well, I guess this is one story my kids
won't have to give a book report on.

552
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,570
Thanks.

553
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:34,968
Must be weird to find out...

554
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:38,906
...that the object of all your
adolescent fantasies is a pig.

555
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:42,943
He's not like that.

556
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,813
Oh, so it's just the way
he describes himself.

557
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,418
<i>She was right.</i>

558
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:52,148
<i>Which was the real Lanny?</i>

559
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,753
<i>I'd find out later that the story
of the hookers in the hotel suite...</i>

560
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,431
<i>... was a complete fabrication.</i>

561
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:01,362
<i>That night, Maureen was alone.</i>

562
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,820
<i>- Hello?
- So how did you like the show?</i>

563
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:33,556
<i>Lanny?</i>

564
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:37,399
<i>The Today show.</i>

565
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:38,969
You did watch, didn't you?

566
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,207
<i>- The show.
- You didn't watch.</i>

567
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,570
<i>Wow, that's scary.</i>

568
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,343
You see, when you're a star...

569
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,576
...you live in terror,
wondering if it's all over yet.

570
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,617
You keep looking for the signs.

571
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,882
You're shooting a scene from a movie
on a New York street...

572
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,286
...and a crowd doesn't form.

573
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,290
You meet a girl on a plane
and tell her...

574
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,157
<i>...that you're gonna be on the
Today show the next morning...</i>

575
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:07,128
...and she doesn't
wake up early to watch.

576
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,097
It's very scary.

577
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:12,937
Hey, you know,
I mentioned you on the air.

578
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:17,009
<i>- You did?
- Yes, I proposed to you on the air.</i>

579
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:20,078
Your building is probably
surrounded with photographers...

580
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,976
<i>- ... at this very moment.
- You're kidding.</i>

581
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,084
Yes, I'm kidding.

582
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,012
So...

583
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,388
...what time would you like to meet?

584
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,416
Stanley, this is Bonnie.
Bonnie, Stanley.

585
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,110
Nice to meet you.

586
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,686
Is the food almost ready, Stan?

587
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,791
Yeah. I'll bring it right out,
Mr. Lanny.

588
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,889
I was very hungry, so I asked Stanley
to prepare us something special.

589
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,088
That sounds great.

590
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,491
Tell me, what kind of a meeting...

591
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:18,569
...does a schoolteacher have to go to
during the summer vacation?

592
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,866
I'm exploring the possibility
of another job.

593
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,704
- Something in publishing.
- How did it go?

594
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,380
Okay.

595
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:30,509
Have you ever thought
about writing a book?

596
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:34,245
- About what?
- Your life.

597
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,251
Sure. When I'm dead.

598
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,288
No, seriously.

599
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,619
It would have to be published
after I died...

600
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,728
...when I wouldn't care what
anybody thought about me.

601
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:48,601
So, what would you write about,
if you were going to tell the truth?

602
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:50,497
In my book?

603
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:54,329
Well, the truth is,
I've met four presidents.

604
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,304
They all seemed like
they were out of it.

605
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,444
Like they had no idea
what was going on.

606
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:01,944
Even J.F.K. Left me unimpressed.
I felt like I was with the boss' son.

607
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,707
You don't think you could say that?

608
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,977
Not if I was planning
on living in this country. No, no.

609
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,122
I don't think that Judy Garland
was such a great singer...

610
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:11,723
...after she turned 16.

611
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:15,292
That quiver, you know,
it was like she had no control over it.

612
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,463
I would get killed for saying that.

613
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:20,929
Or that Marilyn Monroe
was no better an actress...

614
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,626
...after she studied with
Lee Strasberg than before.

615
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:29,773
I'm saying what really happened.

616
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,739
Having to be a nice guy...

617
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:38,247
...is the toughest job in the world
when you're not.

618
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,516
This is a lamb in tea sauce.

619
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:50,526
This is twice-cooked pork
with shredded, pickled cabbage.

620
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:53,399
Kung Pao chicken.

621
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,162
And this is Kung Ping Loh Haa...

622
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,966
...lobster in tangerine peel
for you and your lovely lady friend.

623
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,343
You shouldn't have
done that, Stanley.

624
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:06,444
I don't eat lobster. I'm Jewish.

625
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:07,875
But you eat pork.

626
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:10,706
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, I just thought...

627
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:14,785
No shrimp, no lobster.
They're disgusting. Take it away.

628
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,684
I will pay for the dish,
but take it away, please.

629
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,786
I'll change it.

630
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,258
I'm sorry, I...

631
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,795
I should have asked.
Maybe you love lobster.

632
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,728
I'm fine.

633
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,130
Have you ever had
Szechwan cuisine before?

634
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,863
It's from the northern part of China.

635
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:36,440
It must be strange for you.

636
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:42,213
If you complain to a waiter,
you're not just some jerk at table five...

637
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,610
...you're Lanny Morris.

638
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:47,276
I know that everyone
dreams about being famous...

639
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,250
...but it would be interesting
to know...

640
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,424
...what it's like
to relinquish all anonymity.

641
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:59,758
- Gets me a date.
- Does that bother you?

642
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:02,799
That people only wanna be with you
because of who you are?

643
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:06,097
- As opposed to?
- Well...

644
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:08,171
...the real you.

645
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:11,270
The real me.

646
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,511
The real me was brought up
as a nice middle-class kid...

647
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,346
...which is not the easiest thing...

648
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:23,990
...when you are extremely poor
and living in a slum.

649
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:29,426
The real me spent most of his time
getting the shit kicked out of him...

650
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,154
...and dreaming about
something better.

651
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,767
Like being here
with someone like you.

652
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:42,065
<i>Fifteen years ago, he had,
for one brief moment...</i>

653
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:45,142
<i>... made me feel like
the most special person in the world.</i>

654
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:49,748
"The miracle in my life
is not that I survived polio...

655
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,850
...and am standing here today.

656
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:56,079
No. The reason I consider myself
to be a miracle girl...

657
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,950
...is because I had
the good fortune...

658
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,285
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick."

659
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,556
<i>It was a moment
seen by millions of people...</i>

660
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:08,428
<i>... but felt only by me.</i>

661
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,373
<i>That moment had changed my life.</i>

662
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:23,514
<i>I was about to find my own way
into Lanny's book...</i>

663
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:28,417
<i>... after he had found
such a powerful way into mine.</i>

664
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:44,262
Checking out today?

665
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,310
Is there a message
for Bonnie Trout?

666
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,917
- From one of our guests?
- Yes, Lanny Morris.

667
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,417
I'm afraid not.

668
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,786
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

669
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,130
Do you need a cab?

670
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:29,235
I still don't understand
why Vince Collins is willing...

671
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:32,900
...to be involved in such
an exposé of himself.

672
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,910
Vince is a realist.

673
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,811
The days of his box-office
power are drawing to a close.

674
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:40,015
Given the amount of money
we're offering...

675
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,849
And it's because the investment
in Mr. Collins is so large...

676
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:49,996
...I’ve compiled a list of questions
we'd like the miracle girl to ask.

677
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,562
I don't wanna look at your questions.
I have my own approach.

678
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:03,834
Ms. O'Connor, we're not paying
a million dollars for your approach...

679
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,205
...we're paying for what
Vince Collins has to say.

680
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:09,576
To me. What he has to say to me.

681
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:13,181
Greg, this is not as easy as it looks.

682
00:44:13,753 --> 00:44:16,517
If you go to Vince Collins
and ask him a series of questions...

683
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,987
...you'll come back here
with a 300-page press book.

684
00:44:19,192 --> 00:44:22,286
Well, as I've always understood
this company's policy...

685
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:24,520
...while the book is being written...

686
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:29,168
...the relationship between the author
and editor is sacrosanct.

687
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,329
This isn't your typical book deal.

688
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,698
We've really just leased
an oil well called Vince Collins...

689
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,243
...and granted Ms. O'Connor
the right to tap.

690
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,938
I think we have a responsibility to...

691
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,715
...monitor the drilling.

692
00:45:09,943 --> 00:45:12,434
- Hello.
- Mrs. O'Flaherty?

693
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,536
Yes.

694
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:18,410
My name's O'Connor.
I'm the one writing the book.

695
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:34,728
The book will be
centered around Vince Collins.

696
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,767
I'll be asking him a lot of questions.

697
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:42,999
I wanted to know if there were any
you'd like to have answered yourself.

698
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:51,441
Maureen and I planted this tree
on her fifth birthday.

699
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:56,355
Father did most of the digging,
of course.

700
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,585
She'd be 38.

701
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,486
I'm 59 myself.

702
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,359
If she were alive now...

703
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,330
...we'd be talking about things,
back and forth...

704
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,337
...like two women.

705
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:18,341
Like you and I are doing.

706
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:26,178
And Maureen's father?

707
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,712
Frank died six years ago.

708
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:32,483
He took his own life.

709
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:36,153
One night, just before he died...

710
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:39,491
...he dug up the earth
around this tree...

711
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:42,797
...he took the urn
with Maureen's ashes in it...

712
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:45,732
...and spread them around its roots.

713
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,406
So this is my daughter.

714
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:55,640
This is what I have of her.

715
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:05,352
<i>- Are you Catholic?
- My... My mother was.</i>

716
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,651
<i>Then you will understand
my dilemma.</i>

717
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:12,559
<i>Our faith offers an afterlife.</i>

718
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:16,099
A daughter needs her mother.

719
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:23,199
So I have to live out this life
as far from sin as I can manage.

720
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:28,774
<i>I'll never see my husband again.</i>

721
00:47:29,315 --> 00:47:31,715
<i>He's consigned himself to hell.</i>

722
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:37,612
<i>But what if Maureen
killed herself too?</i>

723
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:43,955
She's in hell, with my husband.

724
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:48,294
The life I'm trying to lead
will bring me to heaven's grace...

725
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:52,736
...only to hear
their screams of torment.

726
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:56,504
<i>Chief Scaglia,
you were in the hotel room...</i>

727
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:59,872
<i>... when they found
Maureen's body in the tub.</i>

728
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:04,215
So was Sally, so was Lanny,
so was Vince.

729
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:09,849
And there was also
a PR lady there from the hotel.

730
00:48:10,256 --> 00:48:11,814
How do you think she died?

731
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:15,552
She died in an auto accident
two weeks later. It was terrible.

732
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,226
No, Maureen.

733
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,095
- How did Maureen die?
- She drowned.

734
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:25,100
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

735
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,830
You and I take baths all the time.
We don't drown in them.

736
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:31,067
You and I do not mix
sleeping pills with booze.

737
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:34,212
- She committed suicide?
- Overdose is the official story.

738
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:38,248
What's the official story on the fact
that the staff of the hotel in Miami...

739
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:41,511
<i>... all seemed to know she delivered
room service to the boys' suite...</i>

740
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:44,554
...three days before
and was never seen alive again?

741
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:46,088
What happened to her?

742
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,760
How did she end up
in a hotel room in New Jersey?

743
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:52,830
Sally never had any problem
moving girls around. Okay?

744
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:54,226
He had two hotels.

745
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,425
- So Sally arranged it?
- No, I don't think so.

746
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,503
You see, she was brought up there
as a reward for the boys...

747
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:02,368
...and I think she started
to party just a little too early.

748
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:05,066
She was a student.
This was a summer job.

749
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:06,540
Listen to me...

750
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,919
...the Palace Del Sol was very
important to Sally, okay?

751
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,282
He launched his new wing...

752
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:19,788
...with a push
from Lanny and Vince...

753
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:25,625
...and this stupid girl
shows up dead.

754
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:30,460
She's not gonna come back.
We do the best thing for all of us.

755
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:35,130
We speed up the investigation
and we cremate her. Okay?

756
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:37,536
End of story.

757
00:49:40,346 --> 00:49:43,941
- Here you are.
- Here's your lobster.

758
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,085
- Enjoy.
- Looks great.

759
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:52,287
"Sally said, 'I'll have them send you
up your own shipment of lobsters.

760
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:54,517
<i>You like lobster?"'</i>

761
00:49:55,094 --> 00:49:58,393
<i>We said we did
because we really did.</i>

762
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:02,066
<i>You shouldn't have done that,
Stanley. I don't eat lobster.</i>

763
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:07,404
<i>Were there any signs of violence
on her body?</i>

764
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:11,907
No, no. There were some
small scratches on the torso.

765
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:19,183
<i>Why did my daughter die?
Did she kill herself?</i>

766
00:50:20,086 --> 00:50:23,647
<i>What had they done to her
that would make her do that?</i>

767
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,489
<i>What had they done?</i>

768
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,697
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

769
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:39,565
<i>... when terrible things
happened to people...</i>

770
00:50:39,772 --> 00:50:42,332
<i>... they were left as a mystery.</i>

771
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,741
<i>Even the tabloids kept a distance.</i>

772
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:58,920
<i>Some things were allowed
to be left just the way they were.</i>

773
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,565
Any trouble with the directions
I gave you?

774
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:13,205
- Only the parts where I had to turn.
- Sorry.

775
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:16,507
It's the price of seclusion.

776
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:23,572
You haven't switched over
to cassette?

777
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:27,651
- Actually, it's my dad's.
- And what does he do?

778
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:31,149
He was a journalist too.

779
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:34,557
He did a big story on you once.

780
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,423
Followed a little girl who had polio.

781
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,028
You took her under your wing...

782
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,499
...and now she's interviewing you.

783
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:50,304
He must be proud that his daughter's
making such a name for herself.

784
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:52,936
I'd like to think so.

785
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,742
- He died last year.
- Sorry to hear that.

786
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:03,014
- Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.

787
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:11,961
Are you alone here?

788
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:16,192
Yes. The thought of having live-in help
is a little poisonous to me.

789
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:17,801
Why's that?

790
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:19,904
Well, I'd have to talk to them...

791
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:22,540
...ask them how
their family was doing...

792
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:25,370
...hear about this and that,
introduce them to the guests...

793
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:28,240
...and tell them
how their family was doing.

794
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:32,145
All so that I would
seem to be a nice guy...

795
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,943
...which is an awful lot of work...

796
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:36,587
...considering what I cherish
most in life these days...

797
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,848
...is not to have to be Vince Collins.

798
00:52:39,058 --> 00:52:40,491
No Reuben in your life?

799
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,785
How do you know about Reuben?

800
00:52:44,163 --> 00:52:47,690
He was in a lot of the material
I've been looking at.

801
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,367
No, I never had a Reuben.

802
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,935
Lanny always paid him directly.
He was Lanny's man.

803
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:53,605
Right.

804
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:58,067
You know, what I like is to...

805
00:52:58,277 --> 00:52:59,869
...read...

806
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,379
...think.

807
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:04,777
It's to have the freedom...

808
00:53:04,984 --> 00:53:07,475
...to get up and leave
without telling anyone about it...

809
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,587
...any time of day.

810
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:13,923
Or even having to say goodbye.

811
00:53:16,129 --> 00:53:20,088
To be backstage, surrounded
by acrobats, actors, magicians...

812
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,164
...it was intoxicating.

813
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:24,199
You know, I was only 12 years old.

814
00:53:24,403 --> 00:53:26,030
That's a...

815
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:27,763
That's a pretty impressionable age.

816
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:31,034
<i>- To hear all these stories of touring...
- My father always told me...</i>

817
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:34,736
<i>... that nothing had meaning
unless it could be put on the record.</i>

818
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:38,240
<i>Yet things had changed.</i>

819
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,478
<i>As Vince had pointed out
at our first meeting...</i>

820
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:45,987
<i>... it had become fashionable
to put yourself into the story.</i>

821
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:49,992
<i>The question became
how far you were prepared to go.</i>

822
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:17,620
- Excuse me. That's not mine.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

823
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,755
Aren't you Miss Trout?

824
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:25,590
We've met,
on the plane to New York.

825
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:26,992
- Reuben.
- Excuse me, sir.

826
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,964
Can I leave you
for just a second, please?

827
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:36,469
I'm so deeply sorry, Miss Trout,
the way you were treated.

828
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:40,703
- He could have left a note.
- Of course.

829
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:45,542
Miss Trout, I would like you
to understand something.

830
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:51,118
I have a great loyalty to Mr. Morris.
He's treated me very well.

831
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,019
I'm very grateful.

832
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:57,453
He has done wonderful things
for many people...

833
00:54:57,663 --> 00:55:02,623
...and I have been privileged
to work for him.

834
00:55:04,203 --> 00:55:06,501
But I do have certain principles...

835
00:55:06,706 --> 00:55:10,938
...especially about how women
are to be treated and respected.

836
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:16,748
Mr. Morris can be very attentive,
but once he has a woman...

837
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:20,715
Oh, God, I think
it's almost a sickness.

838
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:24,553
When he left you that morning...

839
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:27,385
...you may have felt bad,
but believe me, Miss Trout...

840
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:29,424
...to have him out of your life...

841
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:32,325
...is the best thing that
could have happened to you.

842
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:37,062
At that point, you may have felt
your life was wounded.

843
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:40,435
It wasn't.

844
00:55:41,307 --> 00:55:42,569
It was saved.

845
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:54,050
<i>Vince, I was very clear about this
from the beginning.</i>

846
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:55,845
<i>I'm not out to play games with you.</i>

847
00:55:56,055 --> 00:55:58,421
<i>This is why you're being paid
a huge amount of money.</i>

848
00:55:59,425 --> 00:56:01,256
<i>This isn't entirely about money,
you know.</i>

849
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,020
A million dollars is more than
the gross of your last film.

850
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:07,595
I was somehow
under the impression that my life...

851
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,769
...might have been of more than
passing interest.

852
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,962
But if my fleeting encounter with
a girl named Maureen O'Flaherty...

853
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:17,108
...is all you really want to talk about,
then that's what we'll do.

854
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:20,909
I have to make an appearance
at the clinic tomorrow.

855
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:23,240
We can come back
and talk after that.

856
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:26,012
It's Wonderland.

857
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:27,810
I imagine you might remember that.

858
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:46,131
<i>He was right.
I did remember Wonderland.</i>

859
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:48,735
- You ready?
- Ready.

860
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:54,208
<i>When I was a girl, the entire hospital
was devoted to children with polio.</i>

861
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:59,078
<i>Since that time,
it had become a clinic for kids...</i>

862
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:02,516
<i>... with a variety of different
physical handicaps.</i>

863
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:09,492
<i>Once a year, the children
would put on a pageant...</i>

864
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:13,028
<i>... playing different characters
from Alice in Wonderland.</i>

865
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:16,467
<i>Vince, in his continuing support
of the hospital...</i>

866
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:19,160
<i>... had hired a band and a singer.</i>

867
00:57:26,645 --> 00:57:28,340
Who is that?

868
00:57:28,547 --> 00:57:32,381
I don't know.
She's good, whoever she is.

869
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:47,060
Karen, do you mind if we start
this conversation tomorrow?

870
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:50,895
I'm just...
I'm not feeling all that well.

871
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,060
- Vince...
- In fact, it won't make...

872
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:55,536
...any difference over there.
The office is closed.

873
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:56,935
They've been working late.

874
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:59,134
Then they've been working
much too hard.

875
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:03,107
First thing tomorrow. First thing.

876
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:12,489
I hope your editors were reasonable.

877
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:15,660
Reasonable? No, they weren't.

878
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:17,920
We can go as late as you like.

879
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,392
That's good.

880
00:58:19,598 --> 00:58:21,031
It might take us
into the evening.

881
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:23,201
I had a feeling
that might be the case.

882
00:58:23,702 --> 00:58:26,364
So I've ordered a hot and cold
smorgasbord to be brought in.

883
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:28,039
We can work through dinner.

884
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,435
- We'll be having company?
- Yes.

885
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:33,435
I have...

886
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:35,341
...a surprise for you.

887
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:39,046
Actually, this is a fairly big deal
for me as well.

888
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:42,652
I've asked Lanny to join us today.

889
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:44,980
Lanny?

890
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:48,485
Well, this is something.

891
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:52,387
Neuman and Newberry will certainly
be getting their money's worth.

892
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:55,263
I thought that if I was
going to discuss something...

893
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:57,265
...that had such an impact
on our lives...

894
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,064
...it would be fair for Lanny
to hear what I had to say.

895
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:02,468
Given that we've
never talked about it.

896
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:05,337
I'm sure I'll have lots to ask him.
When is he coming?

897
00:59:05,544 --> 00:59:07,478
He should be here any minute now.

898
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:09,878
This is very exciting.

899
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,246
Shit.

900
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:29,129
<i>- Yes?
- Bonnie, I have to talk fast.</i>

901
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:32,395
I need you to do exactly as I tell you
and I can't tell you why, okay?

902
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:33,833
<i>Sure.</i>

903
00:59:34,573 --> 00:59:36,939
Excuse me, that might actually
be him now.

904
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:39,672
Yes, hello?

905
00:59:52,057 --> 00:59:53,615
Yes, thank you.

906
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:56,692
That was my office.

907
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:59,364
There's a woman...
A friend, a relative of yours?

908
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:01,965
She said she called
on a number you gave her.

909
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:04,535
She's gonna call back.

910
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,137
<i>- Yes?
- Hi, kiddo.</i>

911
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:16,473
<i>Listen, your brother Clifford
has just been rushed to the hospital.</i>

912
01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:18,445
<i>He was doing construction
when a thing...</i>

913
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,448
<i>- A steel girder?
- That's it.</i>

914
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:23,144
<i>You better come to the city
and make your peace with him.</i>

915
01:00:23,355 --> 01:00:25,516
<i>You're booked on the next
flight to San Francisco.</i>

916
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:27,885
<i>I'm waiting here for you
in front of the terminal.</i>

917
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:30,794
They reserved me a seat
on the next flight to San Francisco.

918
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:32,293
- I'll drive you there.
- No, no.

919
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:35,558
Sharon is waiting at the airport for me.
You can't stand Lanny up.

920
01:00:35,768 --> 01:00:38,202
Please give him
my deepest apologies.

921
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:50,443
- Hey.
- Please, I can explain.

922
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:53,547
You've broken the law,
Bonnie-fucking-Trout.

923
01:00:53,752 --> 01:00:55,583
You've assumed
another person's identity...

924
01:00:55,788 --> 01:00:58,154
...to get information
from a business competitor.

925
01:00:58,357 --> 01:01:01,019
Obviously I lied about who I was.
I'm sorry.

926
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:03,422
It was a huge untruth.
It wasn't planned.

927
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:08,157
I was just freaked out about
suddenly being on the plane with...

928
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,566
With you...

929
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:13,067
How did you get the seat
behind me on the plane?

930
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:14,899
- It was pure coincidence.
- Bullshit!

931
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:16,540
It's true.

932
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,310
How could you..? How could you have
just left me at the hotel like that?

933
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:25,911
You were asleep.

934
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:29,315
Reuben woke me to say
I had to be a substitute performer...

935
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:33,753
...at a charity concert at the Hollywood
Bowl. I had to get the first flight out.

936
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:35,517
You could have left a note
or called.

937
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,787
- I did leave you a note.
- Where?

938
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:43,227
I don't know why we're even talking
about this. I don't like you.

939
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:46,370
All right? I wish we had never met.

940
01:01:52,244 --> 01:01:53,438
Hello, Vince.

941
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,908
What the fuck's going on?

942
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:00,512
Vince, a few days after we first met...

943
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,552
...I found myself next to Lanny
on a flight to New York.

944
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:05,383
It was a complete coincidence.

945
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:07,252
- He asked my name...
- And she lied.

946
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:10,724
I had just finished reading the first
chapter of Lanny's own biography.

947
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:14,330
His lawyers had let me see it in the
hope of discouraging our own project.

948
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:17,058
As a reflex, since I knew he
would view me as the enemy...

949
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:18,896
...I gave him the name of a friend...

950
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:21,197
...whose apartment I was
staying at in Manhattan.

951
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:24,706
I thought I just had to get through
the awkwardness of the flight itself...

952
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,901
...but the trouble is...
- You slept with him.

953
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:32,148
- Vince...
- You slept with my ex-partner.

954
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:34,847
Technically.

955
01:02:36,855 --> 01:02:39,449
Doesn't sound like things were
particularly technical.

956
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,271
Now, you listen to me, sweetheart.

957
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:07,985
Vince doesn't always do
what's best for Vince.

958
01:03:08,187 --> 01:03:10,781
That's why he needed me
here today.

959
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:15,449
The story of this girl is the
most painful thing in his life.

960
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,822
What happened to her, Lanny?

961
01:03:18,997 --> 01:03:20,897
Well, you're not gonna find out.

962
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:23,392
Not now.

963
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,297
Not after what you've done to him.

964
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:37,308
Vince.

965
01:03:37,516 --> 01:03:38,813
Oh, shit.

966
01:03:40,753 --> 01:03:42,812
Vince...

967
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:44,989
...I made a terrible mistake
in New York.

968
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,557
I apologize to you
more than I know how to say.

969
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:50,991
I'm so sorry.

970
01:04:00,806 --> 01:04:04,105
Vince, the realization
of your life story...

971
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:06,937
...shouldn't be threatened
because of my failings.

972
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:11,878
Please let me continue
to work with you again.

973
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:15,417
I'll help you tell your story right.

974
01:04:18,023 --> 01:04:19,957
Come back tonight.

975
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:23,688
Let me think about it.

976
01:04:36,341 --> 01:04:40,209
- How do you like the wine?
- It's magnificent. What is it?

977
01:04:40,412 --> 01:04:42,903
1961 Haut-Brion.

978
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:44,844
People make a big deal of 1959...

979
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,383
...but I don't think there'll be
a year as special as 1961.

980
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:51,785
It was a great year for French wines.

981
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:57,061
Will you join me?

982
01:04:57,896 --> 01:04:59,488
What are they?

983
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:04,196
They're like very mild-mannered
Quaaludes.

984
01:05:04,436 --> 01:05:06,529
Must've done a few of those
in your time, right?

985
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:09,735
Are you sure they're okay
with alcohol?

986
01:05:09,942 --> 01:05:13,469
Oh, they're even better with alcohol.
Believe me, I'd know.

987
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:21,778
Come on in, honey. The water's fine.

988
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:27,690
<i>All my life, I've had this idea
that I could always be in control.</i>

989
01:05:28,293 --> 01:05:30,227
<i>Ever since I was sick,
I had this sense...</i>

990
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:33,592
<i>... that I could make my body
do anything I wanted.</i>

991
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,460
<i>If I could will my polio away...</i>

992
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:39,125
<i>... I'd certainly be able to will away
the effect of any drug.</i>

993
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:56,548
Do you mind if I close the drapes?
The sun's in my eyes.

994
01:05:58,323 --> 01:06:00,188
It's moonlight.

995
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:03,151
Go ahead.

996
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,149
I remember you.

997
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:09,488
You're Alice.

998
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:12,289
In Wonderland.

999
01:07:12,998 --> 01:07:15,193
Oh, I don't know.

1000
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,800
I'm really stoned
out of my head already.

1001
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:20,662
Is it good?

1002
01:07:26,211 --> 01:07:30,307
Jesus, Vince. It's like monster grass.

1003
01:07:30,515 --> 01:07:32,779
Do you get this stuff all the time?

1004
01:07:32,985 --> 01:07:34,976
All the time.

1005
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:46,763
You're Alice.

1006
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,262
You're so beautiful.

1007
01:08:20,298 --> 01:08:22,198
She's ours.

1008
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:24,892
Isn't that so, Alice?

1009
01:08:26,405 --> 01:08:28,270
I'm yours.

1010
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:54,404
I like you.

1011
01:09:07,054 --> 01:09:10,319
<i>I had always been fascinated by how
some women could cross the line...</i>

1012
01:09:10,524 --> 01:09:15,154
<i>... between who they were and who
they would let themselves become.</i>

1013
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:17,558
<i>Maureen...</i>

1014
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,130
<i>... Alice...</i>

1015
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:22,359
<i>... and now...</i>

1016
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,128
<i>... me.</i>

1017
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:31,975
Morning.

1018
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:35,478
That was not a Quaalude you
gave me. I've had Quaaludes.

1019
01:09:36,784 --> 01:09:38,115
I said it was like a Quaalude.

1020
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,685
And you didn't take one yourself.
You palmed the pill.

1021
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,879
Somebody had to drive.

1022
01:09:43,858 --> 01:09:45,655
Don't worry, you won't get pregnant.

1023
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,691
Not from Alice,
and certainly not from me.

1024
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:50,455
I never took off my pants,
as you may or may not remember.

1025
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:52,325
There are laws against
drugging people.

1026
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:56,526
Oh, please. You took it voluntarily.
Nobody slipped it into your drink.

1027
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:01,506
And you chased it with one of the most
expensive wines in the world.

1028
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:05,110
You're just in a dither because you've
discovered you can swing both ways.

1029
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:09,245
You see...

1030
01:10:10,317 --> 01:10:12,182
...I needed to get something on you.

1031
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:15,651
Of course, your behavior with Lanny
might have been even better than this.

1032
01:10:15,856 --> 01:10:17,619
But I'd already set the wheels
in motion.

1033
01:10:17,825 --> 01:10:21,818
And as I was dying to see
you and Alice get it on...

1034
01:10:22,296 --> 01:10:24,423
Well, these are just a sample.

1035
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:34,872
Why would she agree to do this?
Doesn't she want a career?

1036
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:37,339
Well, it's your career
I'm worried about.

1037
01:10:37,912 --> 01:10:40,244
You're a journalist
playing loose with the rules.

1038
01:10:40,648 --> 01:10:43,173
She's just a vulnerable young singer
you seduced.

1039
01:10:43,384 --> 01:10:46,410
A promising... Oh, good heavens.

1040
01:10:46,787 --> 01:10:49,517
Promising artist
that I happen to manage.

1041
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:51,520
You met her through me...

1042
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:53,625
...and had your way with her.

1043
01:10:58,332 --> 01:10:59,959
What do you want from me?

1044
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:05,269
You're going to continue
writing the book.

1045
01:11:05,472 --> 01:11:09,374
I'm going to continue telling you
juicy stories, funny stories...

1046
01:11:09,577 --> 01:11:11,670
...heart-tugging stories.

1047
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:14,142
And you're not going to ask me
a single question...

1048
01:11:14,348 --> 01:11:16,578
...about what happened
to the girl in New Jersey.

1049
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:20,711
You're going to go to your publisher,
say you tried every angle...

1050
01:11:20,921 --> 01:11:23,856
...but you could find nothing odd
or suspicious in what I told you.

1051
01:11:30,664 --> 01:11:33,565
I'll even try to spice it up a little,
talk about how...

1052
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:36,736
...the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe...

1053
01:11:36,937 --> 01:11:39,201
...so to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1054
01:11:40,174 --> 01:11:41,732
Well, not exactly on my hand...

1055
01:11:41,942 --> 01:11:45,309
...and that's not my preference,
as you might have gathered by now.

1056
01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:58,790
So you get your bestseller,
I get my million.

1057
01:11:58,993 --> 01:12:00,255
Everyone goes home happy.

1058
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:03,692
You've dreaded talking about
Maureen O'Flaherty since we met.

1059
01:12:03,897 --> 01:12:06,058
If it's something you're so
desperate to avoid...

1060
01:12:06,267 --> 01:12:08,258
...why would you ever agree
to do this book?

1061
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:10,630
I need the money.

1062
01:12:10,838 --> 01:12:14,239
Vince, anything you say
in my presence is mine to use.

1063
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:18,143
Everything you said last night
and everything you've just told me.

1064
01:12:18,345 --> 01:12:21,075
And since I'm also allowed to include
contextual background...

1065
01:12:21,282 --> 01:12:23,307
...I can write about
how you set me up...

1066
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:26,884
...how you tried to blackmail me.
I'll even include those Polaroids.

1067
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:30,420
It's your word against mine. We have
a contract. Everything's in my words.

1068
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:33,923
We've agreed to your answers,
but there's nothing to stop me...

1069
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:38,827
...from putting any information I want
into a question I ask.

1070
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,869
Information that I'd like to be
public knowledge...

1071
01:12:43,804 --> 01:12:46,272
...or that the police
might wanna look into.

1072
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:55,245
Would you like me to fire one of my
loaded questions, on the record?

1073
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:57,879
Sure.

1074
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,949
Vince...

1075
01:13:07,461 --> 01:13:10,897
...in your suite
at the Versailles Hotel in Miami...

1076
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:13,931
...was it your or Lanny's idea...

1077
01:13:14,134 --> 01:13:17,467
...to put Maureen's body into the case
containing shellfish and ice...

1078
01:13:17,671 --> 01:13:19,332
...and have it shipped
to New Jersey?

1079
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:27,078
No answer, Mr. Collins?
So noted.

1080
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:30,582
Oh, and incidentally,
by not answering...

1081
01:13:30,784 --> 01:13:33,378
...you're in violation of your contract.

1082
01:13:33,988 --> 01:13:37,185
What a shame.
I understood you needed that money.

1083
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:54,066
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1084
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:57,971
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God!

1085
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:08,517
Was that how
you murdered Maureen?

1086
01:14:21,969 --> 01:14:23,800
Ask Lanny.

1087
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:28,598
He's the one who knows.

1088
01:14:47,094 --> 01:14:50,791
<i>It wasn't that hard for him
to get the suite he wanted.</i>

1089
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:54,991
<i>The Versailles was still one of the
fanciest of the hotels along the beach.</i>

1090
01:14:55,202 --> 01:14:57,864
<i>But by then, its era had passed.</i>

1091
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:00,865
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:15:10,317 --> 01:15:12,649
<i>All the furniture was new.</i>

1093
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:15,218
<i>It had been 15 years...</i>

1094
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:17,914
<i>... but the floor plan...</i>

1095
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,286
<i>... was still the same.</i>

1096
01:15:21,095 --> 01:15:23,325
<i>In that spot...</i>

1097
01:15:23,664 --> 01:15:26,565
<i>... that was where the truth
had come out.</i>

1098
01:15:27,634 --> 01:15:30,398
<i>That was why she had to die.</i>

1099
01:15:41,248 --> 01:15:43,808
Are you Japanese or Chinese?

1100
01:15:45,052 --> 01:15:46,747
Vietnamese.

1101
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:50,486
The kitchen tell me
you famous person.

1102
01:15:50,691 --> 01:15:52,625
Why you famous?

1103
01:15:52,993 --> 01:15:55,120
They didn't tell you my name?

1104
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:56,523
No.

1105
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:58,425
What is it?

1106
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:02,563
Lanny Morris.

1107
01:16:03,303 --> 01:16:04,964
It's a Jewish name...

1108
01:16:05,172 --> 01:16:06,639
...but I'm a nebbish.

1109
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:10,342
You ordered three bottle
of champagne.

1110
01:16:10,544 --> 01:16:11,806
You want me to open one now?

1111
01:16:12,513 --> 01:16:14,538
Or wait until friend come?

1112
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:17,173
Open all three.

1113
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:21,117
Are you really famous, Mr. Morris?

1114
01:16:22,356 --> 01:16:23,983
In my day.

1115
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:26,483
Before your time, I suppose.

1116
01:16:27,494 --> 01:16:30,054
I come from the north of Vietnam.

1117
01:16:30,264 --> 01:16:32,596
In my town, there is no television.

1118
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:37,099
<i>She explained that American movies
had been banned where she grew up.</i>

1119
01:16:42,342 --> 01:16:45,004
<i>She got better tips pretending
she was Madame Butterfly...</i>

1120
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:48,272
<i>... than by telling people
where she was really from.</i>

1121
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,509
What did you do, Mr. Morris?

1122
01:16:52,586 --> 01:16:55,111
I made Vince Collins' life...

1123
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:57,649
...very difficult.

1124
01:16:57,858 --> 01:17:01,055
<i>She didn't understand, but her policy
was not to linger in the rooms...</i>

1125
01:17:01,261 --> 01:17:03,195
<i>... of solitary gentlemen.</i>

1126
01:17:04,598 --> 01:17:08,898
<i>He signed the room-service check
under Lanny's name.</i>

1127
01:17:11,138 --> 01:17:12,662
Thank you.

1128
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:37,993
<i>There was no ice or water
left in the buckets...</i>

1129
01:17:38,198 --> 01:17:40,996
<i>... when his body was discovered
the next morning.</i>

1130
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:46,000
<i>He had dumped the ice into
the bathtub and died in it.</i>

1131
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,334
<i>He must have felt
there was some poetry in it.</i>

1132
01:17:53,747 --> 01:17:56,113
<i>His plan was to drink
enough champagne...</i>

1133
01:17:56,316 --> 01:17:57,715
<i>... with enough sleeping pills...</i>

1134
01:17:57,918 --> 01:18:01,820
<i>... so that ending things would
become an acceptable idea.</i>

1135
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:04,456
<i>He could manage that.</i>

1136
01:18:05,258 --> 01:18:08,591
<i>He knew for certain
he couldn't manage anything else.</i>

1137
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:13,723
Hi.

1138
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:18,699
I thought you were
gonna be out all afternoon.

1139
01:18:23,443 --> 01:18:25,206
I'm sorry.

1140
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:27,511
It's okay.

1141
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:30,507
This was under the door.

1142
01:18:38,091 --> 01:18:39,353
What is it?

1143
01:18:40,994 --> 01:18:43,121
Chapter three.

1144
01:18:44,898 --> 01:18:49,198
<i>John, as my lawyer, I want you
to know that this next chapter...</i>

1145
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:52,372
<i>... is to be read
after Vince and my death...</i>

1146
01:18:52,572 --> 01:18:57,236
<i>... and is only to be used under
the most extreme of circumstances.</i>

1147
01:18:58,945 --> 01:19:01,038
<i>We knew we wanted to make
an early night of it...</i>

1148
01:19:01,248 --> 01:19:04,684
<i>... with the telethon starting the next
day, so Vince suggested we dine in...</i>

1149
01:19:04,885 --> 01:19:07,877
<i>... so Maureen could do
the interview for her campus paper.</i>

1150
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:13,082
This is a gift for us
from the audience...

1151
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:17,663
...from the people,
the people that are out there.

1152
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:22,764
Sooner or later you gotta say,
"We wanna give something back."

1153
01:19:23,036 --> 01:19:24,628
I think that's really important.

1154
01:19:24,838 --> 01:19:29,138
Not many people would take
the time out to do that. Thank you.

1155
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:32,072
<i>She actually hid her tape recorder
in the room-service cart...</i>

1156
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:35,043
<i>... because she didn't want
the hotel to find out.</i>

1157
01:19:42,856 --> 01:19:46,087
<i>We finished the interview
and then asked her to stay.</i>

1158
01:19:49,162 --> 01:19:53,223
<i>To help us get into the mood,
I did a Tuinal...</i>

1159
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:55,060
<i>... then she did one...</i>

1160
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:59,398
<i>... and Vince, he did two,
because he was always doing two.</i>

1161
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:04,232
<i>We got into the second of the
three bottles of Moët we'd ordered.</i>

1162
01:20:04,444 --> 01:20:09,609
<i>We thought it would be better to keep
the action to neutral territory.</i>

1163
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,485
<i>God...</i>

1164
01:20:14,788 --> 01:20:16,483
<i>... she was beautiful.</i>

1165
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:21,389
<i>I chain-locked the front door
to the living room...</i>

1166
01:20:21,595 --> 01:20:25,122
<i>... to make sure that housekeeping,
eager to turn down our beds...</i>

1167
01:20:25,332 --> 01:20:27,892
<i>... didn't walk in on an employee
having a ménage à trois...</i>

1168
01:20:28,101 --> 01:20:30,194
<i>... with the hotel's headliners.</i>

1169
01:20:30,404 --> 01:20:33,237
<i>Then I went to chain-lock
the door to Vince's room.</i>

1170
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,773
<i>I took a quick shower,
I put on my robe...</i>

1171
01:20:36,977 --> 01:20:41,209
<i>... and brought a robe for Maureen,
in case she felt a little bashful.</i>

1172
01:20:44,818 --> 01:20:47,116
<i>So much for bashful.</i>

1173
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:50,949
<i>I threw the robe on the bed
and moved into the room...</i>

1174
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:54,150
<i>... half-worried that they would
finish without me.</i>

1175
01:21:15,015 --> 01:21:17,381
<i>Watch it there, compadre.</i>

1176
01:21:18,185 --> 01:21:20,949
It's a little hard to tell who's who,
under the circumstances.

1177
01:21:21,154 --> 01:21:24,555
I'm the one that's more than
a little hard, you dumb fucking limey.

1178
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:28,791
Well, I'm... I'm the one with a foreskin.
Don't you forget that.

1179
01:21:32,366 --> 01:21:34,266
Watch it. You got the end zone
there, Vince.

1180
01:21:34,468 --> 01:21:37,460
- Come on, come on. Fuck.
- You're gonna like it.

1181
01:21:37,671 --> 01:21:39,764
It's like from another planet
when you come.

1182
01:21:39,973 --> 01:21:41,770
- Get the fuck off me.
- I'd never hurt you.

1183
01:21:41,975 --> 01:21:43,806
- I'd never hurt you.
- Get the fuck off me!

1184
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:47,242
- No, trust me. It's like double the sex...
- Get the fuck off me!

1185
01:21:47,447 --> 01:21:49,938
We don't fuck, Vince!

1186
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:53,678
We're buddies, we're pals,
we're partners, we're a duo.

1187
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:57,118
We love each other,
but we don't fuck!

1188
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:00,188
We're fucking stars!

1189
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:01,793
- We can travel together.
- Okay.

1190
01:22:01,995 --> 01:22:06,796
We can hang out together, we can live
together, but we can't be queers!

1191
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,992
It's not funny!

1192
01:22:32,859 --> 01:22:34,986
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1193
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:36,662
About?

1194
01:22:38,865 --> 01:22:40,890
About your nose.

1195
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:45,271
It's not broken, is it?

1196
01:22:47,908 --> 01:22:49,398
It's how I am.

1197
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:53,340
Guess the question is,
who's gonna pay me?

1198
01:22:53,547 --> 01:22:55,674
<i>This surprised me.</i>

1199
01:22:55,882 --> 01:22:58,282
<i>The girl was not a hooker.</i>

1200
01:23:08,728 --> 01:23:11,458
<i>My wallet was on top of my robe.</i>

1201
01:23:11,932 --> 01:23:13,923
<i>I took out some money.</i>

1202
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,495
<i>I don't remember how much.</i>

1203
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:34,552
I don't think so.

1204
01:23:35,856 --> 01:23:38,484
That's more than you would
make in a month of tips.

1205
01:23:38,692 --> 01:23:40,990
I'm not looking for a tip.

1206
01:23:42,062 --> 01:23:43,689
What the hell are you saying?

1207
01:23:43,897 --> 01:23:46,263
Honey, I'm in my last year
of college.

1208
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:49,162
This is a summer job.

1209
01:23:52,305 --> 01:23:54,273
I wanna write.

1210
01:23:54,474 --> 01:23:57,034
I wanna be a journalist.

1211
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:04,575
So I could either
use this information...

1212
01:24:05,752 --> 01:24:07,310
...or I could use a lot of money.

1213
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:12,487
I promise you
this will only cost you once.

1214
01:24:15,695 --> 01:24:18,994
I'm so tired, I don't even think
I'm going home.

1215
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,661
I think it's the Tuinals.

1216
01:24:24,037 --> 01:24:27,234
Hey, Lanny, don't take it personally.

1217
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,806
You were a great lover.

1218
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:33,446
You have got the cutest little butt.

1219
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:40,714
I guess Vince thinks so too.

1220
01:24:45,725 --> 01:24:47,590
Night, Lanny.

1221
01:24:49,629 --> 01:24:53,121
<i>I would never see her alive again.</i>

1222
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:57,934
<i>I put a "Do Not Disturb" sign
on my door...</i>

1223
01:24:58,138 --> 01:25:01,335
<i>... fastened the chain lock,
in case the maid didn't read.</i>

1224
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,475
<i>I left a wake-up call for 8...</i>

1225
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:06,111
<i>... and went to sleep
knowing that a telethon...</i>

1226
01:25:06,313 --> 01:25:10,306
<i>... was the least of the ordeals I was
going to have to face in the morning.</i>

1227
01:25:15,355 --> 01:25:17,152
<i>The Tuinals had really
conked me out...</i>

1228
01:25:17,357 --> 01:25:20,485
<i>... and I slept through
my wake-up call that morning.</i>

1229
01:25:20,694 --> 01:25:22,821
<i>The operator had called Reuben
down the hall...</i>

1230
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:24,724
<i>... to see if he could wake me...</i>

1231
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:28,128
<i>... but he couldn't get in because
we had chain-locked all the doors.</i>

1232
01:25:29,269 --> 01:25:31,032
Reuben!

1233
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:34,105
<i>I yelled for Reuben to wake up Vince
while I worked on Maureen...</i>

1234
01:25:34,307 --> 01:25:38,107
<i>... trying to make myself believe
that she was still sleeping.</i>

1235
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,213
Fuck.

1236
01:25:42,649 --> 01:25:44,276
No, no. Fuck.

1237
01:25:44,484 --> 01:25:47,976
<i>The autopsy revealed the drugs
and alcohol in her body...</i>

1238
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:50,884
<i>... but I knew
it wasn't enough to kill her.</i>

1239
01:25:55,095 --> 01:25:56,858
<i>All three doors to the suite...</i>

1240
01:25:57,063 --> 01:26:00,624
<i>... were chain-locked from the inside
when I found her.</i>

1241
01:26:01,201 --> 01:26:02,498
<i>I hadn't touched her.</i>

1242
01:26:02,702 --> 01:26:08,800
<i>That's how I know that my former
partner and friend, Vince Collins...</i>

1243
01:26:09,009 --> 01:26:12,240
<i>... murdered Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1244
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:19,446
<i>You must have guessed by now
that Vince and I had found a way...</i>

1245
01:26:19,653 --> 01:26:22,645
<i>... to relocate Maureen's body
to New Jersey.</i>

1246
01:26:22,856 --> 01:26:26,383
<i>This is the one criminal act
the both of us committed...</i>

1247
01:26:26,593 --> 01:26:31,155
<i>... but we were in a panic and
needed to create an ironclad alibi.</i>

1248
01:26:31,364 --> 01:26:33,855
<i>The crates were delivered
to our room.</i>

1249
01:26:34,067 --> 01:26:36,763
<i>The publicist had opened the crates
for a photo op.</i>

1250
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,494
<i>But the official story became...</i>

1251
01:26:38,705 --> 01:26:41,367
<i>... that she found Maureen's
overdosed body in the tub.</i>

1252
01:26:41,574 --> 01:26:45,567
<i>A police officer called Scaglia
was there to witness the whole thing.</i>

1253
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:47,804
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

1254
01:26:48,014 --> 01:26:49,379
<i>During the telethon...</i>

1255
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:53,609
<i>... I kept telling myself that I could
forgive Vince for two reasons.</i>

1256
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,721
<i>First of all, I don't think he could
have known what he was doing.</i>

1257
01:26:56,923 --> 01:27:00,256
<i>He was completely out of it,
even more than usual.</i>

1258
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,325
<i>The second is that he was terrified...</i>

1259
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:05,657
<i>... that this incident would become
public knowledge.</i>

1260
01:27:05,865 --> 01:27:09,528
<i>In those days, the slightest hint
that he could swing both ways...</i>

1261
01:27:09,736 --> 01:27:13,297
<i>... would destroy his
show-business career in an instant.</i>

1262
01:27:14,174 --> 01:27:17,075
<i>As it was, it was only to destroy us.</i>

1263
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:19,736
<i>We completed the telethon...</i>

1264
01:27:19,946 --> 01:27:22,540
<i>... but we both knew
we were finished.</i>

1265
01:27:23,316 --> 01:27:24,749
<i>The marriage...</i>

1266
01:27:25,218 --> 01:27:26,947
<i>... was over.</i>

1267
01:27:28,421 --> 01:27:31,151
<i>There was a moment
in the middle of the telethon...</i>

1268
01:27:31,357 --> 01:27:33,951
<i>... where I actually broke down.</i>

1269
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,323
<i>I just couldn't control myself.</i>

1270
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:40,021
<i>I remember I mumbled something...</i>

1271
01:27:40,233 --> 01:27:44,727
<i>... to a little girl who was recounting
her experiences with the disease.</i>

1272
01:27:45,338 --> 01:27:47,772
<i>I don't remember what I said...</i>

1273
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:51,074
<i>... but I do remember
feeling worthless.</i>

1274
01:27:52,746 --> 01:27:55,510
<i>Everyone thought that my tears
were for her.</i>

1275
01:27:55,882 --> 01:27:59,215
<i>It made for a great picture
in the papers the next day.</i>

1276
01:28:01,554 --> 01:28:03,419
Mr. Morris will see you now.

1277
01:28:27,847 --> 01:28:31,010
I expected to see you
at Vince's funeral.

1278
01:28:32,419 --> 01:28:36,685
Kind of heartless of you not to
show up, don't you think, Karen?

1279
01:28:37,624 --> 01:28:40,252
Considering you're probably
the one that...

1280
01:28:41,828 --> 01:28:43,693
...drove him to it.

1281
01:28:45,265 --> 01:28:46,857
I won't answer that.

1282
01:28:49,502 --> 01:28:51,231
So don't.

1283
01:28:51,571 --> 01:28:53,402
So get the fuck out of my office.

1284
01:28:54,107 --> 01:28:58,840
Lanny, I have interview material with
Vince up until the moment he met you.

1285
01:28:59,045 --> 01:29:01,206
It would be great if this...

1286
01:29:01,548 --> 01:29:04,108
...warm, funny side of Vince
could reach the public.

1287
01:29:04,317 --> 01:29:07,878
And what the fuck do you know
about Vince's warm and funny side?

1288
01:29:10,256 --> 01:29:12,781
What about the warm and funny fact
that he killed himself?

1289
01:29:13,226 --> 01:29:16,457
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

1290
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:20,327
That's the answer I'm giving you...

1291
01:29:20,533 --> 01:29:22,626
...and anyone else that asks.

1292
01:29:23,336 --> 01:29:25,896
- "I don't know."
- But you do know, don't you, Lanny?

1293
01:29:26,105 --> 01:29:28,164
Whatever I know, sweetheart...

1294
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:29,671
...I’m writing in my book.

1295
01:29:30,777 --> 01:29:34,110
Except you're never
going to finish your book.

1296
01:29:34,547 --> 01:29:36,139
You don't have to.

1297
01:29:37,217 --> 01:29:39,185
The person who needed
your book is dead.

1298
01:29:40,854 --> 01:29:42,822
You always wrote the material
for your shows.

1299
01:29:43,022 --> 01:29:44,853
Every single word was rehearsed.

1300
01:29:45,058 --> 01:29:47,526
The book was a manual,
a set of notes...

1301
01:29:47,727 --> 01:29:50,560
...so Vince would get
every detail of the official story.

1302
01:29:51,731 --> 01:29:54,359
"A couple of extra babes for him
to sleep with that night.

1303
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:56,535
A few of them on hand.

1304
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,500
Well, not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference."

1305
01:30:01,174 --> 01:30:04,234
- So, what's your point?
- He quoted that very line to me.

1306
01:30:04,444 --> 01:30:08,642
Quoted it from your manuscript as if
he were saying it for the first time.

1307
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,216
You wrote it because you loved him.

1308
01:30:17,123 --> 01:30:19,250
And feared for him.

1309
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:23,687
And feared for yourself.

1310
01:30:28,601 --> 01:30:30,535
And then you wrote this:

1311
01:30:36,109 --> 01:30:37,576
Where the fuck did you get that?

1312
01:30:37,777 --> 01:30:40,302
- Delivered to my room.
- Bullshit. You stole it.

1313
01:30:40,513 --> 01:30:44,813
Maureen O'Flaherty was killed
in the Versailles Hotel, in your room...

1314
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:47,578
...the night before the telethon.

1315
01:30:49,989 --> 01:30:52,355
The night before we met.

1316
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:00,924
Get out of my office.

1317
01:31:49,415 --> 01:31:51,212
Miss Trout?

1318
01:31:52,352 --> 01:31:55,412
<i>We walked through the deserted
backlot of the studio...</i>

1319
01:31:55,622 --> 01:31:59,888
<i>... and I confessed
that I wasn't Bonnie Trout.</i>

1320
01:32:00,093 --> 01:32:02,186
<i>That I was writing a book
about Vince Collins.</i>

1321
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:04,522
<i>And that I was trying
to uncover the secret...</i>

1322
01:32:04,731 --> 01:32:07,063
<i>... behind what happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1323
01:32:07,533 --> 01:32:10,024
<i>I told him what I found out.</i>

1324
01:32:10,236 --> 01:32:11,863
<i>He prayed that he would
be forgiven...</i>

1325
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:14,369
<i>... for having been there
as the murder was concealed.</i>

1326
01:32:14,574 --> 01:32:16,269
Miss O'Connor...

1327
01:32:16,576 --> 01:32:20,535
...I have a tape recording of
the night Miss O'Flaherty was killed.

1328
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,343
She had brought a machine.

1329
01:32:26,486 --> 01:32:28,477
- For the interview.
- Yes.

1330
01:32:28,688 --> 01:32:31,782
I found it as I was
getting rid of her things.

1331
01:32:33,526 --> 01:32:36,188
She kept it on?

1332
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:40,989
Could you use this tape
for your book?

1333
01:32:45,171 --> 01:32:46,798
Of course.

1334
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,101
Miss O'Connor...

1335
01:32:50,043 --> 01:32:51,874
...is it something?

1336
01:32:53,179 --> 01:32:54,578
Oh, my.

1337
01:32:54,781 --> 01:32:56,806
Is it something I could sell?

1338
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,944
Reuben, I can't speak
on behalf of my publishers...

1339
01:33:01,154 --> 01:33:03,714
...but I'm sure that we can
settle on a price.

1340
01:33:03,923 --> 01:33:06,289
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Connor.

1341
01:33:10,063 --> 01:33:12,623
<i>I'll even spice it up a little,
talk about how...</i>

1342
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,858
<i>... the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe.</i>

1343
01:33:16,069 --> 01:33:18,799
So to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1344
01:33:19,372 --> 01:33:21,203
Well, not exactly on my hand.

1345
01:33:21,407 --> 01:33:24,706
That's not my preference,
as you may have gathered by now.

1346
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:28,575
I need the money.

1347
01:33:30,483 --> 01:33:33,179
Did you have a figure in mind?

1348
01:33:35,288 --> 01:33:38,416
Would you think a million dollars
would be too much?

1349
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:43,226
Vince was being paid
a million dollars for his life.

1350
01:33:43,429 --> 01:33:44,726
This is one night.

1351
01:33:45,698 --> 01:33:47,723
The most important night.

1352
01:33:49,168 --> 01:33:51,159
<i>You could have left me a note
or called me.</i>

1353
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:54,066
<i>- I did leave you a note.
- Where?</i>

1354
01:34:03,816 --> 01:34:06,080
Lanny left this for me
at my apartment.

1355
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:09,848
It's his version
of what happened that night.

1356
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:14,921
On its own,
it's absolutely useless to me.

1357
01:34:15,128 --> 01:34:17,494
I could have typed it myself.

1358
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:25,428
But if it matched
what's recorded on your tape...

1359
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,970
...it would make it priceless.

1360
01:34:34,914 --> 01:34:36,814
Which is why you sent it to me.

1361
01:34:39,752 --> 01:34:42,880
You just said
Mr. Morris left it at your apartment.

1362
01:34:43,089 --> 01:34:45,523
He was surprised I had it.

1363
01:34:47,693 --> 01:34:51,220
Like he was surprised I hadn't found
the note he left for me at the hotel.

1364
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:54,160
The note you must've disposed of
as you were tidying the room.

1365
01:34:54,367 --> 01:34:56,494
I told you how he deals with women.
I was afraid.

1366
01:34:56,702 --> 01:34:58,465
<i>Really afraid of what
he might do to you.</i>

1367
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:00,798
<i>Maybe you were afraid of what I'd...</i>

1368
01:35:01,007 --> 01:35:03,498
I'd do to him. And to you.

1369
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:07,611
Why would I be afraid of
a schoolteacher called Bonnie Trout?

1370
01:35:07,814 --> 01:35:10,374
Because you knew I was
Karen O'Connor.

1371
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:13,313
When I woke up,
you folded my clothes...

1372
01:35:13,519 --> 01:35:15,419
...and placed my pocketbook
on the bed.

1373
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:19,614
The pocketbook that had my name
and the letter from my publisher.

1374
01:35:21,327 --> 01:35:24,626
I was writing about the one thing
you wanted to have total control over:

1375
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,821
Collins and Morris.

1376
01:35:28,334 --> 01:35:32,430
You made me abandon any thought
of trying to contact Lanny.

1377
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:35,439
You made me feel like I was
less than nothing to him...

1378
01:35:35,641 --> 01:35:37,802
...because you were playing
your own complex game.

1379
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:43,710
And what exactly was this complex
game I was playing, Miss O'Connor?

1380
01:36:02,335 --> 01:36:03,996
You were in the room.

1381
01:36:05,338 --> 01:36:07,067
That night.

1382
01:36:07,807 --> 01:36:10,503
Lanny had a robe.
He dropped it on the bed.

1383
01:36:10,710 --> 01:36:13,304
After Maureen asked for money...

1384
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:15,480
...the wallet was on top.
It had been folded.

1385
01:36:15,681 --> 01:36:19,173
Well, I always, always arranged
Mr. Morris' things.

1386
01:36:19,385 --> 01:36:22,650
After he went to bed.
You were there before.

1387
01:36:22,855 --> 01:36:26,052
How would I get out?
All three doors were chain-locked.

1388
01:36:44,377 --> 01:36:46,572
Through Vince's room.

1389
01:36:48,014 --> 01:36:49,572
Then, the next morning...

1390
01:36:49,782 --> 01:36:53,081
<i>... you must have chain-locked the
door before you went to wake him up.</i>

1391
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:59,316
Fuck!

1392
01:37:02,395 --> 01:37:04,795
Lanny let me read the first chapter.

1393
01:37:04,997 --> 01:37:07,329
Vince sent me the second.

1394
01:37:09,936 --> 01:37:11,801
And you stole this.

1395
01:37:12,004 --> 01:37:13,403
To whet my appetite.

1396
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,659
<i>I wanna write.</i>

1397
01:37:39,865 --> 01:37:41,765
<i>I wanna be a journalist.</i>

1398
01:37:42,401 --> 01:37:45,461
<i>So I could either
use this information...</i>

1399
01:37:46,305 --> 01:37:48,296
<i>... or I could use a lot of money.</i>

1400
01:37:48,507 --> 01:37:50,873
Is that why you killed her?

1401
01:37:52,144 --> 01:37:53,406
To protect them?

1402
01:38:00,753 --> 01:38:04,621
<i>For 15 years...</i>

1403
01:38:04,824 --> 01:38:07,884
<i>... he tormented Vince and Lanny.</i>

1404
01:38:11,464 --> 01:38:15,161
<i>He could never blackmail Vince
while Sally Sanmarco was alive...</i>

1405
01:38:16,068 --> 01:38:20,437
<i>... so he waited until Sally died
to activate his retirement plan:</i>

1406
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:26,102
<i>A million dollars from Vince.</i>

1407
01:38:26,879 --> 01:38:31,213
<i>A million dollars for the same tape
he offered to me.</i>

1408
01:38:36,122 --> 01:38:39,990
<i>He would never get his money,
and I would never see him again.</i>

1409
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:48,659
<i>He had taken her life...</i>

1410
01:38:48,868 --> 01:38:51,632
<i>... and with it her mother's heart...</i>

1411
01:38:52,304 --> 01:38:54,602
<i>... and her father's mind.</i>

1412
01:38:56,242 --> 01:38:57,732
<i>And now...</i>

1413
01:38:57,943 --> 01:39:01,174
<i>... all that remained
of Maureen O'Flaherty...</i>

1414
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,407
<i>... was a tree
in her mother's garden.</i>

1415
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:23,397
Your daughter learned something
about Vince Collins...

1416
01:39:23,602 --> 01:39:26,230
...that he didn't want anyone to know.

1417
01:39:26,505 --> 01:39:28,200
Because of that...

1418
01:39:28,407 --> 01:39:29,965
...she was killed.

1419
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:33,339
If it's of any small comfort,
she probably didn't suffer.

1420
01:39:33,946 --> 01:39:37,541
I want people
to know about this man.

1421
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:40,948
I want them to know
why he killed her.

1422
01:39:46,292 --> 01:39:48,453
There is someone in all this...

1423
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,754
...who is totally innocent
of any involvement...

1424
01:39:50,963 --> 01:39:52,863
...in the events of that night...

1425
01:39:53,065 --> 01:39:57,900
...but whose life will be made infinitely
worse if I tell the truth at this time.

1426
01:39:58,938 --> 01:40:02,465
I wanna protect this person
from any further pain.

1427
01:40:05,511 --> 01:40:07,479
I promise you...

1428
01:40:08,047 --> 01:40:11,539
I promise you I will write down
the truth that I've learned...

1429
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,742
...but I have to let matters lie
until this person has died...

1430
01:40:14,954 --> 01:40:17,149
...and the truth
can no longer touch them.

1431
01:40:22,361 --> 01:40:25,455
<i>I saw no indication on her face...</i>

1432
01:40:25,664 --> 01:40:28,224
<i>... that she knew
I was talking about her.</i>

1433
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:04,595
You're a very special girl.

1434
01:41:12,745 --> 01:41:15,213
Forgive me.

1435
01:43:15,214 --> 01:43:18,014
