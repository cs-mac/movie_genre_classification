UHF

2
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,484
Senior... we must not go any farther!

3
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,590
Look!

4
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,519
It is an ancient, sacred Hovitos symbol.

5
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,194
It's certain death to anyone who enters.

6
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:45,333
We must turn back... now!

7
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,184
POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS
DO NOT ENTER

8
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:36,754
KEEP OUT - DANGEROUS AREA
NO VISITORS/NO EXCEPTIONS

WRONG WAY - STOP
SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE

00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:39,844
George. Hello...Earth to George...
George!

12
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,954
Are you daydreaming again?

13
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,635
No, no, I was, uh... admiring
how clean and shiny this grill is...

14
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,526
Come on George, we're busy here.

15
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,403
You know what the problem is?

16
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:53,365
Nobody here appreciates a guy with a good imagination.

17
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,091
At least not the people at the lumberyard

18
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,223
or the miniature golf course or Floyd's Fish Market...

19
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,487
or any of the other places you've worked in the last month, right.

20
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,563
Yeah, well, some day... some day they'll all be sorry.

21
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:09,453
They'll be eating breakfast or something
and all of a sudden they'll say, 'Hey...!'

22
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,944
We screwed up! We never should have fired

23
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:15,714
George Newman because he's got imagination!

24
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,924
Well... I think the fries are just about done.

25
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,901
Oh, geez.  Better not let Big Edna see that.  She'll have a fit.

26
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,305
Big Edna, Big Edna... You sound like a broken record.

27
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:30,646
Why are you so afraid of that pathetic tub of lard?

28
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,893
KUNI'S KARATE SCHOOL

29
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:01,564
How can you do this to me. I knew this was gonna happen.

30
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:06,216
You're right. Bob.  I'm sorry.  What can I say?

31
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,164
I'm a miserable, worthless hunk of slime.

32
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:13,159
Here, I want you to take this crowbar and...

33
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,683
just bash my head right in.

34
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,384
Really, go ahead, please, just bash it right in.

35
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,395
Ah George, you know I couldn't do that...

36
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,505
you still owe me five bucks.

37
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,169
Hey, Kuni!

38
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,672
Hiya, George!

39
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,492
Beginner's class today, huh?

40
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,649
Yeah!  They're so stupid!

41
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,161
Stupid!!

42
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:55,707
Mm boy... look what I got here. Bob...

43
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,900
a twinkie-wiener sandwich... your favorite.

44
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,526
Come on, Bob, cheer up, will ya?

45
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,066
You ruined my life.

46
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,230
You know, Bob-o, I think you're developing a bad attitude here.

47
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,604
You see Bob you gotta look at the bigger picture.

48
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:32,266
You gotta grab life by the lips and YANK as hard as you can!

49
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,812
See anything in the want ads?

50
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,872
Yeah, but nothing with the prestige of working at Burger World.

51
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,962
So what do you think Teri's gonna say when she hears you got fired again?

52
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,066
Teri!  Oh no... what time is it?

53
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:52,904
Seven-thirty?  Oh boy, I gotta go. I'll see ya later, Bob.

54
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,042
- Stupid!

55
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,539
So, what's your excuse this time?

56
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:03,129
Well, Bob and I were having a serious discussion about our... various career options.

57
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,467
Boy, I really like what you've done with your hair. It's really

58
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:10,940
George... did you get fired again?

59
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,841
Yes!  Yes!  It's all true!

60
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,362
I just don't know what's wrong with me!

61
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:21,476
So, what's for dinner?

62
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:26,619
Mashed potatoes?  My favorite!
Teri, you shouldn't have!

63
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:32,978
George, when are you going to start taking things a little more seriously?

64
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:38,048
I mean, you've been wandering aimlessly from job to job ever since I've known you.

65
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:41,354
If only you could just get that overactive imagination

66
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,279
of yours to work for you instead of against you. Maybe you could...

67
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,192
what are you doing?

68
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:54,472
This means something... this is important.

69
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,343
Oh, George, that is just terrible, but, don't you worry.

70
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:12,812
You're a fine young man.  I'm sure you'll get another job right away.

71
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,918
You got such a good face...

72
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:19,349
Look at this face.  Would you look at this face?

73
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:22,081
Is this a face you could die for?

74
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:27,070
So, where's Uncle Harvey?  I haven't seen him all night.

75
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,419
Oh, he'll be out soon.

76
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,794
I think he's having some kind of last minute business meeting.

77
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:36,470
Two pair, aces high.

78
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,678
Yeah, what? Hey, Louie!

79
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:47,508
I just wanted to congratulate you, Mr. Bilchik.

80
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,644
You did very well at the track this afternoon.

81
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:55,173
Oh yeah?  I won again, huh?' Yeh Right.
Thanks, Louie. Bye.

82
00:11:56,548 --> 00:12:00,546
Now, what are we doin' here?
It's your deal, Harvey.

83
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:05,347
Oh!  Hi, honey!  Have you finished your meeting?

84
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,408
Yeah, and business was great tonight!

85
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:14,489
Harvey!  Have you been gambling again?
Hey, what are you complainin' about?

86
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:18,416
This is for when you go shoppin' on Rodeo Drive!

87
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:22,484
what's this?

88
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:28,228
Oh, that's the deed to Channel 62. I won it with a pair of sevens.
I was bluffing

89
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:30,788
Channel 62?  I never heard of it.

90
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:34,494
I'm not surprised.  More people watch the fish tank at Leo's Pet Store.

91
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,523
It's a little UHF station on the edge of town...

92
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:40,500
it's been on the brink of bankruptcy for years.
It's too bad I gotta dump it.

93
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:46,494
Oh, really? I kind of like the idea of us having our own TV station.

94
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:51,528
Forget about it. They can't even find anybody to manage the place anymore.

95
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:56,181
Harvey... I know somebody who'd be perfect for the job.

96
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,135
Yeah?  Who's that?

97
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,620
George, George dear. Would you come over here for a second

98
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:10,184
Oh, no.  No, not him.  Forget it.  No way.

99
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:19,048
I can't believe you're uncle is letting you run his TV station

100
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:24,810
Hey! He trusts me. Besides, he's going to California,
he doesn't want to be bothered with it.

101
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:32,617
Well... here we are!

102
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:40,600
This is it?

103
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,803
Wow, this is even better than I imagined.
Come on, let's go check it out.

104
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:49,028
I don't know, George.  I'm not so sure about this.

105
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:54,822
See?  The front door's open.  It's a friendly place!

106
00:13:55,646 --> 00:14:00,796
Hey, Mister!  Change?  You got change?

107
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:04,185
Oh... uh... sure.

108
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:14,990
... eighty-five... ninety-five... one dollar.  Thanks, Mister.

109
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,820
<i>Hello, I'm Mr. Ed

Can I help you?

117
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:54,685
Who are you?

118
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:58,257
I'm Philo, chief engineer.

119
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:03,912
So... isn't it a little late for you to be working?

120
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:07,053
I mean, what time do you normally go home?

121
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:11,234
This is my home.  I live here.

122
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,931
Hold these.

123
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,923
No, no, no... like this.

124
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:23,905
What are you doing?

125
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:28,196
Oh, I just want to see if my interociter can withstand

126
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:32,682
a sudden charge of sixty-thousand volts.
Wha-?

127
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:46,141
Yeah, it works.

128
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,975
I don't know about this, George.

129
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:59,767
I mean don't know the first thing about what goes on at a TV station.

130
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:03,471
Don't worry. Bob.  It's just like working in a fish market,

131
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:06,101
except you don't have to clean' and gut fish all day.

132
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,983
Yah, So, can I help you?

133
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,149
Hi, I'm George Newman.  I'm the new station manager.

134
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:30,836
You know, when I first took this job
they told me that this position was only temporary,

135
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:35,373
and that eventually, when the time was right I'd move up to news,

136
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:38,918
which is really my forte.  You know how long I've been working here?

137
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:44,399
Two years!  It's kind
of hard to get promoted when every other week you have a new boss.

138
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,871
This job really sucks.

139
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:53,187
And this is my friend Bob.
Hi. Nice to meet you

140
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,576
Howdy, friends, it's Crazy Ernie from "Crazy Ernie's Used Car Emporium!"

141
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:59,380
It's a giant supermarket of cars!

142
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:04,021
I got so many cars, people come up to me and say,

143
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:09,325
"Hey, Crazy Ernie!  Where'd you get all those cars?!"
Lookee here.

144
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,732
I got red cars, I got green cars, I got enough cars to choke a camel! Tell you what, friends.

145
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,612
If nobody comes down and buys a car from me in the next hour, I'm gonna club this baby seal.

146
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,105
That's right, I'll club this seal to make a better deal.

147
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,155
And you know I'd do it, too... cause I'm crazy!

148
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,888
ehn, look at all the old reruns this station is airing.

149
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:31,010
We could sure use some more live shows.

150
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,736
I don't know, something like um..

151
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,983
Oh no
You ok in there Pam?

152
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,104
Yes. If it's not one thing, it's another.

153
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,632
You know that mailman's really got a screw loose.

154
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,763
He delivers us this package that's suppose to go to R.J. Fletcher.

155
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,128
Who?
R.J Fletcher. He runs channel 8.

156
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:53,434
You know, the net work affiliate downtown.
Oh well, I'll just have to
send it back to him tomorrow.

157
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:56,954
No, that's okay, I'll
take it over myself.

158
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,868
It'll be a good chance to meet the competition.

159
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:03,818
You know George, I'll tell you I don't really think
that's such a good idea

160
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,974
I heard he's not the nicest guy in the world.

161
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,934
Oh, come on, he can't be all that bad.

162
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,746
You just gotta know how to talk to those guys.

163
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,139
You idiot!  Can't you do anything I tell you to do?!

164
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,594
Does this look like a Number Two pencil?

165
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:21,734
No, I... I just thought-
You thought?!  I don't pay you to think!

166
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:25,732
But, Dad
Shut up!! Let's get back to the meeting.

167
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,480
Alright, who's got the research report?

168
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:29,601
I left the report on your desk, sir.

169
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:34,926
I don't see it.  When did you put it here?
Yesterday, before I left, sir.

170
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:38,405
The janitor.  It must have been the janitor.

171
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,835
He probably threw it out when he was cleaning up in here.

172
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,755
Send in the janitor!

173
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:44,789
I'm going to get to the bottom of this!

174
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,855
I will not tolerate this type of behavior at Channel 8!

175
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:53,375
This is a business, not a home for irresponsible pus brains!

176
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,765
You wanted me, sir?

177
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:03,387
That's right.  I guess you know why I called you in here.

178
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,532
Because you're lonely?

179
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,481
No, you moron!

180
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,784
Now look carefully.
Do you see anything missing from this desk?

181
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,935
Uh... that stapler?
No!

182
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,264
Now... listen to me!

183
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:29,036
There was a very important file on this desk.

184
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,171
A file that represented two months of intensive research.

185
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,677
It's my guess that you threw it out.

186
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,478
Why, no, sir, no um.

187
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,391
Were you in here cleaning up last night?
Yes sir, yes sir I was.

188
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:47,294
Do you see the file on my desk now?
Gee, I don't know I..

189
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:49,373
I think I've proved my point.

190
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,030
You are a worthless human being, Mr..

191
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,533
Spadowski.  Stanley Spadowski.

192
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,998
May I call you Stanley?

193
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:00,722
- Okay
- Stanley...

194
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:03,374
- You're fired!
- But... I... I didn't

195
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,228
- Get out!!
- But I...

196
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,171
People are..

197
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,584
I can't believe the incompetence in this place!

198
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:17,187
People like that should be put to sleep.

199
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,422
Well, what do you know? The research file!

200
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,936
Here it is! I've been sitting here all the time!

201
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:50,048
Betty, hold my calls.
Yes, Mr. Fletcher.

202
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,882
Hey! R.J.!

203
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:03,693
Hi! George Newman, U62. Say, nice place you got here.

204
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:06,702
You know, I was just thinking, since we're both in the business...

205
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:10,397
Where'd you get this?
Don't you know that stealing mail is a federal offense?

206
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,028
Hold on, you don't understand...

207
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,729
No, you don't understand how serious a crime this is!

208
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,283
I think you'd better just clean out your desk right now and get out!

209
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,922
You're through, mister!
But I don't work here.

210
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:27,343
Trespassing, huh?  I'll give you ten seconds to get out before I call the police.

211
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:31,679
Look, I just thought we could...
... five... four...

212
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:37,672
Gee, look at the time.
Well, gotta go.  Keep in touch.

213
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,104
No... No.. No please... it's all I've got left...

214
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:54,045
Let go!  This is station property!
NO! NO! It's my, mop!

215
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,958
Let go, let go you idiot

216
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,271
That's my mop!
Not any more, buddy!

217
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:09,084
Hey, are you all right?
It's just not fair...

218
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,439
Come on, forget about it.  It's only a mop.

219
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:17,164
Only a mop?  Only a mop?!  Oh, You don't understand.

220
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:21,513
That mop was given to me for my birthday when I was 8 years old.

221
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,281
We've never been apart!

222
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,919
And now... now I don't even have a job anymore!

223
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:37,444
After fifteen years, they toss me out like a bag of moldy tangerines!

224
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:46,360
What am I gonna do?  What am I gonna do?

225
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:51,121
Well... maybe you could come work for me...

226
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,117
Really? You mean it?

227
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:56,528
Uh... sure, I guess we could use a janitor.

228
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,756
Stanley Spadowski.
George Newman.

229
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:01,938
I'm mighty glad to meet you, George.

230
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:05,241
I'm going to do a realy great job, you won't be sorry. I'm really going to do a good job for you.

231
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:07,449
I'm a good janitor, I'm a realy good janitor.
Want me to clean your glasses for you?
- No, I...

232
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:13,484
I'm make them shiny, nice and shiny. Cause we're friends aren't we George.

233
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,457
No!

234
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,740
- Is this it...?
- No!

235
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,522
- Is this it...?
- No!

236
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:30,034
- Is this it?
- No, George, I can't delay the broadcast,

237
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:33,449
because the mayor is suppose to be coming any minute.

238
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,818
Where is he...? No, I've looked all over.

239
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:43,834
- I don't see a  "Noodles" Maclntire
- Macintosh! At your service!

240
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:47,656
Yah, George, Never mind. I think I found him.
Come on, come on!

241
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:05,806
We now go live to U62's Pamela Finklestein on the steps at City Hall.

242
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:10,591
Thank you. HI! Pamela Finklestein here.

243
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,986
Boy it's quite a scene this morning on the front steps of City Hall.

244
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:18,654
We're awaiting the emergence of Mayor Thompson from his annual city budget meeting...

245
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,628
Oh, I think he.... oh yah, here comes the mayor now....

246
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,478
let's go over and maybe we can get a few words out of him.

247
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:44,439
Aww, did I do that?  Oopsie!

248
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:48,107
Hey, Noodles, those things are pretty fragile.  You should be more careful.

249
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:51,456
Here he comes now... I think we should be able to...

250
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:58,132
Hey, sweet heart, take my advice... Broads don't belong in broadcasting.

251
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:03,583
Mr. Mayor!  Mr. Mayor! Richard Fletcher, channel 8 news, how are you?

252
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:17,623
Yah but, yah but..'Broads don't belong in broadcasting'?!

253
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:21,345
Is that the kind of professional courtesy you teach your news department?

254
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:23,047
Why, that's just terrible.

255
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:28,581
I don't know how many times I've told those boys...
never call chicks 'broads.'

256
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,363
Why, you slimy

257
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,467
Hello, and welcome to 'Town Talk.'

258
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,598
I'm George Newman and today our special guest

259
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:43,934
is local high school shop teacher Joe Earley.

260
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,835
Joe thanks for joining us

261
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,115
Thank you homeboy.

262
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,417
Well, I see you've brought some equipment with you today.

263
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,751
Would you mind giving us a demonstration?

264
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:55,265
Not at all.

265
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,818
There's only a few simple principles
you must bare in mind before attempting

266
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:08,951
to operate a sophisticated piece of machinery, like this...

267
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,488
Table saw.

268
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,366
You know, lots of times, when my students first learn to..

269
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:38,753
What? oh, Can you believe this?

270
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:42,408
wouldja look at that.

271
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:49,487
Just call me Mr. Butterfingers.

272
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:56,075
Oh I think its on the floor somewhere...

273
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:00,224
Is my face red.

274
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:06,315
Honey, where's the spatula?

275
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,847
Ok, kids, let's go!

276
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:15,022
There's just one place to go for all of your spatula needs

277
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:16,638
Spatula City

278
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:20,116
A giant warehouse of spatulas for every occasion.

279
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,103
Thousands to choose from in every shape, size, and color.

280
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:21,994
Thousands to choose from in every shape, size, and color.

281
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:23,610
Thousands to choose from in every shape, size, and color.

282
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,193
And because we eliminate the middle man,

283
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,074
we can sell all our spatulas
factory direct to you.

284
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,024
Where do you go if you want to buy

285
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,630
name brand spatulas at a
fraction of retail cost?

286
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:34,326
Spatula City

287
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,743

00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,642

289
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,860

290
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,354
And what better way to say "I love you." than with the gift of a spatula?

291
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,480
Spatula City

292
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:58,884
Hello, this is Sy Greenblum, president of Spatula City.

293
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,851
I liked their spatulas so much, I bought the company.

294
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:05,048
Spatula City - seven locations;

295
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,909
we're in the yellow pages under "spatulas".

296
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:10,952
My, where did you get that lovely spatula?

297
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,271
Spatula City We sell spatulas, and that's all.

298
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:29,443
Hey, kids, where do you wanna go?

299
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:33,468
To Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse.

300
00:28:33,524 --> 00:28:37,878
That's right!  I'm your Uncle Nutzy and boy oh boy,

301
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:40,756
are we gonna have some big fun today, huh, kids?

302
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:48,316
Well, let's walk on over and see who's in our Kiddie Korner...

303
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:51,066
Hi, what's your name?
Billy.

304
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:52,934
Billy what?

305
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,393
Okay...

306
00:28:56,565 --> 00:29:05,576
Uh oh, you know who that is?
That's right, it's your pal, Bobo the Clown! Yayyy!

307
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:13,734
Hey, Bobo, wanna play a game?

308
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:15,462
Okay... look up!

309
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,964
Look down!

310
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,379
Now look at Mr. Frying Pan!

311
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:23,939
Uh Oh, Bobo fall down go boom!

312
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:28,888
Upsie-daisey. Say Bobo, what's wrong?

313
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:32,671
I bet I know.  You're hungry, aren't you.

314
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,254
Well, I know just what you want.

315
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:39,781
Clowns and kids alike can't resist the mouth-watering,

316
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:44,612
lip-smacking taste of Mrs. Hockenburger's Butter Cookies.

317
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,596
Right, Bobo?

318
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:51,188
That's right! And hey, mom!  They're nutritious, too!

319
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:54,632
Just look at how much Bobo here likes 'em.

320
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:58,871
Mmmm, that's good. And don't forget, kids,

321
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:04,075
there's a nifty surprise inside every box of Mrs. Hockenburger's...

322
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:12,605
Uh oh! Ha ha ha... Bobo's been eating Yappy's Dog Treats!

323
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:18,016
That's right!  Yappy's Dog Treats,
your dog will love that real

324
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,523
liver and tuna taste...... with just a hint of cheese.

325
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:31,564
Hi Pamela Finklestein here.
We're talking with Mr. Earl Ramsey.

326
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:36,726
Now Mr. Ramsey is the President of the
local chapter of the American Gun Association.

327
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:43,614
Um Mr. Ramsey, would it be correct to assume
that your organization is against gun control?

328
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:47,176
Gun control is for wimps and Commies.

329
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:53,141
Listen, let's get one thing straight.
Guns don't kill people... I do!

330
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,444
I do
Yes. Well

331
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:57,784

335
00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:18,116
Are you tired of sloppy, cut-rate funerals?

336
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,709
You've tried the rest, now try the best...

Huh, now lookie here people

344
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,739
Listen to my story

345
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:00,279
A little story 'bout a man named Jed

346
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:03,652
You know something?
That poor mountaineer

347
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:06,798
They say he barely kept his family fed

348
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,753
Now, let me tell you
One day he was shootin'

349
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:13,998
Old Jed was shootin' at some food

350
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:17,346
When all of a sudden right up from the ground, there

351
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:21,147
Well, there came a bubblin' crude

352
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:28,067
Oil that is Well, maybe you call it black gold or Texas tea

353
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:36,921
He gonna move next to Mr. Drysdale And be a Beverly hillbilly...

354
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,871
Before you know it, all the kinfolk are-a-sayin'

355
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:45,374
Yeah, buddie, move away from there

356
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:52,209
That little Clampet got his own cement pond
That little Clampet, he's a millionaire

357
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:59,165
Now, everyone said Californie
Is the place that you oughta be

358
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:02,574

Swimming pools

366
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:38,685
Beverly Beverly Beverly hillbillies

367
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:51,661
George... hey, George...

368
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,399
I finished polishing all the doorknobs.

369
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:59,324
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Uh, no, Stanley... that's ok.

370
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:02,226
It's getting pretty late.
Why don't you call it a night?

371
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:08,190
Aw... do I have to?
Yeah.  Go on.  I'll see you in the morning.

372
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:13,002
Okay, I'll see ya.

373
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:17,749
Hey, George. You know, I was just wondering...
like, like, if you were travelling through outer space.

374
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,727
I mean like going real fast like the speed of light you know,

375
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:28,088
and all of a sudden you started screaming...
you think that you're brain would blow up?

376
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,801
Hey, guys, I'm trying to work here, do you mind?

377
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:39,585
No... no, I don't mind, go right ahead.
Do you mind, George?

378
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:45,352
Would you care to order now?

379
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:50,533
Oh yah, I'll have the
No, thank you.  We'll wait.

380
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:55,526
Are you sure he knows what restaurant we're at?

381
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:08,749
Well... I've got some good news and some bad news.

382
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,377
Okay... gimme the bad news first.

383
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:15,812
Well, given our present financial situation,

384
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:22,281
compounded by on-going fixed expenses and outstanding invoices,

385
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:25,235
I figure this station will be flat broke by the end of the week.

386
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:30,063
What's the good news?

387
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:34,388
I lied.  There is no good news.

388
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:41,514
I never should have taken this job.

389
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:47,621
I should have known it would turn out like all the others.

390
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:52,870
You know, for a short time there,

391
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,843
I just don't know anymore.

392
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:03,874
Well, at least I've still got Teri.

393
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,415
Bob, what time is it?

394
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:11,672
Nine thirty.
Oh no...

395
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,086
Hello?

396
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:24,708
George Newman... you're a selfish, thoughtless, insensitive creep.

397
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:30,778
And from now on you can forget all my birthdays... because we're through

398
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:47,638
Hey, kids... where do you want to go?

399
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:54,130
That's right.  To Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse.

400
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:59,822
And boy oh boy are we gonna have big fun today.

401
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,363
We're gonna have so much fun...

402
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:07,427
we'll forget about how miserable we are

403
00:38:07,477 --> 00:38:10,182
and how much life sucks and how

404
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:13,166
we're all going to grow old and die someday.

405
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:17,095
I wanna go home.
Shut up, you little weasel.

406
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:24,652
Okay, right now I'd like to show you one of my favorite cartoons.

407
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:29,802
It's a sad, depressing story about a pathetic coyote

408
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:33,781
who spends every waking moment of his life in the futile pursuit

409
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:39,151
of a sadistic roadrunner, who mocks him and laughs at him

410
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:42,979
as he is repeatedly crushed and maimed.

411
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,128
Hope you enjoy it.

412
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,753
Hey, where are you going?

413
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,797
I think I need a drink.
You don't drink.

414
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:53,984
Yeah, I know, but I've been meaning to start.

415
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:57,940
Well, wait a minute, what about the rest of the show?

416
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,125
Whatch out Mr.Coyote!  Oh no... this is terrible...

417
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,591
Hey, Stanley.
Yeah, George?

418
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:08,477
How would you like your own TV show?

419
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,956
ok.
You're on.

420
00:39:12,006 --> 00:39:16,039
What are you doing?  Are you crazy

421
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:33,014
George, what about?
Bob... it doesn't matter anymore.  It's over.

422
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:39,573
Yeah, we're watchin' it tube... yeah,
I've never seen anything like it... Okay, talk to you later.

423
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,433
Gentlemen! What can I get ya?

424
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:46,115
Beer.
Blueberry daquiri.

425
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,558
Tell you what George, Let's start fresh.
Start a whole new business.

426
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,651
Maybe we could borrow some money from your Uncle Harvey.

427
00:39:55,701 --> 00:40:00,187
Oh. Right.  We just flushed his TV station down the toilet.

428
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:02,816
I'm sure he'd be happy to lend us money.

429
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:07,106
So... I guess Teri's never gonna speak to you again, huh?

430
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:14,518
Hey, I didn't get an umbrella.

431
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:17,303
Look, everybody he's comin' back on!

432
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,670
Hey!!  Welcome back to "Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"!

433
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,679
Are you kids having a good time?
Yaaaaaay!

434
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:29,131
Hey, how bout that cartoon!
That was a weird cartoon, wasn't?

435
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:33,115
You know, that cartoon, it reminds me of a dream I had last week.When I turned into

436
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:37,784
a bird with a candy bar head. And then there were these other birds you know,and there all

437
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:41,690
trying to eat my head and everything.But I got a way from them.Then there was this tree you know,

438
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,232
and there was this weird lizard

439
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:56,498
I...I wanna show you somethin'! I wanna show you somethin'

440
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:08,665
This is my new mop. George, my friend, he gave me this mop.

441
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:13,799
It's a pretty good mop. It's not as good as my first mop.I miss

442
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:18,229
my first mop, but this is still a good mop.Sometimes you just have to take

443
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:24,391
what life gives you.Cause life is like a mop andand sometimes life gets full of

444
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:31,350
dirt and crud and bugs and hairballs and stuff, you just gotta clean it out, you, you gotta

445
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,976
put it in here and rinse it off and start all over again. And Sometimes, sometimes, life

446
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:43,175
sticks to the floor so bad, you know a mop? A mop just it's not good enough...It's not good enough. You gotta get down

447
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:48,067
there with like a toothbrush you know and you gotta you gotta really scrub! You've got to get it off. You've got to

448
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:52,437
real try to get it off. But if that doesn't work, that doesn't work you can't

449
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:57,814
give up... you gotta stand right up and gotta run to the window and yell, 'Hey

450
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:02,352
these floors are dirty as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!!'

451
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,722
Yes mama!  That's right, Stanley Spadowski, ah ah.

452
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:18,145
I don't think that he's married now.

453
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:21,979
Well I think that he went to Harvard.

00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:30,125
I'm done with the show, whaddaya want me to do now?.

456
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:34,044
Did you have a good time in there, Stanley?
Yeah! Oh boy, it was fun!

457
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,650
Great.  How'd you like to do it every day?

458
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,101
Yeah!  That would be... Wait a minute...

459
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:44,265
do I still get to be the janitor?

460
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:50,682
Sure.
Oh. Okay... it's a deal.

461
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,080
I'm gonna go clean the bathroom now.

462
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:04,948
Okay, kids, where do you wanna go?
To Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse!!

463
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:17,816
Great. All right. It's a deal.
Thanks a lot. Ok.

464
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:20,773
George, wait 'till you hear this.

465
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:24,207
'Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse' is sold out for the next three months!

466
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:26,502
The sponsors love him!

467
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:30,272
If we had a few more shows like this, we'd really be in business.

468
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:32,296
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

469
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:36,221
I've been working on some new ideas.
Tell me what you think

470
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:45,353
Today... one of these lucky contestants will win his or her weight in fish...

471
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:50,776

472
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:57,280

Okay, you get over there and spin the Wheel of Fish!

475
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:14,188
Go ahead, give it a big spin...

476
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:20,180
Come on, come on.

477
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:31,933
A red snapper!  MM, is very tasty!

478
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:34,877
Okay, Weaver, listen carefully.

479
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:38,062
You can hold on to your red snapper,

480
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:42,288
or you can go for what's in the box that Hiro-san is bringing down the aisle right now!

481
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:44,620
What's it gonna be?

482
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,501
- Keep the fish!|- Take the box!

483
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:55,858
I... I'll take the box!

484
00:44:55,908 --> 00:45:01,800
You took the box!  Let's see what's in the box.

485
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:10,496
Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

486
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:15,463
Stupid...!  You're so stupid...!!

487
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:33,443
Hello, my name is Philo, and welcome to...

488
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,258
<i>'Secrets Of The Universe.'

489
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:51,014
Today we're going to learn to make Plutonium from common household items.

490
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:55,256
Hey, man, this is Raul Hernandez, and welcome to

491
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:59,973
'Raul's Wild Kingdom,' coming to you live from my apartment!

492
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,387
How about that, huh?  Okay, first thing we're gonna do today is check out the

493
00:46:04,437 --> 00:46:07,432
wonderful world of turtles..

494
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,389
This is my friend Tommy. Tommy say hello to the nice people.

495
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:18,265
'hello' Aaay, isn't he great?  Okay, so... the turtle is a member of the reptile family

496
00:46:18,315 --> 00:46:23,005
and it's got this hard, protective shell...(he raps on it) ... which keeps

497
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:26,518
predators away and provides him with his own house for when he sleep. And he's got these

498
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:32,543
teeny tiny little legs, which makes him move real slow. And not many people

499
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:39,131
know this, but the turtle is also natures suction cup! Watch this...

500
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,197
Did'ou see that?  It sticks!

501
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,761
Okay, oh yah, what else I got for you? yeah, check this out.

502
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:51,642
This is my ant farm.  You know, ants are amazing.

503
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:56,552
They can carry fifty times their own weight,

504
00:46:56,602 --> 00:47:02,802
and they work for weeks and weeks building these intricate little tunnels, and...oh yeah, they hate it when you do this...

505
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:09,404
Oh, look, they're really mad now!

506
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:12,602
Where did you find this guy?

507
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,997
Me, I thought you hired him

508
00:47:16,093 --> 00:47:17,791

Oh, man...

You know, sometimes it takes 'em a
longer to learn how to do it right.

515
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:49,053
Okay... come on... come on... cheer up, cheer up. hey, hey! Who's next?Ah Gigi.

What is this piece of crap?

525
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:48,684
I thought I told you I wanted a Rolex!  A ROLEX!What?!

526
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,717

527
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:57,105
Just thought I ought to tell you, sir,there's a lot of talk on the street about this Channel 62.

528
00:48:57,155 --> 00:49:00,222
They're starting to get a pretty strong following...

529
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:05,066
Excuse me, did you say 'Channel 62.'
Uh huh.

530
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:10,944
Do I need to remind you... that we are a network affiliate?!And we're in competition

531
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:15,394
with other networks,not with a bunch of punks broadcasting out of a closet!

532
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:16,598
But, s s s

Never before in the history of motion pictures

551
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:53,763
has there been a screen presence so commanding

552
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,507
... so powerful

553
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:56,899

Can you tell me where I could find a book on astronomy?

556
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,629

Don't tell me we actually showed up on the list...

578
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:54,100
We're number one.

579
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,378
Say what?

580
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:03,085

Be there! Yah

596
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:11,378
This is indeed a sad day for Channel 8.
We've been number one in this

597
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:14,838
town for the past ten years and now our sponsors are

598
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:19,119
pulling their accounts...we're losing valuable advertising

599
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:24,719
revenue...we're losing credibility in the market... and why?

600
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:31,399
Because of some fly-by-night UHF station. A UHF station!

601
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:34,368
This is an embarrassment. A disgrace!

602
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:39,116
What do you think R.J. Fletcher Sr. would saying if he were alive today?

603
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:44,454
Help!  Let me outta this box!  I can't breath in here!  Help!  Lemme out...

604
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:57,378
We've got to do something. We've got to do it fast. Who owns that station anyway?

605
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:19,947
Yodf!... Hey, Big Louie!  What's happin'
Bad news, Mr. Bilchik.

606
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:23,223
None of your horses came in.
Oh, that's to bad.

607
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:27,443
So, a, what's the damage?

608
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:29,779
Seventy-five thousand dollars.

609
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:39,187
Uh... excuse me, Louie, I think I got some water in the phone here.

610
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:40,990
How much was that again?

611
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,403
Seventy-five thousand dollars. I'll be expecting payment in 2 days.

612
00:56:47,453 --> 00:56:54,063
Two days?!  Listen, Louie... I might need a little more time...

613
00:56:54,113 --> 00:57:00,289
Friday night. Ten o'clock.  Seventy-five thousand... in cash.

614
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,810
I'm dead meat.

615
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:23,102
Yeah, what?...
Mr. Bilchick? This is R.J. Fletcher.

616
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:36,383
Can I help you?
No, thanks. Just taking a few measurements.

617
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:45,894
Wait a minute, I think I missed something here.

618
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:48,964
Oh, didn't I tell you? I own this place now.

619
00:57:49,014 --> 00:57:51,892
You what?
What's the matter, kid,

620
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:54,523
you got wax in your ears?
But my Uncle Harvey..

621
00:57:54,573 --> 00:57:57,589
Harvey Bilchik is flying in tonight to close the deal.

622
00:57:57,639 --> 00:57:59,576
I don't believe this.
Hold this kid.

623
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,040
George, do something.
Hey, wait a minute,

624
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:04,434
don't you already own Channel 8.

625
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:07,954
I mean, isn't it illegal to own two TV stations in the same town.

626
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:14,038
Oh, really? Gee

627
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:18,897
I guess I'll turn it into
a parking lot.

628
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:21,575
Toodle Lo

629
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,414
Harvey

630
00:58:32,464 --> 00:58:35,478
I still don't understand
what this is all about?
I told you

631
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:38,593
, I just have to wrap up a little business deal and I'll be back in a few days

632
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:44,308

- You take care of you're self, you hear?

633
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,688
Bye
Bye

634
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:59,206
Hello? Oh hi George, it's so good
to hear from you? How's everything?

635
00:59:01,784 --> 00:59:03,573
HE WHAT!

636
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:08,101
Harvey Bilchick! Get in here!

637
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:18,469
Uncle Harvey, at least give me a chance to match his offer.

638
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:22,336
Yah let me worry about where I'm going to come up with the money.

639

Yeah, seventy-five thousand, in cash, firday night.

640
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:34,430
10 O'clock, yah I got it. OK, ok, bye.

641
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,660
George, where are you gonna to come up with that kind of money?

642
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,547
Yeah. And what are you going to do about Fletcher?

643
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:51,488
Yeah, I wouldn't put anything past that guy.If there were only some way we could keep an eye on him.

644
01:00:55,999 --> 01:01:02,586
Harvey... Harvey Bilchik? Hey, great to see you. R.J. Fletcher.

645
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:06,659
Did you have a good flight?
Yeah... want some peanuts?

646
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:12,306
No, thank you. Mr. Bilchik, while you're here in town,

647
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:18,433
I want to make sure you're very comfortable.
Anything special you want, you just let me know.

648
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:23,473
Now, whaddaya say we take care of a little business?I've got all the cash

649
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:28,325
right here and as soon as you sign these and we can start celebrating.

650
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:31,405
Yeah, well, uh... listen, I
gotta talk to you about that.

651
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:34,713
What?  What's wrong?
Well you see, the thing is...

652
01:01:34,763 --> 01:01:38,317
that a I promised George that I'd give him a chance to get all the money

653
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:41,108
- by Friday night.
What are you talking about? We had a deal!

654
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:46,151
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, this is just something I had to do.Don't worry about it. There's no possible way

655
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:50,036
that kid can come-up with seventy-five thousand bucks in two days.

656
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,885
TOWN TALK WITH GEORGE

657
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:00,670
George Newman. He starts where the others stop.

658
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,234
Sex with furniture, what do you think?

659
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:07,781
The world watched in amazement as he unlocked

660
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:10,317
the mysteries of Al Caponio's glove compartment.
AH HA!

661
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,097
Road maps!

662
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:14,464
He blow the lid off Satanism.

663
01:02:14,514 --> 01:02:19,860
Look, all I was trying to say..
Oh shut up you pin head! You make me sick!

664
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:25,237
Sometimes shocking, always controversial.He deals with topics that the other talk

665
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:31,220
shows are afraid to touch.He pries, he pokes, he digs deep. He gets

666
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:36,008
the answers, he gets the facts,and most of all he gets the ratings.

667
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:45,583
Lesbian, Nazi Hookers, abducted by UFO's

668
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:49,062
and forced into weight lose programs, all this week, on 'Town Talk.'

669
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:10,653
George, what's a matter?
Stanley, you don't want to know.

670
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,802
Oh... why'd I ask?

671
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,484
Somethin' I can do to help?

672
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:27,575
Not unless you've got seventy-five thousand dollars.

673
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:39,150
No... sorry.

674
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,147
This is ridiculous. There must be something I could do...

675
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:53,740
The U62 telethon is on the air!

676
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:05,872
Hey, dad, you better turn on Channel 62.  Something funny's going on.

677
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:12,732
Now, we're not asking for donations.

678
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,875
What we are doing is offering everyone in this town a unique business opertunity.

679
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:24,146
This is one share of stock in Channel 62.Our goal, over the next

680
01:04:24,196 --> 01:04:30,305
day and a half,will be to sell seventy-five hundred of these at ten dollars apiece.

681
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:33,436
If we succeed, then the station will belong to all of us.

682
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:38,663
Now I'm calling out an S.O.S. Save Our Station!

683
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,685
We've got volunteers right over here that will be taking your money and they're gonna be here

684
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:47,089
around the clock for the next two days until every share is sold!

685
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:50,388
Whaddaya say, kids? Can we do it?

686
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:10,817
I think it's time you boys paid our Mr. Spadowski a little visit.

687
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:17,434
Um ya, I'm calling on behalf of our station
and were having this telethon

688
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:21,580

you could help us. Bring you're dogs down here

690
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,630
I'll wash them for you.

691
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:34,403
Well so far, guys your response has been really been incredible,

692
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:38,914
but we've still got a long way to go... Remember, when you buy stock in U62,

693
01:05:38,964 --> 01:05:42,154

694
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:47,874
You're doing great, Stanley.  Now. remember, you gotta pace yourself..You got a long way

695
01:05:47,898 --> 01:05:51,027

I can do it, George... I can do it.

696
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:54,756
All right, now just take it easy...

697
01:05:57,504 --> 01:05:59,503
Is there anything I can get you?

698
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:02,013
Some play-doh
Okay.

699
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:06,672
NO NO no, give some bubble some real big bubbles.

700
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:08,447
I'll 'see what I can do.

701
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:20,587
Who is it?
Got a pizza here for Mr. Stanley Spadowski.

702
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:23,744
Pizza? For me? Oh boy!

703
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:31,999
I like peppers, but I love anchovies cause there real fishy.

704
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:37,567
Some times I like to get a pizza with nothing on it but anchovies.

705
01:06:37,617 --> 01:06:41,589
No peppers or olives or onions, just anchovies cause there good.

706
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:44,794
So... are we gonna kill him?
No no.

707
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:49,645
The boss just wants us to keep
him on ice for a while. Easy easy.

708
01:06:50,492 --> 01:06:54,801
Hey... wait a minute... you guys aren't from the pizza place!

709
01:07:02,308 --> 01:07:04,052
ON THE AIR

710
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,838
George, George, you've got to do something.

711
01:07:07,888 --> 01:07:10,361
Every minute Stanley's off the air, we're losing money.

712
01:07:10,411 --> 01:07:14,381
Yeah... listen, just stall as long as you can. I'm sure he'll turn up.

713
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,139
OK.
What did the police say?

714
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:20,527
They're doing everything they can.I'm telling you, George, Fletcher's behind this, I just know it.

715
01:07:30,894 --> 01:07:35,135
Okay, I'm thinking Of something... orange.

716
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:41,895
Something orange... orange... Ya give up?  It's an orange!

717
01:07:41,945 --> 01:07:51,347
Get it? This is fun, huh?  Okay, now I'm thinking of something blue... something... blue...

718
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,779
Let me kill him.  Please let me kill him.

719
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:21,585
What! Don't you like Baonaza!?

720
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:38,591
Ok Philo, go to commercial.

721
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:41,547
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK...

722
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,619
Next week on U62...

723
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:47,923
He's back

724
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:50,132
And this time

725
01:08:50,254 --> 01:08:51,902
He's mad

726
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:57,427
No more mister passive resistance

727
01:08:57,585 --> 01:09:00,737
He's out to kick some butt

728
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:05,627
This is one bad mother you don't wanna mess with

729
01:09:10,459 --> 01:09:12,695
Don't move, slimeball

730
01:09:15,161 --> 01:09:17,765
He's a one man recking crew

731
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,827
But he also knows how to party

732
01:09:25,554 --> 01:09:29,560
Gimme a steak, medium rare
Hey, Baldy!

733
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,390
There is only one law

734
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,403
His law

735
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:47,839
Hey, mister!  Change?  You got change?
Do you mind?  Get out of my way.

736
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:53,107
Hey, come on, can't you help a guy out? Anything...

737
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:00,885
Don't spend it all in one place.

738
01:10:02,522 --> 01:10:12,298
Wow! Oh I can't believe it. Thanks, mister! Thanks a lot!

739
01:10:26,881 --> 01:10:31,144
Um, Mr. Fletcher, may I speak to you for a moment?

740
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:33,187
Personnel is that way, young lady.

741
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:37,965
No, I'm not here about a job, I'd like to speak to you about Channel 62.

742
01:10:38,112 --> 01:10:43,043
Channel 62?  Oh yes, my demolition team is looking forward

743
01:10:43,093 --> 01:10:45,332
to turning it into a rubble heap on Saturday morning.

744
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:49,084
Wait a minute. Would you please just listen.

745
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,382
George Newman has turned that little station into something

746
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:56,181
this community cares about.
George Newman is a two-bit

747
01:10:56,231 --> 01:10:59,375
little punk who should never have stuck his nose where it didn't belong

748
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:01,592
and if he sent you here to try and make a deal...

749
01:11:01,642 --> 01:11:03,996
George doesn't know I'm here.

750
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:09,432
Look, it just seems to me there's more than enough room for the both of you in this town.

751
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:13,012
Besides, a little competition is always good for the community.

752
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:15,628
The community?  Let me tell you something.

753
01:11:15,678 --> 01:11:21,381
This community means about as much to me as a festering bowl of dog snot!

754
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:37,552
You guys...?  Hey, you guys...?  My blindfold fell off!

755
01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:41,168
You better come fix it.  I didn't mean for it ..

756
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:45,442
HEY... MY SHIRT GLOWS IN THE DARK!  WOW!!

757
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,917
Would you shut him up?

758
01:11:51,438 --> 01:11:54,226
I got an itch I got an itch I got an itch I got an itch I got an itch...

759
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:03,918
I got an itch I got an itch
Stanley, I don't want to have to tell you this again.

760
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,855
Shut up! You're makin' us nuts.

761
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:13,783
Now I got three guys out here

762
01:12:15,423 --> 01:12:19,624
that would love to cut your tongue out.

763
01:12:20,444 --> 01:12:27,322
But I don't want them to do that. I told them not to complain about all this...

764
01:12:28,523 --> 01:12:31,990
... Stanley, be nice.

765
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:33,856
MY MOP!!

766
01:12:42,447 --> 01:12:43,516
¡Please!

767
01:13:30,231 --> 01:13:31,868
It's a mop

768
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:48,111
¿¿??

769
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:04,735
Yeah.

770
01:14:16,139 --> 01:14:17,581
Stanley!

771
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:23,034
Don't move, Spadowski.

772
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:26,987
Don't even breathe.

773
01:14:34,186 --> 01:14:36,495
What are we gonna do now?

774
01:14:37,617 --> 01:14:39,301
I'll handle this.

775
01:16:33,606 --> 01:16:36,744
HELICOPTER RIDES- $20

776
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:01,822
Who's this guy?

777
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:06,177
I'm you're worst nightmare

778
01:19:10,486 --> 01:19:14,971
Listen, I can see you guys are pretty busy...how about if I just come back later?

779
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:19,417
Forget it, pal.  We're all goin' for a little ride.

780
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:23,376
Oh. Well, we're gonna have to take your car... mine's a two-seater.

781
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:28,819
Just shut up, kid.  You know, you really botched thing up.

782
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:33,075
If you hadn'ta stuck your face in our business,

783
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,889
we'd all be goin' home soon.

784
01:19:38,898 --> 01:19:46,854
But now I'm gonna have to put you and your friend out of commission... for good.

785
01:19:49,447 --> 01:19:51,982
Red rum!  Red rum!

786
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,251
What was that?

787
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:59,251
Hold on. Though hear something?
What?

788
01:19:59,298 --> 01:19:59,987
I don't know...

789
01:20:00,037 --> 01:20:01,585
SUPPLIES

790
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:02,814
Supplies !!!

791
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:20,350
Hey, everybody!  They're back!

792
01:21:17,594 --> 01:21:23,181
Friends, there comes a time in every man's life

793
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:29,266
where he has to look the potato of injustice right in the eye.

794
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:34,871
There's a powerful evil force in the universe, and it lives at Channel 8.

795
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:37,312
I've seen it.  And I don't want it to pop its ugly, greasy head here.  Do you?

796
01:21:37,362 --> 01:21:38,507
No!

797
01:21:38,557 --> 01:21:39,914
I can't hear you!

798
01:21:39,964 --> 01:21:41,057
No! !

799
01:21:41,107 --> 01:21:42,610
I can't hear you!!!

800
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,809
No! ! !

801
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:47,037
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

802
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,500
Alright, say it again!

803
01:21:50,903 --> 01:21:52,940
No! ! !
Alright!

804
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:59,061
And now, a Special Report from the owner and General Manager of Channel 8, R.J. Fletcher.

805
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:03,813
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
I come before you tonight

806
01:22:03,863 --> 01:22:08,226
to speak on a matter which is of grave concern to us all.

807
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:15,290
I want to show you how one small television station can single-handedly

808
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,890
disrupt and destroy the moral fiber of an entire community.

809
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,460
SIGNAL OVER-RIDE
STAND BY

810
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:30,525
The following may upset you. It may even shock you.

811
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:36,125
But I feel it is my duty as a concerned cititizan to bring you this important massage.

812
01:22:39,494 --> 01:22:45,108
This community means about as much to me as a festering bowl of dog snot!

813
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:48,272
You think I care about the pea-brained yokels in this town?

814
01:22:48,322 --> 01:22:52,460
If you took their combined IQ and multiplied it by a hundred,

815
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:56,169
you might have enough intelligence to tie your shoe,if you didn't

816
01:22:56,219 --> 01:23:02,149
drool all over yourself first.I can't stand those snivelling maggots. They make me want

817
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:07,830
to puke.But there is one good thing about broadcasting to a town full of mindless

818
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:14,475
sheep.I always know I've got them exactly where I want them.

819
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:34,953
Seventy-three thousand dollars! WOHOO!

820
01:23:36,694 --> 01:23:39,923
We just hit the seventy-three thousand dollar mark!

821
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:43,508
OK Mouseketeers, Come on!  We can do it!

822
01:23:46,726 --> 01:23:48,396
Whaddaya say, stranger.

823
01:23:50,244 --> 01:23:55,796
Teri? What are you doing here? I thought you never wanted to see me again.

824
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,358
Well what ever gave you that idea?

825
01:23:59,789 --> 01:24:04,087
Well, I think my first clue was when you said you never wanted to see me again.

826
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,634
Oh. Well, George no matter what happens tonight

827
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:12,227
I just want you to know that I'm so proud of you.

828
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:21,920
Uncle Harvey! Listen, we'll definitely have the money for you.

829
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:24,345
It just may take a few minutes longer than we expected...

830
01:24:24,395 --> 01:24:28,310
Look, kid, if it were up to me, I'd let you have all the time you wanted.

831
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:33,196
But you know, Big Louie is a punctual kinda guy.I wouldn't want to keep him waiting...

832
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:42,126
Okay, Okay, I know a lot of you people probably like to wait until the last minute.

833
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:45,122
Well, this is it!  This is the last minute!

834
01:24:45,697 --> 01:24:50,039
What are you doing here? Disturbing the peace. Come on.

835
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:56,980
Why aren't you home in bed? Stand back. Out of my way. Look out.

836
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:06,028
This party is over, Mr. Newman.

837
01:25:10,551 --> 01:25:11,942
You can say that again...

838
01:25:21,343 --> 01:25:29,452
Okay, Fletcher, you win... give me the money.
Settle down... All in good time MR. Bilick.

839
01:25:29,502 --> 01:25:34,432
What are you crazy?! Give me the money!

840
01:25:34,482 --> 01:25:39,020
Please! If you don't mind, there are a few things I'd like to say

841
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,628
to these people before this transaction takes place...

842
01:25:54,548 --> 01:26:02,900
Dear friends. I'm sure that one day you'll realize that

843
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,847
by shutting down this hot bed of subversive activity...

844
01:26:05,897 --> 01:26:09,469
Hey, Mister...
Not now, okay...?

845
01:26:09,519 --> 01:26:13,732
I was just wondering if it was too late to buy shares.

846
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:18,040
- I'll take whatever you got left.
- How much is that?

847
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:23,221
Two thousand dollars.  Keep the change.

848
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:40,321
Uh... Mr. Big Louie, sir? My Uncle Harvey wanted you to have this.

849
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:43,638
Seventy-five thousand dollars... it's all here.

850
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:48,024
Uncle Harvey...

851
01:26:49,218 --> 01:26:50,441
Hey!  What's going on here?

852
01:26:52,645 --> 01:26:55,700
Now wait just one minute here!  What do you think you're doing?

853
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,434
We did it!  The station's ours!

854
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:27,155
Wow look that

855
01:27:27,205 --> 01:27:31,300
You can't do this!  We had an agreement, remember?  An oral contract! I'll sue!

856
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,679
Aw, blow it out your ear scuz bag.

857
01:27:35,862 --> 01:27:37,231
R.J. Fletcher?

858
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:39,916
So what if I am?
I'm John Vickers, FCC.

859
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:44,593
I've noticed that your station is late in filing for its license renewal this year.

860
01:27:44,643 --> 01:27:48,127
Now, normally this kind of violation would be punishable by a stiff fine,

861
01:27:48,177 --> 01:27:52,072
but I've been watching you lately and you've made a big impression on me.

862
01:27:52,122 --> 01:27:57,499
Yah, I'm revoking your license.  Effective immediately, you're off the air.

863
01:27:57,787 --> 01:28:01,234
HI! Pamela Finklestein here coming to you with a most incredible

864
01:28:01,284 --> 01:28:05,652
turn of events. Not only has the once-powerful corporate broadcasting giant been

865
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:10,410
thoroughly crushed and defeated, but now as luck would have it,

866
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,979
they've been completely stripped of their license by the FCC.

867
01:28:14,176 --> 01:28:17,684
Oh well what do you have to say about it, you worthless, slobbering pig?

868
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:21,961
Dad! Where's my dad? What's going on here?

869
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:32,139
Awvw...
did I do that?  Oopsie!

870
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:35,776
Daddddd!

871
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:40,291
Philo... Hey, you really went beyond the call of duty on this one, pal. Thanks.

872
01:28:40,536 --> 01:28:42,987
Glad to have been of service, George.

873
01:28:43,037 --> 01:28:47,180
Well, it appears my work
on this planet is complete.

874
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:51,261
I must now return to my home on the planet Zarkon.

875
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:54,665
Okay, well, have fun.

876
01:28:58,841 --> 01:29:04,005
Hey... nice goin' kid.  I didn't know you had it in ya.  You're okay.

877
01:29:04,055 --> 01:29:06,687
Thanks, Uncle Harvey. Have a
nice flight back to the cost.

878
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:12,512
Say hi to Aunt Esther for me.
Sure will.

879
01:29:15,122 --> 01:29:18,822
Excuse me, aren't you R.J. Fletcher?
Yes...

880
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,725
Stanley!  Congratulations, you really pulled us through.

881
01:29:28,775 --> 01:29:31,544
Hey George I want you to know that I'm mighty proud to be a part of your team.

882
01:29:31,594 --> 01:29:32,975
Well, I'm mighty proud of you too, Stanley.

883
01:29:33,025 --> 01:29:36,076
In fact, I'd like to present you with a small token of my gratitude.

884
01:29:38,259 --> 01:29:42,528
A trophy! That that's me?

885
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:48,599
'Stanley... World's Greatest
Janitor and TV Star.'

886
01:29:49,499 --> 01:29:54,630
Ah, George... I've never had any one give me a trophy before.

887
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:01,165
It's big. George, you're my best friend in the whole world!

888
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:06,439
I'm gonna go show this to everybody right now!!Hey, everybody!  Look at what George gave me!

889
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:15,774
Hey! Hey, I know you! You're the guy that gave me that 1955 double dye Denver

890
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:23,459
Mint penny!Thanks a lot, mister! That thing was worth a fortune!

891
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:28,150
After I cashed it in, I had enough money to buy a whole bunch of shares...

892
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:33,085
plus, I got this neat watch.

893
01:30:33,135 --> 01:30:36,331
It's a Ro-lex. See?

894
01:30:47,593 --> 01:30:50,809
Um, George?
Ah uh

895
01:30:50,859 --> 01:30:53,682
You know those dreams you/re always having?

896
01:30:53,732 --> 01:30:55,321
Yeah...?

897
01:30:55,371 --> 01:31:01,543
Well, do you think that maybe sometime I could be part of them?

898
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:07,916
Honey... from now on, you're going to be in all of them.

899
01:31:09,621 --> 01:31:11,744
Aww... George...

900
01:31:11,794 --> 01:31:15,307
Darlin'... let's leave
