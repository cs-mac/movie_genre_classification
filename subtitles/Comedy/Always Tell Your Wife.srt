1
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:03,643
So like you said, when
you come face-to-face with

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,679
something like that, what
are you supposed to do?

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,648
SWEET DEE: Oof!

4
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,083
Oh, hey, buddy.

5
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,052
Yeah, what's
going on there, pal?

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,988
Oh, my God, I
just found a rat's nest.

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,824
Slaughtered about 200 of 'em.

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:22,028
200? Couldn't be. That's...
Jesus Christ...

9
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:24,998
Oh, it's like, it's like
whole generations of those

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,436
things have died at my hands, and...

11
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:32,339
mothers, fathers, grandfathers,
little baby rats.

12
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,440
Mmm, yeah.

13
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:34,508
Wow.

14
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,778
Well, you know, keep up the good work.

15
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,374
Yeah.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,054
Sometimes I wonder though, if

17
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,253
our lives are really more valuable
than theirs, you know what I mean?

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,587
- Yeah.
- They are.

19
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:48,255
Yeah.

20
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,424
- Our lives are definitely...
- Yeah. without a doubt.

21
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:52,959
- Yeah.
- Without a doubt.

22
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:56,329
If that makes you feel any better.

23
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:57,531
Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:01,401
- Yeah, well, I suppose I oughta...
- Get back to it?

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,870
Yep. Jump right back
in there, tiger.

26
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,771
Get on the horse.

27
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,173
Charlie, bash, bash 'em up.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,507
- Do what you do best.
- Alright. Thanks, guys.

29
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:08,975
Yep. Oh, God.

30
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:10,944
I just gotta go to the bathroom.

31
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,479
- Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Alright, man.

32
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:13,580
He touched me with it.

33
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,582
Ugh! God, what a life, huh?

34
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,417
- Today's his birthday.
- Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,452
Poor guy, on a day like this.

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,987
We oughta do something nice for him.

37
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,389
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.
- Yeah, absolutely.

38
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,558
Oh! You want to get
him a new rat stick?

39
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,559
That's a good idea.

40
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:28,728
Abso... I was thinking maybe we
should throw him a surprise party.

41
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,629
He is really bummed.

42
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,565
I guess we could do
something nice for him.

43
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,868
Definitely. Listen, for one day let's
make the poor bastard feel special.

44
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,839
For one day let's make this lowly
rat killer feel like a king.

45
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:39,706
Yes.

46
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:43,343
In the simplest... Easiest...
way. ...easiest.

47
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,345
I'm tired today, you know?

48
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:58,744
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,950
Here it is. I got it!

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,103
I'm thinking we go with a
Hawaiian

51
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,732
trip-hop, underground luau theme.

52
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,582
- Huh?
- What is that?

53
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,065
- What even is that?
- Well, you know...

54
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,989
I'll even hang around with this guy
Duncan from under the bridge....

55
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,151
And he runs with this rough crowd

56
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,559
and they're all into

57
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,224
Hawaiian underground shit, you know?

58
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,928
And I made a little list of stuff
that would really support that theme.

59
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,163
"Fill bar with sand.

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,699
Roast wild pig.

61
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,966
Invite Duncan and crew."

62
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,337
Ooh, this seems like
a whole lot of work.

63
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,306
Uh, does anybody really even
like surprise parties anyway?

64
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,708
You know?
I don't.

65
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,376
What the hell's the matter with you?!

66
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,411
- How did you get so cynical?
- Cynical?

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,014
You can't even get excited
to give your friend a party!

68
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:04,918
I mean, giving somebody a
birthday party, a surprise party

69
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,487
is one of the greatest
things you can do for him!

70
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,389
Okay, Frank.
Alright.

71
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,625
Alright, alright, well, maybe
we are being a little cynical.

72
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,894
Clearly, this means a
lot to you, so, fine.

73
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,930
We'll jump on board with the party.
What's the plan?

74
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,998
Alright, the plan is you
guys execute this list.

75
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:19,699
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:23,536
I am gonna take Charlie to the
spa for a day to distract him.

77
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:24,504
Hold on a second.

78
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,607
Why do you get to spend the day at
a spa while we do all the legwork?

79
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,043
Because I got these two
coupons in the mail.

80
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,445
Okay, I'm pregnant, and you
haven't offered me coupons or

81
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,749
spa days or roasted pigs or
surprises or any-any of those

82
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,117
fun things.

83
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,053
Oh, oh, okay, well, in the
interest of not being cynical

84
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,989
and, you know, doing shit for
other people, I'm gonna suggest

85
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,958
that we give the two coupons to

86
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,360
<i>Dee and she does the spa thing.</i>

87
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,195
Surprise. Perfect.
Thank you.

88
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,330
Alright, cool.

89
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,967
I will take this coupon and sneak out
the back so Charlie doesn't see me.

90
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,569
- Wait, wait.
- What, what? What?

91
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,772
No, you have to take Charlie
with you to the spa.

92
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,407
That's the whole thing.
You have to distract him.

93
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,508
Oh... Shit.

94
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,211
Yeah, Frank, you might be right
about us getting cynical.

95
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,281
I just, I just jumped straight
to default and was gonna throw

96
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,749
this second coupon in the trash.

97
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,552
But the Charlie thing, yep,
we're doing the Charlie thing.

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,988
Okay, I got it. I'm on it.

99
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,090
Okay.

100
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,327
Hey, Charlie!

101
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,497
Okay, hey, listen, uh, you've
been really stressed, so I

102
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,200
thought I would take you for
a spa day, just you and me.

103
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,768
A what day?

104
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,069
A spa day.

105
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,037
What is this word "spa"?

106
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,706
I feel like you're starting to say a
word, and you're not finishing it.

107
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,141
Are you trying to say "spaghetti"?

108
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,976
Are you taking me for a spaghetti day?

109
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,513
No, Charlie, I wasn't trying to
take you for a spaghetti day.

110
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,581
Oh, God, you know what?

111
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,116
It doesn't matter. It's okay.
That's alright.

112
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,751
I'm doing something nice here.
I tell you what.

113
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's go to a movie.
Want to go to a movie?

114
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,567
Dee, I go to movie or
a spaghetti place with you

115
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,135
you know and ***?

116
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,843
What if I guarantee you

117
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:53,922
that nobody out there will put you

118
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,129
into a bag and bash you
against a telephone pole?

119
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,363
Would that comfort you at all?

120
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,571
Nope. That's a guarantee you
can't make, Dee, alright?

121
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,268
Alright, I tell you what...
That's why I'm building this little puppy.

122
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,970
Yeah. Don't do...
And no one's getting bashed.

123
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,472
Okay, I tell you what, Charlie.

124
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,774
If you don't come with me to
the movie, I'm gonna take this

125
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,210
raccoon of yours and I'm gonna
bash it into a telephone pole.

126
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,245
No! I can't take any more
bashing today, alright?

127
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,413
Okay, let's go, let's go.

128
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,070
This will be fun!
Alright, let's go.

129
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,253
- Dennis.
- Yeah?

130
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,589
Why don't you check that box of tiki
torches, start setting those up?

131
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,191
What this?
Yeah, that box there.

132
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,359
What is this?

133
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,827
We didn't put this in here.

134
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:28,862
Surprise!

135
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,196
What is that? What'd you do?

136
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,464
I got you a present, bro!

137
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm trying to be less cynical,
and Frank is totally right.

138
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,668
The surprise is the way to go!

139
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,736
So you got me a gift?

140
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,838
Yes! Yeah, while we were
picking out the decorations, I

141
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,941
slipped out and I got you something
I think you're gonna gonna like.

142
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,910
Okay, alright. Ooh!
Ooh! Okay. Uh!

143
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,212
Ah!

144
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,615
Oh! Oh, a shirt!

145
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,816
I love this shirt!

146
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:50,917
Oh, that's great, man!

147
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:51,951
Thank you.

148
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,254
Hey. No, this isn't the
shirt that I picked out.

149
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,222
Yeah. No. Well, no.
What is this?

150
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,324
It's the shirt that I...
that I picked out.

151
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,392
But that's cool.

152
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,760
Here's the thing, man.

153
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,863
I-I got a little suspicious
when you slipped out earlier,

154
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,100
and so I followed you into the
store, and I saw that you were

155
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,536
about to make a really bad
choice, and then you did make

156
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,438
that choice and you bought that other
shirt, and it was a bad shirt.

157
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,907
It was an ugly shirt.
Hideous really.

158
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,509
So I grabbed that shirt out
of the bag when you weren't

159
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,678
looking and I returned it and
bought myself this shirt

160
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,946
which isn't hideous.

161
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,247
And so, surprise.

162
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,549
That was a good shirt.

163
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,983
No.

164
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,053
This brings me no joy at all.
I feel nothing.

165
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,355
I feel...
I feel like you just, you stole

166
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,758
money from me, and then you
bought yourself a shirt.

167
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,159
A shirt with your money.

168
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,193
Yeah.

169
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,428
No, that is what happened.

170
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,199
That is a ridiculous
price and you know it!

171
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:44,003
Supposing I bought a pig unseasoned
and dressed it myself?

172
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,405
Then what? What then?!

173
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:50,543
Well, that's not what Jerry
Carelli said, asshole!

174
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,413
Ha! Pitting two pig dealers
against each other.

175
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,681
Ah, sure.

176
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,849
Frank, are you sure
about this luau thing?

177
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,850
I mean, it's a ton of work.

178
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,019
Yeah. Does Charlie even
know what a luau is?

179
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,522
I doubt Charlie can even
say the word "luau."

180
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,808
I mean, how do you know that's
what he wants?

181
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,951
Because I read it in his dream book.

182
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,216
In his what? His dream book?

183
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,298
Yeah. Charlie keeps a book
of dreams and aspirations.

184
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:16,436
They're mostly in pictures
and symbols, but he has been

185
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,673
obsessing about this luau thing since
we met Duncan under the bridge.

186
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,342
Okay, now, my first instinct:

187
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,044
When you say things about
meeting people under bridges,

188
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,380
it's to, it's to berate you
for hanging out with people

189
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,253
under a bridge and to say to
you, "Why do you hang out with

190
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,625
these... with these people?
You and Charlie shouldn't be..."

191
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:35,388
But I'm not gonna say anything because
I don't want to be cynical anymore.

192
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,389
I'm not going to say anything.

193
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,725
I'm just...
Maybe the bridge is exciting.

194
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,393
No.
The bridge is awesome.

195
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,894
Ooh.
It's probably pretty cool.

196
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,397
Hold on a second. Hold.

197
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,766
Hey, it's the other pig guy.

198
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:52,939
Ah, so you come crawling back,
you cheap sack of shit.

199
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,561
Oh, you can't bring food into the theater.

200
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,660
No, I'm not. I bought it over there
with that food.

201
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,439
- No, you didn't.
- How do you know that?

202
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,575
Because we don't serve spaghetti...

203
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,528
and I just watched you walk in with it.

204
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,834
You call my bluff, sir.
I shall dispose of this ***

205
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:15,887
A moment, please.

206
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,623
Dee, do me a favor and pop
this in your purse real quick.

207
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,624
No, absolutely not.

208
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,059
No. Why do you have to
bring spaghetti...?

209
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,427
You caught me hankering for
spaghetti and I want it.

210
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,795
Just eat it, then.
Eat it fast and we'll go.

211
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,163
No, I want to enjoy it
and watch the movie.

212
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,631
It's going to make a mess in my purse.

213
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,767
I'm leaving because the spaghetti
is the whole deal for me.

214
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,836
Goddamn it. Just... Goddamn it.
Just put it in. Be careful.

215
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,370
You are... this is so stupid.

216
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,605
And there we go!

217
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,507
- Got rid of it.
- Great. Thank you.

218
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:36,908
Okay.
Look at this place, Dee.

219
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,727
Look at the size of the place.

220
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,913
What does 3-D even stand for?

221
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,415
Third dimension.

222
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:44,649
Just... please stop talking.

223
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:47,352
Third dimen...
What dimension are we in?

224
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,520
Shh! Charlie, I don't know.

225
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:49,521
Shh!

226
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,790
Isn't stuff, like,
supposed to pop out at us?

227
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:52,791
I don't know. I'm not sure.

228
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,693
Let's watch and find out, okay?
Whoa!

229
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:56,728
Did you see that?

230
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,296
Yeah. Yeah, I saw that.

231
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,098
That came, like, right at you.

232
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:00,766
Is this safe?

233
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,867
Are you kidding me?

234
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:02,868
I don't know.

235
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,870
Take the glasses off if
you're uncomfortable, okay?

236
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,738
But then everything's, like, blurry.

237
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,607
Then put the glasses
on and shut the hell up.

238
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,941
- Shh!
- You shh!

239
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,309
See, then, stuff's not safe.

240
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:12,377
Uh-oh.

241
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,578
Whoa.

242
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,947
What happened to my meatball?

243
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:16,948
Hey, would you shut up?

244
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,917
Oh, no, you know what happened?
When I...

245
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:21,052
- I bet it flew off when I...
- Okay, you are a sleuth.

246
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,788
You've gotten to the bottom of it.

247
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,122
That's very exciting.
Now shut up.

248
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,790
Let me just find it.

249
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,858
- I'm sorry, did you see a meatball...
- Charlie, sit down.

250
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:27,526
Oh, my God, Charlie.

251
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,194
I swear to God, if you don't sit
down and shut up and watch the

252
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:30,195
movie, I'm going to attack you.

253
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,197
I don't care how pregnant I am,
I am going to get out of this

254
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,198
seat, I'm going to attack you.

255
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,200
- I got it, got it, got it...
- Oh, you got it? Okay, good.

256
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,201
Sit down.

257
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,869
- Got the meatball.
- Sit down!

258
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:39,871
- Quiet down!
- The movie's boring.

259
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:40,539
You... You...!

260
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,508
How could you...
You're not watching the movie.

261
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,846
Ugh. Uh-uh.

262
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,681
Aah, you're not gonna like this.

263
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:50,682
What happened?

264
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,850
Ah, nuts.

265
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,686
Some-some spaghetti kind of like
spilled in your purse a little bit.

266
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,054
Oh, shit.
Want your spaghetti, Charlie?

267
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,389
Want your spaghetti?
Here's your spaghetti.

268
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:59,424
Oh, don't dump it on
the ground like that.

269
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:00,826
Shut up and watch the movie.

270
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,627
I don't want to shut up
and watch the movie.

271
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,462
Can't eat spaghetti,
can't follow the movie.

272
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,897
Doesn't make sense.
I'm going back to the bar.

273
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:06,598
Good. Good. Go to the bar.

274
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,033
- I'm taking the spaghetti with me.
- Excuse me.

275
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,034
Are you kidding me?

276
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,369
Are you kidding me?

277
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,007
Dude, I just saw another rat.

278
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:16,741
Yeah, I know.

279
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,276
There's definitely a ton of
rats in here, that's for sure.

280
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:20,212
I see him! I see him!
Oh, shit.

281
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,546
- We gotta distract him.
- Yeah.

282
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:22,981
I'll tell him the keg exploded.

283
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,649
No, that's a stupid idea.
That's a stupid idea.

284
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:25,650
We're going with the burst pipe.

285
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,097
Uh, I like the keg idea.

286
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,321
Your idea is so stupid...

287
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,051
Let's go with the burst pipe...

288
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,382
♪♪♪

289
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:32,891
Hey, Charlie, Charlie!

290
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,892
Charlie boy!

291
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,961
Hey, where'd you get
those glasses, bud?

292
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:36,928
Oh, these?

293
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:38,930
They're just, like, third
dimension glasses, you know?

294
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,633
Don't really work, though,
'cause I feel like I'm still

295
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,768
seeing stuff in whatever
dimension we live in.

296
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:47,505
Right. Well, listen, um, you can't really
go in the bar right now, bro.

297
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:48,273
Why not?

298
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:49,941
Well, because a keg exploded.

299
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:50,942
Holy shit. Can that happen?

300
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,312
A piece of metal flew off the keg
and hit Dennis right in the dick.

301
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,680
Holy shit. Are you okay?

302
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:57,716
Yeah... No, I-I'm fine.

303
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:58,884
I'm fine. I got lucky.

304
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,418
It mashed right into it.

305
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,254
We all thought he was gonna lose it.

306
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,256
Charlie, it lumped it up and
mangled it like a chicken

307
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:04,923
potpie down there.

308
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,558
Dickless Dennis.

309
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,993
That's what we should call
him now... Dickless Dennis.

310
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,561
No, no, no.
It's totally fine.

311
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,764
Oh, Dickless Dennis.

312
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:16,468
Oh, Dick... But it doesn't apply
because my totally went back to

313
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,636
normal, and it's fine now.

314
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,471
I'll show it to you.
I don't want to see it.

315
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,072
Anyway, moving on, how was the spa?

316
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,107
Spa?

317
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,175
Oh, spaghetti?

318
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,210
How's my spaghetti?

319
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:26,159
Dee threw it on the floor.

320
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,212
No, no, the spa.

321
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
The spa that Dee took you to.

322
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:30,015
Oh, no, she took me to a movie.

323
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,016
Yeah, it was lame.

324
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,783
I couldn't understand it.

325
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:32,884
Made no sense.

326
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,726
That cynical bitch.

327
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:40,692
Hello. I would like to redeem
this coupon and go ahead

328
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,060
and toss this one in the trash for me.

329
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,395
Busted!
Ah, see!

330
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:44,796
Oh, busted, Dee.
You're so busted.

331
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,865
What?
What are you guys doing here?

332
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,901
I'm taking Charlie to the
spa because he's stressed.

333
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,903
A keg exploded in the bar,
blew Dennis's dick off.

334
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,905
No, no...
Oh, it's a mess down there.

335
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,707
No, my...
My dick is fine, Dee.

336
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,708
Let me have those coupons.

337
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:57,709
No, you said I can have them.

338
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,878
Dee, you were supposed
to take Charlie.

339
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:01,646
Yeah, I tried to take Charlie,
but he refused to go.

340
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,082
What is your spaghetti policy here?

341
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,317
Are you hearing this?

342
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:06,284
Are you hearing this?

343
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,253
He doesn't belong in a
place like this, you guys.

344
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,921
Alright, come on,
we're wasting time.

345
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,257
Go get Duncan and the bridge
crew and bring them to the bar.

346
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,292
I'll occupy Charlie.
No.

347
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,962
Where's the robes?

348
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,735
I think this is it, right here.

349
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:25,337
This is sketchy as hell.

350
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,372
Yeah.

351
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:35,780
Hey, um, yeah, we're
looking for Duncan.

352
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,217
Oh, let's go.

353
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,486
Oh, yeah, we should take
that as a sign, right?

354
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:44,708
Yeah. Oh.

355
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,649
Come on.

356
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,609
Yeah?

357
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,696
Hey.

358
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:55,200
Hey. Hey.

359
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,202
You pregnant.

360
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,009
One more time.

361
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,011
What is happening in here?

362
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,245
I don't know.

363
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,614
Come on, no Alright, uh, Mr.
Duncan,

364
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,783
we were wondering if we
could talk to you about...

365
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,650
I ain't no Duncan.

366
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:15,253
It's this nigga right here about
to go level three and shit.

367
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:16,254
That's Duncan.

368
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:17,188
Oh... you're Duncan.

369
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,191
Uh, Mr. Duncan, we were wondering if you
could come to a surprise party for Charlie.

370
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,960
Who?
Charlie.

371
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,094
He's Frank's friend.

372
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,830
It's my understanding you guys have
all been hanging out under a bridge.

373
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:26,598
Oh, yeah, Frank.

374
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:27,799
I know that bitch.

375
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,335
Okay, hey, listen, Frank
mentioned that you might be

376
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:31,803
willing to...
Oh, shit!

377
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,339
Level three, son!
Yeah, level three!

378
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,709
This is bizarre, okay?

379
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,045
Charlie should not have anything
to do with these people.

380
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,679
No.
They are deranged.

381
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,681
You know what? Frank has too
much influence over this whole

382
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:44,682
thing, alright?

383
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,618
I think we gotta stop and think
about what Charlie wants.

384
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah, I think we need to get
our hands on Charlie's dream

385
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,789
book and we need to figure out
what that kid wants ourselves.

386
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:52,524
Mother pus bucket.

387
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,827
You piece of shit, you broke my wall!

388
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,662
We have company here.

389
00:13:59,065 --> 00:13:59,931
Should we call the police?

390
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,433
Oh, you know what, let's
just go, let's just go.

391
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,901
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's get the hell out of here.

392
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,570
Alright.

393
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:09,707
Charlie, let's go.

394
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:10,608
Get in here.

395
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,177
Oh, oh, oh.

396
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:15,580
Hey, guys, the management needs
everybody to get out, because

397
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:18,049
they caught a guy jerking off in
here and they're going to send

398
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:20,251
in a crew to wipe down the loads.

399
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,886
Go ahead, go on, let's go.

400
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,288
God, it's terrible.

401
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:25,290
It's really disgusting.

402
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:29,661
Get rid of all the strange dongs.

403
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,162
Ah.

404
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,131
Yeah, a little bit.

405
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,099
I don't get it, man.

406
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,701
What's so relaxing about sitting
around in a hot, wet room?

407
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,403
It's all about opening
up your pores, Charlie.

408
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:39,170
Yeah.

409
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,172
Yeah, take your robe off.

410
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,841
Yeah, that's it.

411
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:45,237
You got your clothes on.

412
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,805
- Get your clothes off.
- What? No.

413
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:48,990
I can't get naked in public.

414
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,549
Suit yourself, alright?

415
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:54,285
I am gonna roast like a pig.

416
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:55,873
OK, I'm gonna eat the spaghetti.

417
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,165
Oh, guys, guys, guys.

418
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,342
Hey, this is it.

419
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:05,945
Dram... Dram bak...
***

420
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,233
Yeah, look at this...
Pictures and symbols.

421
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,502
I don't see anything about
our stupid luau, but, uh...

422
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,036
This looks weird.

423
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,671
What is that?
What do you make of it, guys?

424
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:19,277
Looks like a drawing of a pair of
jeans, a plus sign and a chicken.

425
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:21,379
Denim... chicken.

426
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,047
Denim chicken.

427
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:26,584
Okay, guys, my gut is telling me
to throw this book in the trash.

428
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:27,952
Well, yeah.
It's absolute nonsense.

429
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,620
Uh-huh.

430
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,622
I think we're all feeling the
same thing, but I think we need

431
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:31,656
to fight that instinct.

432
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,925
We have to throw a party for Charlie.
It's so simple.

433
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:35,593
If we can't do that, what
does that say about us?

434
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,128
You're right, you're right.
This isn't about us.

435
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,530
Let's not be cynical.
Let's do what the kid wants.

436
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:41,966
Yeah. If he wants a worm...
hat... Worm hat.

437
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:42,634
Worm hat.

438
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,303
Okay, how do we get him a worm hat,
'cause I don't know what that is.

439
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,071
Maybe there's a drawing, or...
What is that?

440
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,740
- That's a bird with teeth.
- It sure is.

441
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:50,775
Okay, look, we don't have a
lot of time, so let's just

442
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,743
figure out the best we can do.

443
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,810
We can do it, we can do it.

444
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,279
Alright, we'll do these things.

445
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,314
We'll do these things, okay.

446
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,227
Dude, how much longer do
we have to stay in here?

447
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,481
Come on, just relax.

448
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,882
Take your clothes off.

449
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,484
I feel trapped in here, Frank.

450
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,385
Huh?

451
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm trapped like a rat.

452
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:14,490
Holy shit, I'm trapped
like a rat, aren't I?

453
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,392
- No, you're not, Charlie.
- I'm a rat in here.

454
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:17,393
I'm a rat!

455
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,095
I'm trapped like a...

456
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,030
I got to get out of here.

457
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:21,830
Calm down, Charlie.

458
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,433
I'm tired of being in weird places,
Frank, 'cause I'm trapped like a rat.

459
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,934
Calm down, Charlie, calm down.

460
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:27,269
- Relax.
- Okay, alright, alright.

461
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,604
I got to get out of here!
Now calm down.

462
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:29,338
How do I get this off?

463
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,008
Charlie, no, no.

464
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,309
Take it easy, Charlie.

465
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,244
Just bash me, Frank.

466
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,912
No, I'm not going to
bash you, Charlie.

467
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,880
Just bash me like a rat.

468
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,464
Bash me like a rat and get it over with.

469
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,496
Oh, sorry guys.

470
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,442
Just let me know when you're done.

471
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,609
I'm the guy who wipes down the loads.

472
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,032
I'm not wearing the stupid
thing, and that's it.

473
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,933
It's a lei.

474
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,835
Surprise!

475
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,437
What the shit is this?

476
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,471
Where's my luau?

477
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,473
Well, we went around you, Frank.
Yeah.

478
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,974
- Happy birthday, Charlie.
- Happy birthday.

479
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,309
Happy birthday?

480
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:11,346
Oh, is that why you guys were doing
all that weird shit with me today?

481
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,682
Yeah. We were trying to distract
you so we could plan your party.

482
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,250
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.

483
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,351
It's not my birthday, though.

484
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,886
Huh?
It's not your birthday?

485
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,756
Nope.
No, dicks, it's my birthday.

486
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:22,925
What?
Are you kidding me?

487
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:23,892
No, I'm not kidding you.

488
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Wait, wait a second.

489
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:28,063
Were you trying to get us to
plan your surprise party?

490
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,265
Why wouldn't you just
plan it yourself?

491
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,300
Well, that's lame.

492
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:35,370
I mean, this way I get my
surprise party and I give you

493
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:38,240
the satisfaction of doing
something nice for somebody.

494
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,542
Oh, my God.
That is not doing something nice.

495
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,177
That is tricking us.
Son of a bitch.

496
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:43,579
Where's Duncan?
Where's Dunc...?

497
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,114
You should not be hanging
out with Duncan.

498
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,682
You should not be associating
people like that.

499
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,783
I'm saying, I don't care.

500
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,817
It's coming out of my mouth.

501
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,786
Those weird bridge
people that are like...?

502
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,455
Yeah. All that, like,
Hawwoowin lauow?

503
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,124
I knew it, I knew he couldn't say it.

504
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,458
Luau, luau.
Luau.

505
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:57,226
What is it, you know?

506
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,861
I mean, it's the weird...
Hello?

507
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,462
Hang on.
Oh, yeah.

508
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,197
What do we got going
on over here, guys?

509
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,900
Okay, well, Charlie, when we
thought it was your birthday, we

510
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,802
went through your dream book and
we tried to recreate some of the

511
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,703
stuff we found in there.

512
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,972
Yes, that's... okay.

513
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,307
Um... denim chicken?

514
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,242
Yes!

515
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,443
Denim chicken.

516
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,545
Now I got to reroute the pig delivery.

517
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:17,379
Nobody gives a shit.

518
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,587
Okay.

519
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:21,389
And I'm assuming the
teeth are fake, yes?

520
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:24,359
Yes, well, they're not real
human teeth if that's what

521
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:25,160
you're asking.

522
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,764
No, I mean, did you discover a
bird with teeth in this fashion?

523
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,233
That does not exist in nature.
Okay.

524
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,501
I'm not sure about that.

525
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,069
But either way, good glue work.

526
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,938
Do any of you assholes
want to know how old I am?

527
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:37,839
Whatever, Frank.

528
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,601
Nobody... Alright so...
So, Charlie, this is my favorite part.

529
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,578
We weren't quite sure what
a worm hat was, right?

530
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:44,780
So we made a few of them.

531
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:45,947
This is the first one.

532
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,476
It's a hat made of worms, okay?

533
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:50,584
And then option number two
is a hat that you put on

534
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,133
and if you do that you look
like maybe you're a worm.

535
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,647
Right...And then the third one... and
this is the best one, Charlie...

536
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,994
is a hat for your worm.

537
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:02,230
Oh, your teeny tiny little worm gets a teeny
tiny little hat. If you want him to be fancy.

538
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,382
So which was is it? Which one were you
talking about? Yeah, who's right?

539
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,258
Well, I don't recall
every writing worm hat.

540
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:09,177
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was in
your dream book. Your...

541
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:11,387
Oh...
"Wormhat."

542
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,068
Yeah, that's a German guy.

543
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,000
His name is Hans Wormhat.

544
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,121
He appears in my dreams.

545
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,839
He drive a biplane and he shoots it
at me and I run through a field.

546
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,308
You know what, you guys blow.

547
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,176
I'm gonna go find Duncan.

548
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,145
Go, go!
Go!

549
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,415
Guys, wow, the denim chicken,
the bird with teeth,

550
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,317
Wormhat's worm hat.

551
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,285
I mean, I don't know what to say, man.

552
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,254
This is just what I needed today.

553
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,632
Guess what, buddy?
There's one more thing.

554
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,794
Is that what I think it is?

555
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,762
That's a new rat stick, dude.

556
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,198
And you can bash up a whole
bunch of rats with one quick

557
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,266
strike, so it's more humane.

558
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,282
Yeah?

559
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,037
Oh, man.

560
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,372
Well, what do you...?
Oh, you like it?

561
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,641
What do you think?
I love it.

562
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:54,976
I mean...
Ah.

563
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,579
I don't know what to say, 'cause
no one's ever really, um...

564
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,181
I don't know what to say, guys.

565
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,782
You don't have to say anything, man.

566
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,819
Maybe I could give it a quick
whirl around the basement and

567
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,954
see if I can kill a couple rats.

568
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,322
Yeah, absolutely.
You've earned it.

569
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,491
You should, you should.
Go bash 'em up, buddy.

570
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,095
Whoo!

571
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,779
What a life.

572
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:21,672
