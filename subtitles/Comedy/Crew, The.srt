1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,460
Flowery Road or Muddy Road. That is the question.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,200
The six members will experience two different lifestyles for three days.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,530
Some of them will walk on the luxurious Flowery Road.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,000
I've never seen this before.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
It's amazing.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,700
The others will walk on the Muddy Road that's rather simple.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Where should we sleep? Here?

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,430
Who walks on which road will be decided by the viewers' vote.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,060
And...

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,930
Let's be honest and tell if one of us has it.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,100
I don't have it.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,960
The situation keeps changing as they have a battle of wits.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,230
You can trust him.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,630
Me? You can't trust me.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,660
Who will get the transfer ticket?

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,500
The experience of two opposite lifestyles, Flower Crew.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,960
(Flower Crew)

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,130
(It's 9am at the SBS office in Mok-dong.)

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,160
- Byung Jae, thank you. - For what?

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,430
We're all here because of you.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
That's not true.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,560
- Please don't say that. - Thank you.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,000
- I'd like to bow deeply to you. - Please don't do that.

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,630
If it was true, I would've known. I found out when I read the news.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,060
In the pilot episode, Byung Jae said...

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,960
he had joined YG Entertainment but didn't get job offers.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,400
You haven't been on a TV show since you joined YG Entertainment.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,660
I rarely get offers now, and all my programmes failed.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
The president of YG Entertainment...

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,830
decided to produce a variety show to give Byung Jae an opportunity.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,900
YG Entertainment and SBS work together on this show.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,360
(Is it really because of Byung Jae?)

33
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,500
I wish he hadn't put it like that.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm under a lot of pressure.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,130
I don't think what he said is true.

36
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,200
Actually, even though they said it happened all because of me,

37
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,700
some of them think that they should get the credit.

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,530
- You know new members will join. - That's right.

39
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,460
We asked you, the founding contributors, to gather today...

40
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,300
without the new members for a reason.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,700
- Is that so? - Yes.

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,330
"Founding contributor" is too much to describe us.

43
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,230
Are we going to get it already?

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,860
These are the transfer tickets that you really like.

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,400
(The special transfer tickets for the founding contributors are here.)

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,400
You can send anyone including yourself to the other road.

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,660
I'll use my transfer ticket. Byung Jae, go to the Muddy Road.

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,700
(The transfer ticket creates twists.)

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,000
I didn't expect this at all.

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,070
(Who will be the first to get the transfer ticket?)

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,900
The colour is different.

52
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,160
- It's silver. - It was gold colour last time.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,430
The gold one allows you to move...

54
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,860
anyone including you to the other road.

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,330
The silver one allows you to move anyone except for you.

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,230
- Can we still get a gold one? - Yes.

57
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,530
If I'm on the Flowery Road and have the silver ticket,

58
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,330
- I can choose anyone to join me. - That's right.

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,060
Why are you giving this to us now?

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,530
We're giving you a gift as you worked hard for the pilot episode.

61
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,900
- You should give it to all of us. - Hold on.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,960
- Is that all we get... - Yes.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
- for all the efforts we made? - Yes.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,900
- Let's leave the show. - I think we should.

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,360
They're treating us like beggars.

66
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,760
You should let us go on the Flowery Road on our way...

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,660
- to the destination, at least. - That's right.

68
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,900
We deserve a little advantage.

69
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,660
We deserve a lot of advantages.

70
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,460
- We went through such hardship. - Exactly.

71
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,130
We even slept in the rain.

72
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,200
So, which one of you will pick first?

73
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,300
- Are you not listening to us? - That's not what we're saying.

74
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,800
That's not what we're saying.

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,830
- We can refuse this. - Of course.

76
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,430
- We can just refuse to pick one. - Right.

77
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,160
- Then, I'll go first. - I'll pick one, too.

78
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,730
Gosh. How could you?

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,700
- I'll put this here. - Okay.

80
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,460
Let's decide who will go first. Please sit down.

81
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,230
Hold on. Before we decide...

82
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,700
- You said we deserve more. Gosh. - I mean...

83
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,760
Please choose carefully and show it to the camera.

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,930
(Jung Hwan chooses a ticket carefully.)

85
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,000
- The order doesn't matter. - Okay.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,930
Now, let's decide who will go next.

87
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,560
(He seems disappointed.)

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,630
- I'll be back. - I feel sorry.

89
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,330
- Did you pick the transfer ticket? - Yes. I'm sorry.

90
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,530
I can't move to the other road with the silver ticket, right?

91
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,900
- Can we hand it over? - Yes, you can.

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,030
(They can hand over both the gold and silver transfer tickets.)

93
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,430
That's an old-fashioned comedy act.

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,900
This is the one.

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,700
They will edit it out anyway.

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,730
(He looks happy.)

97
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't do it.

98
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,730
Even the writer pretended to be surprised...

99
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,560
when you showed it to the crew.

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't pretend. I don't even want to know what it is.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,460
- You hurt my feelings. - Stop it.

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,730
- They're all so greedy. - Jung Hwan, you picked it, right?

103
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,260
- Yes. - I picked one, too.

104
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,400
- Me, too. - We all picked the transfer ticket.

105
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,100
(Who will be the first one to have the silver transfer ticket?)

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,230
(At that moment, a car approaches the building.)

107
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,760
(Who is getting out of the car?)

108
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,900
Hello.

109
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,460
(Eun Ji Won, the expert for a travelling variety show)

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you not worried at all?

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,530
The people around me told me that it'd be very exhausting.

112
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,400
I was so worried that I didn't even watch the pilot episode.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,230
- You didn't even watch the show? - No. I thought that'd be better.

114
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,060
(The other new member arrives, as well.)

115
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,330
Hello.

116
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,600
(Lee Jae Jin, the peculiar, grumpy guy)

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,030
Did you sleep well?

118
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,400
No, I was too nervous to sleep.

119
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,830
Why were you nervous?

120
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,200
Because I didn't know much about this show.

121
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,700
I watched the pilot episode.

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,460
Did you watch it?

123
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,660
Even if you start on the Flowery Road, you can go to the Muddy Road.

124
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,530
If Ji Won is on the Muddy Road,

125
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,330
he can move to the Flowery Road and send me to the Muddy Road.

126
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,230
- Why would you think I'll do that? - It can happen.

127
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
We should help each other to go to the Flowery Road.

128
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,230
Oh, we can be allies.

129
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,800
- We should help each other out. - They worked together in pairs.

130
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,700
- Hi. - Hello.

131
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

132
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,130
- You don't need to stand up. - Hello.

133
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,700
- I'm happy to work with you. - Me, too.

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,630
When Sae Ho was called by his stage name "Cabbage",

135
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,060
he once interviewed me.

136
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,730
- He said he really liked my sister. - Really?

137
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,360
- He said he wanted to date her. - Eun Ju?

138
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,500
- You liked Yang Hyun Suk's wife? - Is that true?

139
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,430
- Did I say that? - Did you say you liked...

140
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,330
- Eun Ju? - Sae Ho even knew...

141
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,700
You liked the wife of the president of YG Entertainment?

142
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,060
Back then,

143
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,160
Eun Ju's group was very popular.

144
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,030
She was also famous as Jae Jin's little sister.

145
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,460
You mean you had a crush on her, right?

146
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,830
- I think he was just a fan. - I was a fan of hers.

147
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,230
- I don't think that's the case. - I was her fan.

148
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,500
- Look at his eyes. - No way.

149
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,160
- He looks like he still likes her. - That can't be true.

150
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,000
I said I liked her as her fan, right?

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
I think Jang Hoon is right.

152
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,500
(Sae Ho is knocked down.)

153
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,930
He asked me to tell my sister.

154
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,430
- Did you tell her how I felt? - Yes.

155
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,130
How did she react?

156
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,860
She didn't seem very happy.

157
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,600
She didn't take it seriously.

158
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,430
"Don't say that."

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,460
I'll see you on another programme.

160
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,500
That was unexpected.

161
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,830
(Jae Jin attacks the other members once he joins the group.)

162
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,430
- Jae Jin, did you watch the pilot? - Yes, I did.

163
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,000
I could see the role of each member.

164
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,800
- Please tell us. - I'm curious.

165
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,930
- Jang Hoon is tall. - Jang Hoon is tall?

166
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,600
Being tall is his role?

167
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,930
What does that mean?

168
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you mean he's like Daddy-Long-Legs?

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- That's a unique interpretation. - Byung Jae...

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,630
Byung Jae grows a beard.

171
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
His role is growing a beard?

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,430
- Growing a beard? - That's so funny.

173
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,960
- Sae Ho is a funny man. - Thank you.

174
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,830
- Being funny is his role? - Lastly, Jung Hwan...

175
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,830
accompanies Jang Hoon...

176
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,160
so Jang Hoon doesn't feel lonely.

177
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,300
People around me told me that it'd be very exhausting.

178
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,960
Come on, you're an expert for a variety show like this.

179
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,800
The working environment must be poorer than "One Night Two Days".

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,830
I heard a cameraman talking to himself quietly...

181
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,400
that "The Law of Jungle" would be better than this show.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
It's true.

183
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,360
"I should've joined 'The Law of Jungle' instead of this."

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,130
I couldn't watch the pilot as everyone said something like this.

185
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,930
I appeared on "The Law of Jungle", but this show is much harder.

186
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,100
They travel for about 10 days on "The Law of Jungle",

187
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,430
but we travel for only three days on this show.

188
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,300
We have to do everything they do in 10 days in only 3 days.

189
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,660
- It's extreme. - It's as hard as their 10-day trip.

190
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,100
On "The Law of Jungle",

191
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,230
they have to find food when they're hungry and rest when they're tired.

192
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,030
You have to keep thinking how to get the transfer ticket.

193
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,360
Ji Won, can you handle dirty places?

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
- Dirty places? - Yes.

195
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,430
- I don't understand... - For instance,

196
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,630
you get accommodation on a trip on this show.

197
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,000
You can't use water in there, and there are a lot of bugs.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,360
- Imagine that kind of place. - It smells bad, too.

199
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,730
Should I join "One Night Two Days"?

200
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,060
Maybe, I should go back to "One Night Two Days".

201
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,600
Ji Won and Jae Jin, are you two close?

202
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,200
Of course, we are.

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,200
It'd be weird if they weren't.

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,730
How can the producer say that? You cast them.

205
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,130
- How can you even ask that? - I mean...

206
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,930
they haven't worked together in a long time.

207
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,160
It's like asking Jung Hwan if he's close with his son.

208
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,700
(At the previous interview)

209
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,360
Do you think Jae Jin will listen to you?

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,230
I'd be the only one he listens to.

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,530
(Ji Won is full of confidence.)

212
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,760
He won't listen to anyone else.

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,060
I'm sure that I can control him. He'll listen to me.

214
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,430
It seems you trust Ji Won.

215
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,060
Well, yes. I mean, I don't trust him completely.

216
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,970
Right. Ji Won said you would follow him no matter what.

217
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,130
- Did he say that? - Yes.

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,660
- Why does he think like that? - Exactly.

219
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,500
(How will their chemistry be?)

220
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,260
(He dangles the fish.)

221
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,630
- Hey! Gosh. Why would you do that? - I'm sorry.

222
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,000
- Keep that away from me! - Okay. I won't do it again.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,060
(They act like actual brothers.)

224
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm starting to worry. Jae Jin is getting used to this.

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,630
(Jae Jin adjusts to a variety show amazingly quickly.)

226
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,060
I really don't want to sleep in a deserted house.

227
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,530
(Flower Crew)

228
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,360
(The production media conference begins at 11am.)

229
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,900
(Many reporters attended the event with keen interest in Flower Crew.)

230
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,860
(About 100 reporters are seated.)

231
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,060
Now, we'll begin the production media conference...

232
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,660
of SBS' new variety show, "Flower Crew".

233
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,630
- Please welcome the cast members. - Hello.

234
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,830
Please give them a round of applause.

235
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,830
- Hello. It's nice to meet you all. - Please sit here.

236
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,900
- Hello. - You look cool.

237
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,400
(Ji Won and Jae Jin look nervous, as well.)

238
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,060
(It's time to take a group picture to celebrate the start of the show.)

239
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,630
That's a nice pose. Please look to your right this time.

240
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,360
- To your right. Thank you. - Flower Crew.

241
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,900
- Jang Hoon, please pose for them. - Thank you.

242
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,530
What pose should we strike?

243
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,560
Please lift your hands up.

244
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,400
It's not like an election campaign.

245
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,000
That's good. Thank you.

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,230
- Personally... - Please go on.

247
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,930
- my favourite card is January Card. - I see.

248
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,930
So I'll pose like a crane.

249
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,530
(He imitates the crane in the January Card.)

250
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,660
- Oh, wow. - That's brilliant.

251
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,530
That's great.

252
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,400
Here we go. In 1, 2, 3. Action.

253
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,700
(Everybody, freeze.)

254
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
You're the best.

255
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,630
That's a good pose. Everyone will...

256
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,500
take this pose later.

257
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,400
Hey, that's the famous contortionist's signature pose.

258
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,660
No, his signature pose is this.

259
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,430
I see. It's different from the contortionist's pose.

260
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,660
I can tell the difference.

261
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,760
That's great.

262
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,530
Ji Won used to be a cast member of...

263
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,730
Should I call it a travelling variety show?

264
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,000
- A travelling variety show? - We travel around on this show.

265
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,660
Since he appeared on that kind of show,

266
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,760
I rely greatly on Ji Won.

267
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,800
After watching the preview of the pilot episode...

268
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,460
- I thought... - You mean, "rerun".

269
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,960
- That's right. It was a mistake. - How can we...

270
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,430
watch the preview?

271
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,530
Because I watched the pilot,

272
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,430
I'm not worried a lot.

273
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,260
Thanks to Byung Jae,

274
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,400
this show became a regular series.

275
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,460
I'd like to thank Byung Jae.

276
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,060
I was surprised by how the news reports explained it.

277
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm grateful for his consideration,

278
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,630
but I would be more grateful if he had kept it a secret.

279
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,100
He told that to everyone.

280
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,930
If he wants to help the artists in his agency,

281
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,160
I think he should help the singers release a new album sooner.

282
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,230
(Byung Jae criticises his agency owner.)

283
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,900
Now, we'll begin the very first vote...

284
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,460
right here.

285
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,100
- Do the reporters vote? - Yes.

286
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,230
The reporters will decide...

287
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,560
the fate of the six members.

288
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,160
- They are real reporters, right? - Yes, they are.

289
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
(You're lucky to have them here.)

290
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,860
- We're lucky to have them here. - My goodness.

291
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,860
Let's begin. Now, please vote...

292
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,060
for the person who you think would be...

293
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,930
the funniest among the six members...

294
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,600
if he's on the Muddy Road.

295
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,230
Would you not mind that we all know your faces?

296
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,900
I'll remember you.

297
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,860
The first destination...

298
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,730
where the members will...

299
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,760
experience two different lifestyles is Namhae.

300
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,600
The Flowery Road Team will...

301
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,260
stay in a high-end private holiday house...

302
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,500
with an ocean view that celebrities love.

303
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,560
(The Flower Road Team will stay at a private holiday house.)

304
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
The Muddy Road Team will...

305
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,260
stay in a cosy country house...

306
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,600
with a lovely vegetable garden.

307
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,930
Is it really lovely?

308
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,460
Does anyone live in that house?

309
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,000
Everyone has his different point of view.

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,560
The Flowery Road Team will...

311
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,160
go there by plane...

312
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,260
(They'll go to Namhae by plane.)

313
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,230
while the Muddy Road Team will...

314
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,700
drive a small car all the way down to the place.

315
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,960
You have to arrive at the live show spot at 9pm.

316
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,160
(The person chosen by the reporters picks the Muddy Road Team members.)

317
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,960
- Isn't it 400km to get there? - Can he fit in a small car?

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,100
(It would be a problem.)

319
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,330
I assume that the reporters are...

320
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,560
trying to choose a person who would make the situations funny.

321
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,700
- Goodness. - Please...

322
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,930
- Please don't say... - If he's in a small car,

323
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,130
- things like that. - no one else could fit in the car.

324
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,500
- That's true. - No one could travel with him.

325
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
If I become the Muddy Road Team leader, I'll pick you for my team.

326
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,930
No one would fit in the car.

327
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,460
I know. So don't say such a thing.

328
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,960
It makes me worry.

329
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,730
(Everyone, wake up.)

330
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,800
To help you make a decision,

331
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,700
we'll show you...

332
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,700
the accommodation for both teams.

333
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,960
We'll show it only to the reporters.

334
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,500
First up is the accommodation for the Flowery Road Team.

335
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,860
(The Flowery Road Team's accommodation will be revealed.)

336
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
(It's a luxurious resort located in Namhae.)

337
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,000
Is it that good?

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,860
(The reporters are impressed.)

339
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,200
(It's a luxurious, high-end resort.)

340
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
- We can take turns. - It takes hours by car.

341
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,060
(Bae Yong Joon and Park Soo Jin stayed here for their honeymoon.)

342
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
(It looks amazing.)

343
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,860
(He's curious.)

344
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,630
(The members are frustrated as they can't see it.)

345
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,630
Up next is the accommodation for the Muddy Road Team.

346
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
What is it?

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,100
(The reporters burst out laughing once they see the house.)

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,860
(What kind of place could it be?)

349
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,100
(Everyone bursts out laughing.)

350
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,330
(All they can see is the reporters' reaction.)

351
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,330
What we can learn from this is...

352
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,200
people feel happy when they see others unfortunate.

353
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,760
We'll begin the vote now.

354
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,400
- You will vote by a show of hands. - By a show of hands?

355
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,330
- Didn't you prepare a ballot box? - They'll vote by a show of hands?

356
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,130
We pursue transparency in voting.

357
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,900
Before that, we have something to give the cast members.

358
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,300
Please put on a blindfold.

359
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,060
(The members are given a blindfold.)

360
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,760
This is to avoid making eye contact with the reporters raising a hand.

361
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,000
We'll give each of you to say a word to the reporters...

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,900
to convince them.

363
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,900
I was diagnosed with anal fistula two weeks ago.

364
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,700
I'll have the surgery in the beginning of next month,

365
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,060
and I need to take a hip bath every day.

366
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,830
Please take it into consideration.

367
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,560
Many people say that Flower Crew became series...

368
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
because of Yoo Byung Jae.

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,160
It was on a news report.

370
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,760
That's all I have to say.

371
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I wouldn't mind whether you will select me or not.

372
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,660
Please stick to your decision.

373
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
I have faith...

374
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,060
in your transparency.

375
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,260
(I knew it.)

376
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,960
You are not just ordinary reporters.

377
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,160
Since you're entertainment reporters,

378
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm sure you are all very intelligent.

379
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,330
I believe...

380
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,100
you will not vote...

381
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,860
for a typical idea that it'd be funny if I ride in a small car.

382
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,560
- You haven't done it before. - That's not true.

383
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,900
- I did it a lot. - On what TV show?

384
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,260
You can find it somewhere.

385
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,600
I truly believe that such intelligent reporters like you...

386
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,960
would never make a decision like that.

387
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,130
I hope...

388
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,200
that Jang Hoon will be...

389
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,670
chosen as the Muddy Road Team leader.

390
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,730
(He's so peculiar.)

391
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,960
I really want to see him...

392
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,560
crouching in a small car.

393
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,130
I would be angry if someone else had said that.

394
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm holding it back because it was you...

395
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,760
because you're under YG Entertainment.

396
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,100
Everyone, please put on a blindfold.

397
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,630
If you want Byung Jae to be the Muddy Road Team leader,

398
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,900
please lift your picket.

399
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,130
(Many reporters vote for Byung Jae.)

400
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,630
Byung Jae, please take off your blindfold.

401
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,400
Do we get to see the result?

402
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,000
(Byung Jae has 16 votes.)

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,060
- You should be nervous. - Really?

404
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,230
That's all.

405
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,700
It's all good, but could you pick up the pace?

406
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,860
I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack.

407
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,360
- Would you like to go first? - No. I might get the most of votes.

408
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,500
Thank you for coming out of your busy schedule.

409
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,000
If you want him to be the Muddy Road Team member,

410
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,730
please raise your picket.

411
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,860
(He's startled.)

412
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,260
I guess I didn't get a lot of votes.

413
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,330
(How many votes did Sae Ho get?)

414
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,730
Now, Sae Ho, please take off your blindfold.

415
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,930
(He takes off his blindfold nervously.)

416
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,960
(Sae Ho has two votes.)

417
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,170
(He smiles.)

418
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,460
(He's adorable.)

419
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,500
If you think Jung Hwan would be a good leader of Muddy Road Team,

420
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,400
please raise your picket.

421
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,930
(Many reporters vote for Jung Hwan.)

422
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,860
(Jung Hwan might be chosen as the Muddy Road Team leader.)

423
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,030
I think a lot of them voted for me.

424
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,700
Jung Hwan, please take off your blindfold.

425
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,260
(How many votes did Jung Hwan get?)

426
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,060
(Jung Hwan won seven votes.)

427
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,100
Great.

428
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,230
The media of Korea is transparent.

429
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,800
You are absolutely right.

430
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,230
- They're fair-minded. - Is that so?

431
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,100
Now, Jang Hoon, please stand up.

432
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,930
(He's a strong candidate for the Muddy Road Team leader.)

433
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,900
If you think he'd make a great leader of the Muddy Road Team,

434
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
please raise your picket.

435
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,930
(Will he win more than Byung Jae?)

436
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,460
(He won the most of the votes.)

437
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,200
(I have a bad feeling.)

438
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,130
We're lucky to have a member who would take up the hard part.

439
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,260
(People feel happy when they see others unfortunate.)

440
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,560
Jang Hoon, please take off your blindfold.

441
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,700
(Jang Hoon is taking off his blindfold to see the result.)

442
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
- They're voting for the leader. - Hold on.

443
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
(I'm sorry, Jang Hoon.)

444
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,800
The leader will choose his team members.

445
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,500
(His prediction was right.)

446
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,760
I'll memorise each one of the reporters who voted for me.

447
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,860
(He wants my revenge.)

448
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,100
(Oh, my goodness.)

449
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm very impressed to see the reporters...

450
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
typing with their right hands while holding the picket with the other.

451
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,530
That's impressive.

452
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,530
(They're professional.)

453
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,230
If you think Ji Won would be a great Muddy Road Team leader...

454
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,170
Jae Jin, please take off your blindfold.

455
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,300
(Jae Jin won six votes.)

456
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,230
I'll announce the result of the vote.

457
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,260
(Who did the reporters choose as the Muddy Road Team leader?)

458
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,630
The Muddy Road Team leader chosen by the reporters is...

459
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,430
Jang Hoon who won 44 votes.

460
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,530
(Jang Hoon is the Muddy Road Team leader.)

461
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,000
Isn't that the same as your age?

462
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,200
(Congratulations!)

463
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,060
The number of the votes is the same as his age.

464
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,530
(Jang Hoon is 43 years old. He won 1 more vote than his age.)

465
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,670
(He sighs.)

466
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm not sure, but I don't think...

467
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,230
the reporters who are here today...

468
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,670
have a similar sense of humour to me.

469
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,260
I'll drive all the way to Namhae.

470
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,430
It takes about six hours by car...

471
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,170
except for the time at rest areas.

472
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,230
- Thank you. Be quiet. - You like driving.

473
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,560
I get to choose the other two members, right?

474
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,860
That's right. You will choose the other members...

475
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,670
of the Muddy Road Team as the leader.

476
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,900
(Who will join the Muddy Road Team?)

477
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,800
(It's 12:30pm. It's time to select the members of the Muddy Road Team.)

478
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,930
(The six members are headed to the parking lot.)

479
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,030
Oh, that's the car.

480
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,200
(Sae Ho found something.)

481
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,330
(There are two vehicles waiting in the parking lot.)

482
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,460
Oh, that's the car.

483
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,730
(Jang Hoon looks sad.)

484
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,630
- If you keep acting up... - I'm sorry.

485
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,670
This is the car?

486
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,630
- I can't believe this. - I wouldn't mind the car,

487
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,930
but should we really do this outside?

488
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,030
- I'm feeling so hot. - You should be in front of the car.

489
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,060
Let's finish this quickly.

490
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,000
Ji Won!

491
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,030
(Everyone except for Ji Won gathered.)

492
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,900
- It's hot. - It's too hot.

493
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,530
Ji Won didn't leave the show, right?

494
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Is he coming?

495
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,400
There he comes.

496
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,830
Where have you been?

497
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,460
I didn't know I shouldn't change my clothes.

498
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,530
(He's late because he tried to change his clothes.)

499
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,800
The Muddy Road Team leader, Jang Hoon, will...

500
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,670
choose two members and get in the car with them.

501
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,730
Are you going to set off right after this?

502
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,730
Yes. The Muddy Road Team rides in the small car on the right.

503
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,130
We'll take the Flowery Road Team to the airport.

504
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,930
I'll choose quickly as it's really hot.

505
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
The first member I chose to travel...

506
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,830
- with me... - It's so hot.

507
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,630
to the faraway place in this small car...

508
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,860
as a member of the Muddy Road Team is...

509
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,060
Eun Ji Won.

510
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,730
(Jang Hoon chose Ji Won.)

511
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,060
It's Eun Ji Won.

512
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,160
(Ji Won goes on the Muddy Road for his first trip on the show.)

513
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,460
- The reason is... - He didn't choose me.

514
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,560
I'll tell you the reason.

515
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,360
- You'll be on my team. - Why?

516
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,030
I didn't mean to choose Ji Won.

517
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,000
But as you know, I hate feeling hot.

518
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,260
He made me wait here for too long.

519
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,430
(The reason is because Ji Won made him wait here.)

520
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm sweating a lot.

521
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,060
That is the only reason I chose him.

522
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,730
I'll announce the second member of the Muddy Road Team.

523
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,930
I didn't want to choose this member, either.

524
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,160
But something unexpected happened and it made me choose him.

525
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,460
I went to the restroom earlier.

526
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,160
Someone did number two...

527
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,830
and came out of the toilet.

528
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,730
When I went in the toilet after him, it smelled really bad.

529
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,230
- Who is that? - Please come to us.

530
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,830
(He has to join the team.)

531
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,730
Are you talking about me?

532
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,430
This isn't fair. I had a stomachache.

533
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,930
How can that be a reason?

534
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,960
- That's the only reason. - Goodness.

535
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,630
For those reasons,

536
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,200
Ji Won and Sae Ho have been chosen as Muddy Road Team members.

537
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,430
(The Muddy Road Team members have been chosen.)

538
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,800
Now, it's time to draw the transfer ticket.

539
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,360
With this gold transfer ticket,

540
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,130
you can send anyone including yourself...

541
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,100
- to the other team. - That sounds great.

542
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,760
However, you can't use it when all members are in one team.

543
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,360
I think it'd be funny if Jang Hoon drives all by himself to Namhae.

544
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,430
That's possible. You can use it as long as both teams have members.

545
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,930
- Let's begin. - Okay.

546
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,460
The Muddy Road Team members will pick first.

547
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,560
It would be nice to drive a car for seven hours by yourself.

548
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,460
That would be unbelievable.

549
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,900
(How will Jang Hoon's fate turn out?)

550
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,760
- You'll have another chance later. - How do we sleep together?

551
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,400
(He looks unhappy.)

552
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,730
Look at his face. He didn't get the ticket.

553
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,060
- I know you well. - I'm keeping a poker face.

554
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,300
I know you can't keep a poker face.

555
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
I know you.

556
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,660
- We don't have to. - I see.

557
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,230
- We can rest after buying tickets. - We can just enjoy the trip.

558
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,930
- It'd be nice to take a rest. - We can have a meal there, too.

559
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,960
(He's covering it.)

560
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm glad we can take a rest.

561
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,300
Ji Won failed, too.

562
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,830
It's written all over your face.

563
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,530
It's so hard to keep a poker face.

564
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,730
Is that so?

565
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,860
(It's Sae Ho's turn to pick.)

566
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,960
- It's hard to keep a poker face. - This is my first time,

567
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,730
so I don't know what to expect.

568
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,860
You must have no idea now, but once you see your accommodation,

569
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,060
you will realise the importance of the transfer ticket.

570
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,330
(He's surprised.)

571
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,630
Sae Ho, I know you failed. Come back.

572
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,830
I know you failed. Come back.

573
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,100
(Could Jung Hwan's prediction be right?)

574
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,630
Come back in the position. Be careful not to drop your jacket.

575
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,760
(Byung Jae picks one, too.)

576
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,560
If Ji Won has the transfer ticket, he can join the other team.

577
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
We'll do this again at night.

578
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,830
Did you see what it is?

579
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,860
Yes.

580
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,030
I checked it.

581
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,760
I'll show just a part of it.

582
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,730
You're determined to see it.

583
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,860
(Did Jae Jin pick the transfer ticket?)

584
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,030
I think he failed.

585
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,730
- I know Jae Jin. He failed. - He failed?

586
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,260
(Jung Hwan picks one, too.)

587
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,400
I have a feeling that this isn't it.

588
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,130
(So the six members' draw continues.)

589
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,930
This is driving me crazy.

590
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,560
It's a big twist.

591
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,900
I can't believe this is happening.

592
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,830
I'm exhausted.

593
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,360
This is awesome.

594
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,400
(Who has the transfer ticket?)

595
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,230
Now, we'll give you the money.

596
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,300
The Flowery Road Team gets 100 dollars...

597
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,060
while the Muddy Road Team gets only 10 dollars.

598
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,260
- For all of us? - Per person?

599
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,960
No, it's for the team.

600
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,330
What if they run out of gas?

601
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,000
- I think... - What about the gas?

602
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,330
What about the road toll fees?

603
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,530
We'll give you that separately.

604
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,060
(The crew pays for the road toll fees.)

605
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,330
- You have to be careful. - We'll give you right away.

606
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,260
Driving there might be harder than sleeping in an old house.

607
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,660
- It might be better to use it now. - The traffic will be bad.

608
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,400
- Exactly. - You should use it now.

609
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,060
- I'll get in the car. - Can I use the transfer ticket now?

610
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,800
- Okay. I can use it now, right? - Yes. Are you going to use it now?

611
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,230
- I was disappointed... - You're lying. Just get in the car.

612
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,830
I was disappointed in Jung Hwan.

613
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,730
- Why? - I was on the Flowery Road,

614
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,730
- but he sent me to the Muddy Road. - That's right.

615
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,260
Hey, Sae Ho.

616
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,660
(It was the last night of their trip in the pilot episode.)

617
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,000
Hey, Sae Ho. Come here right now.

618
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,730
You should be here. What are you doing there?

619
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,330
Are you serious? Is this not a joke?

620
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,730
(So he stayed in the accommodation for two nights in a row.)

621
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,630
Jang Hoon would've slept there all by himself if I hadn't done it.

622
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,160
- I had no choice. - The car is too small.

623
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,530
- Ji Won is right. - I know, but I want him to join us.

624
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,800
- Hold on. - Do you have it? I have one, too.

625
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,630
- I can show it to them, right? - What is this?

626
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,000
- Show us if you're going to use it. - I really have it.

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,630
(Does Sae Ho really have the transfer ticket?)

628
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
I really have it.

629
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,260
(He really has it.)

630
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,800
- Oh, that's how it's marked. - Yes. I have it.

631
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,900
(He picked the silver transfer ticket at the first draw.)

632
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,000
(He looks happy.)

633
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,960
- The car is too small. - I'll use it...

634
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,930
Sae Ho, forget it. The car is too small.

635
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,930
Let's go. Get in the car unless you'll send me to that team.

636
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,960
Will you send me to that team?

637
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,400
Will you?

638
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,200
- Do you want to go there by plane? - Yes.

639
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,560
But you teased me earlier.

640
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,960
I said the truth. What is your decision?

641
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
- I won't let you go. - Get in the car.

642
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,000
- Why do you... - We have to...

643
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,130
Use it later.

644
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,430
We have to save money for a plane ticket,

645
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,230
and I'd like to celebrate the start of the show.

646
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,460
It'll be pointless to use this later.

647
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,000
I just came back from Brazil. I'm still jet-lagged.

648
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,960
How can I... I'd rather go back to Brazil.

649
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,260
Sae Ho, I'm going to have the surgery.

650
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,330
- Sae Ho, listen. - Don't use it now.

651
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,060
- Four people are too many. - Gosh.

652
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,530
Four people can't fit in a small car. Why would you do that?

653
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,800
It's not like you can transfer to the other team.

654
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,330
- You should be really careful. - Sae Ho.

655
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,360
You can transfer me to the Flowery Road Team later.

656
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,060
- I'll keep it. - Why would I let you keep it?

657
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,730
I'll keep it for you.

658
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,730
- Okay, then. Take this... - Okay.

659
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,930
and let's get in the car.

660
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,530
(He's angry.)

661
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,030
That's so funny.

662
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,300
I just came back from Brazil.

663
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,830
Byung Jae and Jae Jin need to get to know each other,

664
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
and Jang Hoon needs you.

665
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,400
I couldn't even sleep. How could you do this to me?

666
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,530
I didn't choose him, but you brought him here.

667
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,630
- I did what I could. - You are so mean.

668
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
(He opens the car door and looks inside of the car.)

669
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,730
Let's go now.

670
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm feeling so hot. Let's hurry up.

671
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,200
(I hate you.)

672
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,230
I'm so angry.

673
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
(No wonder he's angry as they all have to ride in the small car.)

674
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,430
- Hey. - Jung Hwan.

675
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,530
You made me leave the hotel while I was enjoying wine.

676
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,630
- Let's go now. - Okay.

677
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,360
We'll get going now.

678
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,430
- Flower Crew. - Flower Crew.

679
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,630
(Flower Crew)

680
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,630
- Let's go. - Okay.

681
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,860
- We have only 10 dollars! - I forgot about that.

682
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,400
(It was only the beginning of the tragedy.)

683
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,160
I will never forget this.

684
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,100
I'll even tell my son about the pain you put me through.

685
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,430
- I was on the Flowery Road Team. - I didn't mean that.

686
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,660
Why would you be angry? You asked me that.

687
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,530
How dare you said that?

688
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,860
I surrender.

689
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
(It was only the beginning of the hardship.)

690
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,530
It's completely different.

691
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,330
They're 4 people while we're only 2. It's great.

692
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,300
There are news reports on...

693
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,930
the production media conference. I look like an idol singer.

694
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,430
- It's a good photo. - We look like an idol group.

695
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,600
(We just debuted.)

696
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm 38 years old, too.

697
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,100
Are you meticulous?

698
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,330
I saved my energy for Muddy Road.

699
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,730
That's how you prepared for the programme.

700
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,600
I even brought a big pillow to hug when I sleep on the ground.

701
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,130
(He brought a big pillow for Muddy Road.)

702
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,930
I brought spare batteries just in case.

703
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,300
(He brought a big pillow and spare batteries for Muddy Road.)

704
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,230
(He is taking out the batteries.)

705
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,330
You brought a lot of items.

706
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,500
I also brought a fan in case it gets hot.

707
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,700
I brought 4 batteries and 3 propellers.

708
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,230
This is incredible.

709
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,860
How fascinating!

710
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,130
- It's very cooling. - It is.

711
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,560
I came prepared.

712
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,330
You prepared for Muddy Road.

713
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,700
- Yes, I did. - Really?

714
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,960
- Hello. - Do you have your ID card?

715
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,300
No, I don't have it.

716
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,330
What should I do?

717
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,200
I didn't imagine I would get on a flight.

718
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,030
- Can you board a plane without one? - No, you can't.

719
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,830
My manager went to my house, but I don't know where I put my wallet.

720
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,330
Where did I put my wallet?

721
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,200
(Will they board a plane without a problem?)

722
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,700
Be on alert. I haven't driven in a long while.

723
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,130
This car is nice. The ceiling is high.

724
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,130
It's perfect for you.

725
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,600
I should buy a car like this one.

726
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,330
Do you think there's enough space?

727
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,030
You're already taking our space.

728
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,660
There is no AC in the back, right?

729
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,030
Try this one.

730
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,400
Who turned on the heater?

731
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,230
Someone turned on the heater here.

732
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,560
I didn't do it.

733
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,700
Let's eat gimbap.

734
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,630
- We have 10 dollars, right? - Yes.

735
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,930
There is only pickled radish inside.

736
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,030
- There are no other ingredients. - What is this?

737
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,930
My gimbap isn't even cut.

738
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,930
- I picked a good one. - This is ridiculous.

739
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,230
I only took what was given to me.

740
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,600
I can't believe they prepared them differently.

741
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,730
This is ridiculous. Does yours have pickled radish?

742
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,100
Mine only has spinach.

743
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,430
I'm so lucky.

744
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,700
This is great.

745
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,630
The staff was testing our luck.

746
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,500
It seems like someone will look after me today.

747
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,330
To be honest,

748
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,300
I'm very suspicious of Ji Won.

749
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,830
- What do you mean? - I bet he has the transfer ticket.

750
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,200
I saw one for the first time when you took yours out.

751
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,660
It doesn't make sense.

752
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,960
People get transfer tickets at 9pm. Do the tickets expire?

753
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,960
- No, they don't. - No. They can be used later.

754
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,230
Are you asking because you have one?

755
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,560
I don't have one.

756
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,430
That's why I didn't know transfer tickets don't expire.

757
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,700
I think you're asking about it because you have one.

758
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,730
(Does Ji Won have the transfer ticket?)

759
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,330
What should I do? I do have a photo of my ID card on my phone.

760
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,330
(They arrive at the airport without Jae Jin's ID card.)

761
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,130
It was a comfortable ride.

762
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,530
Isn't your bag heavy?

763
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,030
It's okay. There's only a pillow inside.

764
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,200
- I can carry it for you. - No, it's mine.

765
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,100
(He is a strange and sensitive man.)

766
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,030
This is very dear to me.

767
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,700
Okay.

768
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,660
- You need a copy of your ID card. - I can get a copy here.

769
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,530
I heard that you don't have an ID card.

770
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,930
- Where do I get a copy? - You can get it at a machine.

771
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,500
Is it over there? There is a machine.

772
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,660
Thank you.

773
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,730
(The line is long.)

774
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,930
It's hot.

775
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,400
(Walking back and forth makes him feel hot.)

776
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,330
(The prepared man takes out a fan.)

777
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,500
It works this way, too.

778
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,400
(He brags about his fan.)

779
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,530
Stop bragging.

780
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,700
- It's this one, right? - Yes.

781
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,330
(In the absence of ID card, get a copy of resident registration.)

782
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,460
It's a copy of the resident registration.

783
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,130
(The machine asks for a fingerprint for identification.)

784
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,830
(He fails to identify himself.)

785
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,330
- What? - What is the matter?

786
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Let's try it once more.

787
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,500
(He tries again.)

788
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,330
(He fails to identify himself again.)

789
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,500
Maybe I should place my finger a bit higher.

790
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,730
Things will become difficult for me if this doesn't work, right?

791
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,130
(Of course, they will.)

792
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,730
At this rate, I'll end up getting on the plane alone.

793
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,030
Give me a moment.

794
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,230
Come on.

795
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,430
My goodness.

796
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,030
(Will they be able to get on the plane?)

797
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,200
- The four of us are a team. - Yes.

798
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,630
Can't we join force to send the other two on Muddy Road?

799
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,830
- Yes, we can. - Yes, we can.

800
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,730
- Let's do that. - Give me a moment.

801
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm coming up with a plan.

802
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,760
Coach Ahn is the best.

803
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,730
- He is devising a plan. - Coach Ahn is the best.

804
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,100
If any of us has the ticket, he should come clean.

805
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,330
I don't have one.

806
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,230
- I don't have one. - I really don't have one.

807
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,960
You know I don't.

808
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,300
Show me what you got.

809
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,660
See? I don't have it.

810
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,400
I left mine in the bag.

811
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,700
- He is suspicious. - I'm serious.

812
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,930
I usually don't carry anything with me.

813
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,130
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

814
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,030
I left it in my bag so as not to lose it.

815
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,130
It must be because it says "Transfer" on it.

816
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,700
- Did you get the ticket? - No, I didn't.

817
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,600
That means one of the two on Flowery Road has it.

818
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,570
Jae Jin looked like he had one.

819
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,700
- Really? - Yes.

820
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,230
He cannot keep a poker face.

821
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,600
He was smiling and trying to brag about something to me.

822
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,130
(Jae Jin did look happy.)

823
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,430
- Did you see what it is? - Yes, I did.

824
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,230
(Does Jae Jin have a transfer ticket?)

825
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,200
What should we do?

826
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,330
Excuse me, but the machine cannot read his fingerprints.

827
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,300
- Please go to the third floor. - Third floor?

828
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,460
You can take the matter to the constabulary.

829
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,130
Constabulary? Thank you.

830
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,700
Are we on the right floor?

831
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,730
(He feels bad.)

832
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,400
The journey isn't as comfortable as I thought it would be.

833
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,330
- It's my fault. - It's okay.

834
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,760
I never imagined I would be getting on a plane today.

835
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,700
(In the absence of ID card, visit the self-identification desk.)

836
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,030
Hello.

837
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,500
- We forgot to bring an ID card. - Did you get your ticket printed?

838
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,230
- Did you get your ticket printed? - No, we didn't.

839
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,430
(Will they finally be able to get on the plane?)

840
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,030
(They come out of the constabulary right away.)

841
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,830
We need to go down again.

842
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,430
We need to get our tickets first.

843
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,930
(He is glaring.)

844
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,570
(This is no Flowery Road.)

845
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,500
We are walking more than we do on Muddy Road.

846
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Gosh, it's hot.

847
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,330
(I feel hot.)

848
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,700
We don't have much time.

849
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,730
Let's go up again.

850
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,830
(They finally get their tickets.)

851
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,700
This is exhausting.

852
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,300
They are back.

853
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,330
"They are back."

854
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,760
(Almost everyone in the airport saw them.)

855
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,130
My goodness.

856
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,830
How did you pack four batteries but not your ID card?

857
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
(He is embarrassed.)

858
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,730
(It was a long journey.)

859
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,030
(He finally made it.)

860
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,730
Where should we go now?

861
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,760
(They are not making the most of Flowery Road.)

862
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,930
Let's go.

863
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,460
(Team Muddy Road arrived at a rest stop.)

864
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,860
I got a call from Byung Jae.

865
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,230
Keep your distance from me. Your trousers are an eyesore.

866
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,460
- Hello. - Hello.

867
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,730
Did you already arrive at the destination?

868
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,530
No, we're at the airport.

869
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,700
- Are you at the airport? - Yes.

870
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,230
How is your trip going?

871
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,330
It's going well. Everyone is having fun.

872
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,570
- I need to ask you something. - Okay.

873
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,760
Do you have a transfer ticket?

874
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,830
- Me? - Yes.

875
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,530
- Don't tell anyone else. - Okay.

876
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,830
I have it.

877
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,330
- You have it? - Yes.

878
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,230
- Maybe he is on speakerphone. - No, he isn't.

879
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,030
Okay.

880
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,400
Is he telling the truth?

881
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,330
To be honest, I'm suspicious of Ji Won.

882
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,230
However, Byung Jae is telling me he has the ticket.

883
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,630
(Does Byung Jae really have the transfer ticket?)

884
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,030
It seems like they are doing well.

885
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,230
We might have sweated more.

886
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,330
Are you the type to keep your promises?

887
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,730
- Do you find them important? - Yes.

888
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,860
In that case,

889
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,630
if I pick a transfer ticket, I will use it for you.

890
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,570
(He suggests that they form an alliance.)

891
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,130
I brought this so that my face won't get tanned.

892
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,330
(I don't understand him.)

893
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,430
It has a headband.

894
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,500
(It's impossible to guess what he will do next.)

895
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,030
I brought ear plugs, too.

896
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,730
I got these from a friend who works at a steel mill.

897
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,330
It blocks out the loudest noise.

898
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,330
I thought I would sleep at a less-than-ideal place tonight.

899
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,100
(Jang Hoon made an escape from the driver's seat.)

900
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,760
This won't do.

901
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,330
Which seat would be the most comfortable?

902
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,460
(He is cramped.)

903
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,130
(He moves to the front seat.)

904
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,830
(He pushes the seat backwards.)

905
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,960
- How far do we need to go? - We have about 300km left.

906
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,830
I go straight until I reach Daejeon, right?

907
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,030
(They play games.)

908
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,430
"Kungtari Shabara"! Did I get it right?

909
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,030
(They play a game of guessing song titles.)

910
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,460
See? I got it right.

911
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,330
(It's a long way to Namhae.)

912
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,830
(They take turns in driving the car.)

913
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,500
The scenery is nice.

914
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,030
(The scenery heals their souls.)

915
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,500
- I shouldn't fart, right? - Right.

916
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,400
I don't think I can hold it in.

917
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,200
Go ahead and fart. I will open the window.

918
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,400
(He is surprised by his own smell.)

919
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,130
My goodness, I thought you went to the restroom earlier.

920
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,360
How many trash cans did you consume?

921
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,900
(I let go of everything.)

922
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:58,300
Smelling lilacs

923
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
This isn't the scent of the flower.

924
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,500
(Meanwhile, Team Flowery Road flew for 50 minutes.)

925
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,930
- Is that our van? - Are we getting on this one?

926
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,130
(Wow)

927
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,900
(It's a van from their hotel.)

928
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
I have never been inside a van.

929
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,700
- Really? - Yes.

930
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,630
The weather is nice.

931
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,530
I live with a cat.

932
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,130
- I have three cats. - You have three cats?

933
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,030
One of my cats will be having kittens...

934
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,070
in 2 or 3 days.

935
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,460
(Please give me a kitten.)

936
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,700
- Would you like a kitten? - Yes.

937
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,830
- Please show me the mummy cat. - This is the mummy cat.

938
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,030
It's not a good photo of her.

939
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,230
She has big eyes.

940
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,230
(This is Byung Jae's cat.)

941
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,230
I didn't know you liked cats.

942
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,900
- I didn't know. - To be honest,

943
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,130
I like women more than I like cats.

944
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,300
- It's the same for me. - Okay.

945
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,460
We have a lot of similarities. We both like cats.

946
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,200
I just remembered.

947
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,630
Even though I cannot draw as well as you can,

948
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,430
I used to dream of being a cartoonist. I like to draw.

949
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,130
We both live in apartments with a veranda.

950
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,530
You are right.

951
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,200
We both like drawing, cats...

952
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,860
and women. We live in similar apartments.

953
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,700
- We are in the same agency. - We have many similarities.

954
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,630
We could be friends.

955
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,300
We are here.

956
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,200
We travelled over 50km by car.

957
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,070
- This place is huge. - It looks like a golf course.

958
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,530
Wow.

959
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,330
This is incredible.

960
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,230
(They follow the straight road.)

961
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,930
(Team Flowery Road's hotel is by the beautiful cliff of Namhae.)

962
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,100
This is incredible.

963
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,730
(They are amazed.)

964
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,930
The scenery is different from high ground.

965
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,930
The view is amazing.

966
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,630
(It's the green scenery of Namhae.)

967
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,330
I didn't know such a place existed in Korea.

968
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
This place is amazing.

969
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,800
I wish we would get to stay here during our trip.

970
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,500
I want to sleep here.

971
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,100
Now that I know what the resort looks like,

972
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,200
I don't want to sleep anywhere else.

973
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,230
(They can only marvel at the view.)

974
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,300
I can't go on Muddy Road now.

975
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,030
I could sleep here.

976
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,600
I bet those on Muddy Road will sleep in an uncomfortable environment.

977
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,730
We would like to check in.

978
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,860
- Flower Crew? - Yes.

979
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
Flower Crew.

980
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,300
Please write down your name...

981
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,930
and necessary information.

982
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,070
I don't know who will sleep here, but I will write down my name.

983
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,030
- All right. - We don't know what will happen.

984
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,630
(Their fate may change.)

985
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,630
When you are ready, a staff member...

986
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,930
will drive you to your room.

987
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,430
- Do I need to go there by a car? - Yes.

988
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,530
(Meanwhile, in Team Muddy Road...)

989
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,160
Let's eat something.

990
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,300
Gosh, my back hurts.

991
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,030
(Travelling by a small car for hours makes them groan.)

992
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,070
My back hurts.

993
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
It's fun to be at a rest stop.

994
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,530
Let's see what we can eat with 10 dollars.

995
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,860
It's hot.

996
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,900
Don't do that. You embarrass me.

997
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,730
His dance is ridiculous.

998
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,730
(The man in red trousers is excited.)

999
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,530
His dance is ridiculous.

1000
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,830
I know Jang Hoon likes it.

1001
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,230
(Sae Ho's dance makes even the giant smile.)

1002
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,100
(The man in red trousers is in a good mood.)

1003
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,530
Let's see what we can get.

1004
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,730
What else should we get?

1005
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,400
(They buy four cup noodles.)

1006
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,130
- Let's get four of this first. - How much are these?

1007
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,330
- Four dollars. - Four dollars.

1008
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,530
Let's spend the rest of the money...

1009
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,830
on gimbap.

1010
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,030
You did this to me.

1011
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,030
I will remember this until the day I die.

1012
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,230
I will pass down this pain to my son, Ri Hwan.

1013
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,830
I will tell my son, Ri Hwan...

1014
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,030
that Sae Ho brought me pain.

1015
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,360
- Do they sell a bowl of rice? - Yes, they do. It costs a dollar.

1016
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,530
- Let's buy three bowls of rice. - Okay.

1017
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,600
(They spent 7 dollars on 4 cup noodles and 3 bowls of rice.)

1018
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,630
We have three dollars left.

1019
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,830
- I'm going to eat. - Enjoy.

1020
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,060
(He smells the food.)

1021
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,160
Kimchi tastes amazing.

1022
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,500
Can we get a refill?

1023
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,100
(Team Muddy Road appreciates small things in life.)

1024
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,300
I haven't had cup noodles in a while.

1025
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,200
Isn't it great? When will we get to eat cup noodles together again?

1026
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,230
I have a feeling we will have the same thing for dinner.

1027
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,360
Let's get a refill on kimchi.

1028
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,400
You are more popular.

1029
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,460
(The popular Sae Ho goes.)

1030
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,030
Koreans need kimchi.

1031
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,530
(Please give me more kimchi.)

1032
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Look at that.

1033
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,800
(She is in a better mood than Sae Ho.)

1034
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,460
Please give me more kimchi.

1035
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,800
- I'm glad you went. - Please give me more kimchi.

1036
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,630
Please give me more kimchi.

1037
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,230
Don't give me an empty plate.

1038
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,460
(Middle-aged women love him.)

1039
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,930
It's nice that we have Sae Ho.

1040
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,360
(He is dancing.)

1041
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,830
In this sense, Sae Ho is the third in the nation.

1042
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,730
- Really? - He is top three.

1043
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1044
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,600
- You earned this with a dance. - That's right.

1045
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,860
I tried my best.

1046
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,360
(They resume devouring their food.)

1047
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,730
The thing is,

1048
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,400
I don't even like seafood soft tofu.

1049
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,930
Seafood soft tofu is listed as the best menu.

1050
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,200
- I am craving it so much. - Do you know what's annoying?

1051
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,730
I am full.

1052
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,960
(Meanwhile, in Team Flowery Road...)

1053
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,230
(They are moving to the resort in a van.)

1054
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,630
We are moving to a higher ground.

1055
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,530
Is the resort located by the cliff?

1056
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,230
It is.

1057
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,600
I thought that might be the case.

1058
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,930
(The cliff offers a bird's-eye view of Namhae.)

1059
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,030
Is this the resort Bae Yong Joon and Park Soo Jin stayed at?

1060
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,130
- Is it? - Yes.

1061
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,000
- Really? - My goodness.

1062
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,030
I can't believe I'm here as a single man.

1063
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,600
I won't be able to stay here even if I do get married.

1064
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,230
(This is where Team Flowery Road will stay.)

1065
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,460
- Is this the place? - It reminds me...

1066
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,730
of Iron Man's vacation home.

1067
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:02,830
(It's a 3-storey house with 3 bedrooms, a pool and a sauna.)

1068
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:10,500
(It looks like a house that they use in films.)

1069
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,530
(They excitedly exit the van.)

1070
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,800
Let's check out the place before it gets dark.

1071
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,230
(They excitedly exit the van.)

1072
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,460
(They marvel at the resort.)

1073
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,200
It looks like the car is ours to use, too.

1074
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,730
(There is a convertible for Team Flowery Road.)

1075
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:25,830
Really?

1076
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,630
That's not what's important.

1077
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,700
I have never seen anything like it.

1078
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,400
- Do you want me to take a photo? - Let's take it together.

1079
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,530
I don't want to. I'll take one for you.

1080
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,430
In 1, 2, 3.

1081
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,430
(This is Flowery Road.)

1082
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,900
(They check out the interior.)

1083
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,360
(The house is big enough for them to run around inside.)

1084
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,230
This is the bedroom.

1085
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,900
(The bedroom offers an unobstructed view of the sea.)

1086
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,060
(Is this a dream?)

1087
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,200
There is a sauna.

1088
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,630
(Guests can relieve their stress in the cypress sauna.)

1089
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,360
Here is the pool.

1090
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,300
(The private swimming pool is connected to the veranda.)

1091
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,530
(They move to the second floor.)

1092
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,200
(A spacious living room greets them.)

1093
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,230
It's a living room.

1094
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,800
(The view feels different from that of the first floor.)

1095
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,860
This is amazing.

1096
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,400
This is incredible.

1097
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,430
(They are in awe.)

1098
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,230
I was so surprised.

1099
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,330
I didn't know such a place existed in Korea.

1100
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,130
It looked like a house...

1101
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,630
a millionaire in a film would build by the cliff...

1102
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,800
near Malibu Beach.

1103
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,860
The restroom and the living room...

1104
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,060
were too big to use alone.

1105
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,700
I really want to live here.

1106
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,530
I don't want to go to the abandoned house any more.

1107
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,130
(Team Flowery Road takes the bedroom after looking around.)

1108
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,130
I knew it.

1109
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,530
(What else is there?)

1110
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,530
My goodness.

1111
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,530
It's motorised.

1112
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,630
- What? - It's motorised.

1113
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,100
Hit the button.

1114
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,300
My goodness.

1115
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,630
(The TV is motorised.)

1116
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,130
(This is exciting.)

1117
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,160
(They turn on the TV.)

1118
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,130
This is really nice.

1119
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,860
This is incredible.

1120
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,600
The current time is 6:50pm.

1121
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,100
Shall we go and have dinner?

1122
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,160
Let's go.

1123
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,400
(He is hesitant to leave.)

1124
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,600
I don't want to get out of the house.

1125
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,460
(They get inside the convertible.)

1126
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,530
I have never been inside a car like this one.

1127
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,060
- Is the roof motorised? - What do you mean?

1128
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,930
(This is Flowery Road.)

1129
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,000
Yes!

1130
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,830
Push your seat back. You will be more comfortable.

1131
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,730
(He adjusts Byung Jae's seat.)

1132
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,600
- It's going up. - This is nice.

1133
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,730
Let me adjust it further.

1134
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,060
- How does it feel? - This is great. I can see the sky.

1135
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,100
This car is so spacious.

1136
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,530
I feel bad for four people who are cramped in a small car.

1137
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,830
(They drive down the scenic road.)

1138
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,630
This is my first time riding a convertible.

1139
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,500
This is great!

1140
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,530
We were inside a car for seven hours.

1141
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,200
(Team Muddy Road finally arrived at Namhae.)

1142
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,430
(This is Namhae.)

1143
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,900
We left at lunch and now it's night time.

1144
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,330
(Before you know it, it's late at night.)

1145
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,800
At least we made it safe and sound.

1146
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,900
(They finally arrive at the house.)

1147
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm tired.

1148
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,230
Gosh.

1149
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,130
Oh, my butt.

1150
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,200
(It was a long trip.)

1151
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,400
Byung Jae sent me a picture.

1152
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,830
What is it?

1153
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,530
Wow, where is that?

1154
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,530
(They are pictures from the Flowery Road.)

1155
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,860
- What is that? - Isn't that the Iron Man?

1156
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,800
How did they get there already?

1157
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,960
- That's not the house, is it? - Oh, they're there already?

1158
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,460
- Yes. - I've lost track of time.

1159
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,760
Where's the house for the Muddy Road?

1160
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,900
Is that the place by the light?

1161
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,800
- That's the place. - I hope not.

1162
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,100
Was this the garden you were talking about?

1163
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,630
- This is the garden? - I guess so.

1164
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,030
(There's a small garden at the house.)

1165
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,030
I found them. There are the straw shoes.

1166
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,860
You look so excited.

1167
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,500
You know what's funny?

1168
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,230
I started looking for a place to sleep as soon as I got here.

1169
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,300
Me too.

1170
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,530
I thought I should put down a blanket here.

1171
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,730
Hey, Jang Hoon. We could sleep in here tonight.

1172
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,960
(It looks fine from the outside.)

1173
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,660
(He carefully opens the door.)

1174
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,730
(The door slams.)

1175
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,860
(It's not how it looks from the outside.)

1176
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,160
(The rice cooker must have been there for at least 10 years.)

1177
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,560
Why is this locked?

1178
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,360
(He's scared.)

1179
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,500
I don't understand. Why is that locked?

1180
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,800
Someone must be inside.

1181
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
It's a private vault.

1182
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,960
(It looks like a living room.)

1183
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,700
There are tomatoes and eggplants.

1184
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,660
There are even three TVs.

1185
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,660
(There's a small bathroom.)

1186
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,060
Where are we supposed to sleep? Out here?

1187
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,100
(They can't find a good place to sleep.)

1188
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,660
Take a seat.

1189
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,460
I can't sit there.

1190
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,060
Jang Hoon, there are cobwebs in your hair.

1191
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,530
Really?

1192
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,830
You have so much in there.

1193
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,860
Oh, he's not kidding.

1194
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,500
- Here, I'll get it for you. - What is this?

1195
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,360
I did see this coming.

1196
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,660
This time it's a different season.

1197
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,000
I didn't know what to think of it.

1198
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,330
My mind was blank.

1199
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,600
I have to get myself to the Flowery Road.

1200
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,660
I've been through a lot,

1201
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,530
but this was quite something.

1202
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,030
I was really scared.

1203
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,860
What on earth is that?

1204
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,000
- Look. - What is that?

1205
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,860
- There's something big. - Look at that.

1206
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,430
What is that? It's so big.

1207
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,000
- Isn't that a helicam? - It looks like a drone.

1208
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,200
(The bugs are almost as big as drones.)

1209
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,500
Wow, it's so big.

1210
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,230
It's huge.

1211
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,600
Why is it flying around everywhere?

1212
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,430
There's a weird smell in here.

1213
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,660
(Bugs make even Sae Ho dance.)

1214
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,800
- I'll get it for you. - What's on me?

1215
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,930
Come here, I'll get it.

1216
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,560
- What is that? - Stay still.

1217
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,000
- Get this white thing. - I got it.

1218
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,700
He's under a lot of stress.

1219
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,030
Are you taking it out on me?

1220
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,900
This show shouldn't have been made.

1221
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,730
- Why? - This is too extreme.

1222
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,930
But the Flowery Road is extremely good.

1223
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,030
That's what bothers me.

1224
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,300
Can I get the menu?

1225
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,200
Over here.

1226
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,860
(He should be more polite in such a fancy restaurant.)

1227
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,760
- Hello. - Hello.

1228
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,730
We haven't spent a single penny.

1229
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,800
- Let's order three. - I think we can manage that.

1230
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,130
- I'll have kimchi jjigae... - You can have kimchi jjigae.

1231
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,160
- and myeolchi ssambap. - Me too.

1232
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,860
- What about roasted myeolchi? - Let's do those three.

1233
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,430
At first, I thought...

1234
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,860
I would be okay with the Muddy Road.

1235
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,530
Now that I'm here, I've changed my mind.

1236
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,430
Why would you go there when you have this?

1237
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,660
I was really surprised, too.

1238
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,630
I didn't know there was a place like this in Korea.

1239
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,830
Now that I know,

1240
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,300
I'm going to try my best to stay here.

1241
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,400
Here is your food.

1242
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,800
Do we have to get it for ourselves?

1243
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,630
I thought this was a fancy restaurant.

1244
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,400
- No, we don't have to do it. - Oh, never mind.

1245
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,930
(They were calling for the servers.)

1246
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,130
(They can't be at ease even on the Flowery Road.)

1247
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,600
- You look pale. - I was startled for a second.

1248
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,660
Were you?

1249
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:11,960
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

1250
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,730
(Myeolchi ssambap and kimchi jjigae are looking good.)

1251
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,660
- This myeolchi is huge. - Let's dig in.

1252
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,630
- Hello? - Where are you?

1253
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,860
We're at a restaurant.

1254
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,630
We're alone here with two chefs.

1255
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,860
- Chefs? - Yes, they're here with us.

1256
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,700
Ask him how Jae Jin is.

1257
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,860
Yes, we're here. How is Jae Jin?

1258
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,530
He's very good.

1259
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,960
I see. Can I ask you something?

1260
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,230
Is it me or Jae Jin?

1261
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,100
- I'm sorry? - Is it me or Jae Jin?

1262
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,800
(It's hard to answer him while he's on speaker.)

1263
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,800
(He turns off speaker mode.)

1264
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,500
Hello?

1265
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,700
(Oh, that's how it is.)

1266
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,460
Is it me?

1267
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,230
- I pick you. - Me?

1268
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,730
- Yes. - Oh, really?

1269
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,930
- You pick Sae Ho? - Yes.

1270
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,030
(He feels bad.)

1271
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,900
Okay, take care.

1272
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,100
(He's off the phone now.)

1273
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,160
What was that?

1274
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,430
Enjoy your meal, Jae Jin.

1275
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,100
(It got very awkward in here.)

1276
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,230
What was your answer?

1277
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,300
I said it was you.

1278
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,860
(I don't think so.)

1279
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,930
I wonder what he said.

1280
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,300
- Do you want some of this? - I'm fine.

1281
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,330
(He notices Jae Jin.)

1282
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,360
(What have you done?)

1283
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,760
How old is your cat?

1284
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,430
It's really bothering me.

1285
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,230
(Everything was going smoothly until now.)

1286
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:46,130
(Sae Ho's question left them torn apart.)

1287
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,900
(Time passes slowly.)

1288
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,460
He had to call us while eating.

1289
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,330
I know, right?

1290
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:04,560
(They look like a couple who just had a fight.)

1291
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,930
It was a simple question,

1292
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,730
but look where that left us.

1293
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,300
(Looks like Jae Jin has a feminine side to him.)

1294
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,130
When I watched the show before, it looked fun when they were eating.

1295
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,500
They seemed to be enjoying themselves.

1296
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,860
I thought so, too.

1297
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,100
Here, I made this for you.

1298
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,230
You had your hands all over it.

1299
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,560
(Oh, well.)

1300
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,630
You didn't wash your hands.

1301
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,330
It's not like there is a wet towel here.

1302
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,500
(I'll eat it then.)

1303
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,060
(Things aren't getting better here.)

1304
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,800
I can't even taste the food.

1305
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,130
You were really chatty until now.

1306
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,900
(It's the butterfly effect from Sae Ho's phone call.)

1307
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,330
Do you want to talk about it?

1308
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,600
Tell me what's on your mind.

1309
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,130
(He wants to talk it out.)

1310
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,030
(It's easier said than done.)

1311
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,130
- I don't like where this is going. - Me neither.

1312
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,530
I didn't use to be like this.

1313
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,560
I wanted the older guys to be on the Flowery Road.

1314
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,430
I thought I wouldn't mind...

1315
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,130
staying a couple of nights in bad conditions.

1316
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,230
- I've changed my mind. - Now that you're here?

1317
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:19,060
Yes, now that I'm here.

1318
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,030
On top of that, you say something like that.

1319
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,230
It didn't mean anything.

1320
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,230
(He's naiver than he looks.)

1321
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,900
(The alliance of the Flowery Road weakens.)

1322
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,730
We've been together the whole trip.

1323
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,100
We are practically best friends now.

1324
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,460
Let's go over what's going to happen next.

1325
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,000
I'll be specific.

1326
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,460
If I become the leader of the Flowery Road,

1327
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,100
I'll take Jung Hwan and Ji Won.

1328
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,300
How could you say that?

1329
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,330
No, hear me out.

1330
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,830
Hey, this isn't where I belong.

1331
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,460
I used to be on the Flowery Road.

1332
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,200
Guys, don't get physical with me.

1333
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,000
- I don't belong here. - Okay, I got it.

1334
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,430
- I surrender. - Listen up.

1335
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,130
We should look after each other when one of us becomes the leader.

1336
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,700
I'm sure there will be more transfer tickets.

1337
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,230
(It's a call from Byung Jae.)

1338
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,330
I should take this.

1339
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,860
- Hello? - Hey, Byung Jae.

1340
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,730
- I like Jae Jin way more than you. - Hey, listen to me.

1341
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,630
I'll hang up now.

1342
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,500
(Byung Jae hangs up right away.)

1343
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,400
- He said he likes Jae Jin more. - Let me talk to him.

1344
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,330
He hung up.

1345
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,700
He hung up after saying he prefers Jae Jin over me.

1346
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,830
Okay. Byung Jae is out.

1347
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,000
They're having a good time there.

1348
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,460
Why do they keep calling us and teasing us?

1349
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,530
Didn't you send me a picture last time?

1350
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,600
I did?

1351
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,130
It was you. You sent me the picture from Jeju Island.

1352
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,060
He was dancing desperately in that picture not to be there.

1353
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,860
- I don't take pictures. - I saw him like this.

1354
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,760
(It's the voting time that will change everyone's destiny.)

1355
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,930
(The Muddy Road Team arrives at the Flowery Road house.)

1356
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,930
This is it.

1357
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,060
Are we doing it live here?

1358
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,000
We're in Korea, right?

1359
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,560
(This place is even more beautiful at night.)

1360
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,560
We were only 10 minutes away from here.

1361
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,660
This place is nice.

1362
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,130
(They look impressed.)

1363
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,960
This is so much different than where we were.

1364
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,530
We should have worn suits.

1365
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,230
- Do you want to wear my red suit? - I don't think so.

1366
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,230
- This place is very nice. - It is.

1367
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,900
I didn't know there was a place like this in Namhae.

1368
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,400
Can't we just sleep at the lobby?

1369
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,160
We could sleep over here.

1370
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,360
We could wash ourselves from there.

1371
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,430
(They will sleep at the lobby over the Muddy Road house?)

1372
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,600
- Are they coming? - Yes.

1373
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:41,860
You're here.

1374
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,060
(The six members of Flower Crew are together at last.)

1375
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,560
- Hello. - This where you're staying?

1376
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,000
Yes.

1377
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,360
- You've been here all this time? - Yes.

1378
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,930
Are we even in the same country?

1379
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,500
This place is so nice.

1380
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,760
- The live vote will begin now. - Okay.

1381
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,430
Hello, everyone.

1382
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,100
We are Flower Crew.

1383
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,460
Nice to meet you.

1384
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:13,130
The live vote will begin now.

1385
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,360
This vote will decide...

1386
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,860
the destiny of your first night in Namhae.

1387
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,230
Team Flowery Road will wear the highest quality pyjamas.

1388
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,730
They will sleep in handmade beds crafted by the Swedish masters.

1389
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,160
Team Muddy Road will wear sleeveless undershirts.

1390
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,630
They will also get three kinds of fans.

1391
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,860
Before the live broadcast,

1392
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,730
the six members wrote poems.

1393
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,560
(The six members of Flower Crew wrote poems.)

1394
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,100
(They all look quite serious.)

1395
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,700
The written poems will be picked randomly...

1396
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,530
and read by each member.

1397
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:10,200
The viewers will vote for the person who reads their favourite poems.

1398
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,530
The writer with the most votes will become Team Flowery Road's leader.

1399
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,930
This vote is valid for until tomorrow at 12:00 pm.

1400
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,160
- That's pretty clever. - Everyone gets a fair chance.

1401
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,400
- Let's begin. - I'll get it.

1402
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,060
- We don't know whose poem it is. - Yes.

1403
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,230
- Let's start from this side. - Okay.

1404
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,860
(They will read out poems picked by random.)

1405
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,500
You don't know who wrote it.

1406
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,660
I'll get the remaining one.

1407
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,130
Whose is this?

1408
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,430
(Nobody knows who wrote them.)

1409
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,430
- I could pick my own, right? - You got it?

1410
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,830
- We should read them out sincerely. - Of course.

1411
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,500
It's you I'm worried about.

1412
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,100
"To my Moon".

1413
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,860
(The Moon?)

1414
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,230
(Who is that?)

1415
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,430
"You shine the light to my home."

1416
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,760
"You shine the light to my people."

1417
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,800
It sounds familiar.

1418
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,230
(I have no clue.)

1419
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:11,160
"You shine the light to my meal."

1420
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,600
"You are the Moon. You are my Moon."

1421
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,130
"Shine your light upon me."

1422
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,330
"And may you bring me good things."

1423
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,800
(It's a rather serious poem.)

1424
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,360
It was poetic.

1425
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,400
- It must have been Byung Jae. - No, it wasn't me.

1426
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,500
(Was it really Byung Jae?)

1427
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,360
- "I Wait for You". - No.

1428
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,200
("He's flinching.")

1429
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,930
"I wait for your return."

1430
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,230
"Please come back to me."

1431
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,630
"I wish he comes back to me."

1432
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,200
"He should have come back earlier to this Flowery Road."

1433
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,160
That's it.

1434
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,630
He even drew in it.

1435
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,230
The letters are rather big.

1436
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,660
(Big letters?)

1437
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,200
"Flower Medal".

1438
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:15,530
"Tears drop from the beautiful body of yours."

1439
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,760
(He bursts into laughter.)

1440
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,460
I'm sorry about that.

1441
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,200
"There is the desolation your lonely eyes tell."

1442
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,400
That's so cheesy.

1443
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:32,060
"I want to wash it off this instant."

1444
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,400
"But I can't make my way to you."

1445
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,900
"It doesn't matter if you win or lose."

1446
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,200
"Flowers grow on their bodies."

1447
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,330
I wonder who wrote that.

1448
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:49,200
- I have no idea who it is. - The letters are really big.

1449
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,430
(It was Jang Hoon.)

1450
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,930
- The letters are... - The letters are really big.

1451
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,330
(They already know who it is.)

1452
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,800
I have something to say. I'll tell you later.

1453
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,130
(It's obvious at this point.)

1454
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,730
"Moles".

1455
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,560
"There are moles on my body."

1456
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,560
"They're on my face."

1457
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:14,100
"There's hair growing on the mole under my eyebrows."

1458
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,130
"The fact that this mole was removed..."

1459
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,930
"is a big problem to me."

1460
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,360
"I love every mole that I have."

1461
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,860
- That was good. - Should I start?

1462
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,760
This one is an acrostic poem.

1463
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,460
"I want to go to the Flowery Road."

1464
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,100
"I want to play on the Flowery Road."

1465
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,730
"I'm telling you."

1466
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,830
"I can't spend the night with Sae Ho in a deserted house."

1467
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,730
It's not mine then.

1468
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,230
This is fun.

1469
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,000
- I'll go now. - Okay.

1470
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,330
"Knock, knock. Who is it?"

1471
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,630
"It's me, yellow." "Oh, it's you."

1472
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
"You don't have to knock."

1473
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,000
That was a parody.

1474
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,100
Please vote for your favourite.

1475
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,430
Ji Won read "To My Moon".

1476
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:14,600
I read "I Wait for You".

1477
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:18,600
Mine was "Flower Medal".

1478
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,300
I read "Moles".

1479
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,500
Mine was the acrostic poem.

1480
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,900
Mine was "Yellow".

1481
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:27,800
- That poem was too old-fashioned. - Which one?

1482
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,860
"To My Moon"...

1483
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,930
and the one with big letters. They're too old-fashioned.

1484
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,230
Oh, this one?

1485
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,000
- And this one? - Yes.

1486
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,160
A middle-aged man must have written it.

1487
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,430
We're all middle-aged men here.

1488
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,600
(Sorry)

1489
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,430
The poem with the most votes...

1490
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:48,100
is "Moles" by Jang Hoon.

1491
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,230
("Moles" won the most votes.)

1492
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,330
It was "Moles".

1493
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,230
We don't know who yet,

1494
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,230
but I think we figured out the meaning of the poem.

1495
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:04,230
Will the writer of "Moles"...

1496
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,800
stand, please?

1497
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:10,760
One, two, three.

1498
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,360
(Who wrote the poem?)

1499
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,660
Please stand.

1500
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,060
(Who wrote the poem?)

1501
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,700
(It was Eun Ji Won.)

1502
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:25,800
- Eun Ji Won. - Sechs Kies.

1503
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,460
(They are cheering for the leader of Team Flowery Road.)

1504
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,330
You have a mole?

1505
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,360
Right here.

1506
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,030
Every week, hair grows from it.

1507
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,960
I always have to pull it out.

1508
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,400
Can you see if I have any on the back?

1509
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,430
- Don't I have any moles? - No.

1510
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,630
I had no idea it was his.

1511
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,800
We lost to the guy with a mole.

1512
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,330
When I heard "Yellow",

1513
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,460
I knew it was Jae Jin right away.

1514
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,760
- Who wrote "Yellow"? - I did.

1515
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,430
Oh, really?

1516
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,700
That I never expected.

1517
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,300
Byung Jae was pretending to be someone else.

1518
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,800
How many votes did I get?

1519
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,300
- I got third place? - Wow.

1520
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,200
- What did you write? - Sae Ho has mine.

1521
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,430
Oh, really?

1522
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,530
It's an acrostic poem using my name.

1523
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,460
(It's an acrostic poem?)

1524
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,000
Lee Jae Jin.

1525
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,560
(Everyone's surprised.)

1526
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,200
If you fold it like this, it's Lee Jae Jin.

1527
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,060
The poem depends on the reader.

1528
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,000
- You're right. - You ruined it.

1529
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,900
I didn't know.

1530
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,330
- Everyone knows already. - Was mine not good?

1531
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,000
I did such a good job reading yours.

1532
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,560
When I looked at the votes from last time,

1533
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,900
I thought I would get a lot of votes if I hated on Sae Ho.

1534
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,300
That wasn't the case.

1535
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,360
Can I say something?

1536
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,960
When I said "Flower Medal",

1537
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,360
I meant there aren't only gold, silver and bronze medals.

1538
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,130
I wrote this poem for all the athletes at the Olympics.

1539
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,160
Do you not understand the meaning?

1540
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,430
Team leader Ji Won will pick two members to go with him.

1541
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,430
(Who will be the members of Team Flowery Road?)

1542
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,860
- I've made up my mind. - That's fast.

1543
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:11,060
(He's choosing his team members right away?)

1544
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,160
If I say I want to take Jung Hwan and Jang Hoon with me,

1545
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,600
- We're four. - We will be four if you get picked.

1546
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,900
Let's say one of us becomes the team leader of Flowery Road.

1547
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,460
If I become the leader, I'll take Jung Hwan and Ji Won.

1548
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,200
(The discussion went on even at the Muddy Road house.)

1549
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,660
I'm nervous.

1550
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,870
(Ji Won became the leader as they planned.)

1551
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,130
(Who will Ji Won pick?)

1552
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,400
I'm fine.

1553
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,500
Let's go to the Flowery Road.

1554
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,370
(Ji Won picks Jung Hwan and Jang Hoon.)

1555
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,160
- Are you serious? - Us three?

1556
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,560
- Yes, let's go - I believed in you.

1557
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,100
Did you see that?

1558
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,200
Watch and learn.

1559
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,130
How could you do that to me?

1560
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,370
You know I'm not well.

1561
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,530
You shouldn't be like that.

1562
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,870
I'm sorry for Byung Jae and Jae Jin,

1563
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,870
but those two...

1564
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:05,500
- have spent some time here already. - That's right.

1565
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,230
No, we haven't. Right?

1566
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,530
(I don't care.)

1567
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,900
What did you eat?

1568
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,230
We had roasted myeolchi.

1569
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,660
- Look. - We had instant noodles.

1570
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,300
- Are you serious? - I had to drive for seven hours.

1571
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,030
Sae Ho had to dance for kimchi.

1572
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,830
- This is what I did for kimchi. - Show them.

1573
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,100
- This is what I had to do. - See that?

1574
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,700
Look.

1575
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,000
I had to ask for kimchi like this and she danced back to me.

1576
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,400
(Kimchi Dance)

1577
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,370
She danced back to me when she handed me kimchi.

1578
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,930
- That's your dance from now on. - Okay.

1579
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:41,130
Jae Jin should experience it since this is his first time.

1580
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:42,730
I'm sure he's curious what the place looks like.

1581
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,130
I don't understand...

1582
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,370
why I'm on the Muddy Road again.

1583
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,200
What do you mean?

1584
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,500
I somewhat expected it, but isn't this too often?

1585
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,730
I understand that I am going to be on Muddy Road from time to time,

1586
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,330
but I feel like I'm on the show called "Muddy Crew".

1587
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,460
(For Sae Ho, this show is called "Muddy Crew".)

1588
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,900
(Everyone laughs.)

1589
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,230
- Simply put, this show should be... - "Muddy Crew".

1590
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,160
called "Muddy Crew".

1591
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:06,960
For example, no matter whom I stick to,

1592
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,100
- I'm on Muddy Road after all. - Sae Ho.

1593
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,660
Way to go. I'm on Muddy Road.

1594
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,500
It's the same for Byung Jae.

1595
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,060
I write poems and I'm on Muddy Road again.

1596
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:17,130
What's more funny is that I'm on Muddy Road, and people criticise me.

1597
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,400
- Sae Ho. - This is not an easy path.

1598
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,700
At this time,

1599
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,630
we will draw lots for the golden transfer ticket.

1600
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,460
Muddy Road team members will pick first.

1601
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,030
- Should I pick first? - Go ahead.

1602
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,230
- You said that you like Jae Jin. - I like him.

1603
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,160
Who can I rely on?

1604
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,230
Let's go, Jae Jin.

1605
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,460
Byung Jae, you must have one already.

1606
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,870
- No, I don't. - You got one earlier.

1607
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,730
Go ahead, Jae Jin.

1608
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,760
(He quickly chooses one.)

1609
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,430
(Jae Jin chooses carefully.)

1610
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,370
(He looks so calm.)

1611
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,200
(Jae Jin has a peculiar expression. Does he have it?)

1612
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,870
(Let's see.)

1613
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,930
Where is it?

1614
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,960
(Sae Ho chooses after thinking for a while.)

1615
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,660
(Is that a smile on his face?)

1616
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:11,960
(He turns around quickly.)

1617
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:15,800
(Does the veteran traveller have it?)

1618
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,400
Gosh.

1619
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,200
(Did Jung Hwan, the mastermind, find it?)

1620
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,460
Why do I keep picking the same one?

1621
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:29,060
(Soon, the transfer ticket they chose will cause a huge havoc.)

1622
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,560
- Is it roomy? I need to push back. - Okay.

1623
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,830
It's roomy.

1624
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,960
There are two golden transfer tickets.

1625
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,900
(Someone must have them.)

1626
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,230
Then the other team must have both.

1627
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:43,060
No one here has one.

1628
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,560
- That's right, but... - Is there anything we can do?

1629
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,870
that's why I'm so confused right now.

1630
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,600
- Didn't I show you mine? - Whose?

1631
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,630
Mine.

1632
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:54,200
- Are you doubting me? - No, no.

1633
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
- I'm just confused. - I'm telling you the truth.

1634
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,660
- It's that there are witnesses. - I don't have it, really.

1635
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,330
I told you even when the cameras were off.

1636
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,500
Yes, I know.

1637
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
(They arrive at the Muddy Road house.)

1638
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,760
Let's go Jae Jin.

1639
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,230
(They arrive at the Muddy Road house.)

1640
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,430
This is no joke.

1641
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:11,000
There is a big difference between the two, right?

1642
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,830
(The air seems different from that of the Flowery Road house.)

1643
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,300
It's scary here.

1644
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Is this a well?

1645
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,100
(My lips are parching.)

1646
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,300
(His pupils dilate automatically.)

1647
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,400
Welcome.

1648
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,370
(Jae Jin and Byung Jae enter Muddy Road house for the first time.)

1649
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,300
- Where did it go? - This feels like a movie set.

1650
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,230
There are so many bugs.

1651
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,800
Oh, my gosh!

1652
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,130
- That spider built up its web. - The spider?

1653
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,700
Before, it was just starting to build. Now it's almost finished.

1654
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:43,630
Jae Jin, didn't you say you don't mind Muddy Road?

1655
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,370
(Jae Jin is in shock and is speechless.)

1656
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:47,400
- What? - Muddy Road.

1657
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,730
It's not that bad. I think we can spend a night here.

1658
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,960
(Are you serious?)

1659
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,060
Jae Jin is in shock.

1660
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,500
(Jae Jin does not dare to go inside.)

1661
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,560
- Let's get changed. - Sure.

1662
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,460
- Do we get changed here? - Yes.

1663
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,500
- My goodness. Where can I sleep? - I need my slippers.

1664
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,530
- There's everything here. - Yes.

1665
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,630
(The dumb and dumber find basic necessities.)

1666
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,930
- This... - Going inside doesn't change much.

1667
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,930
Let's just get changed anyway.

1668
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,460
Although...

1669
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,430
changing our clothes in the room doesn't make any difference,

1670
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,000
- we need to change in the room. - in the room.

1671
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,500
What are we doing here?

1672
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,200
(They have no qualms.)

1673
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,660
(However, unlike the dumb and dumber, Jae Jin...)

1674
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,160
(lays down newspapers.)

1675
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,730
(He's marking his territory.)

1676
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:46,200
(He lays down newspapers.)

1677
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,300
(He gently lays down his sleeping bag to get ready to sleep.)

1678
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,600
(Sae Ho comes out in his pyjamas.)

1679
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,830
(Sae Ho fits right in here.)

1680
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,160
(What is he looking at?)

1681
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,200
(He smiles.)

1682
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,460
(How can he be so comfortable here?)

1683
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,830
You will feel better after changing into pyjamas.

1684
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,560
Can I just sleep any way I can?

1685
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,730
Since we are on the same team, we should wear these...

1686
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,370
- Our clothes... - when we sleep.

1687
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:20,230
I'm thankful that you prepared our clothes.

1688
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,600
(Sae Ho likes the Muddy Road team uniform.)

1689
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,060
These pyjamas keep us cool at least.

1690
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,060
Also, we didn't tuck in our shirts because we want to look foolish.

1691
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,060
We just don't want bugs crawling in.

1692
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,100
You may think we look like dumb and dumber.

1693
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:33,230
I have to stand next to you wearing these pyjamas.

1694
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,300
- We will wait for you. - We will wait.

1695
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,230
(However, when he takes his shirt off in the room,)

1696
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,760
(he shows his impressive built.)

1697
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,800
(He seriously has six pack abs.)

1698
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,600
Check out my cap.

1699
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,630
(It is Sae Ho's new fashion item.)

1700
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,500
These are the 1988 Olympics souvenirs.

1701
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,000
(The 1988 Olympics cap and fan)

1702
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,030
(Reply 1988?)

1703
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,430
Byung Jae, you belong on Muddy Road, too.

1704
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:07,130
You fit right in here.

1705
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,560
Byung Jae, we should be where we fit in.

1706
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:13,430
We have to wear clothes that fit us.

1707
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,530
Jae Jin, you look great even in these clothes.

1708
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,460
You should tuck in your shirt because of the bugs.

1709
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,930
(To fit in, he tucks his shirt in.)

1710
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,960
Jae Jin does everything we request.

1711
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,060
(Jae Jin does everything they ask.)

1712
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,000
- Sit up here with us. - I want to sleep.

1713
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,630
I'm dying here.

1714
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,700
(Fatigue sets in.)

1715
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,230
- Do you want to eat? - It's too hot.

1716
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,030
(I just want to sleep.)

1717
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:40,330
- Should we take a group picture? - Sure.

1718
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,960
- Let's use mine. - Okay.

1719
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,530
- Sit in the middle, Jae Jin. - It's for the memory.

1720
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,370
This is an unlikely bunch.

1721
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,630
In 1, 2, 3.

1722
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,660
The phone only recognises my face as a human face.

1723
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,900
(They are laughing.)

1724
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,230
In 1, 2, 3.

1725
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,500
(They are Dumb, Dumber and the Firm Cheek Guy.)

1726
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,000
- Can you send me that picture? - Sure, I can.

1727
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,130
Now that we took a picture, I will get going.

1728
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,230
(What's going on?)

1729
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,160
(What is he doing?)

1730
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,030
(Oh, my gosh!)

1731
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,030
I'm using the transfer ticket to Flowery Road.

1732
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:25,100
(Yoo Byung Jae transfers to Flowery Road.)

1733
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,530
Are you serious?

1734
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,600
(He is full of rage.)

1735
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,000
You are really something.

1736
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,560
I give you credit, Byung Jae.

1737
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,760
(He is confused, angry, shocked, agonised and perplexed.)

1738
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,060
(When did Byung Jae get the transfer ticket?)

1739
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,030
(Right after the live broadcast vote was completed,)

1740
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,160
(Byung Jae chose one.)

1741
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,460
(Transfer)

1742
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,000
Who among you has the transfer ticket?

1743
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
- Jae Jin and I don't have it. - No, there isn't one here.

1744
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,830
That means both tickets are with them.

1745
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,600
None of us have it.

1746
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,460
I am seriously confused right now.

1747
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,660
(He is Yoo Byung Jae, the wily strategist.)

1748
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,370
There is one more ticket that no one has used it.

1749
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:08,630
Do you know what else is scary?

1750
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:09,730
(What is Sae Ho afraid of?)

1751
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:12,600
I feel like Jae Jin has the other ticket.

1752
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,760
However, Byung Jae...

1753
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,760
I think I trusted you too much.

1754
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:20,930
Seriously,

1755
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,030
I trusted you too much.

1756
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,100
(The strategist begins to leave Muddy Road.)

1757
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,560
See you tomorrow. Good night.

1758
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,660
(That's how he left them and got on the van to Flowery Road.)

1759
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,930
- My goodness! - I don't think I can't sleep.

1760
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,200
I can't believe he just leaves like that.

1761
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,870
(Then who has the other transfer ticket?)

1762
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:42,230
Ji Won is a loyal guy.

1763
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,230
Of course, he is.

1764
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,660
Just as we planned in the car,

1765
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,660
(The veteran traveller kept his promise.)

1766
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,400
- he picked us. - It's fantastic.

1767
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,200
He picked us without any hesitation...

1768
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,400
- not requiring anything. - That's right.

1769
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,100
Sae Ho would have...

1770
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,560
- made us suffer and do things. - made us suffer and do things.

1771
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
Also...

1772
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,960
- You had to dance. - Really?

1773
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,460
- These guys... - You danced in front of Sae Ho?

1774
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:10,370
- Just to go on Flowery Road? - Jang Hoon danced twice.

1775
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,100
- What do you want me to do? - Just dance a little bit.

1776
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
(He danced without music.)

1777
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,030
Right on.

1778
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,500
You will be on Flowery Road.

1779
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,560
(That's how he got on Flowery Road.)

1780
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,560
Me?

1781
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,230
Thank you.

1782
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,370
I will take you gladly.

1783
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:33,100
You did a good job.

1784
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,870
(He was so happy then.)

1785
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,630
Jang Hoon doesn't dance easily.

1786
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,900
I just didn't want to go to that house.

1787
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:45,500
Then, let's summon him.

1788
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,230
- Summon him? You have the ticket? - Yes.

1789
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,730
You said you didn't have it.

1790
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,330
(Ji Won has the transfer ticket.)

1791
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,330
(At the draw held during the day,)

1792
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:00,000
(Ji Won found the golden transfer ticket.)

1793
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,030
(He shows a poker face.)

1794
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:03,400
(The veteran traveller began his method acting.)

1795
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,930
- That's what it looks like? - Yes.

1796
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,000
If you have the ticket, be honest and tell us.

1797
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:09,370
I don't have it.

1798
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,100
I don't have it.

1799
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,800
I left mine in the bag.

1800
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,870
- This guy. - Really.

1801
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:20,430
I saw my daily horoscope, and it said that someone will protect me.

1802
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,430
(He is a genius who shakes up this game.)

1803
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,600
- When did you draw this? - At the beginning.

1804
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:28,000
- At the beginning? So you lied. - Yes, I lied in the car.

1805
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,630
(Everyone fell for his brilliant acting.)

1806
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,530
(The mastermind was not Jung Hwan, it was Ji Won.)

1807
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:32,560
You said you didn't have it.

1808
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:36,330
I didn't know what would happen, so I kept it as my secret weapon.

1809
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:38,230
Don't be bitter.

1810
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:40,460
I showed my loyalty.

1811
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,760
That's good and all, but...

1812
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:46,430
I was going to keep this until tomorrow, but...

1813
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,760
This is awesome.

1814
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,130
What a surprise.

1815
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:52,370
Tomorrow, new situations will develop.

1816
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,600
I will use the transfer ticket.

1817
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,100
(No one expected Ji Won has a transfer ticket.)

1818
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,460
(Whom will he choose?)

1819
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,600
Next week on Flower Crew.

1820
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,230
Cho Sae Ho and Lee Jae Jin are left on Muddy Road.

1821
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,500
My trousers are all torn.

1822
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,100
This is no joke.

1823
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,300
(It is the tale of survival from the first night at Muddy Road.)

1824
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,800
You can't take a shower like this anywhere else.

1825
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,460
What will be their fate?

1826
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,700
Flower Crew shows up at a traditional marketplace.

1827
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,830
I can't live without you

1828
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,130
Why did you bring him here?

1829
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,830
Don't vote for the tall guy.

1830
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,160
(Grab the ticket to Flowery Road!)

1831
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,460
Whom will the merchants choose as the captain of Flowery Road Team?

1832
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,460
Votes will decide the fate of Flower Crew.

1833
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,560
(Who will go on the Muddy Road fishing boat?)
