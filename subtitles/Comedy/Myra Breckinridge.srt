appreciate a tour around the old corral.</i>

- I'd ride with you, partner...

150
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,569
except my chiropractor's clue in
to fix my back.

151
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,572
Oh, what's wrong with
your back? ls it fatal?

152
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:13,168
You sure got a sense of humor, Myra.
You ought to take it up professionally.

153
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,248
I bet around the country there's lots
of openings for your style of humor.

[ Myra on TV]
...homometic pantomime...

155
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,109
in which he saw straight through the
strenuous clowning to the hard fact...

156
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,308
that American women are eager for men
to rape them and vice versa...

157
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:56,354
and that in every American, there is a strangler
longing to break a neck during orgasm.

158
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,015
What in hell
is that woman talkin' about?

159
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,582
During the decade between
1935 and 1945...

160
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,791
no unimportant film
was made in the United States.

161
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,164
During those years,
the entire range of human...

162
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,238
which is to say American,
legend was put on film.

163
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,831
Remind me to have my masseuse
come in at 5:00 instead of 6:00...

164

<i>[ Myron]...leave this place
and go into the real world?</i>

166
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,729
<i>Oh, some of them leave, sure.
They have to get money to pay the fees.</i>

167
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,364
It's very expensive.

168
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,035
- Is your name really Irving?
- Irving Amadeus.

169
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,942
- That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
- Yes, I know.

170
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,016
I used to be Jewish
before I was transmogrified.

171
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,349
Now I just eat nuts and raisins
and play Scrabble with my guru.

-On balling.

174
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,990
Just take off your clothes
and get in bed, dear.

175
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,499
Now we need a ballsy young man
for the lover.

176
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,763
- Come on.

177
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,840
And you are irate.
You're bugged.

178
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,773
You think that she is
the lowest slut, the worst.

179
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,869
You also want to, uh,
get in bed with her.

180
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,813
You hold these here.
You look into his eyes and say...

181
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,148
“No, it's all your imagination. I've never
been to bed with any man. You're on drugs.“

182
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,554
- How could you do this to me, you bitch?
- lt's all your imagination.

183
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,559
- That's very good.

184
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,630
- Maybe we should--
- Congratulations, Lance.

teaching the students
to be successful.

187
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,783
We feel that it's
our responsibility to--

188
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,913
But you're a fag, aren't you?

189
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,354
Well, uh-- What do you--

190
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,125
I don't know.
I mean, in the Baha'i faith--

191
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,962
You see, Uncle Buck is convinced
that group therapy and self-criticism...

192
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,127
<i>are the keys
to successful acting.</i>

193
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,637
<i>Personally, I think if everybody
ate macrobiotic foods...</i>

194
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,639
<i>- there'd be no more wars.
- [Buck] Bitch!</i>

195
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,732
<i>I should've put it to her
when she first come in...</i>

196
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,143

Memo to Flager and Flager,
attorneys.

199
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,549
Dear Charlie- Hmm, honey,
that feels real good.

200
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,147
Uh, cut that.
Dear Charlie...

201
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,318
a problem's come up
on which I need your thinkin'.

202
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:55,230
Mm-hmm! A woman showed up today who says
she is the widow to my nephew Myron.

203
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,462
Now, this woman claims she has
a right to half my property...

204
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,061
which did at one time belong
to my sister Gertrude and me...

205
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,132
but is now mine, all mine,
if there's any justice in this world.

206
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,203
Now, Charlie, it's up to you to see
I get the best justice money can buy.

207
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,648
Honey, that is simply wonderful.
Hmm! Strike that.

208
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,413
Not me. Flager.

209
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,890
Let's go inside and watch some of
the fundamentals of acting class.

210
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,061
<i>He's dirty and greasy,
and I can? stand him!</i>

211
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,433
He's always hitting on me in rehearsals
and grabbing and groping me.

212
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,871
<i>[Man] I want you to build
the vibe between you...</i>

213
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:41,037
<i>by closing your eyes
and touching each other.</i>

214
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,376
I can't stand
to have this creep touch me!

215
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,973
Now we're getting someplace.

216
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,848
Real honesty
for the first time.

217
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,392
<i>[ Woman ]
What are you going to teach us?</i>

218
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,800
Well, I've come to bring back
star quality.

219
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:45,070
You simply must understand that that
pseudoanalytical group therapy approach to acting...

220
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,805
may be all right
for naturalistic theater--

221
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,314
a quaint, amiable convention
with little or no significance...

222
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,316
- but it has little to do with--
- What?

223
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,353
<i>[ Myra Narrating] In my posture class,
I was particularly struck...</i>

224
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,583
<i>by one of the students,
a boy with a Polish name.</i>

225
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,457
<i>From a certain unevenly rounded thickness
at the crotch of his blue jeans...</i>

226
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:08,295
<i>it is 522% to assume
that he is marvelously hung.</i>

227
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,928
<i>Unfortunately, he's hot for an extremely
pretty girl with long blonde hair.</i>

228
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,201
<i>Dyed.
Beautiful legs and breasts.</i>

229
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,208
<i>Reminiscent of Lupe Velez.</i>

230
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,744
<i>She is mentally retarded.</i>

231
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:25,977
<i>He is probably just as stupid, but fortunately,
has the good sense not to talk too much.</i>

232
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:30,612
<i>When he does, however, he puts on a
hillbilly accent that is so authentic...</i>

233
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,952
<i>that I almost melt
in my drawers.</i>

234
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,154
I didn't understand a word you said,
but whatever it was, I'm right with you.

235
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,526
I'm certain that regular
attendance in my classes...

236
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,964
will help even the most
limited intelligence.

237
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,196
Wait a minute. What you mean
by “limited intelligence“?

238

Great bunch of boys here. Of course,

<i>- But greatest bunch of kids in Hollywood.
- Bread?</i>

251
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,845
I'm certain of that.
The drivel in their heads...

252
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,006
must've been patiently
instilled by the faculty.

253
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,882
Wait a minute. The faculty may be
a bunch of Commies and fags--

254
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,854
no offense, lrving--
but they're all eminently qualified.

could be inscribed on--

<i>It'll</i> shake their faith

Nothing could shake the simple faith these
deluded bunnies have in you, Uncle Buck.

263
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,641
I can't relate to her!

264
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,650
You don't want to
make it with her, do you?

265
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,586
Forget it. You don't have to worry
about her. She turns me off completely.

266
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,090
I don't want to make any charges.
It may not be a conspiracy at all.

267
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,218
Conspiracy? I should've known.
Every one of them is some kind of lefty.

268
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,492
I mean, man, I never heard
anybody rap like that, man.

269
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,932
I mean, she just got right into it,
man, and rapped.

270
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,266
I don't know.
She's weird, you know?

271
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,136
I mean, I like her,
but she's weird.

272
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,508
I bet a couple of sessions in the old exercise
program would straighten her out pretty good.

273
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,640
Old Buck Loner special would shape her
up real good. God knows she wants it.

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,241
Well,

Mmm. Got a big mob.

280
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,993
I'm a little tired today.
One of those guys will have to go.

Well, there are four or five

Oh, the brass buttons.
Yes, I see.

Uh, she'll see you.
Yes, you.

284
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,266
Mmm,yeah.

285
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,930
You think a squealer

Huh?

You know what I do
to squealers?

I let 'em have it in the belly.

Well, I don't care about your credits
as long as you're oversexed.

Oh, that's one

291
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,283
A bed.

292
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,519
I never did see a bed
in an office before.

293
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,689
Well, you see,
I do a lot of night work sometimes.

294
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,098
Come here.

295
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,773
<i>Mmm.</i>

296
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,643
- Don't work any
harder than you have to for these blues.

297
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,979
I won't.

298
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,454
- How's this?
- Perfect.

299
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,466
You impress me immensely.

300
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,503
I'll keep you in mind
as a summer replacement.

301
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,504
Next.

302
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,889
Well, the end of
another busy day.

303
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,960
I can't wait till
I get back to bed.

304
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,030
<i>If that don? work,
I'll try and sleep.</i>

305
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,122
Mmm. Hi, cowboy.

306
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,997
How tall are you
without your horse?

307
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,833
Well, ma'am,
I'm six feet, seven inches.

308
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,839
Well,
[Clears Throat]

309
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,466
Never mind
about the six feet.

310
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,444
Let's talk about
the seven inches.

311
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:29,445
Those were the days.
Spike Jones and his City Slickers...

312
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,516
Ina Ray Hutton
and Her All-girl Band...

313
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,812
and, of course,
the Andrews Sisters.

314
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,820
Well, there'll never be
anyone like them.

315
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,824
The decline in our music
saddens me...

316
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,486
nearly as much as
the decline in our films.

317
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,064
<i>I have never heard
of any of these people.</i>

318
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,732
But my dear,
they were unique.

319
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,735
Truly mythic.

320
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,500
Why, the Andrews Sisters
really did roll out that barrel...

321
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,475
and no one yet
has ever rolled it back.

322
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,274
Do you know, Mary Ann,
that if you worked very hard...

323
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:08,751
it's possible that you might achieve a voice
something like that of the late La Verne.

324
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,014
<i>Oh, thank you, Myra.</i>

325
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,647
But I'm just studying at the academy
to be with Rusty.

326
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,717
- I just wanna get married
and settle down. - [ Scoffs]

327
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:21,697
- To fulfill yourself as a woman, no doubt.

328
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,793
Well, yes.
I mean, it's only natural.

329
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:30,364
<i>Natural?
Oh, my dear Mary Ann...</i>

330
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,807
don't you realize that--

331
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,709
Well--

332
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,714
Never mind.

333
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,579
<i>It's getting late.
We have a big day tomorrow.</i>

334
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,584
We'll talk about it
another time.

335
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,280
- Well--
- Yes, my dear?

336
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,357
- But, um--
- Mm-hmm?

337
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,358
But we haven't talked
about Rusty.

338
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,360
Oh, that.

339
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,829
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
I have that well in hand.

340
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,991
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

341
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,001
Bye-bye.

342
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,935
Well! Did you hear her?

343
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,137
Never even heard
of the Andrews Sisters.

344
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,511
I scarcely dared mention Ella Mae Morse
and the “Cow-Cow Boogie.“

345
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,380
<i>I Myron] I must say you showed
remarkable restraint.</i>

346
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,478
And four children.
It's not enough that she and that ape...

347
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,081
merely want to reproduce themselves,
she wants to have four!

348
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,650
Half the world is starving now, and if
population continues at the present rate--

349
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,961
I know, I know.
Famine by 1974.

350
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,331
And you can forget
about plankton and seaweed...

351
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,734
because there's not gonna be
enough of that to go around.

352
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:38,138
Oh! I've heard this speech
so many times.

353
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,411
Your goal is--

354
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,244
My goal is the destruction of the last
vestigial traces of traditional manhood.

355
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,147
- In order to--
- Realign the sexes--

356
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,447
- While--
- Decreasing population--

357
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,920
- Thus--
- Increasing human happiness.

358
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:56,926
- And--
- Preparing humanity for its next stage.

359
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,930
<i>Bravo. Also... bullshit.</i>

360
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,592
- Would you care to explain that?
- Gladly.

361
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,568
<i>I thought we were gonna invite Mary Ann
here tonight so that we could talk.</i>

362
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,572
Oh, never mind!

363
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,269
I make all your fantasies come true, and
then all you say is I make everything nasty!

364
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,006
Well, I'm doing
everything I can!

365
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,453
I'll give you Mary Ann
if you want and... Rusty...

366
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,785
and Leticia Van Allen.

367
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,518
The only person I can't deliver
is Buck Loner.

368
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,753
He's a real piece of history.

369
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,696
- Will you stop it?

370
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,529
Oh, you behave
like a real child.

371
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,695
Forgive me.

372
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,812
I just wanna make you happy.

373
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,250
That's all.

374
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,985
Myra will take care
of everything.

375
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,188
You'll see.

376
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:26,078
- <i> Oh, yes,</i> Myra.

377
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,849
I didn't mean to criticize.

378
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,324
I forgive you.

379
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,729
I forgive you.

380
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,765
Good morning.

381
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,927
I'm your typical sun
and fun-loving California sweetheart.

382
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:51,475
We have here a fine selection
of all of your favorite treats.

383
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,136
-“F“ is for French fry.

384
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,907
- “P“ is for pizza.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

385
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,915
“P“ is for pretzel.

386
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,281
- Oh, “A“ is for apple.

387
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,411
I almost forgot.
There's me.

388
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,921
Would you like
this banana?

389
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,026
<i>And me?</i>

390
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,961
Oh. Open wide.

391
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,032
Isn't that good?

392
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,033
<i>Let me see.</i>

393
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,035
<i>Some peanut butter.</i>

394
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:23,005
<i>Would you like some peanut butter?
With a little jelly?</i>

395
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,200
With some whipped cream?

396
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,749
Mmm!

397
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,840
So good.

398
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,888
- <i> “H”is for hot dog.

399
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,493
<i>It's so good!</i>

400
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,224
<i>And a big glass of milk!</i>

401
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,666
<i>Now maybe some chicken.</i>

402
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,147
Johnny Weissmuller,
the zaftig Tarzan...

403
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,915
still provides the last word on soft
man's relationship to hard environment.

404
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:17,359
- <i>And Tarzan and the Amazons, 1945,
he</i> was-- - <i>Tarzan and the Amazons?</i>

405
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,453
You mean you like that?</i>

406
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,657
<i> As I've just indicated,
it was a masterpiece.</i>

407
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,702
But it's trash. I mean,
there isn't a single moment of truth.

408
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,330
<i>I mean, it'; not, uh, real.</i>

409
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,273
Whatever “real“ means.
ls that necessarily good?

410
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,572
<i>Could the real Christ
have possessed a fraction...</i>

411
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,946
<i>of the radiance of H. B. Warner in the first
King of</i> Kings <i>or Jeffrey Hunter in the second?</i>

412
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,759
Heavy, heavy.

413
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,421
<i>At any rate,
back to johnny Weissmuller...</i>

414
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,623
<i>who swung out of the trees
and into our hearts...</i>

415
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,826
with his leading lady--

416
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,462
- Brenda Joyce.
- Brenda Joyce.

417
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,803
<i>The only contemporary figure
we can point to is James Bond...</i>

418
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,073
<i>- who invariably ends up with a blowtorch
aimed at his crotch. - Miss Breckinridge.</i>

419
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,172
- Ah, Uncle Buck.
- <i>May I have a word with you?</i>

420
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,616
- I'm in the middle of a class.
- It'll only take a minute.

421
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,323
All right.
This won't take long.

422
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,655
Miss Breckinridge...

423
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,628
what you're doing here is downright
unwholesome, underminin' all my good work.

424
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,401
Do you think lying to people
is good for them?

425
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:36,599
Do you think telling someone who's got cancer
he doesn't need the operation is right to do?

426
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,835
Well, if he's had the operation
and the case is terminal...

427
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,969
why, you'd want him
to be happy, wouldn't ya?

428
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,811
- Have the happiest frame of mind?
- I can only conclude that you agree.

429
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,943
What you have assembled here are the
national dregs, the misfits and neurotics.

430
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,783
- In short, the fuck ups of our culture.
- That ain't so.

431
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,290
They are the carefully selected
candidates for future stardom.

432
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,157
- Bullshit! - You can't talk
to me like that, young lady.

433
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,162
I'll have you out of here
so fast, your hair'll curl.

434
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,360
You just try it, and I'll take this place
away from you lock, stock and empathy class!

435
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,666
You watch your step. As for taking
this place away from me, why--

436
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,935
I don't even know whether, uh,
that man you claimed you married--

437
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,476
that fag son of a bitch--

438
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,012
you was ever even really
married to that fag!

439
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,944
That, students, was a classic stage slap
delivered so as to give the impression...

440
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,284
that the subject has been hit
very hard in the mouth.

441
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:30,952
It was first developed by Patricia
Collinge in The Little Foxes, 1941.

442
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,963
Oh. Thank you for

Hello, Miss Van Allen. I thought this
was your car. Anything I can do for you?

444
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,437
Come to think of it, yes.

445
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,745
There's a car been following me
for quite some time.

446
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,048
- Want me to bust <i>him?</i>
- No. Introduce him.

447
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,387
Oh, and don't forget to remind me
of the policeman's balls--

448
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,392
I mean, the police show.

Oh, Fellini.
Oh, yes.

No pinching.

- No.

Oh. Well, if I spend
my valuable time on you...

544

Rusty...

555
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,472
it's been my experience in the past,
in problems like yours...

Now, tell me, where were
the ribs broken, Rusty?

563
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:44,350
Four was busted right here, which is why
I'm kind of pulled over to this side.

567

But there's nothing to see. I mean, all of
the ribs are inside me that were broken.

568
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,698
I know where ribs are,
Rusty...

569

580
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:11,165
Now, I believe the problem is a little
lower down, around the small of the back.

581

just announced a plague of locusts.

594
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,352
What's the matter,
Mary Ann?

595
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,355
Is it Rusty?

596
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,618
Can I do anything
to help?

597
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,320
Oh, Myra,
I'm so worried about him.

598
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,091
Oh, there, there.

599
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,434
Busted?

600
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,136
The first time wasn't his fault at all,
but he was on parole.

601
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,305
This time,
they'll really put him away.

602
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,646
Nonsense. They'll do nothing
of the kind. You just leave that to me.

603
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,276
Why? ls there something
you can do?

604
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,845
- Why, of course, my clear.
lt's only the law. -

605
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,588
- Ah, Leticia Van Allen. - The kids
and I sure appreciate these visits...

606
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,596
particularly the scholarship boys.

607
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,689
By the way, speaking
of the scholarship fund--

608
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,065
They say she goes to bed
with all the actors she represents.

609
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,229
Oh, Fl! talk about that another time.</i>

610
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:39,173
Yes. She must be
a marvelous woman.

611
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,736
I think all the gay boys
are gonna take the business over.

612
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,213
There's no more
studs around anymore.

613
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:50,184
Everyone's popping pills
and smoking grass.

614
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,187
- Oh, Miss Van Allen?
-Yes?

615
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,348
This is Miss Breckinridge,
who'll be with us teachin'...

616
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,292
until she goes back East
on or before September 3.

617
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:02,195
Permit me to say that you are the only
brain comparable to my late husband's.

618
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:06,235
Ooh, I appreciate that, honey,
but what did your late husband do?

619
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,770
<i>He wrote books
about the movies.</i>

620
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:12,501
- Oh. Was he gay?
- Ostensibly he was Americana--

621
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,569
a terelyne-hosed chick-baller from East
57th Street, but underneath it all--

622
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,115
He was gay.
Sit down, honey.

623
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,378
You sound like a good agent.

624
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,582
You see, Miss Van Allen,
Uncle Buck and I deal in myths.

625
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,558
And movie stars are like
gods and goddesses.

626
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,220
When one fades,
another promptly takes its place...

627
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,266
because the human race requires
that the pantheon always be filled.

628
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,892
<i>And you and I must seek out
the glittering few...</i>

629
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:44,303
that are the new stars
of our race reborn!

630
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:49,641
That is the damnedest thing
lever heard... about this business.

631
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:53,944
You have all the kinky angles that
are in right now. What about studs?

632
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,951
Heaven.

633
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,715
I mean, have you any
that I don't know about?

634
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,949
Uh, only one that's really
“A“ material.

635
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,993
I know you'd like him.
He's our pride and joy.

636
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:08,428
He's the last stronghold of masculinity
in this Disneyland of perversion.

637
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,831
He looks like he's got quite a lot
going for him. What's his name?

638
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,996
- Rusty Godowsky. - I ain't sure these kids
should try to walk before they can run.

639
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,701
<i>- Anyway, Rusty's been busked.
- [Leticia ] Arrested for what?</i>

640
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,678
Violation of parole.
Perhaps you could help.

641
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,680
<i>I'll</i> look into it.

642
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,841
I have a judge by the--

643
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,851
Oh, Leticia...

644
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,979
they don't call you “Queen of
the Casting Couch“ for nothing.

645
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,958
From what I understand, they're
voting me a special Academy Award.

646
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,290
- An Oscar?
- No.

647
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,864
A golden phallus.

648
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:45,526
<i>And let me tell you, someday we'll
have our own stable of studs.</i>

649
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:49,127
A steady stream
of sturdy studs.

650
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,902
A boy bank,
where credit is always good.

651
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,807
Sort of a lay-a-day plan.

652
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:59,678
- God bless America!
- God help America.

653
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,650
A lay a clay.
Mmm.

654
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,347
<i>That reminds me.
I simply must go.</i>

655
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,356
Identical twins.

656
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,688
I'm the only one
that knows the difference.

657
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:15,163
<i>Yeah. Get me
judge Frederic D. Cannon.</i>

658
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,233
Keep ringing
the judge's chambers.

659
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,394
He sleeps there
between sessions.

660
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,529
Never mind howl know.

661
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:29,369
<i>No nation can long endure
the onslaught of godless Communism...</i>

662
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,710
which permeates the very warp
and woof of Southern California.

663
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,274
Eternal alertness to what your neighbor
is up to is the price of freedom.

664
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,651
Miss Breckinridge,
keep your eye on him at all times.

665
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,247
<i>And remember...</i>

666
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,886
<i>the Commies will use every
infernal device known to man...</i>

667
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,397
to worm their way into
our churches and supermarkets...

668
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,399
which is why...

669
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,699
only the National Rifle Association
stands between a free America...

670
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,705
and a Communist takeover.

671
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:02,403
<i>With this in mind, we may yet curb
the lawlessness and degenerate values...</i>

672
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,412
as expressed by the Kremlin...

673
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,539
<i>and upheld...</i>

674
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,609
<i>by the Supreme Court
of the United States.</i>

675
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,245
Well, thank you, sir.
Come along, Rusty.

676
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,110
- Say, Ollie?
- What?

677
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,111
<i>What time is it?</i>

678
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:46,478
- <i>It's nearly half past.</i>
- <i>Thank you, Ollie.</i>

679
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,442
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

680
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:18,105
<i>we take great pleasure
in presenting to you...</i>

681
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,808
<i>the world-famous

682
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,545
<i>Miss Leticia Van Allen...</i>

683
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,951
- <i>and the Van Allen Dancers.</i>

684
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:38,227
Hell, jail wouldn't be so bad
if it wasn't for all those faggots.

685
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,429
There's always
some fruit after you.

686
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,974
That shouldn't bother you, Rusty.

687
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,043
Well, the whole idea
makes me wanna puke.

688
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,135
A man should act like a man.
Know what l mean?

689
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,873
Look out, baby!

690
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,609
- <i>How should</i> a <i>man</i> act?

691
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,721
He should ball chicks.
That's how.

692
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,961
- But only if he loves her.
- <i>[ Woman ]</i> Cigars...

693
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:10,158
- cigarettes, chewing gum...

694
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,235
Bananas.

695
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,828
What is normal?

696
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,807
Well, it's what everyone does.

697
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:23,367
I mean, it's what the majority
of society does most.

698
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,418
Yeah.

699
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,368
I still think a guy
should ball chicks.

700
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,000
- Ah-ha-ha.
- Hi.

701
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,205
How's it goin', girls?</i>

702
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,475
just great, sweetie.

703
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,590
<i>Playing, uh, canasta?</i>

704
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:26,423
- That's right, sweetie.

705
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,089
Hey. Great, great, great.

706
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,328
<i> Uh, how's your
poker game going, sweetie?</i>

707
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,670
Ah, great, great.

708
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,710
Great.

709
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,110
- Just great.

710
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,182
Yes.

711
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,890
- Bang! Bang!
- Oh!

712
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,460
Ooh,you got him, Kid Barlow.
You got him.

713
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,359
Kid Barlow was the fastest gun
at Republic Pictures.

714
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,557
- Them was the days.

715
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,499
Yeah. Well...

716
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,071
every time I look at
them old flicks of mine...

717
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,163
in the morning on TV...

718
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,868
I get a lump right here
in my throat.

719
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,538
Oh, we was Saturday afternoon
for the whole world.

720
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:21,413
Till our kind of pictures...

721
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,951
just rode off in the sunset.

722
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:27,022
And what's taken our place?
I'll tell you what.

723
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,683
Perversion.
That's what's taken our place.

724
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,556
Communist perverts
turning out filth.

725
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,144
I guess I'll have to pass.

726
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,071
- <i>One no-trump.

727
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,082
Three hearts.

- <i>Three hearts?</i>

729
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:01,018
<i>Three no-trump.</i>

730
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,560
Three no-trump?
I know I'll have to pass now.

731
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,688
- <i>No bid.</i>

732
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,004
- Well, how was the beef teriyaki?

733
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:55,043
Awful.
Worse than the chow mein.

734
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,642
What's that?

735
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,013
Swedish massage.

736
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,610
What do you do with it?

737
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,486
I beat you with it.

738
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,082
- Does it hurt?

739
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,162
You bet your ass.

740
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,355
Somethings wrong
here someplace.

741
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:17,567
Good evening, Rusty.

742
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,398
Good evening, Rusty.

743
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,473
Um, gee, it's,
uh, really nice...

744
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,248
that Leticia Van Allen wants
to represent Mary Ann, isn't it?

745
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:42,051
<i>Yes, very nice.
About your back...</i>

746
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,718
I've spoken to Uncle Buck's
chiropractor...

747
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,625
and she's going to arrange
a special brace.

748
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:52,633
But she couldn't be here tonight. So she asked
me to take an exact tracing of your spine...

749
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,635
so that she'll know
what to do.

750
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,501
So if you'll just
slip off your shirt...

751
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,507
we'll get right to work.

752
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,732
Step on the scale...

753
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,802
and we'll measure you.

754
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:34,672
Take off those atrocious cowboy boots.

755
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,802
- They'll break the scale.
- Oh, no, they won't.

756
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,939
Do exactly as I tell you.

757
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:43,712
You don't want me to have to tell
the judge that you've been...

758
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,754
uncooperative, do you?

759
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,491
No, no.

760
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,297
Guess I'm full of holes.

761
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,162
Oh, well, that's all right.

762
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,165
Now we'll need your weight.

763
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,679
Um, which is...

764
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,849
174.

765
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,942
And your height...

766
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,454

767
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,459
six-one and a quarter.

768
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,461
Well, the chart's
filling up nicely.

769
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,531
You can get down.

770
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,959
Now, we'll need
a urine specimen.

771
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,367
Step behind the screen.

<i>Perhaps we better
wait for the doctor.</i>

784

- Do as you're told, Rusty.
- What do you want me to do?

785

<i>Well, it's very simple. I don't know

01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:11,128

your belt and say, “Ah. "</i>

788
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,716
- Turn your head to the side and cough.

789
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,016
Hmm. Bend over
the table, please.

790

<i>There's more where that came from.
Bend over the table.</i>

791

Certainly there.

793

905
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:42,166
I don't know.
I just don't understand.

906
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,832
Well, let me
fix you a drink.

907
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,034
It'll soothe
your nerves.

908
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:53,677
Didn't he give you
any explanation at all?

909
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,080
No. Nothing.

910
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,084
It was frightening.

911
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:01,485
Just that he was sick of me.
Sick of women.

912
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,649
Sick of women?

913
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:08,390
- He actually said that?
- <i>Yes.</i>

914
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,891
Well, I'm certain
he didn't mean sick of you.

915
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:17,165
- Oh, sick of women in general, perhaps.

916
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,172
I don't know.
Both, I guess.

917
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,004
Men.
They're all alike.

918
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,047
But don't you worry.
We'll find him.

919
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,916
We've just got to.

920
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,385
I may never see him again.

921
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,058
Of course you will.

922
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,685
You'll see. Everything
will work out just fine.

923
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,128
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

924
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,995
<i>I just can? go back there.</i>

925
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,729
You don't have to.
You can stay here with me.

926
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,737
Oh, no. I couldn't.

927
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,739
I insist.

928
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,809
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

929
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,470
<i>It's really
no bother at all.</i>

930
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,945
Really. We'll just
find you something to wear.

931
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,549
Now, then.
Let me see.

932
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,625
[Sighing]

933
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:15,619
- [Mumbling]

934
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,097
Those are men's pajamas.

935
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,100
Oh.
So they are.

936
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,534
How indiscreet.

937
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,629
<i>You've had a very
trying day, Mary Ann.</i>

938
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,004
<i>I really feel you should
go right to bed.</i>

939
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:31,569
I don't know how to thank you.
You've been so sweet to me, Myra.

940
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,274
And don't you worry
about Rusty.

941
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,248
It's either them or me.
I told him.

942
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,049
And of course it will be
you, my darling.

943
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,182
Now, let's have
a nice girlie evening.

944
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,921
<i>I'll</i> tell you howl lost my virginity,
if you tell me how you lost yours.

945
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,363
- Jesus.
- There we go.

946
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,561
Oh, Rusty.

947
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,105
Oh.

948
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,538
There, there,
my dear.

949
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,736
He's only a man,
and not good enough for you.

950
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:08,111
- How well I remember my own puppy love.
- No shit.

951
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,618
Mmm, Myra?

952
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,822
This is Leticia. Rusty's at
the beach house with me right now.

953
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,830
I'm calling to say thanks.

954
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,696
Oh, I'm--
I'm so glad you liked him.

955
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,702
Uh, is it
the right color?

956
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,637
Well, I guess so.
It's the usual color.

957
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,232
- Didn't you ever make it with him?
- Not in the classic way, no.

958
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:39,473
<i>Well, I 'm-- I hope
he sleeps well in his new home.</i>

959
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,742
<i>I wouldn’t entrust him
to just anyone.</i>

960
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,547
<i>- Good night, dear lady.
- Oh, well. Good night.</i>

961
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:50,023
Come on, honey. Let's take
another trip around the world.

962
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:50,225
<i>Charlie, I've knowed you
ever since you was a cough and a spit.</i>

963
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:54,753
<i>Charlie, I've knowed you
ever since you was a cough and a spit.</i>

964
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,797
- Gee.
- I've watched you become the dream...

965
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,264
of every parent this
side of San Diego.

966
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:02,393
- Wow.
- You're a fine boy, Charlie.

967
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,837
- A fine boy.
- Gee, uh, thanks, Uncle Buck.

968
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,909
You know what I've
always thought of you...

969
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,477
ever since you did that
morning television show on ABC.

970
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,672
I can tell you now,
Uncle Buck, that--

971
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,715
Well, you've
always been my idol.

972
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:17,546
I've lost more fights over you
at UCLA than anything else.

973
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:21,315
I'm very moved to hear you
say that, very moved.

974
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,323
Also, I'm pleased to hear
you're a fighter...

975
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,620
'cause this Myra Breckinridge
is more than a match...

976
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,695
<i>for most men--
more than a match.</i>

977
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:32,290
<i>l'll</i> do my best, Uncle Buck, and, if my best
isn't good enough, well, that's too bad.

978
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,300
Not quite, Charlie. Not quite.

979
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,597
- If your best ain't good enough...

980
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,071
you might just as well
pack up and move to Milwaukee.

981
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,665
- <i>There she is.</i>

982
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:45,213
Remember, the, uh,
velvet hand and the iron glove.

983
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:55,646
- Come in, Myra.
- Okay. Let her rip.

984
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,392
- This better <i>be good.</i>

985
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,022
Who's this? It <i>looks like
The Late, Late Show.</i>

986
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,465
Myra, this is Charlie Flager
of Flager & Flager.

987
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,767
I thought you two should get together and sort
out the little problems we've been having.

988
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,433
<i>Problems, Uncle Buck?
I don? have any problems.</i>

989
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,444
All I know is
that you owe me $900,000..

990
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,242
And the price of real estate
is going up every day.

991
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:23,283
<i>I think you should know that
Charlie's dad and me have been pals...</i>

992
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:26,183
ever since he handled me when I had
that row with the Blue Network.

993
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,552
I-- I guess that we value
Mr. Loner's account...

994
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,888
more than any single
non corporate account.

995
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:36,760
Like Dad always says,
“Buck Loner has a real reputation.“

996
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,856
Uh, for being, like,
a straight shooter.

997
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,936
<i>When you two lovebirds are finished,
perhaps you'll tell me...</i>

998
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,005
what lousy, dirty trick
you're up to now.

999
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,972
<i>No lousy tricks, Mrs. Breckinridge.
I am simply here...</i>

1000
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,441
to defend my client's interest,
which in this case...

1001
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:53,981
<i>is your alleged claim to, like, half
the value of this Westwood property.</i>

1002
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,982
- Alleged?
- <i>Alleged.</i>

1003
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:59,451
That marriage certificate
is an out-and-out phony.

1004
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,988
Oh.

1005
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:17,370
It isn't easy being a woman,
Uncle Buck...

1006
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:20,873
especially when you have
to fight your own family...

1007
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:23,376
for what's rightfully yours.

1008
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,878
Honey, honey, honey.

1009
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:29,712
We don't want to take what's yours.
That's the last thing on our mind.

1010
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,116
But we gotta make sure
you're entitled to it.

1011
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,815
Like, you might be an impersonator
saying you are who you are.

1012
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:40,293
And after Gertrude gave you
that $200 back in Philadelphia...

1013
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:44,491
to pay for the abortion of the daughter
of that Rexall druggist...

1014
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:48,035
you knocked up and refused to marry.

1015
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:51,196
<i>The point is, can you prove
you were married?</i>

1016
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,274
<i>That 's all.</i>

1017
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:01,176
Proof will arrive before the end of the week
in the person of Dr. Randolph Spencer Montag.

1018
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,818
Montag?

1019
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,356
- The great dental psychiatrist?
- <i>He was a</i> witness to our wedding.

1020
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:12,017
I trust his word
will be sufficient.

1021
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,790
Let me make it
perfectly clear that it might.

1022
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,263
In any case,
my price has gone up...

1023
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:22,302
to an even million dollars.

1024
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,333
<i>-  How old were you then?

1025
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,873
Long distance call,
Dr. Montag.

1026
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,273
Yeah. Uh, Mondo--
No, no. Montag here.

1027
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,743
Yeah? Oh. Oh, Myra.

1028
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:06,746
How are ya, kid.
How's your teeth?

1029
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,748
Spit out now.

1030
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,944
- So, my so-- - Myra, dental health is
mental health. Will you remember that?

1031
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,953
- John Phillips tried to rape me.
-Open.

1032
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:17,422
- And I said, “Oh, how can he do that?“
- What?

1033
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:21,985
Myra, believe me that your appeal
reaches me at every level...

1034
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,395
- from lower id to superego.

1035
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,263
After all, I realize that our
relationship was always much more...

1036
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,269
than that simply of
analyst to patient.

1037
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:32,135
- I'm also your dentist.

1038
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,607
No-- No, Myra, I've got
other patients who need me too.

1039
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,769
- And he shouldn't have done it.
- Spit out now, dear.

1040
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:41,315
Oh, you've got such lovely boobs.
They're such a comfort to me.

1041
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,611
No, I said 15, Myra.
Open up.

1042
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:45,777
Fifteen percent.
I'm in L.A. tomorrow.

1043
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:54,426
<i>Mighty kind of you, Doc, coming
all this way to help our little Myra.</i>

1044
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:58,522
- <i>Of course, we all mean to do the right
thing by her.</i> - <i>Then cut the crap...</i>

1045
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:03,502
- and handover the <i>cash.</i> - Naturally, we are,
uh, not about to question the probity...

1046
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:07,302
<i>of such a well-known person
and author as Dr. Montag.</i>

1047
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,707
- Yes?

1048
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:13,042
- New York calling Mr.
Flager. -Which Mr. Flager?

1049
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,981
<i>Mr. Flager, Jr.</i>

1050
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,075
Take it, junior.

1051
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:20,154
In the bathroom, you idiot.

1052
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,223
Uh, I have to
go to the bathroom.

1053
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,826
Do you get to
the movies much, Doctor?

1054
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:36,495
<i>- I say do you get
to the movies much, Doctor?</i>

1055
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,801
<i>I was wondering what you thought
about all the pornography we have.</i>

1056
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:44,607
- Pornography. Uh-- - I was wondering
what you thought about it in our movies.

1057
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,612
I've never seen
any of your movies.

1058
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:49,581
I mean our current American picture,
which is loaded with smut.

1059
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:50,918
- Smut. Yes.
- Uh, listen, could--

1060
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,409
- Smut. Yes.
- Uh, listen, could--

1061
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,681
- Uh, attention, everybody.

1062
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:59,385
Uh, uh, I guess you all know,
uh, th-that was a call, uh...

1063
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,724
from our, uh,
New York office.

1064
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:04,924
- <i>What did they say?</i>
- <i>Oh, uh, Dad, um...</i>

1065
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:08,969
before we get into that, I--
I think it might be nice, at this time...

1066
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:11,732
to put everyone in the picture
as to the background.

1067
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,207
- Uh, would you tell him to--
- Shut up and get to the point.

1068
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,210
The point is,
Mrs. Breckinridge...

1069
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:21,976
that no record of your husband's death
exists in New York City or State.

1070
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,176
- Strike.
- Just remember, Myra...

1071
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,810
these people don't
screw around.

1072
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,821
Everything's legal
and aboveboard.

1073
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:33,417
Not like in some places I can mention
south of the border down Mexico way.

1074
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:37,658
Listen, I say the man's dead,
you unmitigated shit.

1075
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,892
And that means he's dead.

1076
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:43,994
<i>Oh, I 'll admit his body
was never found. That's true.</i>

1077
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,596
<i>He died in a car accident
outside the Bank of America.</i>

1078
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,006
<i>Fire!</i>

1079
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:53,410
- <i>Beverly</i> Hills branch. - <i>There is not
one iota of evidence that he is dean'...</i>

1080
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:56,279
and we are not going to
pay you one single penny.

1081
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:58,648
Strike.

1082
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,988
Randolph...

1083
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,958
I believe the moment of truth
has finally arrived.

1084
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,460
Go get 'em.

1085
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:10,827
Gentlemen...

1086
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:13,162
I am Myron Breckinridge.

1087
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,293
Uncle Buck,
your fag nephew...

1088
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,668
became your niece two years ago
in Copenhagen...

1089
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:21,207
and is now free as a bird
and happy in being...

1090
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:24,506
the most extraordinary woman
in the world. [Chuckles]

1091
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:27,308
And I thought
I fell in love with a man.

1092
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:34,681
- That's the ball game.
- [ Myra Chuckling]

1093
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,967
Uh, Stanley,
what time is it?

1094
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,531
It's about half past--

1095
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,835
Something went wrong.

1096
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:58,936
“Either you keep me on here,
or <i>l'll</i> tell the world...

1097
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,813
that Buck Loner's fag nephew became
his niece two years ago in Copenhagen.“

1098
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,444
I could kill him. I could kill him
if I could get away with it.

1099
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:09,717
Strike that.
Anyway, thank God...

1100
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:13,225
I never slipped him
the old Buck Loner special.

1101
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,004
Myra, don't.
It spoils it.

1102
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:32,807
All right. Whatever you say, Mary Ann.

1103
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:42,347
But I do love
being with you like this.

1104
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:44,652
I'm sorry, Myra.

1105
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,659
I just can't.

1106
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,093
I wish I could, really.

1107
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,789
Love isn't always
a matter of sex, you know.

1108
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:57,633
Well, I know.
And I really do love you as you are.

1109
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,302
I even like it
when you touch me.

1110
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,838
Up to a point.

1111
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,276
I don't know.

1112
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,854
I just can't
let myself go.

1113
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,048
That's the way I am.

1114
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:21,788
Well, is it Rusty?

1115
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,126
No, that's finished.

1116
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,392
But someone like him.

1117
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,596
Someone gentle.

1118
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:36,141
Rusty gentle?

1119
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:38,644
I thought he was violent.

1120
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:43,445
No. Whatever
gave you that idea?

1121
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:46,714
It's because he was so gentle
that I loved him.

1122
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,386
He never grabs you
like the other boys.

1123
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:00,925
Oh, you are an angel,
Myra, and I do love you.

1124
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,003
I really do.

1125
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,739
I just can't,
you know?

1126
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,606
Yes. Of course. I know.

1127
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:19,313
If only there were
some man like you.

1128
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,854
I'd really fall.
l would.

1129
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:25,250
But not like this.

1130
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:29,291
If only you were a man.

1131
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:45,011
[Thinking]
<i>l'll</i> get you this time.

1132
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:47,673
It's a dangerous thing,
ambition.

1133
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:50,546
Ruined Mickey Mouse's
whole career.

1134
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,916
Well, now it's
eight bars and out, honey.

1135
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:58,788
You were no more than
a Linda Darnell paper doll.

1136
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,828
A Disney cow
that got over the fence.

1137
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,829
You got ambitious.

1138

<i>You were great in CinemaScope
and Technicolor...</i>

black and white.</i>

- <i>Magnificent!</i>

1141
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:29,323
Funny...

1142
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:34,862
when I waited for you...

1143
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:36,930
you didn't come.

1144
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:40,297
But now you have come, and...

1145
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,301
I must go away.

Where are my tits?

01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:53,339
Good morning, Nurse.

1150

Ah, what have we got here?
When you get to 103, sell.

Hey, forty chin-ups, baby.

What are you doing, writing home
for money? What are you saying there?
