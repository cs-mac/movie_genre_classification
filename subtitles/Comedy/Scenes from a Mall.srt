{2591}{2653}- What are you telling me?|Fifty bucks is not enough|for three days?|- No.
{2655}{2746}- Fifty bucks is not enough.|- No.|- We need dinner. We need lunch.|We need video games.
{2748}{2845}Well, forget it. You're not gonna get|that. And every time you roll your eyes,|it's gonna be ten bucks less.

{2898}{2962}- That's...|- Forty bucks?|- Yeah, yeah. And you give me|that look, it's 30 bucks.

{3538}{3587}Take care of her.|And let her... Let her... You know...

{4382}{4455}We've procreated, and now we can die.
{4457}{4563}Debbie, tell the guy that delivers|the newspaper not to, you know...|He's gotta put it in a plastic bag.
{4565}{4643}- Honey, I've told you a million times,|no more plastic.|- It's moist. It's moist.
{4645}{4722}- I know. It's moist,|but it's also non-biodegradable.|- Look at the thing.
{4724}{4823}- We can't do this any more.|- I'm starting to feel guilty|that I didn't give them enough money.
{4825}{4886}Well, Nick, they have to have|a sense of the real world.
{4888}{4949}So why am I so guilty about it?|I know what you're gonna tell me...
{4951}{5002}That l... That l... That I have to be|the loved one all the time.
{5004}{5058}Well, you don't mind being|the bad guy in business.

{5863}{5937}Phillip... I'm gonna put here at|the end, otherwise he'll|hog the entire conversation.
{5939}{6017}Well, the only way this guy w-won't|hog the conversation, I promise you...
{6019}{6078}is if you don't invite him,|'cause he's just gonna rant on.
{6080}{6152}Oh, Arthur said he... he couldn't come.|He called to say so.
{6154}{6204}What... Arthur's at a s...|a "Save the Bats" convention.
{6206}{6263}You hear about that?|He's in Houston.
{6265}{6362}Isn't that incredible? Suddenly bats|are... are vital for the ozone layer.
{6364}{6412}I'll bet ya Phillip told him that.
{6414}{6489}Let me tell you something. If Phillip|starts in with me one more time...
{6491}{6582}I promise you, about "New York is|the cultural centre of the world"...
{6584}{6654}and "Los Angeles is...|is a barren desert"...

{6846}{6894}I was hoping you'd say that.
{6896}{6967}Do you have any interest at all in|making love? Can I interest you in that?
{6969}{7027}Do we have the time? I thought|we were gonna take a brisk walk.
{7029}{7093}You know, we always do it|on the anniversary.
{7095}{7165}- Okay. If we hurry, we can do both.|- Well, I'll hurry.
{7222}{7292}{Y:i}... to be able to enjoy what I have|coming up for you, it's this.
{7294}{7411}{Y:i}Take a look at this ring.|It's the most beautiful|cocktail ring you've ever seen...
{7413}{7467}{Y:i}in a graceful waterfall design.
{7469}{7511}{Y:i}- It's set with both the baguette...|- The sound of ripping Velcro.
{7513}{7607}That's the quintessential|sound of the 80's, right?
{7609}{7691}- Or is this the 90's?|- Honey, I don't know.|- I can't get the decades straight.
{7693}{7741}Do you think I should put Nora|next to Daniel?
{7743}{7810}Yeah. You had to mention it.

{8219}{8268}Okay. Oh, g... Hey...
{8394}{8442}Oh, you...

{9401}{9478}No. No, you're not calling me|at a bad time, Elizabeth.
{9480}{9528}You know you can always call me.
{9555}{9603}Oh, I see.
{9605}{9687}Well, we discussed that, didn't we?
{9689}{9801}L-l-It's natural that there|would be a period of mourning|in a situation like this.
{9838}{9887}Yes, I know he acted|inappropriately...
{9889}{9968}but you cannot control|how another person acts.
{9970}{10036}You can only control how you act.
{10075}{10162}I see. Well, listen.|Elizabeth, if...
{10164}{10214}You know, that's|an excellent idea, Elizabeth.
{10216}{10299}Why don't you, um, call your friend|and see if you can visit her?
{10301}{10350}But don't hesitate if you need me.
{10352}{10400}Yes. My service can get me anywhere.
{10402}{10476}All right. You know,|Elizabeth, you're doing fine.
{10478}{10526}You're welcome. Bye-bye.
{10528}{10590}Oh, that poor excuse for a husband|left her three months ago.
{10592}{10643}She's finally starting to feel it.
{10645}{10718}They should give you double|when they bother you on the holidays.
{10720}{10771}Oh! Oh! L...

{11535}{11624}M... Mrs Fong... No, no, n-no.

{12577}{12638}- Did Cindy get you yesterday?|- Mm-hmm. She called my office.
{12640}{12753}- See, I think she wants|a recommendation.|- And I suggested Branfman,|'cause he's so good with couples.
{12755}{12803}L-It's the second marriage|for both of them, you know?
{12805}{12870}- It'd be great if it could work out.|- Yeah. I love them both.
{12872}{12922}- They deserve it.|- Mm-hmm.
{12924}{12981}I was thinking about this|the other day.
{12983}{13075}The... The two of us,|in all our, you know...
{13077}{13172}in our whole group, we're the only two|that have been married for so long|to the same husband and wife.
{13174}{13269}- Well, what about Isaac and Nora?|They've been married for a long time.|- Isaac and Nora, sure.
{13271}{13335}But Isaac and Nora live in two separate|cities for the last nine years...
{13337}{13396}so, you know, it's easy for them|to relate to one another.
{13398}{13463}- You can't count them.|- We are pretty amazing, huh?
{13465}{13519}- Yeah, I know.|Sixteen years is a modern record.|- Yeah.
{13521}{13569}Seventeen. Seventeen.
{13571}{13634}Seventeen. Right. So we count the year|we lived together as seventeen years?
{13636}{13705}- I always do.|- I know. I always... I repress that.
{13707}{13790}- Why? It was a great year.|- I don't know. 'Cause... 'Cause|you didn't want to split the rent.
{13829}{13911}- Congratulations.|- Oh, you too.
{13913}{13991}- What do you attribute|it to? Our... Our...|- Professionally?|- Yeah, yeah.
{13993}{14079}- Or any way at all. You know,|what's the secret of our longevity?|- Oh, I don't know. Let me think.
{14117}{14214}- I have my own theory about this.|- Commitments. You know what?|I have to admit it.
{14216}{14267}- It's a mystery. I have no idea.|- Is it?
{14269}{14317}- No, I have no idea.|- 'Cause I have a definite theory.|- What's that?
{14319}{14406}- Can I say what it is?|- Sure. It's... It's|the meaningless little things.
{14408}{14476}It's the corny things.|It's-It's-It's, you know, the kids...
{14478}{14543}and... and, um,|our memories together...
{14545}{14603}and the fact that we take trips|and laugh at the same thing.
{14605}{14665}- You know, the... the corniest things.|- Oh, really?
{14667}{14747}Yeah. A-A-Actually, when I|was outside just now with Sam...
{14749}{14806}You know, I was helping him,|y-you know, load his skis...
{14808}{14873}l... You know, the kid's practically a|man, and I wanted to just pick him up...
{14875}{14961}and kiss him and hug him,|and the same with Jennifer and you.
{14963}{15041}- You know? L-I know this sounds...|unbelievably corny.|- Oh.
{15043}{15099}Oh, no. More, more, more, more, more.
{15126}{15199}- Oh, that's the family line.|- Don't get it. Y-You know...
{15201}{15248}- Let's just leave it.|- It could be about tonight though.
{15386}{15494}Hello. Hi. Hi, how are you?
{15496}{15552}Yes. Oh, thank you.
{15554}{15647}Yes, thank... It's Sheila. She's...|She's wishing us a happy anniversary.
{15649}{15697}- Thank... Yes.|- Hi, Sheila.
{15699}{15793}To... Uh... Tonight,|about seven-thirtyish, I would say.
{15795}{15845}Right. Uh-huh. No, it's gonna be...
{15847}{15920}It's... It's gonna be an oriental motif,|so it'll be, you know...
{15922}{16003}What we're discussing here basically|is sushi. So you should bring...
{16005}{16073}You should bring Kirin Light|if you're gonna bring anything.
{16075}{16141}Right. Oh... Oh, incidentally...
{16143}{16191}you know, we're gonna be|seating you next to Phillip...
{16193}{16243}so... so you'll want to bring|your earplugs.
{16245}{16308}L... I just thought I'd warn you.|I know how you feel about that.
{16310}{16417}Okay. Okay, yes.|Uh... Listen, I love you too.
{16419}{16501}I love Sheila. I just wish she were|a little less anxious.
{16503}{16553}- Well, I like her|exactly the way she is.|- Uh-huh.
{16555}{16606}I think you like her 'cause|she's got a great body.
{16608}{16663}Sheila has a great body?|You must be joking.
{16665}{16715}- Oh, you rat.|- She's your best friend.
{16717}{16803}- More your friend these days,|ever since we went to China together.|- No, it's...
{16805}{16874}Remember how the two of you took|that long hike up the Great Wall?
{16876}{16947}I have nothing to wear. You guys|didn't come back for four hours.
{16949}{17007}- You had the flu, remember that?|- Well, so did she!
{17009}{17090}And ever since she broke up|with Claude... gee, whiz...|it's hard to keep her out of the house.
{17092}{17168}Claude was a moron, a complete moron.
{17170}{17219}You don't think I had a thing|for Sheila, do you?
{17221}{17330}No, not at all.|Well, hmm, maybe just a little.
{17332}{17406}Well, you know, some affection|for friends is a natural thing.
{17408}{17460}- Did you put your tennis racket|on my good shoes?|- Yeah. Yeah.
{17462}{17538}I like to keep it up there on your...|on your underpants, you know?
{17540}{17621}Brings me luck. You know,|you were the one that wrote...
{17623}{17683}"As long as you don't act|on those affectionate feelings."
{17685}{17774}You know what I wish? We could spend|our anniversary alone, just once.
{17776}{17855}We're gonna be alone. We'll be alone,|you know, till 6:00 tonight...

{28814}{28928}{Y:i}Marriage began when life expectancy|was not even 30 years.
{28930}{28995}{Y:i}Therefore, a modern marriage|has to be several marriages.

{29960}{30020}It's full of interesting insights|about marriage and...
{30022}{30087}Here, you can turn to any page. Like|"The Joy of Fidelity." Look at that.

{30764}{30832}- Y-Y... My heart was pounding|back there.|- What for?
{30834}{30913}Listen, I can't help it if you wrote|a hugely successful book.
{30915}{30974}But you know my... my feelings|about cheap publicity.
{30976}{31034}There's competition.|This is what everybody does.
{31036}{31084}- You didn't have to buy another book.|- It's a reality.

{31144}{31226}Believe me, with their marriage, they|could use a half dozen copies of this.
{31228}{31276}I still think it was hostile.
{31278}{31331}Okay, it was hostile. L... You know,|I don't know what came over me.
{31333}{31395}I suddenly, you know,|was possessed or something.
{31397}{31485}- L-I've been feeling|very strange lately.|- Nick, there's a difference between|a hostile act and a hostile person.

{41224}{41291}and, you know, in the... in the elevator|when we made it, you know.
{41293}{41361}- Is that what you did with her?|- A little bit, yeah, at first.
{41363}{41447}But then it tapers off very quickly|to very, very nothing, nothing.
{41449}{41509}- Oh, nothing.|- You know... J... You know, routine sex.
{41511}{41566}Oh, like ours was this morning.
{41568}{41620}Fake, perfunctory.
{41667}{41725}- Do you love her?|- L...|- Do you wanna marry her?
{41727}{41800}- Hey, look, I told you,|this is over, so I don't wanna|make it a drawn-out thing.|- Did you love her?
{41802}{41871}- Did you want to marry her?|- L... I couldn't marry her.|I was married.
{41873}{41927}- Yes or no?|- How could I marry her?|- No, of course not.
{41929}{41986}Believe me, no. I mean...
{41988}{42048}- You never told her you loved her?|- No... I might have. Yes, I might have.
{42050}{42118}- But I didn't love her.|I'm... I'm not even sure...|- Then you lied to her too?
{42120}{42199}- I didn't lie. You tell people things,|you know, in the heat of passion.|- Oh, then you did love her.
{42201}{42293}I didn't love her. L... l...|l... I liked her. I loved the sex.
{42295}{42409}Oh. You love me,|but you only like the sex.
{42411}{42498}No. L... I love our sex,|but after 16 years, you know...
{42500}{42569}y-you must admit, in every family,|it gets very routine.
{42571}{42626}You know, it becomes|like two zombies.
{42673}{42743}- Look, I told you, it's over.|What are you... What are you...|- Then why are you telling me now?
{42745}{42837}- What... Deborah,|what's the difference? I'm trying to...|- You're guilty, and you|want me to exonerate you.
{42839}{42897}Hey, can l...|May I tell you something?
{42899}{42987}Hold it. Before you get too wound up,|just... Let me point...|This is your book, right?
{42989}{43045}This is your book. I'm... I'm giving you|a very, very good source in here.
{43047}{43120}So... So... One second.|One second. But listen to this.
{43122}{43197}"You cannot carry a large lie|through a marriage...
{43199}{43247}because a large lie,|like an untreated cancer...
{43249}{43312}will continue to grow until you|or the relationship dies."
{43314}{43391}- This is you writing. This is your...|You don't believe your own...|- It's Sheila, isn't it?
{43393}{43447}How can it be Sheila?|Would I do that to you? Of course not.
{43449}{43516}It's a total stranger.|Someone you don't know.
{43518}{43578}- How old is she?|- Her age was an accident.
{43580}{43653}- How old?|- Twenty-five.
{43655}{43736}She's very brilliant. Uh, a painter.|Creative and very, very lovely.
{43738}{43801}- A painter.|- She... A paint... She paints.|- How interesting.
{43803}{43860}She paints the sports pictures|that you hate, okay?
{43862}{43932}- And... And how'd you meet this|very bright, creative painter?|- That's the...
{43934}{43988}I met her in Chicago. What's|the difference? L... l... You know...
{43990}{44055}I was... I was doing a deal for...|for... her husband.
{44057}{44107}He was... He was being traded|to the Chicago Cubs.
{44109}{44179}And then they had a bad marriage|and... and it... it was messy.
{44181}{44259}And she was vulnerable, and I was, at|the time, I guess. I don't know. But...
{44261}{44327}- What's her name?|- Her name you gotta know?|What do you have to know her name?
{44329}{44401}- What are you gonna do, call her?|- She knew my name, didn't she?
{44403}{44457}- What's hers?|- Ed.
{44517}{44568}- Ed?|- Ed. Ed. Yes, Ed. Ed.
{44570}{44678}- What's so strange? Edwina is her name.|- Edwina?
{44709}{44771}I know. I know.
{44773}{44827}Oh, Nick.
{44865}{44924}What a lost boy you are.
{45048}{45097}- I'll bet you feel better now, huh?|- I do.
{45099}{45169}I'll tell you, I feel 100% better.|'Cause l... You know...|I didn't know how to broach this.
{45171}{45219}I've been trying|to bring this up for weeks.
{45221}{45315}- But you couldn't|until yesterday at 4:30.|- Right. Exactly.
{45317}{45386}4:30 I was able to bring it up.|Who knew how you would react?
{45388}{45440}You know, a lot of wives|would not understand this.
{45442}{45514}You know, they would th... make a big|thing out of it. But... But, you know...
{45516}{45585}The thought of remarrying|is such a sophisticated concept.
{45587}{45638}- I love you. I really, really love you.|- Oh, honey.
{45682}{45756}You are the most callow, selfish...
{45758}{45855}short sighted son of a bitch|who has ever lived!
{45857}{45943}I hope you fry in hell, shithead!
{46085}{46175}- Give me the car keys.|I said, give me the car keys!|- Where are you going?
{46177}{46228}First, I'm gonna call everyone|and let them know the party's off.
{46230}{46325}- Then I'm gonna find myself a lawyer!|- I'm a lawyer.
{46327}{46392}{Y:i}- Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer|- Hi, this is Cindy Lipman.
{46394}{46483}{Y:i}- In the holiday spirit, I'm offering|you the original soundtrack recording...|- Had a very shiny nose
{46485}{46567}{Y:i}- of Gene Autry singing|"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."|- And if you ever saw it
{46569}{46631}{Y:i}- Leave your message at the beep.|- You would
{46633}{46699}Cindy, I can't explain now,|but the party for tonight's off.
{46701}{46783}And my marriage is also off. All right?|Let everybody know. Goodbye.

{46868}{46946}{Y:i}- Farewell, my own true love, true love|- My honey
{46948}{47024}{Y:i}I'm gonna go away and leave you
{47026}{47111}{Y:i}- Never to see you any|- Never gonna see you any more

{48642}{48695}Deborah. Deborah. Deborah, where...
{48697}{48751}I was looking all over...
{48753}{48820}What are you doing? What's the matter|with you, you... Are you blind?
{48822}{48869}She can't... The woman can't move!
{48871}{48932}I'll kill you, I swear.|I've killed before. I'll...
{48934}{48982}Oh, Deborah. Deborah. Deborah.
{48984}{49048}Move... Let me... Let me drive.|You're in no condition to drive.
{49050}{49140}Let me take over. Get that space.|Pull... There's a... There's a space.
{49142}{49199}Get... Get over there, quickly!
{49320}{49368}- Deborah. Deborah, we have to talk.|- Go away!
{49370}{49418}- No, I don't want to go away.|- There's no point.|- What do you mean?
{49420}{49512}- There's always a point in talk...|- Adultery is never about|the third party.
{49514}{49575}It's about the original couple.|It's about us!
{49577}{49637}- You were sending me a message!|- What kind of message?
{49639}{49706}- What kind of message? L...|She was available. I was... I was weak!|- I can't believe you...
{49708}{49764}I can't believe you threw away|everything we had.
{49766}{49857}Would you stop saying that?|I didn't throw away anything.
{49859}{49922}- Hey, put yourself together.|- It's jealousy, isn't it?
{49924}{50020}- Jealousy of what? What... What...|What am I jealous of?|- My success. My book.
{50022}{50101}L... I'm proud of your book.|L... l... I told you that.
{50103}{50167}- I'm... I'm...|- You started life as a public defender.
{50169}{50231}L... I like what I'm doing.|I told you that. I'm proud of it.
{50233}{50306}I don't care. I like negotiating|for the Chargers and the Athletics.
{50308}{50366}It's fun, and I like the money.|I don't care about the...
{50368}{50474}I'm happy to get the money. And I give|to the-the ACLU, and I give to Amnesty.
{50476}{50529}- I'm proud of the money. I don't care.|- Yes, but deep down!
{50531}{50584}- Yes...|- Deep down!|- Deep down, no...|- Yes!
{50586}{50642}- Will you stop it? You...|- No!|- You're embarrassing me.
{50644}{50692}You don't have to be|a shrink all the time.
{50694}{50811}Can't things just be sometimes|exactly what they seem on the surface?
{50813}{50912}All right, all right. I'm... I'm... So I'm|normal. So once in a while I'm jealous.
{50914}{50962}Did you know...|Y-Y-You'll be at a party...
{50964}{51015}- and everyone will be, you know,|fussing over your book...|- Okay. All right.
{51017}{51070}- They'll be... They'll be making...|- It's over. It's over.|- Why is it over?
{51072}{51145}- Because that's what you want!|- What l... What I want?
{51147}{51202}- What l... I don't want it.|- It's classical. You had an affair...
{51204}{51272}to sabotage the relationship because|you couldn't confront me directly.
{51274}{51340}I was the one who brought it up. I|wanted to start over and tell the truth.
{51342}{51411}- You were the one|who was out getting laid.|- So read your own book.
{51413}{51465}Seventy-five percent of married couples|have adultery, but...
{51467}{51519}I thought we were in the other 25%.
{51521}{51586}It's over.
{51588}{51651}- Where you going?|- To get a cab.
{51653}{51730}- That's ridiculous, Deborah.|I'll drive you.|- No you won't.
{51732}{51830}You're crazy. Uh, look... Okay, I made a|mistake. Statistics are bullshit, okay?
{51832}{51920}- I was wrong to bring that up.|You know, it's... it's my adultery.|- Why are you kidding yourself, huh?
{51922}{51980}- It's over.|- I don't want it to be over.
{51982}{52057}What do you want? Another 16 years|of lying to each other?
{52059}{52177}- The mature thing is to|get out now while we're both|still young enough to start over.|- I don't want to get out now.
{52179}{52236}All right, have it your way.|I can't debate this argument.
{52238}{52302}- What about the children?|- Children? That's a good one.
{52384}{52476}- Debbie, will you stop this?|You can't get a cab in Los Angeles.|- Oh, of course you can.
{52478}{52543}Look, you're gonna throw|everything away...|the whole marriage... for one lousy...
{52545}{52622}Four! It was four by your count.|Who knows how many it really was?
{52624}{52687}It was... Deborah, the first three|were nothing. It was... Would l...
{52689}{52768}- How can you ever expect me|to trust you again?|- L... Yeah. I don't know what to say.
{52770}{52833}- You... You're making a mountain|out of a molehole.|- You can't even give me a reason!
{52835}{52922}- I can't...|- How do you expect...|Where's your present?
{52924}{52996}- What do you mean?|- Your surfboard!|- I don't know.|- Somebody's going to take it.
{52998}{53092}- I bought it three months ago.|I had them engrave your|name on the damn thing!|- What are you...
{53246}{53317}{Y:i}We three kings of Orient are
{53319}{53396}{Y:i}Bearing gifts we traverse afar
{53398}{53474}{Y:i}Field and fountain|Moor and mountain
{53476}{53552}{Y:i}Following yonder star
{53554}{53599}{Y:i}Wise men from|the shepherd to the lamb
{53601}{53647}{Y:i}Pack your bags|Shoot to Bethlehem
{53649}{53696}{Y:i}Yo, gee, are we men or mice
{53698}{53742}{Y:i}Find that baby|by the name of Christ
{53744}{53792}{Y:i}You can't stop me|No man or beast
{53794}{53842}{Y:i}I see a star shining from the East
{53844}{53892}Safe.
{53919}{53968}But I ruined the picture.
{53970}{54043}You know what I should do? I should have|them deliver this. This is cumbersome.
{54045}{54104}What are you talking about? I thought|you wanted to take it to Malibu.
{54106}{54174}- You'll never get it this weekend.|It's Christmas!|- It's... It's not such a big deal.
{54176}{54285}- I don't have to have it.|I'll live without it for a second.|- Maybe I could have Nora's|handyman come and p...
{54287}{54353}- Oh, Deborah.|- Don't touch me. I'll kill you.|I'll kill you, I swear.
{54469}{54517}Why did you do this to me?
{54519}{54605}You've ruined my life.|Oh, God.
{54607}{54669}I'm sorry, Deborah. L...|It... It was a mistake.
{54671}{54739}I made a mistake.|What do you want me to say?
{54741}{54800}- Is that you or me?|- Me.|- It's you, yeah.
{54802}{54853}- No, you don't have to go.|- Let me alone.
{54880}{54917}Just alone. Get it?
{55211}{55276}I'm sorry your friends|weren't home, Elizabeth.
{55308}{55381}No. No, I don't think Valium|is the solution.
{55445}{55494}Oh, that's an excellent idea.
{55496}{55583}Go to the museum for the Russian|Futurist show. Very good idea.
{55631}{55684}Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.
{55686}{55740}My nose is a little stuffed up,|that's all.
{55788}{55846}Of course you can.|You can call me anytime.
{55896}{55944}Elizabeth, you'll be fine.
{55946}{56038}Just stay away from the Valium.
{56040}{56090}All right. Goodbye.
{56092}{56157}That was very touching. You know,|I thought you handled that great.
{56159}{56232}- Come on. I'll drive you home.|- I'm not going home.
{56234}{56295}- I'm going to Marty Lefkowitz's office.|- Marty?
{56297}{56369}- You're gonna see Marty tonight|at the party.|- No, I won't. The party's off.
{56371}{56477}- Remember? What, did you think I was|going to act out some humiliating|charade in front of our friends?|- No. Who wants to act out a charade?
{56479}{56529}Besides, I need a lawyer.
{56531}{56583}A lawyer?|Why do you need a lawyer? So soon?
{56585}{56633}What's the matter with you?|When did you think I was going to do it?
{56635}{56698}What are you talking about?|And Marty Lefkowitz she picks?
{56700}{56772}- You won't accept real...|- That's who you would use? That's who|you'd use for a lawyer, Marty Lefkowitz?
{56774}{56876}- A guy who's been sanctioned|by the bar three times?|- Look, whom I choose for a lawyer|is my business. You got that?
{56878}{56948}- L... Are you serious?|- Yes, I'm serious.
{56950}{57008}You... You're kidding. Marty Lefkowitz?
{57010}{57097}That's... Th-Th-That's who you|would pick for a lawyer, my, you know...
{57099}{57167}- l... I just...|- You got a better recommendation?|- Yes. Yes, I do. Me.
{57169}{57217}- That's who you should use.|- You?
{57219}{57267}- Yes, if you're serious about this.|Why... Why not? Why not?|- You!
{57269}{57326}It's just possible that you|lack objectivity, that's all.
{57328}{57412}- I lack objectivity? Thank you.|- Enjoy.
{57414}{57509}- Deborah, this is y-y-your,|you know, your favourite.|- For some reason, I don't have|much of an appetite.
{57511}{57638}Yeah, I know... What's... Look, we...|This is California, right?|So it's community property anyhow.
{57640}{57704}So everything's gonna be split|down the middle. Use your head.
{57706}{57796}And you know I'm not gonna screw you|when it comes to the kids|because I'm crazy about them.
{57798}{57887}Stop for a second. So this is... I'm|talking a savings of 30,000 bucks here.
{57889}{57952}- That's if we don't go to court even.|- I can't believe I'm hearing this.
{57954}{58003}Hey, try me, okay?|What have you got to lose?
{58005}{58084}Nothing. Just my shirt, my livelihood,|my house and my children.
{58086}{58179}Hey, look, w-we'll discuss it.|If you think it's unfair...|Deborah. Deborah, wait one second.
{58181}{58273}If you think it's unfair,|then go get Marty Lefkowitz,|get Marvin Mitchelson, whoever you want.
{58275}{58358}You're just using this|as an excuse to stay in contact.|I've seen it 100 times with my patients.
{58360}{58440}You're wrong. I'm... I'm s... doing this|to save us money, I promise you.
{58442}{58532}- You really wanna do this?|- I do. L-l-I'm the guy.
{58534}{58599}- All right. Right now.|- Now you wanna do it?
{58601}{58669}Right now. I don't want to live|with this hanging over my head.
{58671}{58760}If I don't see you again at the end|of today, it'll be just heaven for me.
{58762}{58834}If you've got any trick up your sleeve,|I'd like to know it now.
{59048}{59109}- Two... Two... Two margaritas.|- I don't want a margarita.
{59111}{59203}- No salt. Two.|- I won't drink it. I don't want it.
{59205}{59285}It's... It's... It's okay. I'll... I'll...|I'll... I'll drink them both. No salt.
{59368}{59431}Soft talk, alcohol.|Next you'll be buying me flowers.
{59433}{59538}- It's not gonna change my mind.|- So, let me... let me get this.
{59540}{59590}I know you're... you're anxious.
{59619}{59672}Um, what we should start with,|I guess...
{59674}{59765}is a list of all the, uh...|all the community property stuff...
{59767}{59815}uh... we... all the stuff|that we acquired...
{59817}{59895}prior to residency in|a community property state.
{59897}{59971}- You mean, like|the Early American breakfront?|- Mm-hmm.
{59973}{60089}We should also write down our debts|and our outstanding bills...
{60091}{60162}a list of my estate...
{60164}{60232}with the welfare and the pension.
{60234}{60324}{Y:i}- We should decide, uh, actually|what we're gonna do with the house.|- Dos margaritas.
{60326}{60410}You know, 'cause it's a... We have|a number of options. Uh, thank you.
{60412}{60476}Uh, one thing we can do, if you like...
{60478}{60595}is, uh, sell the house|and divide the profit.
{60597}{60710}A possibility. Uh, another possibility|for us would be, um, to...
{60712}{60802}- Take this.|We're not gonna eat anything.|- I think we should call the kids|and tell them now.
{60804}{60906}What is "now?" Why... Why...|Today is so urgent all of a sudden.|They're on vacation.
{60908}{60958}They have a right to know their parents|are getting a divorce.
{60994}{61083}Well, now... You know... Now I feel like|the... the scumbag of all time.
{61085}{61133}You are.
{61170}{61234}- You want another... another...|Give her another one.|- Why not?
{61236}{61339}You know, l... I want one... I want|another one too. You can leave mine.
{61666}{61714}The wicker chest.
{61716}{61764}It's from my mother.
{61814}{61890}- The folding chairs.|- Well, I should keep|the folding chairs...
{61892}{61990}because I have the Formica table,|and they go with the Formica table.
{61992}{62046}See?
{62048}{62123}- The pole lamps.|- Oh, you can have the pole lamps.
{62150}{62199}The "Free Angela Davis" posters.
{62201}{62283}- I don't want 'em.|- The rolltop desk.
{62285}{62396}- Nick, that was your birthday present.|- Was it?
{62398}{62455}Yes. Don't you remember?
{62457}{62576}We bought it in that antique shop|in Oxford. Gosh, don't you remember?
{62662}{62751}- Was that my present?|- I remember.
{62753}{62829}- I do remember. We missed the train.|- That's right.
{62831}{62879}- To London, right?|Was I right about that?|- Mm-hmm.
{62881}{63007}- And then we... s... we... we mired down in|that dreadful bed and breakfast place.|- The bed and break...
{63009}{63081}- Oh, that was the worst.|- But the leaky toilets|and the 500 cats.|- Right. And remember...
{63083}{63174}we s... we were up all night 'cause I|couldn't find any coins for the heater.
{63176}{63257}- That was, uh... That was|adorable in a way.|- It was fabulous. Great.
{63259}{63331}- We were 23 at the most, right?|- No, 24.
{63333}{63399}Twenty-four. So... So where did we...|Where did we get the balls...
{63401}{63470}to buy a rolltop desk|with that kind of money?
{63472}{63520}Amazing.
{63552}{63600}The Persian rug.
{63602}{63662}The one in the dining room|or the one in the foyer?
{63664}{63723}The one from law school...
{63725}{63792}Artie Sims threw up|the... the spaghetti sauce on.
{63842}{63894}Artie Sims.
{63896}{63945}Hey, are you sure you wanna|go through with this?
{64005}{64067}This was your idea.
{64069}{64117}I know... You know, but...
{64159}{64213}If you can't handle it,|I'm gonna get myself another lawyer.
{64215}{64331}I can handle it. It's fine. There was|this... You know, so when l... when I said|the Persian rug, I got a little twinge.
{64333}{64438}You know what? This is crazy.|We're just kidding ourselves.
{64475}{64579}- Hey, I said I can handle it.|I can handle it.|- This isn't fair to either one of us.
{64581}{64629}- Deborah, I can handle this.|- I'm gonna get a cab.
{64631}{64686}- I think what we ought to do is...|- I said I can handle it.
{64688}{64769}- We ought not to speak|to each other for a while.|- What are you talking about suddenly?|- That's right.
{64771}{64826}- I tell you... Nick, what are...|- Hey.
{64828}{64893}- Nick, it's over. L-l...|- Don't say it.|- There's no trust any more.
{64895}{64955}The whole thing is over.|What I think you ought to do...
{64957}{65023}is you ought to go out, and you|ought to get yourself an apartment.
{65025}{65112}It's gonna be difficult|for a little while, but, you know,|I know we're gonna be friends again.
{65114}{65191}After we get over the resentment|and the pain, we'll be friends again.
{65193}{65275}Listen, thanks for|a great 16 years, honey.
{65277}{65325}- What are you saying?|- Bye-bye.
{65327}{65375}You... Wait a minute.|Deborah, wait a minute.
{65466}{65515}Wait.
{65517}{65587}Deborah... Deborah, please don't do this.|Don't do this. I need you.
{65589}{65666}- Nicholas...|- No, please listen to me.|- Nicholas... Nicholas, you'll be fine.
{65668}{65747}- No. No. No.|- You'll be fine. Your future|depends on yourself, not on me.
{65749}{65814}- No... You know... Is that what you|tell your patients sometime?|- People adjust.
{65816}{65864}At first they think|they're gonna die or something.
{65866}{65948}- But then, a few years later,|they're perfectly fine.|I've seen it 1,000 times.|- No. Deborah. Deborah...
{65950}{66000}- Calm down.|- I know a man's not|supposed to do this.
{66002}{66050}- I know that.|- Men can do anything they want.
{66052}{66112}Anything they want.
{66114}{66221}- I love you. I need you.|Don't do... Don't do this, please! Pl...|- Nicholas...
{66223}{66314}- I can't live without you.|- You can. You can, Nicholas. You can.
{66316}{66364}Nicholas...
{66403}{66483}Nicholas, breathe deeply.|Breathe deeply.|What's the matter with you people?
{66485}{66553}Don't you have anything better to do|than to watch a person in pain?
{66555}{66629}- This isn't a TV talk show.|- I'm ashamed.|- Two tickets for anything.
{66631}{66691}- For what show?|- Anything. Whatever's on now.
{66693}{66767}{Y:i}- All we've got is Salaam Bombay,|and it's ten minutes in.|- That's fine. That's fine.
{66769}{66821}Hang on. Hang on, Nicholas.|Thank you.
{66823}{66889}{Y:i}I saw Salaam Bombay. Deborah...
{66891}{66929}{Y:i}Two for Predator for the 4:00 show.
{67306}{67389}Jesus. When I see|these people in India...
{67391}{67476}my problems seem like|complete and total bullshit.
{67478}{67544}- Your problems are not|complete and total bullshit.|- Yes.
{67546}{67665}Besides, I can assure you, there are|plenty of men in India doing exactly|the same thing you did.
{67720}{67841}Let me tell you, this picture holds up|damn well for the second time.
{68093}{68143}It's a powerful picture.
{68190}{68282}Oh, Christ!|What do you want me to say, Deborah?
{68284}{68336}I don't... I don't...|I don't know how I could have done it.
{68338}{68391}You do know how|you could've done it.
{68393}{68448}Your needs were not being met.
{68450}{68537}- Maybe l... Maybe I was just giving|too much time to my patients.|- No, no, no.
{68539}{68609}That's not what it is.|It's, you know... Just...
{68611}{68672}God, it was so ridiculous.
{68674}{68774}L-l... I'm sorry. How could...|I don't know how you could forgive me.
{68776}{68869}- You have to forgive yourself.|- I can't! I can't.|- It's a problem of self-esteem.
{68871}{68946}You know, you come on strong|to the world, but you hate yourself.
{68948}{69048}And what better way|to-to deal with your hatred than|to take it out on your marriage partner.
{69050}{69133}- This is obvious,|and yet I still act shitty.|- Only in this case,|your wife became your mother.
{69135}{69228}- It's classical.|Think about your own mother.|- Shh!
{69230}{69304}- She never wanted me.|- At least not when you were an infant.|- No.
{69306}{69356}You remember how she was|when Sam was little?
{69358}{69418}- She refused to hold him.|- Right. I remember.
{69420}{69511}- It's no wonder you spent your life|looking for love and reassurance.|- Yes, I know. But I had it.
{69513}{69603}That's the point. I had love|and reassurance with you and|l-I blew it. I fucked it up.
{69605}{69664}That's because you didn't trust it.
{69666}{69766}You had something good.|You thought it was going to go away|so you sabotaged it before it did.
{69768}{69860}Right. Of course, that's-that's what|I'm used to. I'm used to that.
{69862}{69917}That's right.|Now you're getting real insight.
{69919}{70006}Of course. I'm used to a relationship|with no... with no... you know...
{70008}{70089}So what kind of way is that to be?|How can a person be that way?
{70124}{70182}Shh!
{70184}{70247}- Relax. Relax. Sit back.|- That feeling is coming back.
{70249}{70328}- I ruined our life, Deborah.|- No.|- Yes, I did.
{70330}{70389}- No, no, you didn't ruin it.|- I feel so terrible about it.
{70391}{70466}You didn't ruin it. It can get better,|but it's going to take a lot of work.
{70468}{70576}You know, you're a good man.|You really are. You really are.
{70578}{70634}- L... I betrayed us.|- Only once.
{70636}{70687}Four times I betrayed us.|Four times.
{70689}{70768}Once it mattered. How many in|a 16-year marriage can say that?
{70770}{70847}Tell me. Some of my patients|do it on their honeymoon!
{70849}{70895}- Deborah. Listen to me, Deborah.|- What, darling?
{70897}{70975}- Listen to me. I'm gonna try.|I promise you, I'll try.|- What, darling? Yes. Of course.
{70977}{71032}- But I can't do this by myself.|- No, of course you can't.
{71034}{71106}- I love you.|Don't you understand that?|- I need help. I need help.
{71108}{71222}- Deborah. Deborah, look at me.|- Oh, darling, I love you so much.|- Deborah. Deborah.|- I love you.
{71224}{71278}- Deborah.|- Oh, darling.
{71332}{71409}- Deborah.|- Oh, Nick. Nick, my darling.|- Oh, Deborah.
{71544}{71592}Oh, sweetheart.
{71693}{71746}- Deborah.|- Darling. Oh, my angel.
{71748}{71809}- Deborah. Deborah. Deborah.|- What? What? What?
{71811}{71857}I want you.
{71859}{71909}I want you now.
{72333}{72402}- Oh, my God!|- Shh!
{73263}{73311}That was amazing.
{73359}{73413}You wanna see another movie?
{73481}{73577}We should really get|the sushi for the party.
{73579}{73627}Yeah.
{74075}{74121}{Y:i}Salaam Bombay?
{74123}{74218}We want to make sure we get enough sushi|because it'd be a terrible thing|to-to not have enough.
{74220}{74268}- It'd be embarrassing|at our anniversary.|- Oh, honey.
{74270}{74402}We already spent $ 743|on this anniversary and...|and I'm absolutely exhausted.
{74404}{74483}- I feel great.|- Do you?|- Well, listen, if you're tired,|why don't you go sit in the atrium.
{74485}{74569}- I don't feel tired. I feel great.|- No, it's comfortable down there.|And I'll call Cindy.
{74571}{74627}- I love you.|- I love you.|- I adore you.
{74629}{74720}- All right, honey, hang onto this.|And I'll be right back.|- Let me have it. Okay.
{74722}{74788}{Y:i}Gene Autry singing|"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."
{74790}{74855}{Y:i}- Had a very shiny nose|- Leave your message at the beep.
{74857}{74933}Hi, Cindy, Deborah.|Cancel my previous message.
{74935}{74992}I know it sounds schitzy,|but I'll explain later.
{74994}{75052}Uh, just call everyone and tell them|that the party is still on.
{75054}{75123}And I'm crazy about Nick.|Sorry for the inconvenience.
{75125}{75187}All right.|I'll talk to you later. Bye.
{76791}{76849}- Norteña music from Chihuahua.|Remember?|- Yeah.
{76851}{76948}The-The train and the canyon|and the whole thing? Remember that|and how charming that was?
{76950}{77010}- Yeah.|- We should take the kids sometime.|That would be a great trip.
{77012}{77089}- You know, 'cause you always wanna|take 'em someplace where...|- I'm having an affair.
{77133}{77189}His name's Dr Hans Clava.
{77191}{77256}He's an expert in|family systems therapy...
{77258}{77321}a refugee from Brno,|Czechoslovakia, but he's...
{77323}{77444}but he's lived in the West|since he... since he defected in 1968.
{77446}{77512}You saw him in that|TV blurb in the bookstore...
{77514}{77562}the one with the beard.
{77618}{77737}I met him at that UC retreat|for mental health practitioners|in-in Arrowhead last-last spring.
{77739}{77839}He, uh... He was the guest lecturer.|He's 61 years old.
{77841}{77900}And he's just brilliant.
{77902}{77978}We went to dinner a few times and...
{77980}{78050}You know that fixation|I had on my father.
{78052}{78115}I guess I never worked it out.
{78117}{78224}So... So, we met during the year|every week or two...
{78226}{78274}sometimes not for a month.
{78276}{78337}I tried to end it three|or four times, but I couldn't.
{78339}{78386}I mean, I felt like I had used him.
{78388}{78442}And-And it wasn't fair.
{78444}{78572}And there were his feelings|to consider too. After all,|I mean, l-I got a lot out of it.
{78574}{78636}He helped me with the book.|And it wasn't just the sex.
{78638}{78719}Although the sex was...|the sex was... was good.
{78721}{78814}In fact, I'm not gonna lie to you.|The sex... The sex was incredible.
{78816}{78891}The man was insatiable.|But it wasn't about that.
{78893}{78994}It was more about|my growing up and becoming|a fully-integrated human being...
{78996}{79068}and working out|my relationship with my father.
{79070}{79187}Do you see? Something like that.|In any case, um...
{79189}{79253}l-l-l-I wanted to break up with him.
{79255}{79354}L-I couldn't break up with him.|L-I became terribly confused.
{79356}{79451}And, uh, I drifted|back and forth, you know.
{79453}{79559}At one time, I tried to tell you,|but you just didn't seem to be there.
{79561}{79611}Nick, it's not an accident...
{79613}{79673}that both of us were doing|the same thing at the same time.
{79675}{79771}How could it be? But it|started to become so painful.
{79773}{79869}So much shame, so much guilt.|The children, you.
{79871}{79933}I mean, I've just been a mess!
{79935}{80039}But finally, I know what I have to do.|I have to end it immediately, today.
{80041}{80098}Right now.|And that's what I'm going to do.
{80100}{80148}Oh, you've helped me so much.
{80150}{80198}All I wanna say is I love you.
{80200}{80288}And thank you. Thank you.
{80290}{80372}Well, what'll happen is...
{80402}{80450}I'll send for my clothes.
{80452}{80517}And you phone Marty Lefkowitz.
{80519}{80584}I'll use Herb Brenner as a lawyer.
{80586}{80639}And I'll call you.|And we'll have lunch.
{81386}{81461}{Y:i}- Gene Autry singing,|"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."|- Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
{81463}{81513}{Y:i}- Leave your message at the beep.|- Had a very
{81515}{81597}It's me again, Cindy.|Disregard my previous message.
{81599}{81663}Just call everybody and cancel.
{81943}{82030}Christ!|Where's my fucking Saab?
{82032}{82080}Oh, shit! I can't...
{82587}{82677}{Y:i}- Mr Santa, bring me some toys|- This is Dr Hans Clava,|the eminent family therapist.
{82679}{82751}{Y:i}Would you care to comment, Dr Clava,|on Dr Feingold-Fifer's book?
{82753}{82829}{Y:i}Well, as Dr Feingold-Fifer|so brilliantly points out...
{82831}{82945}{Y:i}the institution of marriage began when|life expectancy was not even 30 years.
{82947}{83025}{Y:i}Therefore, a modern marriage|has to be several marriages.
{83027}{83107}{Y:i}To survive, one has to make|a clean break with the past...
{83109}{83188}{Y:i}every six or seven years|and remarry each other.
{83190}{83247}{Y:i}This is a profound|and healing insight...
{83249}{83309}{Y:i}spoken from the heart of the author.
{83311}{83399}{Y:i}And I should know because|for the last year I have been|having an affair with the author.
{83401}{83499}{Y:i}Three times a week. She is fantastic.|I heartily recommend her.
{83501}{83596}{Y:i}Dr Deborah Feingold-Fifer,|I Do, I Do, I Do!
{83598}{83653}- Calm down!|- I'm calm.
{83655}{83745}Stop telling me to calm down. I'm calm.|I understand everything.
{83747}{83829}I was parked in a restricted zone|and I don't have a permit.
{83831}{83927}But I'm a cripple.|Can't you see that you're dealing|with-with a mental cripple here?
{83929}{83988}Anything goes with me. I'm... l...
{83990}{84068}Don't tell me it's, uh, uh,|the biggest shopping day of the year.
{84070}{84134}I don't wanna know that. I gotta|get the car back. Give me the car.
{84136}{84216}I gotta get the car back|and I don't want a lot of...|uh, a lot of tap dancing.
{84218}{84285}L... Don't just sit there.|I need the car. I need the vehicle.
{84287}{84353}I gotta get out of... Hey, I need|an aspirin. I gotta get an aspirin.
{84381}{84405}In the drugstore.
{84592}{84645}- Oh, my God!|- Are you okay?
{84647}{84715}- Would someone get a glass of water?|- What happened?|- Get a doctor.
{84717}{84799}- She's fainted.|- Excuse me. Excuse me.|- Somebody do something.|- I'm her husband.
{84801}{84881}- Look.|- Are you okay? Deborah?|Deborah, are you all right?
{84883}{84976}Deborah. My God. What happened?|Uh, could you please not... Go back.
{84978}{85044}- This is my wife. I can handle this.|- Not any more. He left me.|- No, no.
{85046}{85116}I'm her wi... I'm her husb...|I'm her husband, legally. We're still...
{85118}{85176}- I'm all right. Really, I'm all right.|- Take-Take two... Take two...|Don't stand up!
{85178}{85234}I'm-I'm... Here, here, let me just|have some of this. Here. Here. Here.
{85236}{85295}Drink this. Have...|Have some. You-You...
{85297}{85363}- I blacked out. Must be my blood sugar.|- Breathe deeply.
{85365}{85431}- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll be fine.|- Drink the water. Breathe...
{85433}{85497}- Thank you.|- I know, but I see you laying here|on the floor, I get alarmed.
{85499}{85578}- It's natural.|- I don't need your help.
{85580}{85666}Okay, okay!|I'm not, you know... I'm not... not...
{85668}{85716}- Jesus! I mean, what...|- You can go.
{85718}{85792}- Stop telling me I can go.|- I'm not your responsibility|any more, all right?
{85794}{85893}- I understand that, and I'm not yours.|That's not my point. I was concerned.|- That's a relief.
{85895}{85977}- Believe me, sixteen years...|sixteen years worth of relief.|- Seventeen.
{85979}{86054}Seventeen years. For Christ sakes,|what's wrong with you?
{86056}{86129}- And l-I don't have|to listen to you any more. Can l...|- Who said you had to listen?
{86131}{86180}- Can I have some Advil, please?|- I want one too.|- A bottle of Advil.
{86182}{86248}- What do you need Advil...|I was gonna get one and split it.|- I don't want to split it.
{86250}{86333}- What are you talking about? There's|250 in a jar. How many do you need?|- It's not a jar. It's a bottle.
{86335}{86400}- Two bottles of Advil.|- Two Advils.
{86402}{86494}- I don't know how|our marriage lasted so long.|- Mutual death wish.|- That'll be 8.95 each.
{86496}{86561}- Yeah, yeah, here. I'll pay for my own.|- It's been interminable.|Thank God we're getting a divorce.
{86563}{86624}- Give me that.|- I'll drink to that.
{86771}{86837}So, how do you feel now|that the thing's over?
{86839}{86931}- You feel relaxed? 'Cause I|feel... I feel completely relaxed.|- You know, I feel a lot better. Not bad.
{86933}{87026}- Yeah, it's a good feeling.|- I feel kind of weightless|like I was in a spa.
{87028}{87125}- Well, I wouldn't|overdo this if I were you.|- Like dancing in a way.
{87127}{87209}- Really? You never liked to dance.|- Well, so what? People change.
{87211}{87305}And you were always a lousy dancer|if you don't mind me saying so.
{87307}{87365}- What are you laughing at?|- Still at it.
{87367}{87455}- I don't mind.|Nothing you can say can hurt me.|- We can let it all hang out now.|You know, it's over.
{87457}{87507}- We can...|- What else about me bothered you?
{87509}{87566}- Go ahead. Take your best shot.|- You've gotta be kidding.
{87568}{87626}L-l... You know,|I could go on for days.
{87628}{87717}- Really?|- Just a numer...|Yeah. I've told you before.
{87719}{87767}- Go ahead.|- It's like... It's like nothing new.
{87769}{87830}Your... Your self-indulgent|fear of flying.
{87832}{87917}You know, your-your having to take|a valium and a martini...
{87919}{87984}just to get past security|on the aeroplane.
{87986}{88064}Searching your hair follicles|for grey roots, you know.
{88066}{88140}I beg your pardon.|I don't remember doing any such thing.
{88142}{88186}What do you mean you don't...|You gotta be kidding.
{88188}{88242}- And your interrupting me|all the time when I speak.|- Please.
{88244}{88336}In 16 years,|I've never finished a sentence.
{88338}{88390}- Go ahead, finish.|- I forgot what I was saying.
{88392}{88466}- Follicles.|We were talking about follicles.|- Okay, I got a good one. How about...
{88468}{88535}How about the way when you're nervous,|you-you chew Kleenex?
{88537}{88593}You actually eat it.|You swallow it.
{88595}{88676}It's endearing. In my case|it's endearing 'cause I don't...|I don't imbue it with any...
{88678}{88768}- Okay, here's a good one. How 'bout|when we make love, not in 16 years...|- I can't finish a sentence.|I can't finish a sentence.
{88770}{88827}Have we ever made love|unless the television was on.
{88829}{88940}- So what? I'm a guy who can do more|than one thing at a time.|- It's... No, you're not.
{88942}{89054}- Oh, Jesus. So was there...|There was nothing good about me?|- Oh, you had your moments, I suppose.
{89056}{89117}Like what?
{89145}{89224}- Like what?|- Oh, please, give me some room.
{89256}{89333}- Really? You wanna know?|- Yeah, well.|- Well...
{89370}{89434}Is this a tough question?|Because, uh...
{89436}{89513}- Well, you have|a decent sense of humour.|- Mm-hmm.
{89515}{89591}You care about people.
{89593}{89706}- Okay. And? Nothing else?|- And when you're not being|hostile and judgmental,|you're a pretty good father.
{89708}{89756}- When I think about it.|- No, you-you really are.
{89758}{89845}You-You are a good father. I have to|give you that. When you think about it.
{89847}{89936}- Okay, and you have|some good points too. You know,|I didn't mean to imply that...|- No kidding? Really?
{89938}{89980}- Yeah.|- When?
{89982}{90117}Well, I, you know... I have some...|I have some good memories of...|of things actually.
{90119}{90212}You know, when-when we'd... we'd...|we would travel, that was fun.
{90214}{90320}And... And when... when you would|sit in the car and sing|the Grateful Dead songs.
{90322}{90374}L... You know, for some reason...
{90376}{90457}I have a... a sweet memory of that.
{90459}{90572}And when my father died,|you were fabulous.
{90574}{90630}- I mean it. I'm not kidding about this.|You were... You were great.|- You know what? I was.
{90632}{90700}- Because my mother would've gone crazy.|I mean it, Deborah.|- Your mother was completely out of it.|She was a lunatic.
{90702}{90777}- You were really... You were really...|That was a very important thing to me.|- So you do. You have a lot|to be grateful for.
{90779}{90869}You know, 'cause... 'cause a person|needs to be taken care of sometimes.
{90871}{90926}And-And, you know,|you were a good mother.
{90928}{91031}- And you... loved the kids which is|really, really important to me.|- Oh, I do. I love those kids.
{91033}{91113}So, all right, okay, if you had it|to do all over again...
{91115}{91163}what would you do differently?
{91193}{91256}Uh, the truth?
{91283}{91357}No, a lie. Of course the truth.|We're talking.
{91359}{91462}- We're trying to be truthful.|- Well, okay, is... If-lf... If so then,|like, if I can be frank...
{91464}{91526}I would not...|I would not marry again at 24.
{91528}{91594}I mean, I think that's crazy.|I would wait till I was 40 or 45.
{91596}{91660}You know, and I would want to|live to a certain amount.
{91662}{91776}You know, I would want to travel|and see places that I've, you know...|that I haven't seen.
{91778}{91858}Machu Picchu and Bali. You know,|because I'm more exotically inclined.
{91860}{91944}I would like to meet some exotic women|and try some exotic things|with some exotic women.
{91946}{92043}- That would be fun for me.|- Oh.|- You know, and, um...
{92045}{92102}'Cause, you know, that's...|that's a young age to be married, 24.
{92104}{92229}It's crazy. Don't-Don't you|find this? You know, that 24-year-old|marriages don't last as a general rule?
{92231}{92289}- Statistically, no.|- Isn't that your experience? It's true.
{92291}{92422}- So, you know, I, uh... Listen.|- And then after that was over,|would you get married to me?
{92424}{92483}I don't think we would have met|if I lived like that. I think...
{92485}{92594}- You know, I think...|And if we did run into each other...|- Oh, why? Because I would be like|in-in a conservative square mode?
{92596}{92660}- I wouldn't meet anyone|as hip and cool as you?|- No. I mean...
{92662}{92723}It would have been a one-night stand|or something. I'm sure.
{92725}{92806}Listen. What's the difference?|We-We... You know, we found out now.
{92808}{92916}- And I think we're lucky.|You know, it's a miracle we lasted|this long, let me tell you.|- Amen, really.
{92918}{93006}- And we still have... we still have|plenty of time, I think, you know,|before we're old and decrepit.|- Well, l...
{93008}{93096}I'm not going to Machu Picchu,|I can tell you that.
{93098}{93184}You're afraid of heights|and not too adventurous.
{93257}{93326}- Excuse me. I'll be right back.|- Don't hurry.
{93328}{93402}{Y:i}So everybody say|Go, Santa, go, Santa, go
{93404}{93454}{Y:i}Go, Santa|Go, Santa, go
{93456}{93547}{Y:i}- Go, Santa, go, Santa, go|- Go, Santa, go, Santa, go
{93549}{93659}{Y:i}- Now let me hear you say|Go, Santa, go, Santa, go|- Go, Santa, go, Santa, go
{93661}{93725}{Y:i}And let me hear you say the break|Yo, the Christmas break
{93727}{93781}{Y:i}With a ho-ho-ho|and a bottle of rum
{93783}{93833}{Y:i}It's the break, yo|The Christmas break
{93835}{93891}{Y:i}It's a ho-ho-ho|and a bottle of rum
{93893}{93955}{Y:i}It's the break, yo|The Christmas break
{94000}{94086}Deborah, the guy went for it,|the whole thing, the whole 600,000.
{94088}{94147}Williams went for the whole thing.|You know, it's...
{94149}{94211}Danny Fong's gonna be|in tennis-brat heaven.
{94213}{94271}Well, don't... We should celebrate.|This is... Is this not fantastic?
{94273}{94374}- Good. Go call your girlfriend.|What's her name? Ed?|- Will you stop? That's-That's over.
{94376}{94463}- I'm talking seriously.|- Aw, poor Nicky, he hasn't got|anybody to celebrate with.
{94465}{94543}- Hey, look, I could do this by myself.|But this is big news.|- You certainly could.
{94545}{94616}- We'll-We'll get|some champagne or something.|- Champagne?
{94618}{94699}- Come on. Yeah, with a little caviar?|- What do I want champagne with you for?
{94701}{94801}Look, we'll celebrate. This is|half yours. This is not just me.
{94803}{94890}This-This deal was made|while we were still married.|So, fifty percent of it is you.
{94892}{94955}- Oh, all right.|That's a horse of another colour.|- Come on. This'll be fantastic.
{94957}{95025}- Let me get my...|Let me get my burdensome surfboard.|- Let's get some Thai food.
{95027}{95084}No! I'm talking champagne|and caviar, not Thai food.
{95086}{95172}- Champagne. Champagne and caviar?|- Yeah. Some black eggs, some-some...
{95174}{95229}All right, if we're gonna eat black eggs|I'm gonna get a new dress.
{95231}{95288}- I wanna look great.|- Whatever you want.|I'll get you whatever you want.|- No, it's all right.
{95290}{95340}I'll pay for it myself|out of my own half.
{95342}{95442}No alimony, no special stipends,|just plain vanilla child support...|a lot of it.
{95611}{95661}- Mrs. Feingold-Fifer?|- Oh, yes, yes!
{95663}{95754}- How's it going?|- Well...|- Oh, you look beautiful!
{95756}{95819}- Oh, that's fabulous.|- Look at you!
{95821}{95878}- What do you think?|- I love it.|- Have I crossed the line?
{95880}{95947}- Is it too much?|- No, it's radically sexy!
{95949}{96021}- Oh, you like it.|- I do. I think you look great.|- Well, it's an awful lot of money.
{96023}{96088}- But Fatima says it's absolutely me.|- No, I think it's wonderful.
{96090}{96194}Now I feel that I should get|something in-in... you know, to get|in the celebrating, uh, mode.
{96196}{96251}- Okay.|- I should get something trendy|and-and attractive too.
{96253}{96324}- Then we'll get caviar.|- Okay.|- Okay, so I'll go over to the...|to the atrium.
{96326}{96380}- Oh, yeah.|- And I'll meet you there.|- Well, you take your time...|- Okay.
{96382}{96443}'Cause I'm... I'm still shopping.
{96494}{96554}What'd he say?
{96556}{96619}- He likes it.|- I think it's fabulous.
{98299}{98376}- Well, look at you! Very nice.|- Me? Look at you!
{98378}{98442}- Italian?|- Yes, I picked this up at Bernini's.|- Oh, brother.
{98444}{98507}- Very sexy.|- But you're a... a rhapsody|in pumpkin chiffon.
{98509}{98594}- Look, you should have dressed|Italian a long time ago!|- Yeah? You think that's, uh...
{98596}{98679}- Would other women say that,|or is it just you? 'Cause I gotta...|I gotta start planning.|- Depends on the other woman.
{98681}{98744}- Well, what about|this little number over here?|- Obviously.
{98782}{98839}- Oh, let me get my...|my good prescription.|- Oh, you fancy her, do you?
{98841}{98918}- Yeah. Wow.|- Want me to set you up?|- You don't have to. I can handle that.
{98920}{98975}- Actually, she's probably|a little brainless for me.|- Brainless? Brainless?|- Yeah.
{98977}{99060}- Why? Because she's young and|blonde and beautiful?|- What can I say? It's an instinct.
{99062}{99128}- I think she...|she wouldn't be enough for me.|- Look, you're gonna have to|make up your mind.
{99130}{99190}- Well...|- I mean, there's a world of choices|out there for you midlife guys.
{99192}{99254}- And the demographics|are all in your favour.|- Midlife?
{99256}{99327}- Midlife! That's you.|- You're talking to the boy.|You gotta be kiddin'.
{99329}{99384}I got... I got... You know, most...|I'm still on the way up.
{99386}{99446}Oh? Well, how 'bout these|two gorgeous creatures coming|along right here?
{99448}{99496}- Oh. Yes, yes.|- Think you can handle them?
{99498}{99572}- Handle them? I could...|I could salivate on them.|- Mm-hmm.
{99574}{99636}- My God. Oh, look at that.|- Well, now's your chance.
{99638}{99686}- Yeah. This could be great.|- Want me to get lost?
{99688}{99759}- Well, it's starting to sound|like a better idea than, you know...|- Well, okay.
{99761}{99827}- They're adorable.|- Okay. Just don't forget|to practise, um...|- Yeah, I know. Safe sex, safe sex.
{99829}{99870}- You too.|- Oh, of course I will.
{99872}{99941}We'll get the... We'll get|the large economy family size condom.
{99943}{100034}You know, we can both use it.|It'll be... It'll be interesting.
{100036}{100150}You think I'm gonna endanger|my life just for some... younger man?
{100152}{100232}- Geez, talk about brainless.|- Who said anything about brains?|- This guy behind us.
{100234}{100321}Oh, no, you got that, right, with your|Otto... your-your Dieter guy... that Nazi?
{100323}{100418}He's not a Nazi.|He's a Czech. And his name is Hans.
{100420}{100494}Mm-hmm. Go ahead, make your move.|Go ahead.
{100526}{100596}- Nick!|- You can just grab the guy.|You can find out.
{100598}{100646}Oh, please.
{100711}{100764}This was the guy.|He's the guy for you.
{100766}{100846}- He was... He was clocking you|in the... in the elevator.|- I should be so lucky.
{100848}{100926}- No, you'd be perfect.|Older women are in.|- Will you stop calling me|an older woman?
{100928}{100992}You know, where are you gonna meet guys|if not through a friend?|How you gonna do it?
{100994}{101066}What about you? Planning on making|the rounds at the singles bars?
{101068}{101139}- I hadn't thought about it,|to tell you the truth.|- Well, you ought to think about it.
{101141}{101220}- What are you gonna do,|buy another garment?|- Maybe. What are you gonna do?
{101222}{101320}I mean, really? You gonna join a health|club? You gonna get a big fancy car?
{101322}{101414}You gonna have plastic surgery?|Go to a tanning salon?
{101416}{101493}What are you gonna do? You gonna, uh,|uh, take a cruise to Machu Picchu?
{101495}{101556}- You can't cruise to Machu Picchu.|- Oh, excuse me.
{101558}{101636}It would be very embarrassing.|No, I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be one|of those guys...
{101638}{101702}that... that buys a, um...|a personal ad.
{101704}{101752}- Really?|- Yeah, they're personals. Yeah.
{101754}{101830}- Which you can write for me|'cause you know me better than me.|- Oh, no problem.
{101832}{101931}Hey. "Straight single man experiencing|extreme mid-life crisis.
{101933}{101978}- Seeks second chance."|- Very depressing.
{101980}{102050}We'll wind up with people we know,|you know that, don't you?

{102420}{102500}- Don't forget Mother Fong.|To Mother Fong.|- The Fongs!
{102663}{102752}Deborah, I hope that you get|everything that you want out of life.|I really mean that.
{102754}{102846}I'm not joking now.|L... I just want you to have any-any|little thing your heart desires.

{102907}{102977}I want you to meet the man|of your dreams. That's important to me.
{102979}{103037}And may you find eternal love.
{103039}{103110}Thank you.
{103112}{103178}Really.
{103180}{103280}Come on.|For old time's sake. Come on.
{103568}{103636}{Y:i}You'd be
{103638}{103724}{Y:i}So easy to love
{103726}{103818}{Y:i}So easy to idolize
{103820}{103906}{Y:i}All others above
{104163}{104249}{Y:i}Oh, we'd be
{104251}{104331}{Y:i}So grand at the game
{104333}{104411}{Y:i}So carefree together
{104413}{104506}{Y:i}That it does seem a shame
{104508}{104565}{Y:i}Though you can't see
{104567}{104656}{Y:i}- So tell me.|You never answered my question.|- Your future with me
{104658}{104720}{Y:i}- 'Cause we'd be|- Debbie, you never... you never...
{104722}{104779}{Y:i}- So easy to love|- Tell me, which one of our friends...
{104781}{104835}which one of our friends|would you wind up with?
{104837}{104887}Oh, I like Daniel.
{104889}{104935}Daniel. Not Marty, right?
{104937}{105004}- 'Cause I always had that...|that secret fear that it was...|Well, Daniel doesn't turn me on.
{105006}{105078}- But Marty really doesn't turn me on.|- Oh, really?
{105080}{105148}- 'Cause Marty...|l-l-I always suspected Marty.|- He's big. He's a big man.
{105150}{105205}- He's cuddly.|- He needs to lose 50 pounds.
{105207}{105277}I'd be afraid to go to bed with him.|He'd crush me like a pea.
{105279}{105363}I always... I always feared...|I always suspected Marty.
{105426}{105474}Who's your "Miss Right?"
{105476}{105568}- No one... No one in our crowd.|- Oh, come on. Nora. Oh, she's perfect.
{105570}{105661}- You... You know me so little|after all these years.|- She's perfect. She has no breasts.
{105663}{105715}- You know me so little.|You know me so little.|- You're a breast man.
{105717}{105798}- You're not a breast man.|- Nora is the least interesting|of all the people we hang out with.
{105800}{105856}Well, what about Cindy?|She's cerebral.
{105858}{105911}Cindy's your best friend.|I couldn't do that to you.
{105913}{105969}Cindy... Cindy and Sheila,|that would be like incest.
{105971}{106025}I couldn't do it.|I couldn't do it to you.
{106027}{106116}No. It's singles bars, definitely.
{106118}{106185}- That's the... direction.|- Well, at least they're anonymous.
{106187}{106224}Yes.
{106226}{106296}- Blind dates are always a possibility.|- Blind dates are great.
{106298}{106380}You know, we can tell our|life story to total strangers|two or three nights a week.
{106382}{106458}- Oh, my God.|- It'll be fun, a little dreary,|but, uh, you'll get used to it.
{106460}{106543}- Introducing them|to the children afterward.|- I know, it's depressing.
{106545}{106613}- L-I know.|- It's tedious. It's unbearable.
{106615}{106687}So, to the future.
{106715}{106774}Many hopes and many dreams.
{106776}{106835}Thanks a lot.
{106949}{107028}Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
{107030}{107123}- Yeah, unfortunately, I probably am.|- Tell me. What?
{107125}{107206}I'm thinking that, you know...|that I'm stuck with you.
{107208}{107296}That-That... That you betrayed me|and that I'm... that I'm stuck with you.
{107298}{107366}- I betrayed you?|- I don't believe this.|- Well, that is a real good one.
{107368}{107488}- Yes, you betrayed.|You sure did betray me.|- That's a good one. I betrayed you?|What about you? Who betrayed me, huh?
{107490}{107538}- Don't think...|- What about your seven-month adventure|with a girl named Ed?
{107540}{107607}- At least I had the guts|to call it off!|- I was gonna call mine off.|- You're still...
{107609}{107689}- You're still out there doing it.|- I was going to call it off.|- Oh, stop it, stop it.
{107691}{107758}- What are you talking about?|It's still going on.|- Would you lower your voice, please?
{107760}{107826}- It's still going on. What are you...|- That's it. That's it. That's it.|- Here. Here.
{107828}{107881}- You can keep... keep the change.|- I quit. I don't have|to listen to this.|- Just a minute.

{108130}{108182}- Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me.|- Hey, what's your hurry?
{108184}{108246}Sweetheart, if you think you're|going someplace without me saying|what I want to say...
{108248}{108344}I have no interest in hearing|anything you have to say. And keep|your wife-battering hands off me!
{108346}{108394}- What are you gonna do,|make a citizen's arrest?|- Maybe I will!
{108396}{108478}- You would, right here|in front of all these people.|- You are the lowest, two-timing|sociopath that ever walked the earth.
{108480}{108527}- Let go of me!|- Will you please...|- Shut up and let go of me!
{108529}{108641}How did we get to this? I don't|understand. How did l... How did I|wind up with you? It's a joke. It's a...
{108643}{108732}- Why? Why did I ever have children|with anyone as shallow as you?|- Hey!
{108734}{108819}She's a very sick woman, folks.|Really sick.
{108821}{108909}- Let go of me! I said...|- What do your... What do your|patients do? You ever cure anybody?
{108911}{108983}Keep my patients out of it.|I help my patients.
{108985}{109083}I'm not wasting my life putting|people's names on tennis shoes.
{109085}{109135}- You're such a fraud.|Your whole life is a sham.|- Shut up, shut up, shut up.
{109137}{109223}- If you knew how many years|I've been dying to tell you|what I really think of you...|- Will you stop it? Stop it.
{109225}{109345}How many times I've had to bite|my tongue, how much shit I've had to|swallow not to hurt your feelings.
{109347}{109439}- Will you stop that? 'Cause I can say|some very ugly things to you.|- Oh, yeah? Like what?
{109441}{109540}Like if you had any idea how you looked.|If you had any notion what a silly...
{109542}{109599}You-You look like|my Aunt Minna in that dress.
{109601}{109675}You look... You think you...|Will you stop it?
{109677}{109773}I'll kill you! I will!|I'll kill you!
{109817}{109865}I'll kill you!
{109904}{110002}- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did l...|- Excuse me. Excuse me.
