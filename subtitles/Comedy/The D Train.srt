01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:54,089
           He's cool.

1385
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,924
       But I should have
       known about this.

    but you wouldn't listen.

1387
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,527
       So I asked Oliver.

1389
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,899
    >> Yeah, why wouldn't I?
          >> He's 14.

1390
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,367
    >> What are you gettin'
      so upset about, Dan?

1391
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:07,535
You should be celebrating this.
          He's a stud.

   >> No, but it's not okay!

1397
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,381
         >> It is okay!

1398
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,387
     >> Maybe I overstayed
          my welcome.

1399
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:27,455
   >> I'm gonna get my things
     and crash at Craig's.

01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,424
   >> I am so sorry, Oliver.

1401

          Dan, what is
