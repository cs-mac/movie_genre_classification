1
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,644
Bitterman, stop the car!
Stop it, stop the car.

2
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,207
Girls! Girls!

3
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:24,766
Hello, girls!

4
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,724
Would the more attractive
of you please step forward?

5
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:33,006
God! That's funny!

6
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,529
No, actually,
you're both very attractive.

7
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:42,322
Would the one who thinks I'm
attractive please step forward?

8
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:45,208
Quickly as possible!
Time is money!

9
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:47,567
What'd you have in mind?

10
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:50,770
VD I'm really into penicillin.

11
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,206
Now that's funny!

12
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,564
Actually, what I had in mind...

13
00:01:56,812 --> 00:02:00,009
...was spending the evening
with a stranger who loves me.

14
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:02,890
It's going to cost you $ 100.

15
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:04,929
Oh, yeah?
What time do you get off work?

16
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,527
No, I'm kidding!

17
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:13,124
Let's make it $200.
But I will ask you to Simoniz my car.

18
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,603
Has there been a death
in your family?

19
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,211
This is funny stuff here.

20
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:26,931
Let's go.

21
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,248
Bitterman, give her...

22
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:33,960
...give her friend $ 100.
She came in second.

23
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,325
Who is that guy?

24
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:41,766
I'd rather not say.

25
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,480
I think I know.
I saw his picture in the paper.

26
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,848
- That's Arthur Bach, isn't it?
- What if it is?

27
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,526
Is there something wrong with him?

28
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:53,608
Yes.

29
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,529
Permit me to introduce myself.

30
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:12,523
Where in the hell's my hat?

31
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,051
It's on the floor.

32
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:16,720
I hate it when that happens.

33
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:20,922
I am Arthur.

34
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,850
I'm Gloria.

35
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,566
- I am Arthur.
- Yeah. What're you drinking?

36
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,484
Scotch. Would you like some?

37
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:31,562
Why not?

38
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,406
You're with me and
you can ask that question?

39
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,482
What's so funny now?

40
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:46,644
I sometimes just
think funny things!

41
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:49,730
What do you do for a living?

42
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,121
I race cars. I play tennis...

43
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,209
...I fondle women, but...

44
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:59,161
...I have weekends off
and I am my own boss.

45
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:07,045
The Plaza, and step on it!

46
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:09,522
Sir, if I may say so...

47
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,923
Go through the park.

48
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,968
You know how I love the park!

49
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,810
Can I have another drink?

50
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,405
Isn 't this fun?!

51
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,010
Isn 't fun the best thing to have?!

52
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,643
Don 't you wish you were me?

53
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,405
I know I do!

54
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,645
Isn't that Arthur Bach?

55
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,531
I fell out of the goddamned car!

56
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:08,930
Is that the funniest thing ever?!

57
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,011
Are you hurt, sir?

58
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,250
I fell out of the car!

59
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,967
Isn't that the funniest thing ever?

60
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,844
You had to be there, right?

61
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,684
You are quite amusing, sir.

62
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:25,850
Please get my drink.
After all, we're going to the bar.

63
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,202
Thank you so much.

64
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,325
Madame, I'm sorry,
but we have absolutely no...

65
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,847
Don't give me any stuff, buster!

66
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,003
It's all right,
the lady's with me.

67
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,687
Mr. Bach! How good to see you!

68
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,492
If only someone
I knew felt that way!

69
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:52,847
We have your regular table,
Mr. Bach.

70
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,725
I know you have it,
but is anyone sitting at it?

71
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,603
It's all right. They're used
to seeing me with the turtle.

72
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,087
Uncle Peter! And Aunt Pearl!

73
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:17,488
You're looking well.

74
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,562
Thank you!

75
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,049
Aunt Pearl, may I say
you're looking younger every day.

76
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,203
Doesn't Aunt Pearl
look wonderful, darling?

77
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,124
She looks great.

78
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,290
We haven't had the pleasure
of meeting this young woman.

79
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:32,931
Would you introduce us?

80
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,924
How stupid of me!

81
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:40,445
Princess Gloria, may I
introduce my aunt and uncle...

82
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,569
...Peter and Pearl Bach.

83
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:44,406
How are you?

84
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,728
Princess? Did you say
"Princess," Arthur?

85
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,364
There's a very small country
in the West Indies. I mean small.

86
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,170
I see. Thank you.

87
00:06:57,452 --> 00:07:00,728
It's terribly small.
Tiny little country.

88
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:04,207
Rhode Island could
beat the crap out of it in a war.

89
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,726
That's how small it is.

90
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,206
It's small.

91
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,247
It's very little...

92
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:14,405
It's 85 cents in a cab
from one end to the other.

93
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:15,965
I'm talking small!

94
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:19,204
We understand it's small, Arthur.

95
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:23,890
They recently had
the whole country carpeted.

96
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,208
This is not a big place.

97
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:31,205
We understand that it's small, Arthur.

98
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,966
And we also understand
that you are very drunk.

99
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,921
So why don't we meet again
when you're sober?

100
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,524
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

101
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:47,361
Grow up, Arthur.
You'd make a fine adult.

102
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:48,761
That's easy for you to say.

103
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,730
You haven't got
50 pairs of short pants...

104
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,923
...hanging in your closet!

105
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,689
It's the regular table!
Wait a minute...

106
00:07:57,892 --> 00:08:00,531
...regular chair.

107
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:07,203
How rich are you?

108
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,163
All I can tell you is...

109
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,330
...I wish I had a dime
for every dime I have.

110
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,565
The service here is terrible.
Where the hell's my drink?

111
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,923
- We just ordered!
- That's always their excuse.

112
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:25,525
Engine room,
where the hell's my drink?!

113
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,840
Are you married?

114
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,562
There's only one woman for me.

115
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,482
And I can't stand her.

116
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,484
Her name is Susan.

117
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:39,445
I can't tell you her last name.
It would be indiscreet.

118
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,886
Johnson.

119
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,964
Susan Johnson.

120
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,850
My father wants me to marry her...

121
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,610
...but I'm not going to!

122
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:50,728
You're the only woman at this table.

123
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,532
Sure, you bring her a bottle,
me you bring a glass.

124
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,768
Fine. Thank you very much.

125
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,526
Aren't waiters wonderful?

126
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,929
You ask them for things,
and they bring them.

127
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:07,130
Same principle as Santa Claus.

128
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,405
Tell me about yourself.

129
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:17,571
You mean, why I'm a hooker?

130
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,167
Are you a hooker?

131
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,411
Jesus, I forgot!

132
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,001
I thought I was
doing great with you.

133
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:29,846
Why are you a hooker?

134
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,369
My mother died when I was six.

135
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,488
Son of a bitch!

136
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:40,566
Don't they know
what they do to kids?!

137
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,888
My father raped me when I was 12.

138
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:45,811
So you had six
relatively good years.

139
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,801
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:52,524
Listen, my father screwed me too.

141
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:57,927
Do you like me?

142
00:09:58,452 --> 00:09:59,851
You're cute.

143
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,804
I know that!

144
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,724
But do you like me?

145
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,812
Well, Princess,
we're going to have fun!

146
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:14,129
Tonight is New Year's Eve!
Third time this week!

147
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,330
Here's to you!

148
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,127
Noisy!

149
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:20,484
Hello, darling.

150
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,331
Good morning.

151
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:25,527
Did you sleep well?

152
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:26,847
- Fine.
- Good.

153
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:31,163
Please stop that!

154
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,409
Hobson how good to see you!

155
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,804
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

156
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,288
I've taken the liberty of
anticipating your condition...

157
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,922
...and I've brought you orange juice,
coffee and aspirins.

158
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,884
Or do you need to throw up?

159
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:53,205
Gloria, I would like you
to meet Hobson.

160
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:55,010
My best friend in the world.

161
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,522
I relish the compliment.

162
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,570
It is thrilling to meet you, Gloria.

163
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:07,888
You obviously have a wonderful
economy with words, Gloria.

164
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,124
I look forward to your next
syllable with great eagerness.

165
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:25,128
As we all can see,
it's a lovely day.

166
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,330
Which would seem to indicate
that the night is over.

167
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,922
I have arranged breakfast
for you on the east patio.

168
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:38,245
This is a robe.
Please put it on.

169
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,729
Say goodbye to her, Arthur.

170
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:06,323
Do you know what
I'm going to do?

171
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:07,971
No, I don't.

172
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,723
I'm going to take a bath.

173
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,090
I'll alert the media.

174
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,327
Do you want to
run my bath for me?

175
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,290
It's what I live for.

176
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:44,964
Perhaps you'd like me to
wash your dick for you...

177
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:46,725
...you little shit.

178
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,922
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry

179
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,681
You'd better not pout
I'm telling you why

180
00:13:56,332 --> 00:14:00,007
Santa Claus is coming to town

181
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,650
Hobson, this is Arthur.

182
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:09,167
Yes! How delightful
to hear from you.

183
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,729
How about a pitcher of martinis?

184
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,121
No, thank you.

185
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,886
I'm not going
to face my father sober.

186
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,926
If you don't bring them
I'll have someone else do it!

187
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,890
I'll bring them.

188
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:23,930
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye.

189
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,484
He treats me like a kid.

190
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,326
You know, Arthur...

191
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,128
...your father is going
to demand that you marry Susan.

192
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,249
I don't care what he demands.

193
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,041
Stay with me a minute, Hobson.
You know I hate to be alone.

194
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:07,162
Yes. Bathing is a lonely business.

195
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,368
Except for fish.

196
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,811
I beg your pardon?

197
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,123
Did you say "except for fish"?

198
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,325
Fish all bathe together.

199
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:23,492
Although they do tend
to eat one another.

200
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:24,968
I often think...

201
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,891
...fish must get
awfully tired of seafood.

202
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,531
What are your thoughts, Hobson?

203
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,611
Pardon me...

204
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:44,524
I don't want you to be alone.

205
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:47,485
I'll never be alone.
I have you.

206
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:50,441
Isn't life wonderful, Hobson?

207
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,047
Yes, Arthur, it is.
Do your armpits.

208
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,607
A hot bath is wonderful!

209
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:58,441
Girls are wonderful!

210
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,450
Imagine how wonderful
a girl who bathes would be!

211
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:02,841
Get dressed!

212
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,125
I hate it here.

213
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:18,966
Of course you hate it.
People work here.

214
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:23,284
Here, read this magazine.
There are many pictures.

215
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,844
Look how nobody ever smiles here.

216
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,965
Why doesn't anybody ever smile here?

217
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,049
They smile at lunchtime.

218
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,643
Lower your voice, Arthur.
And sit up.

219
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,763
Stop being so nervous.

220
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,965
Later on, we'll get ice cream.

221
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,124
Your father will see you now.

222
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:57,760
Come on, Hobson.

223
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,004
He wants to see you alone.

224
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,803
He gets all that money.

225
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:14,324
Pays his family back
by being a stinking drunk.

226
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:17,525
It's enough to make you sick.

227
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:20,929
I really wouldn't know, sir.
I'm just a servant.

228
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,685
On the other hand...

229
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:25,371
...go screw yourself.

230
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:33,330
The press has a good time
with you, Arthur.

231
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,607
"Millionaire Drunk Playboy. "

232
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,362
You're the weakest man
I've ever known!

233
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,809
I despise your weakness!

234
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,043
I'm afraid we have to talk.

235
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,128
I'm not going to marry her!
I've told you a thousand times!

236
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:03,365
Fine. If that's your decision,
the family has no choice.

237
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,002
I'm sorry, Arthur, very sorry.

238
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,130
But as of this moment, you are...

239
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,242
...cut off.

240
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:14,649
You mean cut off from...

241
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,564
...you and Grandmother
and the family?

242
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,129
So you mean cut off
from the...

243
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,925
You don't mean cut off from the...

244
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,804
The money, Arthur.

245
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:35,930
Your grandmother and I have had
all the papers drawn up.

246
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:37,930
We want this marriage, Arthur.

247
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,810
I want it. Burt Johnson wants it.

248
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,331
Burt Johnson!

249
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,131
He's a criminal!

250
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,324
We all are, Arthur.

251
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:48,045
And as you know...

252
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:52,044
...we usually get what we want.

253
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,244
Frankly, Father,
I'd rather starve.

254
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,401
And I will.

255
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,130
I'll get married when
I fall in love.

256
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,806
Fine. I respect your integrity.

257
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,726
You've just lost
750 million dollars.

258
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,042
Actually, Susan is
a very nice girl.

259
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,090
And she'll make a wonderful wife.

260
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,004
Yes, wonderful.

261
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,728
Have you ever seen her face...

262
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:20,963
...when the light
catches it just right?

263
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,964
She's really quite beautiful.

264
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:26,326
Of course, you can't depend
on that light.

265
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:28,927
The wedding is a month from today.

266
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,927
The invitations will be
mailed tonight.

267
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,924
Ever taste her chicken?

268
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,967
She does spectacular
things with a chicken.

269
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,846
And I love a chicken made at home.

270
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:47,929
This is the ring your grandfather
gave to your grandmother.

271
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,010
She wants you to
give it to Susan.

272
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:56,288
This is to marry one girl?

273
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,527
Don't do this to me.

274
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:02,008
I've been waiting for you
to grow up. I can't wait any longer.

275
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:05,802
Congratulations, Father, you win.

276
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,446
I had every intention of winning.

277
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:10,450
Congratulations to you, Arthur.

278
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,286
You're going to be wealthy
for the rest of your life.

279
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,369
That's all I've ever wanted to be.

280
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:26,009
I'll take three dozen of these shirts.
Assorted colors.

281
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,407
I hate my father.

282
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,688
Then purchase four dozen.

283
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:33,805
Four dozen.

284
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,042
And I want...

285
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,721
...14 of these sweaters, all green.

286
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,524
- All green?
- I don't wear sweaters.

287
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:42,530
Send them to
my address, will you?

288
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,763
What else can I buy, Hobson?

289
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,282
Hobson! Did you see that?!

290
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:00,001
She stole that tie!

291
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,567
It's a perfect crime!
Girls don't wear ties.

292
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:06,529
Although some do. It's not a perfect
crime, but it's a good crime.

293
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,605
If she murdered the tie
it'd be a perfect crime.

294
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,524
Why are you so happy
about all this?

295
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,968
The man following her
is a security guard.

296
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,565
We've got to be calm!

297
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,650
Isn't she beautiful? Jesus!

298
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,360
May I ask what have
we to do with this?

299
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,046
I beg your pardon, miss.

300
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,567
I'm the security guard
in the store.

301
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:10,602
You don't need the badge.

302
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,082
No customer would
wear that jacket.

303
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:15,851
I must look in the bag.

304
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:17,730
I saw you put something in it.

305
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:22,323
You got trouble, mister.

306
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:25,405
You'll never work on the East Coast
again. What's your name?

307
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:26,806
She's sensational!

308
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,691
She does have a certain
Eleanor Roosevelt quality.

309
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,126
What's your address?

310
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,648
The address, Chester!
I'm not fooling!

311
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:35,729
I saw you put a tie in that bag!

312
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,251
What did you say?!

313
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:39,809
All right, that's it!
I want a cop!

314
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:41,724
Get me a cop!
We need a cop here!

315
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:43,644
Don't move from where you are.

316
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:45,405
I don't want you out of my sight!

317
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:47,290
Get me a cop!
Get your hands off me.

318
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:50,163
I'm Arthur Bach.
I'll straighten this out.

319
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,091
Mr. Bach, you really should
stay out of this.

320
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,169
Well, he's in it, Chester.
Tell him, Alfred.

321
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,402
I know this woman.
We're shopping together.

322
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:01,767
Where the hell have you been?

323
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,570
I'm sorry darling.
I got caught up.

324
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:04,807
She's a friend, Mr. Bach?

325
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:07,731
He just said that, Chester.
You're such a schmuck.

326
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,645
I asked her to pick out a tie.

327
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,444
I was going to put it on my bill.

328
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,126
- You didn't pay for it?
- I forgot. I'm sorry.

329
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,929
Chester, what can I say?
I had no idea.

330
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:20,890
May I look at the tie?

331
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:30,127
Oh, God, that's really lovely.

332
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:33,125
- I hope you like it.
- You're really wonderful.

333
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:39,249
Not in front of
all these people, dear.

334
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:40,851
They might think you're an animal.

335
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,764
Mr. Bach, you understand,
it's my job.

336
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:45,930
Would you ask the lady at
the counter to put this on my bill?

337
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,006
I'll take care of it, Mr. Bach.
Thank you very much.

338
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,371
Were you scared?

339
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,328
Why are you smiling
at me like that?

340
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:14,368
I see.

341
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,331
You're a little strange...

342
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:17,800
...but cute.
How are you?

343
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:23,120
Have a nice day. Thank you very much.
I'll go to the bus stop now.

344
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:27,205
Why did you steal that tie?

345
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:29,086
I don't know.

346
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:30,765
I'm a wonderful person!

347
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm serious.

348
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,287
I'll be with you in a minute.
He's getting on my nerves.

349
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,488
Will you stop smiling
at me like that?

350
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:44,322
You look like
one of Santa's helpers.

351
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:46,808
Is he with us?

352
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,725
My name is Arthur,
and this is Mr. Hobson.

353
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,371
Good afternoon.

354
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,364
Good afternoon?

355
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:58,890
My name is Linda.

356
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,447
I'd like to thank you very much.
You did a nice thing.

357
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:05,523
That was an interesting kiss.

358
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:09,331
- You kiss your wife like that?
- I'm not married.

359
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:16,084
Keep smiling. 688-5549.

360
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:18,370
Don't expect big things
on the first date.

361
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,251
Yes, it's been a distinct
pleasure meeting you.

362
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,722
Arthur, we really must be going.

363
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:25,923
Thank you for
a memorable afternoon.

364
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:30,330
Usually one must go to a bowling alley
to meet a woman of your stature.

365
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:33,811
Wouldn't it be funny
if he called me?

366
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:38,131
Arthur, I see no reason
for prolonging this conversation.

367
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,606
Unless you're planning...

368
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:42,724
...to knock over a fruit stand
later in the evening.

369
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:44,491
Good luck in prison.

370
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:47,761
Who was the tie for?

371
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,321
A guy.

372
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:52,484
Look how he stopped smiling.
My father. It's his birthday.

373
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:53,966
What are you doing tomorrow night?

374
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:56,287
I don't know.

375
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,404
I have plans for tomorrow night.
What should I wear?

376
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,250
Steal something casual.

377
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,127
- I like him.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

378
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:07,165
I'll have Bitterman
drive you home.

379
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,251
You don't have to do that.

380
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:14,528
Bitterman doesn't
have to take me.

381
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:21,325
I really hardly ever
take the bus, ever.

382
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:25,125
- But it's so hard to get a cab.
- Of course.

383
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:28,404
I'm sure we know a lot
of the same people.

384
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,165
- Get in.
- Right.

385
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:36,210
Tell Bitterman where to take you.
And make sure...

386
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:39,081
...you give him your address
and phone number.

387
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,723
Take care of her, Bitterman.

388
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:46,041
Good afternoon!

389
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:57,328
You'd think they'd never
seen a car before.

390
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,931
Hey lady, where
did you get the car?

391
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,970
Could you children please
allow us our privacy?

392
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:09,207
Could I sit here until
one of my neighbors walks by?

393
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:12,081
I want someone I know
to see me get out of this.

394
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:13,288
I understand.

395
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,170
Here comes Mrs. Nesbit.
This should kill her.

396
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:20,409
Don't touch the door.
I'll do it.

397
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:24,728
Mrs. Nesbit deserves
the entire treatment.

398
00:27:33,812 --> 00:27:35,211
Thank you, Bitterman.

399
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:37,931
Well, hello, Mrs. Nesbit!

400
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,125
Will that be all, madam?

401
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,487
I think so.

402
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,684
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Nesbit.

403
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:51,521
- Could be a big tie.
- It is a tie.

404
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,527
Then guessing would be
out of the question.

405
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:58,410
- It is a tie!
- Surprise!

406
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:00,731
I love it!

407
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:05,122
It goes with everything I own.

408
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:06,608
I hope you like it.

409
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:10,327
If I don't get a job soon, you may
get it back on your birthday.

410
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:13,121
Dad, shut up.

411
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,721
A funny thing happened
to me today.

412
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:21,530
Do you know why...

413
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:23,967
...girls marry so badly?

414
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:27,843
Is this a joke?
Are these Polish girls?

415
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:34,401
The reason is, there
are so many girls...

416
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,489
...and so few princes.

417
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,286
You met a prince?

418
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,605
I met a nice guy. With my help,
he could become a prince.

419
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,570
- Who is he?
- Just a guy.

420
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,006
What does he do?

421
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,887
Nothing.

422
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:58,328
Another beauty.
How does he make a living?

423
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,211
Look, I have to make dinner.

424
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:06,161
I take it this bum
will be calling you.

425
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,560
Dad, he's a millionaire.

426
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:13,327
You have my permission
to marry him.

427
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:15,325
Roses. Yellow.

428
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:18,086
She'll drop dead. She'll love them.

429
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:20,691
Yellow roses. Two dozen.

430
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,570
I think something else
would look nice too.

431
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,050
Red roses. With the yellow.

432
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,408
She won't know what hit her!
You'll be aces with her.

433
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:31,647
You're a nice boy.

434
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:33,325
Two dozen red, okay?

435
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:36,486
- Do you know what happened?
- No, I don't.

436
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,768
Yesterday I met her
outside Bergdorf's.

437
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,889
I can't stop
thinking about her!

438
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:44,727
Are you married?

439
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:46,451
Once. She's alive.

440
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,930
- What's that?
- A yucca plant.

441
00:29:50,132 --> 00:29:51,770
- I'll take it.
- How many?

442
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,242
Four.

443
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:55,920
Where were you
when I was selling cars?

444
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,850
How did you know
when you fell in love?

445
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,411
How does anybody know?

446
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:00,966
I was on a train.

447
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:02,486
From Washington to New York.

448
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:03,647
What's that?

449
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:05,769
- A fern. You need five.
- Right!

450
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:10,285
A girl got on the train.
Skinny. She gave me a smile.

451
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:14,002
By Baltimore, I was a dead duck.

452
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:17,445
Did you whistle a lot?
I find I whistle!

453
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,767
I whistled.

454
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,282
Did you feel funny?
I feel funny.

455
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:26,045
You may have a cold.

456
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:32,726
Send all this and anything else
you can think of to this address.

457
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,970
Send 2 dozen roses
to your wife.

458
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,645
The skinny one on the train.

459
00:30:39,892 --> 00:30:41,120
Here, keep the change.

460
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:43,527
You're the rich one?

461
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,286
The one who drinks?

462
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:49,612
How does it feel
to have all that money?

463
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:51,891
It feels great.

464
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,283
A dumb question.

465
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:58,929
What do you do?
I've never asked.

466
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:02,408
I'm an actress.
I mean, I'm studying to be one.

467
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,206
But I'm working as a waitress.

468
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:07,249
A lot of talented girls do that.

469
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:09,451
What's it like being a waitress?

470
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:11,569
It's fun. I mean, you know.

471
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,722
This guy came in and pulled out...

472
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:27,123
A guy came into the diner
and pulled out...

473
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:38,126
- He pulled out what?
- Pulled out a gun!

474
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:46,007
I love this song!

475
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:47,731
I love it too!

476
00:31:55,932 --> 00:31:57,047
When do I get a turn?

477
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,806
Can't you see I'm going
for a new world's record?

478
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:03,129
After only 12 games,
I have 80 coupons!

479
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,928
I knew it would be different
spending an evening with a millionaire.

480
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,881
Two more and I'm 20 for 20!
That's another 35 coupons!

481
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:20,325
Could we have a little quiet here?

482
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:23,085
You nut!

483
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:29,765
Look at him with his gun.

484
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,130
Are you cute!

485
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,691
God, I missed!

486
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:39,688
Nineteen.

487
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:44,002
For 19, you get 15 coupons.

488
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:50,404
We really have to go now.

489
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:56,971
Space Invaders!

490
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,802
Do you want the orange one?

491
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:10,327
Enjoy it!

492
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,365
Now take care of it.

493
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:13,806
I already named it!

494
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:17,925
I named it after my grandmother
on my mother's side.

495
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,606
Arthur.

496
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:27,247
Here's a rose.
I stole it from the restaurant.

497
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:30,721
Thank you.

498
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,162
I've never taken care of anyone.

499
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,884
Everyone's always taken care of me.

500
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:42,010
But if you got sick, or anything...

501
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:44,845
...I'd take care of you.

502
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:47,491
Then I'll get sick.

503
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:07,724
This Vermeer just arrived today.

504
00:34:09,452 --> 00:34:10,771
It's called...

505
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:14,564
..."Woman Admiring Pearls. "

506
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:18,324
The dealer jerked me around
on the price a little.

507
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:20,369
But what the hell.

508
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:21,766
We live once.

509
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:27,526
Martha...

510
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:31,809
What's the matter, Arthur?

511
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:37,727
I can't marry Susan Johnson.

512
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:42,091
- Really?
- I met this girl!

513
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:48,206
You are a charming boy.
Unfortunately...

514
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:51,768
...every time you have an erection,
it makes the papers.

515
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:57,007
Goodness!
I sound like a dime novel.

516
00:34:58,572 --> 00:34:59,846
Peanuts!

517
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:07,724
Isn't my grandson handsome, Harriet?

518
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,724
- Yes.
- Thank you, Harriet.

519
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,886
Is it wonderful to be...

520
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:18,087
...promiscuous?

521
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:22,929
At your age, Martha,
it might just be dangerous.

522
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:32,970
Who is she? This one you met.

523
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:36,244
I don't know.

524
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:39,041
She lives in Queens.
She's nobody.

525
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:43,526
But there's something
about her, Martha.

526
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:52,570
Make no mistakes.

527
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:56,644
You are too old to be poor.

528
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:59,361
You don't know how.

529
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:02,927
We are ruthless people.

530
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:05,487
Don't screw with us.

531
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,847
Arthur, I love you.

532
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:12,442
If you don't marry Susan
I'll cut you off without a cent.

533
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:19,406
You're a scary old broad, Martha.

534
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,404
And you are a delightful child.

535
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:29,005
Marry Susan and cheat
with the nobody from Queens.

536
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:44,121
How are you?
I got off work early.

537
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,482
Listen, do you like lasagna?

538
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,963
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.

539
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,523
I know this is last minute...

540
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:59,202
...but something came up.
I can't make it tonight.

541
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:01,723
Fine. No problem. What?

542
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:04,962
Listen, the truth is...

543
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:07,170
...I'm getting engaged tonight.

544
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,361
The easiest thing would be
to lie, but I like you...

545
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:13,649
Look, no sweat.
We had some laughs. Good luck...

546
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:15,843
I wanted to tell you
the other night, but I...

547
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:19,010
Don't worry about it.
I have to go. Okay? Bye.

548
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:29,326
Would you like a beer?
I'll get you a beer.

549
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:31,568
I'll be all right, sweetheart.

550
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:35,051
I just have to be
alone for a minute.

551
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:37,767
Oh, God! I can't bear it.

552
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:40,480
Come in.

553
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:44,690
Shall I get the car, Mr. Bach?

554
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,201
No thanks, Bitterman.

555
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,646
Tonight I'll drive myself.

556
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:53,488
How often does
a young man get engaged?

557
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:55,128
Where's Mr. Hobson?

558
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:59,048
Mr. Hobson was tired, sir.
He's resting.

559
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,324
He's been tired
quite a bit lately.

560
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,610
I'm sure he's fine, sir.

561
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:16,606
Will you cut it out?

562
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,924
I didn't mean to tell you,
but I've got a tumor.

563
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,406
Did the lights go off?

564
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,290
Just talk to me, okay?

565
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:26,524
With a tumor in my head?

566
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:29,245
Listen, Arthur.

567
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:35,364
There are three books...
This is important.

568
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:37,725
Take them back...

569
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:40,206
...to the library.

570
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:54,168
Don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.

571
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:57,844
I've only got a cold.
Now go and get engaged.

572
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:02,164
I just told Linda
I was getting engaged.

573
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,851
I don't know why.

574
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,721
A tart like that could
save you a fortune in prostitutes.

575
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:09,851
Listen, old man.

576
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:13,246
Don't ever talk about
her that way again.

577
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,642
She's the best person I know!

578
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:18,725
Goddamn it,
why are you such a snob?!

579
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:40,843
I raised my voice to you.
I've never done that before.

580
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,650
That's quite all right.

581
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,727
You know, you may be growing up.

582
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,731
And I'm sorry for what
I said about Linda.

583
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:54,126
Do you want anything?

584
00:39:55,132 --> 00:39:56,645
I want to be younger.

585
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:59,201
I'm sorry.
It's your job to be older.

586
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,531
- Good evening, Mr. Bach.
- Good evening, Mr. Butler.

587
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,410
I'm here to get engaged.

588
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,324
Won't you come in, sir?

589
00:41:28,772 --> 00:41:30,046
How are you?

590
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:34,890
Susan! You get down here
this minute!

591
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:38,729
Miss Susan is expecting you.
She's dressing.

592
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:41,003
I will inform her you're here.

593
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:43,766
Tell her Chief Inspector Flanigan
from homicide is here.

594
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:46,128
That should get her
down in a hurry.

595
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,407
Nothing. Offer to take my coat.

596
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,250
You don't have a coat.

597
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,728
Well, offer to take my tie.

598
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,685
It's a little joke.

599
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:01,931
Take the rest of the week off.

600
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,123
You're obviously
under a lot of tension.

601
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:06,243
Would you care to wait
in the library?

602
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:09,125
Yes! The bathroom is
out of the question!

603
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:14,928
That's another little joke.

604
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,488
Follow me, please.

605
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,728
I'm a little nervous.
I'm getting engaged.

606
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:25,011
You may wait in here.

607
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,122
Thank you!

608
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:30,526
Is there anything you
care for while you wait?

609
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:34,322
Do you have today's Pravda?
I like to keep up with Russia.

610
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:38,171
Then fill a glass with scotch.

611
00:42:38,412 --> 00:42:41,529
Are you sure you want
to be a nightclub comic?

612
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:52,522
Marty, he's pouring a drink.
I'll get back to you!

613
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:59,405
If you're going to be like that,
let's call the whole thing off!

614
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:03,210
God, these people!

615
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:07,323
I'm glad we had this time together.
You're a funny guy.

616
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:09,164
You have that trouble too?

617
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:21,925
This must be awfully
embarrassing for you.

618
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:36,608
Hello, Arthur.

619
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:38,281
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

620
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:40,410
I haven't seen you lately.

621
00:43:42,132 --> 00:43:44,521
The reason you haven't
seen me is because...

622
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:47,849
...I normally pick Susan up
at her apartment in town.

623
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,526
And you live here.
Want a drink?

624
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,211
I never drink.

625
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,288
- No one in my family drinks.
- That's great!

626
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:58,882
You probably never run out
of ice your whole life.

627
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:04,366
I don't drink because drinking
affects your decision-making.

628
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:07,410
You may be right.
I can't decide.

629
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:12,528
That's just a little humor.

630
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:14,924
Where's the rest
of this moose?

631
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,722
Arthur, I think it's time
we got to know one another.

632
00:44:18,932 --> 00:44:21,765
I do too. That's why
I had you come over today.

633
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,285
This is a tough room.

634
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,727
I don't have to tell you that.

635
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,570
You must have hated this moose.

636
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:34,361
Why don't you forget
the moose for a moment?!

637
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:38,840
Right.

638
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:44,321
You know...

639
00:44:44,572 --> 00:44:47,006
...I didn't inherit money
like you did.

640
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:48,924
I started with nothing.

641
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:50,842
And yet...

642
00:44:51,932 --> 00:44:54,571
...I was a millionaire
by the time I was 18.

643
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,325
Anyone stood in my way,
they got hurt.

644
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:03,768
When I was 11 years old...

645
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:06,291
...I killed a man.

646
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,360
When you're 11, you don't even
know there's a law against that.

647
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:14,564
Is Susan here?

648
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,770
I knew what I was doing.
We were poor.

649
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:22,729
He came into our house
to steal our food.

650
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:24,963
Well, he was asking for it.

651
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:28,325
I took a knife...

652
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:31,521
...and I killed him
in the kitchen.

653
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:38,721
You probably ate out that night.

654
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:41,850
I mean, with that man
lying in your kitchen.

655
00:45:42,132 --> 00:45:45,681
- You seem to find humor in everything.
- Yes, sorry.

656
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:47,007
- Arthur!
- What?

657
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:51,721
Do you know what I consider to be
my most precious possession?

658
00:45:54,572 --> 00:45:56,210
My daughter.

659
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,326
She is my gold.

660
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:01,724
- She is my treasure.
- She's very nice.

661
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:04,406
And I protect what's mine.

662
00:46:05,372 --> 00:46:08,091
And I do it in an ugly way.

663
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:14,206
- I'm from the gutter.
- I understand. The gutter.

664
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:15,646
You seem upset.

665
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:17,723
Now, Susan loves you.

666
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:21,321
And I want you to make her happy.

667
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:25,280
You can count on it.

668
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:28,285
I insist upon you making her happy.

669
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:32,125
Listen.

670
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:35,563
What happens...

671
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:37,404
...this is just hypothetical...

672
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:41,400
...if I don't make her happy?
Which is out of the question!

673
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,326
But let's just say...

674
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,130
...I make her...

675
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:47,685
...cranky?

676
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:52,122
For cranky, I guess you'd
probably just break my ankles.

677
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,211
Something like that.

678
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:57,650
You'll make her happy.

679
00:46:57,852 --> 00:46:59,570
I don't like your drinking.

680
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:02,083
It makes you unreasonable.

681
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:05,651
I want you to go to work.

682
00:47:06,012 --> 00:47:09,925
Now, your father and I
talked about it. I want you...

683
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,925
...to work for me.

684
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:15,130
Is this it?
She's not happy already?

685
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:17,010
Susan loves you.

686
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,605
So I love you.

687
00:47:19,852 --> 00:47:22,002
You'll find me a friend.

688
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:24,324
Don't you get it?

689
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:25,966
You can get drunk.

690
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:27,520
You can throw up.

691
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:30,121
You can forget to call me
for months.

692
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:32,044
You can't lose with me.

693
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:34,409
I know you too well.

694
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:36,722
And I'm much stronger
than you are.

695
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:40,567
I know how alone you are.

696
00:47:41,452 --> 00:47:43,408
I hate how alone you are.

697
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,486
I've cried because
you're so alone.

698
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:49,850
Don't be afraid, Arthur.

699
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:53,526
You're never going
to be alone again.

700
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:55,611
Waiter!

701
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:59,567
I'll have another.
You want another fish?

702
00:47:59,812 --> 00:48:01,086
Don't drink anymore.

703
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:07,051
You're such an asshole!

704
00:48:10,132 --> 00:48:11,565
This is what I am!

705
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:15,332
Everyone who drinks
is not a poet.

706
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:20,484
Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

707
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,851
A real woman could
stop you from drinking.

708
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:27,043
It'd have to be a real big woman.

709
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:30,005
Will you take my hand?

710
00:48:30,212 --> 00:48:32,123
That would leave you with one!

711
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:34,768
Sorry. Here's the hand.

712
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:39,730
I love you, Arthur.

713
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:43,210
Good! I have to talk
to the waiter now.

714
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:47,441
My doctor advised me to
drink 10 of these an hour.

715
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,648
I understand, Mr. Bach.

716
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:13,121
This is the ring my grandfather
gave to my grandmother.

717
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:18,442
Then he died.

718
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,252
And subsequently,
she gave it to me.

719
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:23,443
I'll always love you.

720
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:25,844
It's a great ring, isn't it?

721
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,724
It's a beautiful ring.

722
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:30,530
It's a magical night.

723
00:49:33,612 --> 00:49:37,048
Do you have any objection
to naming a child Vladimir?

724
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:38,847
Even a girl?

725
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,930
Ask me.

726
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:47,211
Will you marry me?
Take the weekend if you want.

727
00:49:48,212 --> 00:49:49,691
Congratulations!

728
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:56,169
Would you mind if I took you home?

729
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:59,525
I've got a terrible headache.
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:39,772 --> 00:50:41,683
This must be the building.

731
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:05,850
I hope it's not late.
Who am I talking to?

732
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:07,924
It's me, it's me.

733
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:10,963
- What do you want?
- Oh, shit!

734
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:14,606
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, madam.

735
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,810
I was looking for Linda. I hope
it's the wrong house. No offense.

736
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:19,849
My husband has a gun!

737
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:21,849
I'm sure he has, madam.

738
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:25,845
For all I know, he shot it
while you screamed.

739
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:27,770
Perry! Come over here!

740
00:51:28,012 --> 00:51:29,764
This man wants to know
where Linda lives!

741
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:33,891
She lives at 14133, Apartment A,
next door.

742
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:37,690
You tell a total stranger that?
You don't know who he is.

743
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:39,650
- He looks okay.
- Right, get over here!

744
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:44,042
She's terrible! Does she
always hit you like that?

745
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,520
Yeah, what can I do?

746
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,125
Mind your business!

747
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:50,887
For God's sake, she's going
to kill you! Get in there!

748
00:51:51,132 --> 00:51:54,647
Give her a shot!
It's you against her, Perry!

749
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,640
Oh, God!

750
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,846
It's horrible!

751
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:00,366
Horrible!

752
00:52:03,012 --> 00:52:04,843
You shouldn't hear this.

753
00:52:09,372 --> 00:52:10,521
God!

754
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:20,843
Perry, you're a dead man.

755
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,731
Pardon me.

756
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:35,605
Oh, you're a hedge.

757
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:41,561
- You must be Linda's father.
- It's kind of late.

758
00:52:41,812 --> 00:52:44,326
Although I wasn't sleeping myself.

759
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:46,483
Oh, nice to meet you, Arthur.

760
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:48,921
Hi, Linda!

761
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:53,050
Can I come in?
Don't you hate Perry's wife?

762
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:54,520
Let him in.

763
00:52:58,012 --> 00:52:59,650
Linda, I've missed...

764
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,762
Sorry, Linda.
I'm sorry.

765
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:06,525
Really.

766
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:09,404
It happens.

767
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:18,805
What's the matter with you?

768
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:23,532
Nobody knocks on a door
at 3:00 in the morning!

769
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:26,366
You're so drunk,
you can hardly stand up.

770
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:28,170
And you're engaged!

771
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:09,850
This is a goner.

772
00:54:12,892 --> 00:54:14,530
I'm going to sleep.

773
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:23,649
You come here at 3 o'clock
in the morning to say goodbye?

774
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:27,731
I have to get up and go to work
in the morning. Stop kidding around!

775
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:29,849
Will you stop kissing me!

776
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,931
I'm sure you're not going
to want to be a waitress...

777
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,241
...for the rest of your life.

778
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:37,971
I am studying to be an actress.

779
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:40,123
- You told me.
- Well, I am.

780
00:54:44,772 --> 00:54:46,410
This is for you...

781
00:54:46,652 --> 00:54:48,927
...your father...

782
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,328
...and your acting career.

783
00:54:52,972 --> 00:54:54,883
Please take it and I'll go.

784
00:55:01,572 --> 00:55:03,483
$ 100,000.

785
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,524
We don't need your money.

786
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:14,890
Linda, it'll help you.

787
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:17,128
Look what it's done for you.

788
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:20,130
Tell your story walking,
before I call a cop!

789
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:22,129
Get out of here!

790
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:27,245
Closet.

791
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:34,125
I know.

792
00:55:52,092 --> 00:55:53,684
Want to take her for a spin, Hobson?

793
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:55,611
No, thank you, Arthur.

794
00:55:56,532 --> 00:55:59,490
Mr. Bach, be sure you call me
anytime you need the track.

795
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,723
- Take it easy.
- Thank you.

796
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:09,525
Do you know how miserable I am?

797
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:13,520
You're miserable?
I've got all this and I'm on a salary.

798
00:56:13,772 --> 00:56:15,490
ARTHUR 3

799
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:23,404
Do you know the worst part?
The worst part of being me?

800
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:25,722
I should imagine your breath.

801
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:28,522
Let me be unhappy, will you?

802
00:56:29,412 --> 00:56:31,004
You know, Hobson...

803
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:34,207
...I could love somebody.

804
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:37,725
I never got to love anybody!

805
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:43,249
What do I have to live for?
I'm a failure. I'm just in the way.

806
00:56:43,572 --> 00:56:45,563
Would you remove your helmet, please?

807
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:47,524
- Why?
- Please.

808
00:56:51,812 --> 00:56:52,961
Thank you.

809
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:54,281
Now your goggles.

810
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:56,329
- Why?
- Please.

811
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:03,330
You spoiled little bastard!

812
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:07,322
You're a man who has everything.
But that's not enough.

813
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:12,326
You feel unloved? Welcome to
the world. Everyone is unloved!

814
00:57:13,372 --> 00:57:16,808
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
And incidentally, I love you.

815
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:19,762
Marry Susan, Arthur.

816
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:23,723
Poor drunks do not find love.

817
00:57:24,372 --> 00:57:27,967
Poor drunks have very few teeth.
They urinate outdoors.

818
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,282
They freeze to death in summer.

819
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:33,364
I can't bear to think
of you that way.

820
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:35,250
I need Linda, Hobson.

821
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:36,607
I see.

822
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:39,965
Well, perhaps fate
will lend a hand, Arthur.

823
00:57:40,612 --> 00:57:42,170
One never knows.

824
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:45,846
Good afternoon?

825
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:47,930
May I come in?

826
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:51,922
If you and your undershirt
would walk two paces backwards...

827
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:53,844
...I could enter this dwelling.

828
00:58:15,732 --> 00:58:17,484
How revolting.

829
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,924
Look who's here.
The British Tonto.

830
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:27,364
How are you? How's Arthur?

831
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:30,047
Ever since I met Arthur,
I liked him.

832
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:33,602
We have to make sure these
two wonderful kids stay together.

833
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:34,881
Who is this person?

834
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:40,050
- He's my father.
- Yes, and I'd like to say that...

835
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:41,526
Try not to speak.

836
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:44,610
Would you get me a cup of tea?
I wish to speak to Linda.

837
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:46,525
Sure.

838
00:58:48,812 --> 00:58:51,246
There is an engagement
party tonight...

839
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:54,325
...at Arthur's father's house
in Southampton.

840
00:58:54,772 --> 00:58:57,730
Here is the address.
Perhaps you should attend.

841
00:58:58,132 --> 00:58:59,850
Are all the ones
he passed up coming?

842
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,168
Young woman, this is a tie
you cannot steal!

843
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:05,482
This is a tie you'll have
to work for.

844
00:59:05,732 --> 00:59:09,008
Are you inviting me
to Arthur's engagement party?

845
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,328
This is not an invitation.

846
00:59:11,612 --> 00:59:12,931
However...

847
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,608
...if there's one thing that
old gentlemen can still do...

848
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:20,003
...they can still spot
young gentlemen in love.

849
00:59:21,172 --> 00:59:23,128
Please go to the party.

850
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:24,921
Are you all right?

851
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:26,963
Yes, I'm fine.

852
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:36,765
Does Arthur know you're here?

853
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:40,084
No, Arthur is far too fine
a person to be involved...

854
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:42,482
...in something as devious as this.

855
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,521
You really look out for him,
don't you?

856
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:49,408
And it is a job
that I recommend highly.

857
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,001
I have something for you.

858
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:53,042
For me?

859
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:02,441
What is it?

860
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:05,331
If I told you,
it would spoil the surprise.

861
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:07,045
Don't open it.

862
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:09,161
Here's your tea.

863
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:11,323
I despise tea.

864
01:00:11,532 --> 01:00:13,727
Would you bring me 2 aspirin
from the bathroom?

865
01:00:14,972 --> 01:00:19,488
You'll find them on the top shelf,
behind the untouched shaving cream.

866
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:33,443
That sounds bad.
Have you seen a doctor?

867
01:00:34,372 --> 01:00:36,124
Yes.

868
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,129
And he has seen me.

869
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,051
You know...

870
01:00:47,412 --> 01:00:49,562
...I think Arthur has
a very good friend.

871
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:53,725
May I kiss you on the cheek?

872
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:55,923
Is it something you feel
strongly about?

873
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:06,485
What about your aspirins?

874
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:09,521
The aspirins are for you, my dear.

875
01:02:34,652 --> 01:02:35,607
Hello.

876
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:38,686
Good evening.

877
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:49,608
God knows when I'll see you again.

878
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:52,566
Arthur, will you play
something for us?

879
01:03:18,492 --> 01:03:21,450
- Don't you hate these things?
- Despise them.

880
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:23,563
Actually, seriously...

881
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:26,881
...songs come and go.

882
01:03:27,172 --> 01:03:29,527
But I love the classics.

883
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,883
And I hope you'll enjoy this one.

884
01:03:43,892 --> 01:03:45,484
You'd better watch out

885
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:48,523
You'd better not cry

886
01:03:50,012 --> 01:03:52,207
Are you good friends with Arthur?

887
01:03:52,532 --> 01:03:54,011
For ages.

888
01:03:54,252 --> 01:03:58,165
I'm so pleased he finally found
the right woman. Where is she?

889
01:03:59,052 --> 01:03:59,848
Over there.

890
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:01,963
Isn't she just beautiful?

891
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:03,167
Of course she is.

892
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:05,643
Why would Arthur marry a dog?

893
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:06,728
Pardon?

894
01:04:06,932 --> 01:04:09,241
Santa Claus is coming to town

895
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:15,921
How does it feel to be
getting married?

896
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:18,371
Blue Moon

897
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:21,562
You saw me standing alone

898
01:04:24,252 --> 01:04:26,322
Without a dream in my heart

899
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:31,287
Thanks a lot. That's flattering.

900
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:34,320
If you knew Susan
like I knew Susan

901
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,251
I need a drink!

902
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:46,768
- Tell me your entire name, darling.
- Preston Langly.

903
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:52,287
Really! If you don't remember
when we met, I mean, honestly!

904
01:04:52,532 --> 01:04:54,841
- Put your arm around me.
- Of course.

905
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:59,204
Linda, you're here.

906
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:01,721
So true.

907
01:05:03,652 --> 01:05:04,846
Join us.

908
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:11,162
Congratulations.
Father sends his regards.

909
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:13,528
- Does he?
- Yes, he does.

910
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:16,247
Wednesday night may be
difficult for me.

911
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:19,165
- What?
- You're looking wonderful, my dear.

912
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:21,289
- Aren't I? Thank you.
- Wednesday?

913
01:05:21,532 --> 01:05:23,841
It's difficult for her
that night, Preston.

914
01:05:24,092 --> 01:05:27,482
Isn't that the night you usually
attend the ballet, darling?

915
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:31,361
Actually, I feel foolish,
but I don't recall ever making...

916
01:05:31,612 --> 01:05:35,082
Would you be divine and
get me a gin and tonic?

917
01:05:35,852 --> 01:05:37,763
Scotch for me, Preston.

918
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:42,169
- You wait here for me?
- If it takes forever.

919
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:53,480
What are you doing here...

920
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:56,041
...and why are you talking like that?

921
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:02,810
I was in the neighborhood.

922
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:05,646
It took me two buses,
three cabs and a train...

923
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:08,611
...to get into the neighborhood.
But what the hell?

924
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:12,170
Nice place. I like a living room
you can land a plane in.

925
01:06:12,412 --> 01:06:14,972
There's more of it. You like a tour?

926
01:06:15,692 --> 01:06:17,569
I've seen bedrooms.

927
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:19,803
Don't be a lover. Be a person.

928
01:06:21,052 --> 01:06:22,724
Make me happy.

929
01:06:23,332 --> 01:06:25,607
Her name is Linda Marolla.

930
01:06:25,972 --> 01:06:29,851
She's the one Arthur saw
the other night. She lives in Queens.

931
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,361
Mario, please!

932
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:53,565
Don't worry. I talked to the warden.
We'll get you out of here.

933
01:06:53,812 --> 01:06:58,090
When I was a kid, I used to open
their stalls and let them run out.

934
01:06:58,332 --> 01:07:00,766
You should have been there
the day I freed my goldfish.

935
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:03,207
Come over here.
I want you two to meet.

936
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,524
Pancho, this is Linda.
I told you about her, remember?

937
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,360
It must have been something,
growing up with all this.

938
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,642
I was away at boarding school
most of the time.

939
01:07:13,972 --> 01:07:17,851
I was kicked out of ten prep schools.
I was a bad kid.

940
01:07:18,252 --> 01:07:19,571
No, you weren't.

941
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:21,763
You just wanted to go home.

942
01:07:24,652 --> 01:07:26,802
Bad kids don't grow up
as nice as you.

943
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:29,566
- Why do you think Pancho loves you?
- Thank you.

944
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:34,567
This is kind of like prom night,
isn't it?

945
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,763
I mean, we're all dressed up.

946
01:07:42,052 --> 01:07:43,371
Have you ever been in love?

947
01:07:46,172 --> 01:07:47,127
You?

948
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:52,963
But when I was little,
I thought the moon followed me.

949
01:07:53,212 --> 01:07:54,008
What?

950
01:07:56,172 --> 01:08:00,290
I would walk and I thought
the moon went anyplace I did.

951
01:08:03,892 --> 01:08:05,325
That's great!

952
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:08,487
I know it's silly,
but I was only eight years old.

953
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,969
I thought it meant something special
would happen to me someday.

954
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:17,086
So I've been waiting. Every day I've
been doing my hair, and washing...

955
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:19,883
...my face...
- Can I kiss you?

956
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:21,731
Please.

957
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:33,004
I wasn't talking to you.

958
01:08:35,172 --> 01:08:38,960
Why is it you can make me laugh
at the saddest times in my life?

959
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:40,804
I'm funny, that's why.

960
01:08:41,092 --> 01:08:42,127
I'm funny!

961
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:44,207
Yeah, that's it.

962
01:08:45,172 --> 01:08:46,730
You're going to marry Susan.

963
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:52,367
I'm still glad I came here.
Made a fool out of myself.

964
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,525
I wish we had made love.

965
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,841
I'd give anything
to see you in the morning.

966
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:04,847
I have to marry Susan.
If I don't, my family will cut me off.

967
01:09:05,092 --> 01:09:07,128
It's almost a billion dollars.

968
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:11,323
One of the horses just fainted.

969
01:09:13,372 --> 01:09:14,885
Look, this is ridiculous.

970
01:09:15,132 --> 01:09:18,761
You got cab fare to the city?
I don't like the train at night.

971
01:09:21,252 --> 01:09:23,083
Look, when Susan and I
get married...

972
01:09:23,332 --> 01:09:25,971
...I can set you up in an apartment
and we can...

973
01:09:26,212 --> 01:09:27,361
Forget it.

974
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:30,447
Are you cute!

975
01:09:35,692 --> 01:09:37,808
I thought I'd find you here.

976
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:40,680
He just loves that smelly old horse.

977
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:43,762
Have we met?

978
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:46,964
I don't think you have.

979
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:49,970
Linda Marolla,
this is Susan Johnson, my fiancee.

980
01:09:50,572 --> 01:09:52,449
I hope I'm not interrupting.

981
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:54,963
I'd say that if I were you.

982
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:57,967
We might as well tell her.

983
01:09:59,252 --> 01:10:00,731
You tell her.

984
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:08,051
My husband, Harold,
went to prep school with Arthur.

985
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:11,605
Harold lost a fortune gambling.
He's sick!

986
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:12,961
He's a sick man!

987
01:10:13,652 --> 01:10:15,563
But he's my husband.

988
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:19,170
I'm not one of your guests.
I came for one reason.

989
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:22,563
I came here to beg Arthur
to lend us some money.

990
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,205
One of my kids...

991
01:10:25,452 --> 01:10:27,568
...my youngest, my baby...

992
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:29,649
...needs an operation.

993
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:33,210
Harold hasn't kept up the insurance.
I don't know where to turn!

994
01:10:33,452 --> 01:10:34,965
Do I have to go on?

995
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:37,281
No, of course not!

996
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:39,409
Of course not!

997
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,485
- Arthur, I wasn't spying on you.
- I know that!

998
01:10:42,732 --> 01:10:45,769
There's an urgent phone call
for you from Bitterman.

999
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:47,128
Thank you.

1000
01:10:49,572 --> 01:10:51,563
Say hello to Harold for me.

1001
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:05,565
You all right, Bitterman?

1002
01:11:05,852 --> 01:11:06,967
Yes, sir.

1003
01:11:09,772 --> 01:11:12,161
Would you like me to get you
some Scotch, sir?

1004
01:11:13,012 --> 01:11:14,809
We'll get through this together.

1005
01:11:19,972 --> 01:11:21,564
It's very hard.

1006
01:11:25,132 --> 01:11:27,168
I'm glad to have you here, sir.

1007
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,971
Bitterman, do me a favor.

1008
01:11:33,492 --> 01:11:35,050
Go back to the house.

1009
01:11:35,412 --> 01:11:39,451
Phone my father and Mr. Johnson and
Miss Susan. Tell them what's happened.

1010
01:11:39,692 --> 01:11:43,367
The wedding will have to wait.
And bring me back some clothes here.

1011
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:57,607
Okay, let's open the presents.

1012
01:11:58,652 --> 01:11:59,846
I'm sorry, Arthur.

1013
01:12:00,772 --> 01:12:03,286
- For what?
- For leaving you.

1014
01:12:05,372 --> 01:12:06,771
You're not leaving anyone.

1015
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:14,482
Why, it's a basketball!

1016
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:17,966
What the hell?
I knew you didn't have one.

1017
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:21,006
If I feel the urge to dribble...

1018
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:23,049
...I can always call the nurse.

1019
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,970
I'll put this over here.

1020
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:34,846
You purchased a choo-choo?

1021
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:36,963
Look, the wheels go round.

1022
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:45,484
I'm very pleased.

1023
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:47,165
Do you remember...

1024
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:50,921
...when you used to play
hide-and-seek with me?

1025
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:53,128
I used to hide and
you never found me!

1026
01:12:53,772 --> 01:12:56,491
- Did you know I never looked?
- Come on!

1027
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:01,691
Well, I looked a little.

1028
01:13:03,932 --> 01:13:05,763
One for you, one for me.
Put it on.

1029
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:09,163
I don't wish to put it on.

1030
01:13:14,492 --> 01:13:16,050
I'll put it on.

1031
01:13:20,732 --> 01:13:24,566
If I begin to die,
please take this off my head.

1032
01:13:24,852 --> 01:13:26,968
This isn't how
I wish to be remembered.

1033
01:13:29,692 --> 01:13:30,966
Aren't they great?

1034
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:36,726
I've got guns and
holsters too. Look.

1035
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:41,971
Just in town for supplies, partner.

1036
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:46,125
Arthur, I'm frightened.

1037
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,963
I know you're frightened.

1038
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:55,568
I'm going to take care of you.

1039
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:31,605
Good morning, Mr. Bach.

1040
01:14:31,852 --> 01:14:32,967
Hi, Ken.

1041
01:14:39,332 --> 01:14:41,050
Here, I'll take that.

1042
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:44,568
You look terrible.
You haven't slept in a week.

1043
01:14:44,932 --> 01:14:47,207
Well, we had a bad night.
He was up.

1044
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:50,085
I got the kippers and eggs.
I'll get fired.

1045
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:52,527
No, you won't.

1046
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:55,121
Listen.

1047
01:14:55,772 --> 01:14:57,000
For lunch...

1048
01:14:58,932 --> 01:15:02,766
...I want the trout almondine
from Lutece. Tell Henri it's for me.

1049
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:04,166
He shouldn't eat that.

1050
01:15:04,372 --> 01:15:07,205
I don't want his last meal
to be Jell-O.

1051
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,568
Thanks very much. See you later.

1052
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:13,645
Look who's up.

1053
01:15:17,652 --> 01:15:19,768
We have eggs, we have kippers.

1054
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:22,606
We have croissants.
We have a yellow rose.

1055
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:26,447
We have strawberries.
We have blueberry cakes.

1056
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:29,331
We have orange juice
and great coffee.

1057
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:33,203
Right. Table for one, sir.

1058
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:35,126
Your regular.

1059
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:38,725
You know, Arthur...

1060
01:15:39,972 --> 01:15:41,564
...I'm very glad you're here.

1061
01:15:42,012 --> 01:15:44,685
I want you to eat this.
This is costing me.

1062
01:15:44,932 --> 01:15:48,322
I've got chefs working at six
in the morning all over town.

1063
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:50,324
You look awful.

1064
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,968
That's because you've never
seen me sober. Now eat.

1065
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:56,402
Come on. You used to make me eat.

1066
01:16:04,532 --> 01:16:06,250
It's not so bad.

1067
01:16:06,892 --> 01:16:09,360
You don't need to be
so frightened about it.

1068
01:16:11,212 --> 01:16:13,442
- What?
- Dying.

1069
01:16:14,652 --> 01:16:16,324
Seems natural.

1070
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,724
Even comforting, now.

1071
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:22,164
You're even teaching me
how to die?

1072
01:16:22,772 --> 01:16:25,764
I'm through teaching you anything.

1073
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:28,525
You've grown up.

1074
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:42,168
You can do anything
with your life that you want to.

1075
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:46,966
What do you mean?

1076
01:16:48,452 --> 01:16:49,965
Figure it out.

1077
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,643
You seen Linda Marolla lately?

1078
01:16:53,412 --> 01:16:54,925
Linda Marolla?

1079
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:57,330
Why would you ask about her?

1080
01:16:57,532 --> 01:17:00,922
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm dying.

1081
01:17:08,492 --> 01:17:10,210
Want me to read you Shakespeare?

1082
01:17:10,452 --> 01:17:13,171
Hamlet was in big trouble
when we left off.

1083
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:14,487
No.

1084
01:17:29,572 --> 01:17:31,290
You're a good son.

1085
01:18:25,012 --> 01:18:27,890
You take your average kid today.

1086
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:30,408
He don't want to go in the army.

1087
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:32,961
Yeah, what does he care? Dope!

1088
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:36,847
But the Communists,
they go in the army!

1089
01:18:37,532 --> 01:18:40,046
If only we had some Communists here.

1090
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:41,840
No.

1091
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:45,686
While our kids are dancing...

1092
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:48,771
...their kids are learning
how to fight!

1093
01:18:49,012 --> 01:18:51,162
Everybody's dancing here!

1094
01:18:53,372 --> 01:18:56,569
You're right. You're right.
It's not worth talking about.

1095
01:18:56,772 --> 01:18:59,570
- Let me buy you another drink.
- Right.

1096
01:19:00,052 --> 01:19:01,280
What do you do?

1097
01:19:01,892 --> 01:19:03,689
I'm a dance instructor.

1098
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:09,170
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding!
Honest to God.

1099
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,367
I'm a dentist.

1100
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:12,649
I hate dentists.

1101
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:16,927
We're not bad guys.
It's not easy, you know.

1102
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:20,329
There's teeth and gums and blood!

1103
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:22,164
Oh, my God!

1104
01:19:22,572 --> 01:19:25,211
I have to get looped
just to walk into my office.

1105
01:19:25,452 --> 01:19:28,967
Bartender!
We would like two more, please.

1106
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:33,170
- Haven't you had enough?
- I want more than enough.

1107
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:38,487
How come you got all this
money for all these drinks?

1108
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:43,010
I saved my money.
I haven't had a drink in a month.

1109
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,804
Oh, my God!

1110
01:19:45,052 --> 01:19:47,202
Well, you see, my father died.

1111
01:19:49,732 --> 01:19:51,529
So I stayed sober.

1112
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:55,243
One night at the hospital...

1113
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:58,165
...he fell asleep.
I was watching him.

1114
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:00,361
And then...

1115
01:20:01,412 --> 01:20:03,687
...he just kept on sleeping.

1116
01:20:04,852 --> 01:20:06,808
And I was all alone.

1117
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,923
Oh, that's terrible.

1118
01:20:09,812 --> 01:20:11,245
Listen...

1119
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:14,166
...I was lucky to know him at all.

1120
01:20:17,452 --> 01:20:19,010
Are you somebody's father?

1121
01:20:19,252 --> 01:20:21,208
No, I'm a drunk.

1122
01:20:22,012 --> 01:20:25,527
I have a brother
who moved to New Jersey.

1123
01:20:26,452 --> 01:20:28,170
I'm getting married soon.

1124
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:29,561
Great!

1125
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:31,490
I don't love her.

1126
01:20:32,492 --> 01:20:33,481
I don't love her!

1127
01:20:33,732 --> 01:20:35,211
Well, don't make a scene!

1128
01:20:35,452 --> 01:20:37,682
No, I'm sorry, but there's...

1129
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:39,285
...this other girl.

1130
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,810
She steals ties...

1131
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,132
...and gives them to her father.
She's funny.

1132
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:51,726
I want her.

1133
01:20:53,612 --> 01:20:54,601
I want her!

1134
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:56,040
I have to go.

1135
01:20:58,972 --> 01:21:00,200
Sorry.

1136
01:21:00,492 --> 01:21:03,450
Sir, your wedding is within
less than five hours.

1137
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:04,967
Listen.

1138
01:21:05,212 --> 01:21:07,168
Go see your brother.

1139
01:21:07,412 --> 01:21:08,288
All right?

1140
01:21:08,652 --> 01:21:11,371
Nobody should be alone.

1141
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:13,409
It's awful...

1142
01:21:13,972 --> 01:21:15,530
...to be alone.

1143
01:21:23,452 --> 01:21:26,410
I want you to know, if he doesn't
show up for this wedding...

1144
01:21:26,652 --> 01:21:27,562
...I'll kill him.

1145
01:21:27,812 --> 01:21:31,691
Don't worry about it, Burt.
I talk to Arthur every day.

1146
01:21:31,932 --> 01:21:34,810
Since Hobson's death, he's stopped
drinking. He's anxious to work.

1147
01:21:35,132 --> 01:21:38,886
He's become a responsible citizen.
He'll be a good husband.

1148
01:21:39,452 --> 01:21:41,568
Thanks very much.
Have a nice day.

1149
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:45,770
- Where's my roll?
- We're having it monogrammed.

1150
01:21:45,972 --> 01:21:47,928
Hurry up with the old man's roll!

1151
01:21:50,532 --> 01:21:51,408
Can I help you?

1152
01:21:52,652 --> 01:21:54,961
Do you recommend the French toast?

1153
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:56,611
With all of my heart.

1154
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,851
Lady, I got customers.

1155
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,526
I'll have it.

1156
01:22:01,772 --> 01:22:03,808
You've made the right decision.

1157
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:05,360
Wait a minute! Wait!

1158
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:07,045
I've waited long enough.

1159
01:22:08,852 --> 01:22:11,650
Can you take the next
60 years off?

1160
01:22:12,452 --> 01:22:13,885
I'll have to ask.

1161
01:22:17,372 --> 01:22:19,932
- You want some coffee?
- Where's my roll?

1162
01:22:20,172 --> 01:22:21,366
Wait! I'll get it!

1163
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:24,445
- What the hell's going on?
- She's getting your roll.

1164
01:22:28,372 --> 01:22:29,566
Here's your roll.

1165
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:30,722
Arthur, what happened?

1166
01:22:30,972 --> 01:22:32,200
Hobson died.

1167
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:33,487
I know.

1168
01:22:33,732 --> 01:22:36,405
He loved you very much.
Did you know that?

1169
01:22:36,692 --> 01:22:39,001
And I think I'll grow up.

1170
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:40,446
I want to marry you.

1171
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:45,249
Although I'm supposed
to marry Susan in 20 minutes.

1172
01:22:45,492 --> 01:22:48,564
- He's drunk, but he sounds sincere.
- Eat your roll!

1173
01:22:50,212 --> 01:22:52,567
The money.
Can you live without the money?

1174
01:22:53,012 --> 01:22:54,604
Well, we'll have to.

1175
01:22:57,052 --> 01:22:58,929
Please marry me.

1176
01:23:00,692 --> 01:23:03,365
I'll try to be sober
and to make you happy.

1177
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:06,285
Although it won't be easy,
because I'll be poor.

1178
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:07,408
We'll be poor.

1179
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:08,681
We'll be poor.

1180
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,600
- Most people are poor.
- Eat your roll!

1181
01:23:13,852 --> 01:23:17,242
Now, I have to tell Susan.
Come with me?

1182
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,481
I got to change.

1183
01:23:18,732 --> 01:23:20,450
- I'll cover for you.
- All right.

1184
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:24,766
Last night, I could have sworn
the moon was following me.

1185
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:26,405
It was.

1186
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:55,363
I'm Arthur Bach, the groom.

1187
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:57,051
Congratulations!

1188
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:59,408
Thank you. And to you too.

1189
01:23:59,652 --> 01:24:02,724
I wonder, could you tell me
where the wedding party is?

1190
01:24:04,932 --> 01:24:06,923
Right over there, in that room.

1191
01:24:07,452 --> 01:24:10,922
Thank you very much.
You've got a lovely...

1192
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:18,125
...hat! Hat. It's called a hat.

1193
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,086
Good luck, Arthur.

1194
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:28,368
Thank you very much.
I'm Arthur Bach, the groom.

1195
01:24:29,492 --> 01:24:30,766
I'm Arthur Bach.

1196
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:41,923
Did you forget your garter belt?

1197
01:24:49,612 --> 01:24:51,011
Sorry I'm late.

1198
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:57,365
Susan, just the one I wanted
to talk to.

1199
01:24:57,612 --> 01:24:58,169
Nice dress.

1200
01:24:58,412 --> 01:25:01,722
- Arthur, the ceremony's just...
- Yeah, I know.

1201
01:25:03,212 --> 01:25:07,125
Could we just talk for a moment,
away from all these people?

1202
01:25:08,412 --> 01:25:09,481
Of course.

1203
01:25:24,012 --> 01:25:26,128
I don't love you. I don't love you.

1204
01:25:26,332 --> 01:25:28,527
- What is it, dear?
- I don't love you.

1205
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:30,321
I don't love you!

1206
01:25:30,732 --> 01:25:32,529
It's right in that room over there.

1207
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:34,723
Thank you.
Your hat is lovely.

1208
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:36,646
I've heard.

1209
01:25:38,892 --> 01:25:40,325
You're drunk?

1210
01:25:41,332 --> 01:25:42,685
You're frightened?

1211
01:25:42,932 --> 01:25:44,570
I'm both of those.

1212
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:47,007
I know, but I'm...

1213
01:25:47,252 --> 01:25:48,970
...in love with another woman.

1214
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:53,727
- What, dear?
- I'm in love with another woman.

1215
01:25:55,852 --> 01:25:56,967
I'm in love...

1216
01:25:57,972 --> 01:26:00,042
...with another...

1217
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:01,281
...woman!

1218
01:26:02,132 --> 01:26:03,884
Susan, the one innocent...

1219
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,323
...person in all of this has been you.
I'm really sorry.

1220
01:26:07,532 --> 01:26:09,363
Shut up, Arthur! Just shut up!

1221
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,850
Daddy!

1222
01:26:17,532 --> 01:26:19,443
Hello, Mr. Johnson!

1223
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:35,290
He must be nervous.

1224
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:37,124
Arthur gets nervous.

1225
01:26:39,212 --> 01:26:41,567
Here's your ring, Arthur.

1226
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:44,165
I hope you're happy.

1227
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:47,722
Now, stand up, son, I want
to kill you with my bare hands.

1228
01:26:50,052 --> 01:26:53,761
I think you know everyone.
This is Susan's father.

1229
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:55,685
My God! Arthur, you're really hurt!

1230
01:26:57,732 --> 01:27:00,644
I've got him right
where I want him.

1231
01:27:05,572 --> 01:27:07,369
You animal!

1232
01:27:07,612 --> 01:27:09,011
Look, it's over!

1233
01:27:09,332 --> 01:27:12,449
He doesn't love your daughter.
I'm sorry. It happens.

1234
01:27:12,772 --> 01:27:13,807
He loves me.

1235
01:27:15,012 --> 01:27:16,650
What about Harold?

1236
01:27:17,772 --> 01:27:19,410
Harold?

1237
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:21,370
- You poor thing.
- Stand aside.

1238
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:25,446
Now, is this the slut that
you've disgraced my daughter for?!

1239
01:27:25,692 --> 01:27:26,488
Slut?!

1240
01:27:28,212 --> 01:27:29,281
Slut?!

1241
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:53,488
Please, Daddy!

1242
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:56,326
- Daddy, he's not worth it.
- Just sit up.

1243
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,164
Can you move, Arthur?

1244
01:27:58,532 --> 01:27:59,760
Everybody out!

1245
01:28:00,732 --> 01:28:02,370
Out! All of you, out!

1246
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:06,765
God!

1247
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:15,125
He's taking the knife
out of the cheese!

1248
01:28:16,492 --> 01:28:18,005
Do you think he wants
some cheese?

1249
01:28:18,212 --> 01:28:20,282
No, I think we're going to die!

1250
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:30,971
What's going on here?

1251
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,128
Stop that this instant!

1252
01:28:34,612 --> 01:28:37,365
Don't screw with me, Burt!

1253
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:19,243
Ladies and gentlemen...

1254
01:29:21,932 --> 01:29:23,081
...I'm sorry.

1255
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:28,761
As you probably have surmised by now...

1256
01:29:29,012 --> 01:29:30,843
...there will be no wedding.

1257
01:29:32,652 --> 01:29:34,051
The bride...

1258
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:36,010
...has had second thoughts...

1259
01:29:36,692 --> 01:29:38,444
...and has decided...

1260
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:40,125
...not to marry me.

1261
01:29:40,372 --> 01:29:43,523
Most of you know me.
Can you blame her?

1262
01:29:47,412 --> 01:29:51,041
I won't be seeing most of you
anymore because...

1263
01:29:53,452 --> 01:29:55,522
...I'm going to be...

1264
01:29:56,812 --> 01:29:57,927
...poor.

1265
01:30:01,892 --> 01:30:03,530
I'll miss you.

1266
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:11,206
Now there's a good...

1267
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:13,283
...chance I should go...

1268
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:16,010
...to the hospital.

1269
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,363
This has some iodine on it,
so it might hurt a little.

1270
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:34,728
That hurts, I hate it! Stop it!

1271
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:39,248
- Why did you do that?
- Because I hate an infection!

1272
01:30:40,012 --> 01:30:42,128
If you'd have just
let me get...

1273
01:30:49,412 --> 01:30:51,528
Look, as long as we're here...

1274
01:30:51,932 --> 01:30:53,809
Do you promise to love me...

1275
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:55,326
...and obey me?

1276
01:30:55,732 --> 01:30:56,960
And be a good boy?

1277
01:31:00,892 --> 01:31:01,722
I do.

1278
01:31:02,412 --> 01:31:06,200
And do you promise never to put
that stuff on my face again?

1279
01:31:06,572 --> 01:31:07,448
I do.

1280
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:09,887
God!

1281
01:31:10,452 --> 01:31:12,329
We're going to be great!

1282
01:31:13,252 --> 01:31:15,288
We're going to be like...

1283
01:31:15,492 --> 01:31:19,724
...one of those poor couples
on the subway who hold hands.

1284
01:31:20,332 --> 01:31:22,323
How much is the subway?

1285
01:31:22,812 --> 01:31:25,849
Sixty cents. But if you spit,
it's a $500 fine.

1286
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:28,248
Then I won't spit.

1287
01:31:28,492 --> 01:31:30,289
Good! None of the best people do.

1288
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:31,806
I'll get a job!

1289
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:34,723
That's what I'll do!

1290
01:31:34,972 --> 01:31:36,690
I'll get a job!

1291
01:31:37,612 --> 01:31:38,567
I'll work!

1292
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:40,731
God, this'll be great!

1293
01:31:40,972 --> 01:31:43,566
- Good! Look how excited he is.
- I'll come home from work.

1294
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:45,684
You'll be ironing.

1295
01:31:45,932 --> 01:31:48,207
We'll eat some cheap,
disgusting food.

1296
01:31:48,452 --> 01:31:49,328
Stop!

1297
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:51,570
I think we're in trouble.

1298
01:31:53,812 --> 01:31:56,007
That is out of the question!

1299
01:31:57,292 --> 01:32:00,648
There has never been such a thing
as a working-class Bach!

1300
01:32:01,492 --> 01:32:03,562
And there never will be!

1301
01:32:06,412 --> 01:32:08,528
Step! Step!

1302
01:32:10,372 --> 01:32:11,805
I've reached a decision.

1303
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:16,927
The Bach family must endure.
And not on a subway.

1304
01:32:17,372 --> 01:32:20,125
Your children will be
senators, ambassadors.

1305
01:32:20,372 --> 01:32:22,727
Perhaps even a president!

1306
01:32:23,772 --> 01:32:27,321
You have your 750 million dollars.

1307
01:32:28,092 --> 01:32:29,320
All right!

1308
01:32:34,212 --> 01:32:35,964
I don't know, Martha.

1309
01:32:36,852 --> 01:32:38,285
You don't know?!

1310
01:32:38,532 --> 01:32:41,410
- Money has screwed me up my whole life.
- I know!

1311
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:44,160
I've always been rich
and never been happy.

1312
01:32:44,412 --> 01:32:46,562
I've always been poor
and usually been happy.

1313
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:50,521
Rubbish! I've always been rich
and I've always been happy.

1314
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:55,530
Would you make me
a tuna fish sandwich?

1315
01:32:56,852 --> 01:32:59,525
I'm going to have
a tuna fish sandwich, Martha.

1316
01:32:59,772 --> 01:33:00,921
Step.

1317
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:08,330
I demand that you take this money.

1318
01:33:09,652 --> 01:33:11,927
I want a decision
and I want it now!

1319
01:33:15,532 --> 01:33:19,127
I can't tell you what a lousy
wedding that was, Bitterman.

1320
01:33:21,572 --> 01:33:23,483
Bitterman, goodbye.

1321
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:25,561
I'm going.

1322
01:33:26,212 --> 01:33:27,645
Goodbye, sir.

1323
01:33:27,892 --> 01:33:30,087
It was a pleasure working for you.

1324
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:32,846
Chauffeurs rarely get to laugh.
Thank you.

1325
01:33:33,092 --> 01:33:35,083
- Goodbye, Bitterman.
- Goodbye, miss.

1326
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:38,682
Arthur, I'm going!
Open that door, Rockland!

1327
01:33:39,972 --> 01:33:42,964
- Ever been on a yacht?
- No, is it wonderful?

1328
01:33:43,212 --> 01:33:45,123
It doesn't suck.

1329
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:48,689
I shall never offer you
this money again.

1330
01:33:49,612 --> 01:33:52,365
I wish you luck in your poverty.

1331
01:33:59,212 --> 01:34:00,361
Excuse me.

1332
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:21,481
What happened?

1333
01:34:21,732 --> 01:34:23,085
I turned her down.

1334
01:34:24,172 --> 01:34:26,322
She invited us for dinner
and I said...

1335
01:34:26,532 --> 01:34:29,649
...we're having a tuna fish sandwich.
So I turned her down.

1336
01:34:30,772 --> 01:34:33,525
I took the money, I mean,
I'm not crazy!

1337
01:34:35,892 --> 01:34:37,530
Do you want to double your salary?

1338
01:34:37,812 --> 01:34:40,007
- Then open that door.
- Right away, sir.

1339
01:34:40,252 --> 01:34:41,526
Is that funny?

1340
01:34:44,052 --> 01:34:45,007
Where to, sir?

1341
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:50,365
The park. Drive through the park.
You know how I love the park.

1342
01:34:51,612 --> 01:34:53,682
- Get in! Step!
- Step!

1343
01:34:54,132 --> 01:34:56,600
