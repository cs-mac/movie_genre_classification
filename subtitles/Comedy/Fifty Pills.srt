00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:21,163
Hi. I hate myself.

2
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,332
Leave a message.

3
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:27,586
Darren, you dumb son of a bitch, stop
wallowing in self pity and wake up.

4
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,882
Christ. All right, look. I'm already
on my way to Philly for the weekend.

5
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,009
Lindsay’s being a bitch about something.

6
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,387
Someone told her I banged
her older sister, which I did.

7
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,889
But it was while we broke up
for that week in September.

8
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,684
I don't know why she’s so pissed about
it. But anyway, I gotta head down there

9
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:45,604
before she goes ballistic on
me. But, um, back to my point. I…

10
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:59,994
Hi. I hate myself.

11
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,037
Leave a message.

12
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:06,041
Darren, you dipshit. I
know you're still sleeping.

13
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:10,171
So wake up. I found a way
for your ass to stay in school.

14
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:13,841
Okay, man look. I felt kinda bad

15
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:17,178
about the whole thing with the alcohol
violation, and your scholarship.

16
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,346
You're the one that threw
the party, you asshole.

17
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,017
I'm the one that threw the party,
and I'm the asshole. I know.

18
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,437
So I guess you could say this
is my way of making it up to you.

19
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,357
Okay? Now look on my desk.

20
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,527
There are 50 pills of
ecstasy, and one of my pagers.

21
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,071
Now you have to remember
there's no voicemail on that one

22
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:39,742
so the numbers are gonna
come straight through, okay?

23
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:42,578
Look, exams are over, my man, and
you know are gonna wanna get down …

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,705
What the fuck are you talking
about, Coleman? I can’t do this.

25
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:48,334
Sure you can. - I am not like you.
I'm not a fucking drug dealer.

26
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:51,587
What are you thinking, man? Are you
crazy? - Darren, you'll do fine.

27
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:54,548
But, uh, no, this…
- No. No buts.

28
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,592
I am gonna fucking get arrested.

29
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:59,845
Look, man. It’s only one day,
and no one’s gonna notice you.

30
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,224
I have to turn in a paper
on Dante’s Inferno today.

31
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,226
Look, man, uh, I gotta go.

32
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,311
You're, you're breakin’ up here really
bad. Listen hang in there, buddy, bye.

33
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,355
No, don't you fucking hang
up this... Coleman! Coleman,

34
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:12,775
I can’t do this. I'm
not gonna do this. Fuck!

35
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:35,381
Holy shit.

36
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,433
I hate you, Coleman!

37
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:57,611
#FIFTY PILLS#

38
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,053
#NEW YORK CITY#

39
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:49,557
#FOUR MONTHS EARLIER#

40
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,407
#COLEMAN#

41
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,492
My first year at college.

42
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:12,663
It’s about damn time. That’s what
you're supposed to say, right?

43
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,380
Within 10 minutes, I met
my new roommate, Coleman.

44
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,009
From the first time I saw him, I
knew I’d never met anybody like him.

45
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:29,221
Yo, yo, Green Day. What the fuck,
does this look like my bathroom?

46
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,558
What are you gonna do next, take
a shit on my bed? - Yo, man, sorry.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,769
Yeah, don't be sorry,
just fix it. It’s simple.

48
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,107
Hey, what’s up, man, I'm Coleman.

49
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:43,319
I didn’t know if I wanted
to know anybody like him.

50
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,948
It made me wonder why his parents sent
movers instead of coming by themselves.

51
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:53,496
Mine, mine wanted to. Just they really
couldn’t take the time off of work.

52
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:01,128
Do well, son.

53
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:06,550
First time away from home?
- Yeah. I went to camp, though, once.

54
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,013
You ever had international phone sex?
- What?

55
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,557
Wait, hold that thought.
Uh, do you smoke?

56
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,228
Hell yeah, I'm from
North Carolina, come on.

57
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:21,649
I grew up on these things.

58
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,535
That’s okay. Enjoy.

59
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,374
You can’t imagine how rad it is to
get off while talking to some chick

60
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:41,794
on another continent who’s getting
off, and sometimes in a language

61
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:45,464
that you don't even speak. Kicks ass.

62
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:50,594
I was impressed. It was either at
that moment or somewhere near it

63
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:53,681
that Coleman became
my new personal hero.

64
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,601
It’s like this. If you
act like the fuckin’ man…

65
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,564
…and you think you're the fuckin’
man, then nothing is gonna make

66
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:05,568
that other schmuck lookin’ up to you
think that you're not the fuckin’ man.

67
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:09,947
Everything in
life involves a little creativity.

68
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:12,032
It literally took Coleman
about five minutes…

69
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,161
No, no, no, no, no. Four
minutes, 15 seconds, please.

70
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:20,124
Four minutes, 15 seconds to realize
that we had to have a moving in party.

71
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,209
The best way to have a good party is…

72
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:27,381
To fucking advertise. New
York, I'm here, bitches!

73
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,469
Apparently, summer
internships at his father’s

74
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,806
multimillion dollar PR
firm really paid off.

75
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,105
Yeah, you know that’s what I'm packin’.

76
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,357
Dude.
- What?

77
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:48,736
Did they pretend they don't
like it? They fuckin’ love it.

78
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,863
You know, I doubt it.

79
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:55,284
Why do you think they come
here? Same reason you did.

80
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,536
To learn?

81
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,092
Yeah, welcome.

82
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:14,762
Okay, everybody, let’s
go, party’s over, come on.

83
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:18,766
Make sure you take cabs.
- I know. Stupid. Really stupid.

84
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:22,269
This is when I realized that Coleman
should be no one’s personal hero.

85
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,814
See, what we failed to realize was
that if we write about the party

86
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:28,692
on every whiteboard in the dorm,
the RAs are gonna see it too.

87
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,320
Darren Giles. Welcome to college.

88
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,531
Yeah, I think we’re gonna
have to write you guys up.

89
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:37,493
No, you don't have to…
- Check, check, three checks.

90
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:41,413
That’s a lotta checks. - You guys
are like a couple of Germans.

91
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:44,917
I don't even know what that means.

92
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,089
You see, what happened is we invited this
guy that lives on our hall to come over

93
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:53,217
and hang out, and it just got
outrageous. I don't know what happened.

94
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,261
Could this have had
anything to do with it?

95
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,346
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy,

96
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:01,892
so get your ass down to room 315
tonight and meet the real Tin Man?

97
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,729
Well, he
- he looks happy.

98
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:11,735
And how about this?
- That? That belongs to Coleman.

99
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:13,821
Christ, I made that thing with
some friends in high school.

100
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:17,616
It’s for show. I drink out of glasses.
I would never use something like that.

101
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,827
You and your
roommate are going on probation

102
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,079
On probation?
- Probation.

103
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,957
What do you wanna do next? You
wanna put a collar around my nutsack?

104
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,003
Yes, sir?
- Felicia,

105
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:32,673
bring a collar for his nutsack.
And you goin’ on probation today.

106
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:36,260
You goin’ on probation as of
two minutes after you leave here.

107
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,638
And if you try it, if you have a little
one, if you have a little tiny drink,

108
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,682
you are goin’ to lose that scholarship,

109
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:45,144
you are going to lose your financial
aid, and I will personally make sure

110
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:49,231
that you never go to another
university for the rest of your life.

111
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,986
From the second day of my college
existence, I had one strike against me.

112
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,659
So, now all we had to do was be good.

113
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:05,748
And we were good. Good at
not getting caught again.

114
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:49,583
Believe it or not, I was
actually looking forward

115
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,169
to Thanksgiving break
with my parents.

116
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:56,632
Clean sheets, toilet
paper, a refrigerator.

117
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:59,593
With food in it.

118
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,642
Doreen, you have outdone yourself
with that stuffing. Fantastic.

119
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:13,315
Son, your mother and I have
something we’d like to tell you.

120
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:16,193
Yeah. No need to be
alarmed…

121
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,362
…what’s the best way to put this?

122
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:22,324
I don't know, the best way to put it is
that we’re going through a few changes.

123
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,536
Yeah, we’re, uh…
- You're not pregnant, are you?

124
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,997
No.

125
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,876
No, no. I should be so lucky, huh?
- What the hell does that mean?

126
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,545
Harold, it’s been four months, and
if it weren’t for Mr. Red upstairs,

127
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,547
I’d probably have lost my mind.

128
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:40,009
Damn, Mom, that’sdisgusting! We’re
eating. - Don't say damn to your mother.

129
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,052
And you don't have to bring up our
intimate times in front of the boy.

130
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,096
Well, honey, a little companionship
in that department would be very nice.

131
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,515
I can't believe this.
- I’m gonna go upstairs.

132
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:49,602
I'm allergic to the Viagra.
- What?

133
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,897
Yeah, uh, it makes me sweat,
and gives me wet shits.

134
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:55,649
Oh, I am sorry. I mental images are.

135
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,110
Honey, that was the kielbasa.
- You sit down. It’s not the kielbasa.

136
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,154
We had to sent that carpet to
the cleaners. It cost a fortune.

137
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:02,698
Sit. Talk.

138
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,409
Son, I have something very
important I wanna tell you.

139
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:08,329
Don't you wanna hear it?
- Fine.

140
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,669
Son, your father’s been laid off.

141
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,714
They're replacing me with
a damned laptop computer.

142
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,883
Windows 98, or some foul thing.

143
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,427
I'm sorry, Dad. That’s
- that’s really screwed up.

144
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:25,763
No, it’s fucked up, is what it is.

145
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,432
Let’s, you know, call a spade a spade.

146
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,188
I
- I have to get that.

147
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,860
What was with you bringing up
our sex life in front of him?

148
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:43,823
Hello?
- Mr. Darren.

149
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,158
How did I know it would be you?

150
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,744
#GRACIE# - Gracie was at the party
we threw that first night.

151
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:53,582
For some reason, she was talking to me.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,088
Jesus Christ. Oh my God.

153
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,215
It wasn’t longer than the whiteboard.

154
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,551
Oh, I don't know, I didn’t see.

155
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,095
I didn’t mean to.

156
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:11,225
All right, here’s to new
beginnings, and all that shit.

157
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:16,897
I need a refill, though.

158
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,776
Well, maybe next time.

159
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:23,571
Definitely.

160
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:58,230
That Gracie chick is hot,
man. You should tap it.

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,068
Dude, she just broke up with
her boyfriend like two days ago.

162
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,030
I don't really think she was ready
to jump into another relationship.

163
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:10,493
Who’s talking about a relationship? I'm
just saying she’s got the hot ass, is all.

164
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:17,458
All right. I'm goin’ to bed.

165
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:21,754
Mr. Darren.
- How did I know it would be you?

166
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,798
Having fun in the bible belt?

167
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,967
Does hearing about your parents’
sex life constitute as fun?

168
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:30,471
I would think no.
- Yeah, I agree.

169
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:35,976
Do you, like, when I get back, do you
wanna go have dinner or something?

170
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,523
Invitation accepted.

171
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:43,234
Yeah, 'cause we, you know, we could
bring, like, friends and stuff like that.

172
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,528
We could, you know, go
in a group or somethin’.

173
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:47,863
Okay, sure.

174
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,284
I’d better get going. Michelle’s
interpretive dance show is about to start.

175
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,912
I... okay.
- Good night, Darren.

176
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,164
Bye, see you.

177
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:04,630
Greasy, greasy, greasy.

178
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:10,136
Greasy?

179
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:31,490
I was just curious. Shit.

180
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,301
Bumpin’ uglies is not
appropriate dinner conversation.

181
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,511
Honey, he’s very upset. Why
don't you have a talk with him?

182
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,389
I think he’s upset because you have a
talk. You have the rapport with him.

183
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,683
Why don't you establish a rapport
with him and have a relationship

184
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,977
with somebody in this family, huh?
- Go on, go on.

185
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:09,069
Fine. I’ll talk to him.
- Woman’s job to talk to her son.

186
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:31,133
Honey? Darren? Sweetie?

187
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,678
You know, Dad and I
didn’t mean to scare you.

188
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,311
Honey?

189
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:47,608
Sweetie, we just, well, I’d really
rather talk to you face to face.

190
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:51,779
Can I come in?
- Yeah.

191
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:54,073
Okay.

192
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,993
Mom! God!

193
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:05,626
Oh my God.

194
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,963
You're gay!

195
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,844
Close the door!

196
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,639
It has nothing to do with your sex
life or me not wanting to be here.

197
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,268
I just have to get home and protect my
room. - Son, son, be honest with me.

198
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,771
Do you have a boyfriend that you're
going back to New York to see? Do you?

199
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,732
It’s okay you.
- I am not gay! What’s wrong with you?

200
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,485
Shh, keep it down.

201
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,822
Put the window down. Put it down.

202
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,366
Oh, honey.
- Come on, come on, now.

203
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:39,743
Don't leave us like this. You know, I
looked it up on the Internet last night.

204
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,745
It’s okay to be gay.
It’s almost natural.

205
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,873
Honey, why don't you just
stay a couple more days?

206
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:47,084
We can work this out, son. I’ll go to
a gay bar with you. One step at a time.

207
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,545
Honey, if you have a special
friend, you can bring him home.

208
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,922
We’ll hang a gay flag in
the front of the house.

209
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,216
Honey, we understand these things.
- Yeah, we do.

210
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:56,343
We saw “Philadelphia.”
- We loved it!

211
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,555
All I wanted to do was get home,

212
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,225
have a few beers, and
party with my friends.

213
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,394
But they weren’t there.

214
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:09,023
Coleman wasn’t even
there. Then, I saw why.

215
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,820
Apparently, Coleman had thrown
a party while I was away,

216
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,490
and guess what? It got
busted. Now you would think

217
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:21,243
that because I wasn’t there,
I wouldn’t be in trouble, right?

218
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,079
No. A bottle of vodka in my refrigerator

219
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,916
made it my responsibility
and my problem.

220
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,504
I was fucked. My scholarship
was gone, and without that money,

221
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:35,341
I couldn’t even register
for classes next semester.

222
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:03,702
So here I am, a thousand dollars
short, 24 hours to pay it,

223
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:07,206
50 pills of ecstasy, and I'm
actually contemplating doing this.

224
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,126
#THE DAY BEGINS#

225
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,462
Hey.
- Hey.

226
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,298
Good morning to you, too.

227
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,761
It’s D day.
- I know.

228
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,100
Sorry. God, you’ve really
cleaned this place out.

229
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:29,103
Yeah, I'm just, you know, scraping
at the bottom of the barrel now.

230
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:34,525
There’s nothing left. But I'm,
you know, I could ask my parents,

231
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,194
it’s just that they don't have it.

232
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:41,198
And my grandparents, I
already tapped them out, so.

233
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:47,246
Hey, what’s up, Darren? Uh, you
still wanna do that deal, dude?

234
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:50,374
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,626
Deal?

236
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,301
Ten bucks, right, dude?

237
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:03,679
Yeah, you got it, man. Thanks.

238
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:07,016
I fuckin’ love David Duchovny.

239
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:12,813
What?
- Nothing. I just...

240
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:17,777
What?
- Nothing. Don't worry about it.

241
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:21,197
I just thought Coleman
might be rubbing off on you

242
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,491
a little bit too much for your own good.

243
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:27,453
Oh, no. That’s funny.

244
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:32,458
God, I can’t imagine this place
without you. Is that weird?

245
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:39,465
Well, let’s not go getting all sentimental.
I have to run an errand with Michelle.

246
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:42,009
But I’ll see you for
the Christmas fundraiser?

247
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,512
Hell yeah, definitely. I will be there.

248
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,057
Okay. I’ll be there until 9:00, but
dress warm, 'cause it’s gonna be cold out.

249
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,727
You're not gonna believe this,
but I just sold my jacket.

250
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,691
Okay. I’ll bring blankets.
- Okay.

251
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:01,737
Okay. Hey, don't worry
about this stuff. Okay?

252
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:06,158
You'll figure something out. 'Cause
you're good at this sort of thing.

253
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,537
Yeah.

254
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,634
Hi. Hi, sir.

255
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:27,346
Good morning, Darren.
- Something I can help you with?

256
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:31,225
I got a call from the finance department.
I think you know what they had to say.

257
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:36,272
I know. I mean, um, what,
what am I supposed to do?

258
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:40,734
You know, can’t you help, or? I wasn’t here
when they got written up. You know that.

259
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:44,822
My hands are tied. It’s policy.
And if I could do something,

260
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:51,287
I... you're a good kid.
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

261
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:54,999
No, sir, there’s
nothing you can do.

262
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:59,628
Look. I’ll hold off on filing
the move order until Monday.

263
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,881
But if you don't get this
straightened out with them by then,

264
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,092
security will enforce your removal
from the building, you understand me?

265
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,511
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

266
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,222
Wish there was more I could do.

267
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,934
Yeah, me too.

268
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:01,816
Hey. Did somebody just page me?

269
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:05,152
I heard you, uh, got some real
kickin’ shit. How much is a pill?

270
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:07,905
Uh, 20. Twenty, uh, I mean, um…

271
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,324
Oh, 20, well, okay,
sounds cool, sounds cool.

272
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:12,326
All right, let me talk
to my boys real quick.

273
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:14,954
Okay, but you know what? Maybe
you should… - …just call back later.

274
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:20,126
#EDUARDO#

275
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:24,755
It’s a university number, yo.

276
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:27,133
Yeah, man, what did you say
this cockfaced man was again?

277
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,677
Coleman, man, like the cooler.

278
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:33,097
Why you so pissed at this guy, Ed?
- I can't tell you, man.

279
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,850
Man, but you expect us to go over
there and bust up this college prick,

280
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,519
but you can’t tell us why.
- It’s embarrassing, V.

281
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,771
Man, we can't justify
crippling some dude on a whim.

282
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,441
Yeah, Little Steve’s just not
that kinda guy. - Yeah. - Right.

283
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:47,570
I was at Vinyl, right? And I see some
super sharp lookin’ motherfucka, right?

284
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:51,323
But he sells cocaine, okay? So,
you know, I buy some, whatever.

285
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,993
I go, you know, I go to the
bathroom, I sniff snort some shit up.

286
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,704
Next thing I know, I
shit in my pants, man,

287
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:59,498
in the middle of my Hammer dance, bro.
- Yeah, we heard about that shit.

288
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,750
That was you? - Now you know
why I got this, motherfucka.

289
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,462
Oh, whoa, whoa!
Put that thing down.

290
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:07,381
Come on, man. Put the gun down. - No.
- What you gonna do with that?

291
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,633
I’m gonna bust a motherfuckin’ cap
in his ass. - Shoot your foot off.

292
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:12,178
Hey, you ain’t never shot a gun before.
- Yeah, I have, dude.

293
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:15,014
I fuckin’ know how to use this shit.
I read the instructions, motherfucka.

294
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:53,469
I am technically a virgin.
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,472
Whatever.

296
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:59,266
Don't let her give you
the wrong impression.

297
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,521
Unless you think it might
be the right impression.

298
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:08,943
All right, then. So let’s
get down to business.

299
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:14,198
Yeah, great. These are 20
apiece. And, how many do you need?

300
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,493
We need four.

301
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:20,287
Eighty bucks?

302
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:25,543
Would you excuse us for
just one second? Just…

303
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:35,469
Well, we do have an hour or so to kill.

304
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:40,307
How about a proposition?

305
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,810
Okay.

306
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:46,689
Maybe there’d be some other
way of paying for these pills?

307
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:49,525
I don't know exactly what you mean.

308
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:57,366
We’d have a real good time,
if you know what I mean.

309
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,494
I'm gonna fuck you with my strap on.

310
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:05,332
I am not really in the position to be…

311
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:08,085
Oh, I like your choice of words.

312
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,090
Position. So. What do you say? Hm?

313
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:20,055
No, I can’t. I'm sorry.
Twenty apiece. I'm sorry.

314
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:24,268
Fine.

315
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,774
Thanks.
- Yeah. - Thank you.

316
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,942
‘Kay. See ya later.

317
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:38,616
Here we go, here we go. Coleman,
you little fuckin’ slut. Graves Hall.

318
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:41,243
They don't give you the
fuckin’ room number, though.

319
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:43,829
I don't know why you're wasting
your time with the little bitch.

320
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:48,042
It’s the principle of the matter, bro.
- Man, what are you talkin’ about?

321
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,336
Tell him, tell him. Tell him.

322
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:53,714
Principle of the matter. And don't
be using my shit to prove your point.

323
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:57,009
Whatever. - It’s something I
came up with a few years back.

324
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:01,806
You know, it’s like a philosophy.
You know, it’s kind of like a force.

325
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:05,351
A force. - But the principle of the
matter here is I don't feel like

326
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:07,770
chasin’ some little college
biotch around all day.

327
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,272
You know what?
I'm with him. I’m with him.

328
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:12,358
No, no, but you know
what? You know what?

329
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,820
It’s 'cause you don't understand.
You guys don't understand. That’s why.

330
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,657
I understand fine. And I think
Little Steve understands fine, too.

331
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:24,912
You couldn’t handle your junk, you
shit your pants doin’ the Hammer dance.

332
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,040
I mean, good God, who
wouldn’t blame somebody else?

333
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,251
I've done the Hammer dance so many
times, I never shit in my pants.

334
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:33,379
I know it was the coke, dude.
He was dealing some bunk shit.

335
00:27:33,462 --> 00:27:36,757
Oh, my God. - Okay? You don't
do that to other people.

336
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:38,801
People don't do that to other people.

337
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:41,887
You don't do that to other people?
What’s it, bad for business?

338
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,931
It’s drug dealing, ya asshole.

339
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:47,351
Not the most ethical business in the
world. God. What’s he talkin’ about?

340
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:49,728
Fuck youse. - Fuck it. Jesus.

341
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,231
All we gotta do is get in the dorm.

342
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,817
Man, I used to date this chick, she
went to school there, and they got this,

343
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,111
coat of arms shit where they
don't, like, lock the doors or some shit.

344
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,780
Oh, shit.
Man, it’s honor code, man.

345
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,866
Honor code.
- Yeah, the fuckin’ honor code.

346
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,702
You ever go to college? - Yeah I went
to college. I went to junior college.

347
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:06,829
You used to pick me
up every day, remember?

348
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:09,623
Junior college for Junior Sanchez.

349
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,960
That’s funny, yeah, yeah. That’s
funny, that’s funny. Fuck you, man.

350
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:32,563
Oh, I love you, Coleman.

351
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:36,692
I know.

352
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:39,570
You know what?

353
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:45,868
I know you love me, and
I really like you for that.

354
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:49,121
So say it, then.

355
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:56,712
I really like you. A lot.

356
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:02,093
Oh my God.
You know what?

357
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,345
Oh, shit. Should I get this?

358
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,972
No. I think you
should get out, is more like it.

359
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:09,767
Look, don't be irrational, okay?
I drove all the way down here.

360
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,936
Yeah, and you
won't even say I love you.

361
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:14,980
Well, that’s a word I like to
save for very special situations.

362
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,525
I am your girlfriend.
- Okay.

363
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,486
Since the ninth grade!
- Yeah, I see where you're going here.

364
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:22,530
I don't even know
why I put up with this anymore.

365
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,990
You know, honey, this
might be important.

366
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:27,243
You know what? I think
you should just get out.

367
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:29,370
I don't even wanna look
at you right now. Get out.

368
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,705
Oh, right. Here we go again. Okay.

369
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:34,708
You slept with my sister. - Yeah, and
I thought we were past that already.

370
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,169
Out!

371
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,797
Wait.

372
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:46,929
You know, it’s not like I slept
with some random girl, okay?

373
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,932
At least you know her.
- Out!

374
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:51,976
Fine. Fine.

375
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,520
Fuck!

376
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:58,858
Press pound for more options.
- I hate you, Coleman.

377
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:21,046
#PETUNIA#

378
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,895
Come on in, it’s open.

379
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:48,491
Hello. I'm sorry, I think
I just have the wrong house.

380
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:53,370
Are you sure? You're the young
man with the ecstasy, aren’t you?

381
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,999
I guess so.

382
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:01,378
Well just go on downstairs. My
granddaughter is waiting for you.

383
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,011
Go on.

384
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:11,972
Okay.

385
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,920
Yes.

386
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:02,940
Yes. You like that, you bitch.

387
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,109
What? What?

388
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:10,239
What are you looking
at? Fuck you. Fuck you.

389
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:14,702
Fuck. Yeah, take it,
take it, you love it.

390
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:17,705
Yes. You like that?

391
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,666
What the fuck do you want?

392
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,961
Didn’t you call me?
I mean, this is…

393
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:28,215
Shut up. Come here.

394
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:33,596
What, you want to be one
of my little bitches, too?

395
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,517
No, no. I'm not really,
I don't... I don't wanna be…

396
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,187
Bitch. Say it. It’s, uh,
it’s healthy. It feels good.

397
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:43,689
A bitch.
- Say it! Scream it!

398
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:48,110
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!
- Good. Now come here.

399
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:53,199
Shit, sorry, dude. Sorry, man.
- Shut up. He probably liked it.

400
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:55,367
Do you have what I want?

401
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:57,620
They're in my pocket.
And you... I can't really

402
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,122
get into my pocket right now
if your hands is and my balls.

403
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:03,667
Fine by me. No fun for you.

404
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:07,171
How many do you want?

405
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:11,759
Well, I need one for myself,
three for these pathetic creatures,

406
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,764
and three for the pathetic assholes
I have coming next hour. So, seven.

407
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:20,476
Yeah. That’s $140.

408
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:25,648
I bind them so they cannot move.

409
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,529
And then, and only then
I give them the ecstasy.

410
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:35,449
No touch. No movement.

411
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:39,411
It is the modern future of
sadomasochistic torture, if you ask me.

412
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,455
Yeah. Sounds cool.

413
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:46,377
Yes, it’s cool, it’s really
cool. Stupid idiot money.

414
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,589
Petunia, honey. Jessica’s on the phone.

415
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,635
Grandma! It’s Madam P. In this room,

416
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,304
I am known as Madam P.

417
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:00,474
All right, honey.

418
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:06,939
Leave now.
- Yes, Petunia. Madam. Madam.

419
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:11,777
And you! And you! You bitch.

420
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:15,030
Shut up. Shut up, Seoul Man, shut up!

421
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:19,994
Seoul Man?
- Yeah, you like that?

422
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:22,746
Seoul Man was something
of a New York legend.

423
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,500
The biggest, baddest, Blackest drug
dealer you'd ever seen in your life.

424
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:31,046
And I just stepped on his hand.

425
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,509
Hello?
- Hi. Is this Darren, the ecstasy guy?

426
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:38,596
Yeah.
- So it is true.

427
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:42,099
Gracie?
Where’d you hear that from?

428
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,935
Well, darling, it’s all anyone
is talking about these days.

429
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:48,063
That’s just fantastic.

430
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:51,984
I'm just kidding. I saw Daniel
in Liquid Sky a few minutes ago.

431
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:56,697
Meet me in my room in, like, 15
minutes. We’re just getting back.

432
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,242
Will do. See ya then.

433
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,995
Shit.

434
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:31,065
Goddamn it, Michelle. What
in the hell are you doing?

435
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:34,485
Trust me, it’s better. It used
to smell like 1969 in here.

436
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:37,238
Relax. Paul is gone for the weekend.

437
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:41,200
I know, but Albert is roaming the halls,
and he’s, like, tougher than a tiger.

438
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:45,538
A tiger. - Yes.
And speaking of tigers,

439
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:48,124
I have planned the ultimate
door party for this evening.

440
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,709
Well, what the hell does
that have to do with a tiger?

441
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:52,920
No idea.

442
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:55,423
So.

443
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,550
I have to pee.

444
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,802
Thank you. That’s very helpful.

445
00:36:01,387 --> 00:36:04,640
Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,435
She’s driving me up the wall.

447
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:10,646
I can tell.

448
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:15,401
So why are you doing this? Seriously?

449
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:18,696
You know why.

450
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,948
I wish you would have told
me about it this morning.

451
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:23,868
I didn’t know I was gonna do it.

452
00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:25,995
Can you just get a loan or something?

453
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:29,707
I tried that. I mean, I'm on
probation. I can’t get a loan.

454
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,961
You just, you gotta find something else.

455
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:40,217
Okay. I’ll try. I really will try.

456
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:44,680
All systems are go.
- My turn.

457
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,099
I feel left out of this.

458
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:51,020
We’re doing a cleanse. - My idea.
- Go figure.

459
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:56,192
So I was thinking. I don't
even know why I would help you,

460
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,445
but I do have my cousin Ralphie that

461
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:02,865
might be interested that
I could possibly call.

462
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,785
Oh, thanks, yeah.

463
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:09,079
He’s a little weird.
Really sweet, though.

464
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:12,541
He dropped out of BC three years
ago, after he inherited his trust

465
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:16,462
when he turned 21. And then he
won the lottery like a week later.

466
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:18,589
I would have dropped out too.

467
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:22,426
No, see, that’s the thing. He
didn’t win, like, the big lottery.

468
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,681
He just won, like, 20 scratch off
tickets that he cashed out for $7,000.

469
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:30,768
But he said it was a sign from God.

470
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:37,441
Anyways, now he’s just
a lonely Internet trader.

471
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:42,321
Like you'll be someday.
- Thanks, Pothead.

472
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,665
You should call
him, probably, maybe.

473
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:56,085
Don't tell Gracie about this, ‘kay?

474
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,921
Just, I kinda wanna keep her out of it.

475
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:04,301
Sure.
- Thank you.

476
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:09,348
Oh, please, no more.
You are such a cunt.

477
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,350
She’s not a cunt, she’s
the coolest girl I know.

478
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:13,686
Can I be a cunt when I grow up?

479
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:16,230
Only if you work really,
really hard at it.

480
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:18,274
Okay. Hey, don't forget.

481
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:21,777
Six o’clock, homeless kids,
Christmas trees, got it.

482
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:29,910
Get off my bed.
- Fuck you, bitch.

483
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,627
#RALPHIE#

484
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,129
Hey, hey how’s it goin’?
- Ralph?

485
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,298
Come on in, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

486
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,383
Hey, hey, you want a
beer or something, man?

487
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:30,763
I got Carl Strauss,
southern California’s finest.

488
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:34,183
You know what? I'm gonna
have one myself right here.

489
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:37,686
Hey, thanks, yeah.

490
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,815
Here you go.
- Thanks.

491
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:46,028
So word is you
got the E bombs, right?

492
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:51,826
The word? - Yeah. That's,
that’s what Michelle said.

493
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:53,911
Yeah, yeah, Michelle, okay.
- Yeah.

494
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:56,664
That’s different, yeah. - Yeah.
- Yeah. Here you go. I got ‘em.

495
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:59,917
Awesome, awesome. Yeah, yeah.

496
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,670
Let me get eight of ‘em.

497
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:07,633
Eight? - Yeah.
- All right. - Yeah.

498
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:12,054
Yeah. You know what?
I think I want 10.

499
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:14,223
All right. Ten’s even better.

500
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:19,395
Yeah, I think ten’ll be
good. Ten is perfect, yeah.

501
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:23,232
No, no. That’s crazy. Ten
is, 10 is absolutely crazy.

502
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:26,652
That... I'm sorry.
My bad, my bad. Eight.

503
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:29,405
Yeah, oh… - Eight. Ten is way
too much. Just lemme have eight.

504
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,033
You don't wanna kill yourself.
- No, exactly. Exact... gimme 10.

505
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:37,163
You sure?
- Gimme 10. Ten.

506
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:39,498
‘Kay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,085
That’s, that’s 200 bills, dude.

508
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:48,215
Dude, I just got off work,
man. God, what a friggin’ day.

509
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:52,511
You know, my laptop
completely just crashed. Done.

510
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:56,515
So I spent the whole day trading
at the copy center over on Waverly.

511
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:59,894
And lemme tell you something. Those
people over there, they got issues.

512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,897
Yeah?
- God, yeah, dude. Yeah.

513
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:08,027
Look, man. We’ll get to business
in a bit. Do you mind if I?

514
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,947
Oh, no, shit. No,
yeah, you can take one.

515
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:14,033
You sure?
- Yeah.

516
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:18,704
All right, awesome. I have been
waiting all day for this, man.

517
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:22,541
Oh, my God. Jesus, I'm
so glad you got here, man.

518
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,587
Oh, God.

519
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:37,640
Sit down, take it easy.

520
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:40,935
Go ahead. There ya go.

521
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:57,118
Before we go any further,
I gotta ask you a question.

522
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:00,704
Now this is totally, 100% serious.

523
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:03,749
Okay.

524
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,877
Are you into the Strokes?

525
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,297
I mean, I saw them down at CBGB’s
before they were anybody with my cousin.

526
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:15,052
They were awesome. - I'm not
talking about the fucking band.

527
00:42:18,222 --> 00:42:23,227
Dude, contrary to what
many people think, I am not gay.

528
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:25,646
Do I give off some kind
of gay vibe, or something?

529
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:30,776
Look, look. I am not talkin’ about
swabbin’ the poop deck either, man.

530
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:34,488
I’m talkin’ about Different Strokes.

531
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:41,620
Yeah, only the greatest
television show ever made? Yeah?

532
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:45,833
See, that’s the problem, man. People
- people don't even know about it anymore.

533
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:50,087
'Cause the networks, they don't
even put it on. And TV Land?

534
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:55,718
TV Land can go fuck themselves,
putting it on all late at night.

535
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:59,138
Not showin’ it the proper
respect that it deserves.

536
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,852
My dream is to buy the
rights of that show from NBC

537
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:08,981
and put it on in
rotation at a decent hour.

538
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,776
The show deserves no less, man.

539
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:16,071
I mean, that show was so ahead
of its time. I mean, come on.

540
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:21,410
Interracial families? That is some heavy
shit for network TV back in the day.

541
00:43:22,578 --> 00:43:26,665
Yeah, I remember, like,
what you talkin’ about, Willis?

542
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:32,088
You are so goddamn right, brother.

543
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,632
And it’s not just Willis.

544
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:38,677
It is what everyone was talkin’ ‘bout.

545
00:43:39,345 --> 00:43:44,266
Hey, let me ask you something. So
you're down with the show, right?

546
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,645
Well, uh, yeah…

547
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,439
Yes, man. I mean,
today is your lucky day.

548
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:55,820
Today is the luckiest day
that you have ever had.

549
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:13,754
You know?

550
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,051
I really like you. A lot.

551
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:25,474
Really?

552
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:30,062
Yeah. Really.

553
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:52,168
Oh, you dick tease.

554
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:55,463
Child molestation? I mean, come on, man.

555
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:58,591
No other show even touches on that shit.

556
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,846
Oh. I gotta go take care
of some business right here.

557
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:08,142
Hey, do you think you should be
doing business in your condition?

558
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:12,730
Yeah? Yeah.

559
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,065
I know it’s a fuckin’ big deal.

560
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:18,068
You want an answer? Huh?

561
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:21,614
You want an answer? I’ll
give you a fuckin’ answer.

562
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:27,244
Why don't you take those fuckin’
papers and shove them up your ass?

563
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:31,373
Yeah. Yeah, I know it’s a big deal.

564
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:37,004
Well, I’ll fuckin’ take
care of it tomorrow, okay?

565
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:40,716
Yeah. Yeah, I know it’s all
on the fuckin’ line right now.

566
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,513
Yeah. All right. All right! All right.

567
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:52,144
It’s my mom.

568
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:54,688
Aw, shit, man, shit, I gotta go.

569
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,774
Really?
- Yeah.

570
00:45:56,816 --> 00:46:01,946
Hey, listen. Just so you know, you could
stay here as long as you wanna, man.

571
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:04,782
It’s cool. Chill out,
and just so you know, man.

572
00:46:06,158 --> 00:46:08,828
All that stuff, that had
nothing to do with you, man. - No.

573
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:13,833
That was between me, her, and
some late fees on some videos, man.

574
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:16,043
It has nothing to do
with you, I promise.

575
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:18,629
Yeah, I know. I just I
have, you know, my business,

576
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:20,756
and I gotta take it when
I can get it, you know?

577
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,925
Hey, I understand, man. I'm with you.

578
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:25,970
Let me, let me give you
some scratch, buddy. ‘Kay?

579
00:46:26,011 --> 00:46:28,722
Thank you. - Yeah, dude.
- Thank you for this.

580
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:31,058
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

581
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,605
You take a check?

582
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:40,109
Yeah, uh, yeah.
- Is that cool, or what? Is that fine?

583
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:42,653
That’s cool. - It’s cool?
- That’s cool. Just…

584
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:44,697
All right.
- …make it out to Darren Giles.

585
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,783
All right. All right.
- Just, Giles, G,I…

586
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:51,162
Darren?
- Darren.

587
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:53,873
Giles.
Giles? G…

588
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:57,334
G, I… - I…
- L, E…

589
00:46:57,418 --> 00:47:01,839
E and S. Darren Giles. All
right, man. All right, buddy.

590
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,385
I got this. Here you go, man.
- Yeah.

591
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,765
That’s for you, man. - Thank you.
- Yeah. - Thank you very much. Thanks.

592
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:13,434
Hey, hey. Hey, what are you
guys doin’ this weekend, huh?

593
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,561
You know, we’re probably just
going to the dorm to have a party.

594
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:17,813
You know, Michelle. - Yeah, you guys
live close to each other, right?

595
00:47:17,855 --> 00:47:19,857
Like, two doors down.
- That’s cool.

596
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:21,984
All right, hey, man. Not
tryin’ to hold you back. - No.

597
00:47:22,026 --> 00:47:24,695
You do what you gotta do. Hey, the
elevator’s right over there. - Yup.

598
00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:27,239
Hey, it was great to meet you, man.
- Yes.

599
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:29,909
This was so awesome.

600
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:33,120
God. That kid’s great.

601
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:38,375
Smart, like that. Went to
college. Hmm, yeah, yeah.

602
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:41,754
Education. That’s good,
good stuff. It shows.

603
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:44,048
Kid’s got a brain on him. Yup.

604
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:51,180
I'm gonna see that kid
again. Our paths will cross.

605
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:13,327
That’s good, yeah.

606
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:43,190
What you talkin’ about, Darren?
- Shut up.

607
00:48:43,232 --> 00:48:45,818
Why?
- Because. Bitch.

608
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,362
Did you just call her a bitch?

609
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:52,950
No. Uh, where are you guys going?

610
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,035
To get some pizza. Do you wanna come?

611
00:48:55,077 --> 00:48:57,621
I have to do my paper.

612
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:59,874
Please?

613
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:05,254
Okay. I can’t say no
to that. Don't do that.

614
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:16,056
Are you sure there
isn't any meat on this?

615
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:19,977
That’s the whole point of
ordering a vegetarian slice.

616
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:22,313
Do you think they use meat
when they make their sauce?

617
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:24,982
Michelle, it’s vegetarian.

618
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,194
To use meat would defeat the
whole purpose of using that word.

619
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:32,740
You know, I heard that if you don't eat
meat, it, like, intensifies your high.

620
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:34,825
Bullshit.

621
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:37,077
No, it’s, like, scientifically
proven and stuff.

622
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,291
Scientifically? - Do you have any
documentation on that one?

623
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,503
No, but I bet I could
find some, smart guy.

624
00:49:45,836 --> 00:49:50,341
Well, see, the Deadheads
discovered it back in the sixties,

625
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:55,554
and then they passed it on to the,
the fish people after Jerry died.

626
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:57,890
And that’s why they're all vegans.

627
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,893
That is the most asinine thing
I've ever heard in my life.

628
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:04,396
I don't have time for this. I
have to go meet the tree guy.

629
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:07,316
Yeah, I have to, uh, do my paper anyway.

630
00:50:08,526 --> 00:50:12,154
Okay, well. But I will see you at 6:00?

631
00:50:12,196 --> 00:50:14,907
Oh yeah. I’ll see you then.

632
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:20,871
Well, I have to go do something too.

633
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:26,419
And in conclusion, I believe Dante
was right when he said life is hell.

634
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,046
You start at the bottom, you
work your way up to the top,

635
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:32,925
and when you finally get there,
you realize it’s still hell.

636
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:37,388
And then you die. And done.

637
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:39,849
Done!

638
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:44,770
Hello?
- Hey, Darren, it’s Scott.

639
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:47,606
Hey, Scott, what’s up?
- Nothin’ much, man.

640
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:50,401
Nanny was wondering if you were
comin’ to Long Island this weekend.

641
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:53,612
Oh, man, I would love
to, but I can’t…

642
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:55,823
…I might come on Tuesday,
right before I leave.

643
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,451
Cool, cool.
- Dude, no offense, but I gotta run.

644
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,787
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Listen, real quick. One thing quickly…

645
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:03,998
…I promise.
- What’s up? Is everything all right?

646
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:06,625
No, nothing like that.
Yeah, everything’s fine.

647
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:09,086
I was just wondering one quick thing.

648
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,007
You remember that stuff you bought out
a couple of weeks ago from your roommate?

649
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:16,927
The, the ecstasy?
- I do.

650
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:19,221
Do you know where I
can get any more of it?

651
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:21,932
I have, like, a bunch of
friends that want some, too.

652
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:24,101
Do you know anybody
that can help us out?

653
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:26,520
Yeah, I’ll be there in an hour.
- Great, great.

654
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,190
Thank you. I’ll pay for
your ticket, too, no problem.

655
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:31,484
Awesome. See you soon.

656
00:51:35,488 --> 00:51:37,490
Party services.

657
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:40,159
Dear God, Honey, he’s selling
his body to the queers.

658
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:42,286
Honey? It’s okay.

659
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:45,122
You don't have to do this to
get revenge on us. We understand.

660
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:47,666
Please tell me you're using condoms.

661
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,504
I am not gay!
- Well, we’ll see about that.

662
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:55,007
Look, I love you, but I have to go,
okay? I don't have time for this.

663
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,051
I have to go to Long
Island to see Scott.

664
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:59,345
Now, is Scott a friend, or
is he more than a friend?

665
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:02,056
Scott, my cousin, your nephew. Scott.
- Oh, okay.

666
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:04,975
Look, I'm gonna miss my train
if I don't go right now, okay?

667
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:07,812
I’ll call you on the weekend, bye.
- Bye.

668
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:13,400
Sounds like our son is in denial.
- Yes indeedy.

669
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:17,363
Yes indeedy. Sounds like he’s
a chip off the old Uncle Greg.

670
00:52:20,658 --> 00:52:22,660
We’re going to take
number one again this year.

671
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,954
You comin’? - No.

672
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:37,466
Hey, Scott. You'd better
make that two hours.

673
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:48,811
#PETUNIA... AGAIN#

674
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:54,817
Yes, sir. Me and my friends are
going to this party later on,

675
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:58,404
and I promised them that I
could get enough for all of us.

676
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:02,158
That sounds just peachy.

677
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:05,035
Peddling your dirty drugs in school.

678
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,163
How dare you, young lady.

679
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:10,791
This fine institution will
not tolerate such behavior.

680
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:14,044
You must be severely punished.

681
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:18,883
I understand, sir.
Here’s your money, mister.

682
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,677
Thank you.

683
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:24,847
Get over here right now, young lady.

684
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:27,349
Yes, Principal Myers.

685
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:29,852
I’ll see you, uh, later.

686
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:35,858
Who’s your principal?
- You are, sir.

687
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,944
Who’s your principal?
- You are, sir.

688
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:41,989
You are, sir.
You are, sir.

689
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:45,326
You are, sir.
Oh, God, I’ll never play again.

690
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:43,259
#COUSIN SCOTT#

691
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:49,098
Thanks for comin’ out
here all of a sudden.

692
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:51,976
I wouldn’t have called, but
things have just gotten crazy.

693
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:54,478
How’s that?
- There’s only one guy

694
00:54:54,478 --> 00:54:56,647
in the whole school
who can hook up some X,

695
00:54:56,772 --> 00:55:00,985
and he knows it, too. So he
upped his price to $35 a pill.

696
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:03,487
That’s ridiculous.
- Yeah.

697
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:07,575
Does, 20 sound better to you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:11,078
All right. How about a, um, bag of 10?

699
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:15,207
Thank you so much. Ah.

700
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,547
I'm sorry I can’t, like,
stay any longer. I kinda gotta go.

701
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,341
Aw, it’s cool. It’s...
I’ll see you at Christmas.

702
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,761
All right, that’s okay.
Yeah.

703
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:29,180
All right, thanks, Scott.
- Thank you, dude. See ya.

704
00:55:44,695 --> 00:55:46,906
Got your eyes on him?
- Yeah.

705
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:49,450
I think this is the new kid on the block
everyone was talkin’ about today.

706
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,994
Think he’s a threat to The Seoul?
- Yeah, I think he’s a fuckin’ threat.

707
00:55:52,036 --> 00:55:54,080
You fuckin’ with me, bitch?
- Hey, look,

708
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:56,332
I'm not tryin’ to step on
anybody’s toes here, okay?

709
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,584
But this must be one huge
ass operation if he’s covering

710
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,961
Manhattan and Strong Island in one day.

711
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:03,506
Aight, bitch. I’ll
take care of this shit.

712
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,510
Yeah, looks like his train’s
heading back to the city right now.

713
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:11,740
What the hell is this?

714
00:57:11,907 --> 00:57:15,327
You think you can fuck with
the man and get away with it.

715
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:17,830
You think that Seoul Man
doesn’t hear about everything

716
00:57:17,913 --> 00:57:20,124
that goes down in this
motherfuckin’ city.

717
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,460
What? Where the hell am I, man?

718
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:27,173
'Cause he does. And he knows that
you’ve been with his business today.

719
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:31,969
And he don't like that at all little man.
'Cause Seoul may not be the biggest,

720
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:35,890
but he’d fuck you up with a
one inch punch, just like Bruce.

721
00:57:37,308 --> 00:57:40,102
Shit, you're The Seoul Man?

722
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:43,814
I thought you were Black.
- What?

723
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:46,400
#THE SEOUL MAN#

724
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:49,195
It’s Seoul, with an E?
Like the capital of Korea?

725
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:52,364
You dumb cracker. You know what
we do with crackers around here?

726
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:57,203
Dude, I just needed the money
for one day. One day only, man.

727
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:03,125
My roommate gave me the pills just so
that I could get a bill paid for tomorrow.

728
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:05,711
Just let me go for this one day.

729
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:08,798
I promise you'll never hear
from me again. I promise.

730
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,176
Kinda bitch ass Nancy
boy you think I am?

731
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:14,720
Seoul Man don't play that way. No.

732
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:17,556
He’s up at Scores,
sipping cognac with Howard.

733
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:20,851
Chillin’ Atlantic City,
keepin’ that Jersey titty.

734
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:24,939
I ain’t no bitch, and I definitely
don't let no bitch talk to me that way.

735
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:28,859
Ever. I put bitches and
bitches like you in their place.

736
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:30,945
Dude, I would never- I
would- I wouldn’t even -

737
00:58:30,986 --> 00:58:33,364
I would never, man, shut the fuck up.

738
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:35,866
Had enough of this shit.

739
00:58:35,866 --> 00:58:39,870
You pasty ass, inbred
motherfucka. Cut this fool.

740
00:58:42,915 --> 00:58:46,752
Shut the fuck up, Seoul Man.
- Hold it.

741
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:51,340
What the fuck you say to Seoul?

742
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:54,844
It’s the future of modern torture.

743
00:58:55,177 --> 00:59:00,307
I know who puts who
in whose place. Bitch.

744
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:08,149
Shit.

745
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:19,660
Damn. Let’s roll.

746
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:27,418
Wait. You guys aren’t gonna
fuckin’ untie me, are ya?

747
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:31,380
I don't even know where I am.

748
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:29,039
Well, I'm here to give my cousin
some soup, you know what I mean?

749
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:34,086
She’s sick. She’s in need of my
medical attention, is what it is. Okay?

750
01:01:34,378 --> 01:01:37,548
Somebody has to sign ya in
if you wanna go upstairs.

751
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,509
Really? - Yeah. - Did you not hear me?
Are you stupid or somethin’?

752
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:43,262
I said look, man, this is
soup, okay? This is super soup.

753
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:46,182
She needs super soup to get
better. I told you, she’s sick.

754
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:50,728
I don't care if she has malaria. No one
gets upstairs unless they're signed in.

755
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:53,189
Don't be coppin’ no
attitude with me, all right?

756
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:56,275
Hey, what kind of higher
education is this, huh?

757
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:00,446
Maybe I should tell the
administration about this shit.

758
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:03,449
I'm sure they would love if
you took their shit up to them.

759
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:07,203
Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, I got somethin’
for ya. It’s a big fat bowl of dicks.

760
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:09,246
You wanna eat it, motherfucker?
- Okay.

761
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:12,083
Any time. Right now. Me and you.
You take off that gun, I'm right here.

762
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:14,668
Oh, any time, sonny boy. - I’m right
here. You think I'm scared of you, bro?

763
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:17,254
Junior… - Look, I'm almost laughing
to you right now. You know what?

764
01:02:17,296 --> 01:02:20,800
You're so beautiful, I think you'd like
my new dance. You like my new dance?

765
01:02:22,134 --> 01:02:24,678
How you like? That’s
what I'm talkin’ about.

766
01:02:24,762 --> 01:02:27,098
You're a rent-a-cop. You
ain’t shit, motherfucker.

767
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:29,475
That’s why you're mad. I’ll

768
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:34,355
Look. Let me in the motherfuckin’ elevator.
Right now. right now. I’ll kill you.

769
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:36,440
Chill out, chill out, chill
out. Chill, chill, chill, chill.

770
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:38,567
Jayne here is gonna
sign us in. roommate.

771
01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:40,694
Oh yeah, she is?
- Okay, good. Okay, good.

772
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:42,780
Your cousin. She’s gonna sign in.
- Right, right, right, right.

773
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,907
Your cousin. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, your cousin.

774
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:47,034
Yeah, beautiful. - Come on.
- How you like them apples?

775
01:02:48,577 --> 01:02:51,163
Come on.
- Hey, keep the soup.

776
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:01,549
Hey, when I find him? I'm
gonna rip him a new asshole.

777
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,260
What do you think about that, huh?

778
01:03:05,803 --> 01:03:08,764
She don't care, Ed.
- It’s true.

779
01:03:08,848 --> 01:03:11,225
Yeah, yeah? Well, fuck
you then, all right?

780
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:15,604
Chill out, Ed. Listen,

781
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:19,775
I think me and Jayne are gonna head
up to her room for a little bit.

782
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:23,279
What? Little Steve, how about you, man?

783
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:25,906
Hey. Got a roommate, right?

784
01:03:26,031 --> 01:03:28,033
That’s fuckin’ great. Ooh, that’s great.

785
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:30,077
That’s great. Bros
before hos, remember that?

786
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:33,038
Bros before hos? It
even rhymes. Fuckers.

787
01:03:35,332 --> 01:03:37,460
‘Scuse me.

788
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,134
It’s your world, right?
I just live in it?

789
01:03:49,013 --> 01:03:51,891
I must pee, and then I’ll be okay.

790
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:08,824
Hello? Hey, man, I gotta piss.

791
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:13,412
You here, man?

792
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,001
Come on, man.

793
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:23,214
Little Steve, I told you,
I bruise like a peach.

794
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:28,052
You, you, you. You, you. You
know Coleman like the cooler?

795
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:31,806
What? - Coleman, like the cooler.
Coleman like the cooler!

796
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:36,560
Coleman. Yeah, he’s a royal dick.
He lives on the third floor, room 315.

797
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:39,772
Three one five.
- The guy is crazy.

798
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:44,485
Eduardo, the third floor is
downstairs. Come on, we better go.

799
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:53,160
Hey, Chuck.

800
01:05:36,954 --> 01:05:39,123
Sorry.

801
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:45,880
Thanks,

802
01:05:51,886 --> 01:05:54,430
what’s, what was your name again?

803
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:57,475
Marla.
- Marla?

804
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:06,150
Why don't you stop by my room later?

805
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,569
Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

806
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:20,831
Fuck!

807
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:25,503
That’s not the guy.
- What’d you say?

808
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:29,048
You shot me! - I said that’s
not him. - He shot me, man.

809
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,509
Should I shoot him again, just
so he won’t tell anybody? What?

810
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:35,012
Fuck no, man!
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

811
01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:37,515
Fuck. Fuck.

812
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:52,196
Hey. What the fuck are
you guys doing to my door?

813
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,699
Oh, shit.

814
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,509
Hey, man.

815
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:17,012
Yo, what the fuck happened
to you, dude?

816
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,724
How you doin’? What you
need, you need smoke? - No.

817
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:25,563
What you need, drugs?
- I did the drugs.

818
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:29,024
You look like you did the
drugs. You need bitches?

819
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:31,861
And I got bitches. C Low got flavors.

820
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:34,572
I got blondes with black hair,
I got black haired blondes,

821
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:37,366
I got blondes with blue eyes,
I got blondes black eyes,

822
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:40,453
pistachi hos, strawberry
dickery, butterican pinky

823
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:42,538
I'm the only motherfucker with hos.

824
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,207
Mocha, don't touch me, I will
smack the shit out you, White boy.

825
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:48,252
Right. - Put your hands to yourself.
So what can I help you with?

826
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:52,673
I need your coat.

827
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:56,010
This is the fur of the century,

828
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:59,597
with more sexual experiences
than Wilt Chamberlain.

829
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,807
This fur means more to me
than most of my bitches.

830
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,685
I’ll give you $300.

831
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:09,648
And my bitches don't mean too much to me.
Money talks, bitch. All right. Put it on.

832
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,984
Yeah, I gotta check it out.

833
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:14,195
Fix your pants, White
boy. Fuck happened to you?

834
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:16,781
Oh, I'm good.
Yeah!

835
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,784
Get the fuck outta here.
Walk like a pimp, bitch.

836
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:23,996
Walk like a pimp, bitch.

837
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:41,263
Hey. Let me get this for you.
- I got it.

838
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:44,391
I'm so sorry.
- It’s fine.

839
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:46,519
It’s not fine. I know how
much that meant to you,

840
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:49,480
and I wanted to be
there. I was on my way.

841
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:52,900
I know what you were doing.
That doesn’t make it any better.

842
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:57,530
Gracie, Gracie, wait. Please.
- Why?

843
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:01,325
Look, I can’t imagine how
let down you feel right now.

844
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,577
All I wanted to do was be there.

845
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:08,749
But you weren’t. Sometimes, it takes
more than just wanting something. Darren.

846
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:15,673
You're just not who I thought you were.

847
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:18,300
Gracie, that’s not who I...

848
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,513
it was just one day
that I did this, okay?

849
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:25,349
And you have to understand that.

850
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:27,977
I don't have to understand it.

851
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,482
Maybe you should get that.

852
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,152
Are you mad at me?

853
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:40,906
No. Just disappointed. Okay?

854
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,674
I'm sure he’ll be right here.

855
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,181
Do you think we can put
the hardware down now?

856
01:10:05,931 --> 01:10:08,058
Yeah, we can do that.

857
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:12,688
Bang!

858
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:21,822
So, I’ll give you whatever
ecstasy he has left.

859
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:24,909
I’ll give you my watch, it’s a Tag.

860
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:29,747
It’s a real one.
And we’ll call it even.

861
01:10:29,747 --> 01:10:33,375
All right. I think that’s equally
beneficial to both parties.

862
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:37,838
What? Okay, if that’s the
way it’s gotta be, man.

863
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:41,258
No, I'm gonna shoot him. Like,
just in the foot, or something.

864
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:43,385
No, gimme, gimme the gun.

865
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:45,888
Fuck.

866
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,933
Hey, sorry about
the blood and stuff, Coleman.

867
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:53,604
It’s not mine. No harm, no foul, right?

868
01:10:53,646 --> 01:10:55,689
Right.

869
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:58,901
Hey, just one more thing, okay?

870
01:10:58,943 --> 01:11:04,156
You gotta blow me.
- What?

871
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:10,287
You see? He was thinking about
it. Such a fag. Such a fuckin’ fag.

872
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,456
Yeah.

873
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,169
Hey so with that E, can
I get some glow sticks?

874
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,588
You know what I mean, so I could dance?

875
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:22,133
I heard you shit yourself the
last time you went dancing.

876
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:24,802
Ha, ha, ha, motherfucker, that’s funny,
I’ll kill you. Gimme that fuckin’…

877
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:27,972
Dude, come on, seriously.
Easy, we’re past that now.

878
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:32,101
Holy shit.

879
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:36,397
Hey, buddy. Did ya have a good day?

880
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,816
What the hell is this?

881
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:44,780
Look, Darren, I'm
gonna need that E back.

882
01:11:47,616 --> 01:11:51,036
I need it. - Darren, I think it would
be a good idea to give the drugs

883
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:55,082
to the man who has a gun pointed
at your fucking head. Don't you?

884
01:12:03,549 --> 01:12:05,634
That’s right.

885
01:12:09,346 --> 01:12:11,307
Fucker.

886
01:12:12,558 --> 01:12:14,685
Pleasure doin’ business with you.

887
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:19,899
Oh, and one more thing? All right,
now, you gotta blow Little Steve.

888
01:12:23,402 --> 01:12:27,323
You blow Little Steve.
Get the fuck outta my room.

889
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:58,354
What the hell are you doing?

890
01:12:58,395 --> 01:13:01,899
Packing. Considering I'm not
gonna be here much longer,

891
01:13:01,982 --> 01:13:06,695
I felt I might as well get a head start,
since I can go to the party tonight.

892
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:11,367
There’s a party? Where?
- Don't you ever stop, man?

893
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,994
Please. Stop whining, okay?

894
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:17,790
Look, you just had a gun
pointed at your face, all right?

895
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:20,793
And I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

896
01:13:20,876 --> 01:13:26,048
Look, I hope you take offense to this.
Go fuck yourself. What do I have left?

897
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:29,718
I gave up everything today. I coulda
got arrested, I coulda got shot,

898
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:33,889
I coulda got killed. I coulda been
gangraped by a large group of Asian men.

899
01:13:33,973 --> 01:13:37,476
Yeah. It’s drug dealing.
There are consequences.

900
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:40,604
I shoulda just got a job. I shoulda
just got a job, or something.

901
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,107
I coulda figured something
out, but no, I let

902
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:47,027
you bring me into this
world of shit today.

903
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:50,990
Here I am, still leaving school.
- Well, I am sorry for that.

904
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:54,201
That’s not good enough.
You and your money

905
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:56,871
and your bullshit. I'm done with it.

906
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:59,665
All right. All right. Stop. Stop!

907
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,669
Don't put your hand around my neck.
- Then back off. Back off.

908
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:11,469
You're an asshole. You know that, right?

909
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:19,977
Yeah. I'm an asshole.

910
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:23,814
And you're the nice guy
that usually gets shit on.

911
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,276
That happens to be the
basis of our friendship.

912
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:38,788
But let me ask you something, man.

913
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:43,709
I mean, why do you really
wanna stay in school?

914
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:49,298
'Cause. 'Cause I don't
wanna be a fuck up anymore.

915
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:54,553
I refuse to let other
people control my life.

916
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:58,557
I can’t. Not anymore.

917
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:05,940
Well, I'm sure there’s at
least one girl down the hall

918
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:08,109
who would really like
to hear you say that.

919
01:15:08,192 --> 01:15:11,487
No, I'm pretty sure there’s not.

920
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:14,031
You'd be surprised, man.

921
01:15:14,365 --> 01:15:16,450
You know, sometimes people
just need a little shock

922
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:21,163
to the system to get them to
see what’s important, right?

923
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:25,251
You needed an electric chair.

924
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:30,464
Personally, I'm amazed at what
one day can do to somebody.

925
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:37,596
Wait. Are you trying to tell me
you did it all for that?

926
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:44,687
That you cared about somebody else?

927
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:48,023
Everything is about you.

928
01:15:48,107 --> 01:15:52,570
Everything is always about you,
Coleman. You did not do this for me.

929
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:58,367
How would I know, man? I’m
just an asshole, remember?

930
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,246
Yes, you are an asshole.

931
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:11,756
After hours answering service.

932
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:15,760
I’d like to schedule an appointment
to make a tuition payment tomorrow.

933
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:19,680
No, not for me.

934
01:16:23,642 --> 01:16:28,689
Okay. Thank you very much.

935
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:59,405
I know that you don't even
wanna look at me right now,

936
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:03,075
but just let me say this.

937
01:18:04,452 --> 01:18:08,205
I just screwed everything up.

938
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:11,709
I don't know if I just
couldn’t see it altogether,

939
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:15,463
all the times I coulda said something.

940
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:20,718
Doesn’t matter, I'm not talking
my way around it anymore.

941
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:23,721
I don't know what I'm
gonna do next semester.

942
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:27,516
I don't even know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow.

943
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,813
I just know that I made a mistake,
and that you're hurt because of it.

944
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:37,193
And I am so sorry for that.

945
01:18:44,742 --> 01:18:48,704
Well, what are you gonna
do to make it up to me?

946
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:07,598
So.

947
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:29,328
Here you go. Good?
Excellent.

948
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:32,415
Okay. Wait. Okay.

949
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:35,209
What is this for again?

950
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:40,965
Let’s just say it’ll make
my parents really proud.

951
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:46,387
Smile.
- Thanks.
