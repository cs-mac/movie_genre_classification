00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:20,072
Tomorow, you take the subway, sweetheart!

158
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,075
No way!

159
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:23,849
Every day it's the same thing!
The same comedy!

160
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:28,658
It's cool, you see, I figure
I give her a ride at least we'll

161
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,524
tell each other our life,
the things of the world, of the life,..

162
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,524
..philosphy or...

163
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,087
the beauty of nature...

164
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,771
And in fact not at all...

165
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,832
hello? Earth is calling.
You hear me ?

166
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,431
Peekaboo!

167
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:00,393
There you go.

168
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,303
I figure you have a good reason to be late ?

169
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,696
Well in fact 'mam you're gonna laugh 'cause...

170
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,233
As you see me there, I'm at my best

171
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,241
Well, you see this morning I had a breakfast accident.
I got a Choco Pops

172
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,804
..stuck in the nose.

173
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:59,015
My mother had to take me to the emergency to...

174
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:02,606
-And you, I figure it was a Frosties or something ?

175
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:09,654
-What a face she had!
-Unbeleivable

176
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,956
Well, ciao!

177
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,000
bye

178
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,512
By the way with Arthur did it get better?

179
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:18,594
So-so

180
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:22,451
I just wanna tell you that if I was him,
I would never have left you.

181
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,014
Yeah, but you're not him

182
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,535
Yeah, I know...

183
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,751
You know, it's not because
he's my best friend that
I agree on everything he does.

184
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,264
I know...

185
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,739
And...

186
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,084
You, I adore you. Really.
I don't want this to destroy our friendship, Lola.

187
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,601
I adore you too, Maël.
Really.

188
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:40,724
All right then.

189
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,066
We will go on with some factorization

190
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,324
..by resolving the following equation :..

191
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,797
..(x   1)   (x   3) = 0.

192
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:53,049
There you go.
You want me to help you to finish it, Charlotte ?

193
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,142
Yes

194
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,826
It' not very complicated, you'll see.

195
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,085
<i>Make love to me, like we do at 16

196
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,290
<i>Make love to me...

197
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:06,203

199
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:15,877

00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,231

201
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:18,184
Voilà!

202
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:19,917
Does everybody understand?

203
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:24,864
<i>Make love to me, like we do at 16

204

May I ?

205
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:32,072
Huh? yeah, sure. Come on in, it's all right.

206
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,931
We continue with another exercise...

207
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,416
What's wrong with the girl, they're turned on or something ?

208
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,144
It's good for you, no ?

209
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:41,745
-I'm sorry ?
-It's good for you, no ?

210
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:44,830
...(x-2)   (x  3)...

211
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,422
"Absolutely fabulous!"

212
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:56,114
Nespresso

213
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,320
Silence, be quiet!

214
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,761
Please!

215
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,700
I wanna be able to ear a fly...

216
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,860
Well.

217
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,514
The first one who opens his mouth...

218
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,593
I send him straight "directly" to the principal.

219
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,076
I've seen Maël.

220
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:19,327
Oh yeah ?

221
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,934
I'm warning you

222
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,934
this year...

223
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:28,273
..I refuse to be the victim of one of your childish jokes.

224
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:29,830
What's happening ?

225
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,087
You hear me ?

226
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,001
bye

227
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,423
Bye

228

hu, sir...

229
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,897
-Yes Charlotte?
-My mother is wondering if you give

230
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,412
..private lessons at home?

231
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:44,723
Lessons of?

232
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,714
Of mathematics, sir.

233
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,229
For your mother?

234
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:49,487
Well no, for me.

235
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,221
Oh Yes! Oh NO...

236
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,966

..this kinda things.

238
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:59,562
-oh... No big deal.
It's unfortunate. Bye sir.

239
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,298
bye.

240
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,022

He was so ambarassed, poor guy!

No doubt about it.

and you Lola
what do you thing about it ? LOLA!

246
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,044
Does the math teach likes her?

247
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,560
Don't know

248
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:22,992
Damn it, Arthur's there!

249
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,751
-I don't give a shit about it!
-Really ?

Yeah, totally

-She's a real sticky note this one.

252
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:30,699
Damn you're right!

253

I love your t-shirt, where d'you get it?

254
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,883
And where d'ya get what you got under that shirt of yours ?

255
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,499
What a sense of humor. You went shopping.

256
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,552
Well I gotta say you needed it...
-She's funny this one, huh ?

257
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:41,199
It's rare to find a girl with so much spirit.

258
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:43,866
-That's right
-I look up to you

259
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:45,652
Can I talk to you for a sec ?

260

I want you to tell me

To tell you what ?

266
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,099
Well your sexual miracles,
your stories...

267
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,622
Leave me alone...

268

Medhi, you got a light?
Why? The one you got on your ass isn't enough ?

I hope you came at least, 'cause it'd be stupid otherwise.

273
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,999
You're disgusting, go fuck yourself!

274
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,327
The specialist is talking now, that's great
You know what you're talking about, huh ?

275
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,320
-What's your problem ?
-classy!

Well no, not yet

Why is that?

284
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,430
Well not every night. Otherwise I don't see the point

00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:47,198
Check this out Stéphane, hey Charlotte
is it "Petit Bateau"..

318
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,617
..or "Titanic", your underwear?

319
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,484
Stop it, it's my mother! She only buys that.

320
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:52,999
-Right!
-Right!

321
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:53,908
Stop it

322
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm thinking my mother she robbed the whole H&M store,
many thongs don't fit her

323
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,334
I can give you some if you want

324
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,943
Yeah, that'd be cool

325
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,468
And you Provence, you're instrested?

326
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,590
Na I don't like thongs, honestly I think it's vulgar.

327
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,884
Got it!

328
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,187
Got it!

329
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,617
Damn it, chief...

330
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:14,702
Move your ass, Goddamn it!
Normaly you know all about it...

331
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,215
There, you see it that one ?

332
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:17,669
Clavel, you need help ?

333
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,425
Paul-Henri, don't fall in love with the ball

334
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,376
Watch it, Arthur!

335
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,894
What's wrong with you ?

336
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,375
He's crazy this guy!

337
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,889
-It's Lola, man, she's a girl!
-she's "a" girl or "your" girl ?

338
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,968
It ain't a box ring here, all right!

339
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,790
It ain't "your" problem anymore!

340
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,167
Yeah, Maël the BIG justice lover!

341
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,358
He's insane!

342
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,574
So pathetic!

343
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:40,787
YOU are pathetic

344
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,080
Shut up you!

345
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,904
<i>I love him, I love him...

346
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,413
<i>I love him...

347
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,802
<i>I love him, I love him, I love him...

348
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,322
"Think about you"
"THINK ABOUT YOU TOO"
"If Arthur wasn't my friend..."
Yeah ????
LOL :) Good night.
Good night.

349
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,734
"Thinking about you"

350
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:17,832
"I'm thinking about you too"

351
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:23,432
"If Arthur wasn't my friend..."

352
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:25,433
"Yes ????"

353
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,232
"lol. Good night"

354
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,431
"Good night too"

355
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,904
Listen Lola, I'm at the police headquaters
they just confiscated my car registration document, so please..

356
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:49,932
..Because it's like that
I'm not Dolto, I don't have to justify
everything to everyone all the time.
Now that's enough!

357
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,363
Oh shit! Come on now...

358
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,625
Shit! Shit!

359
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,750
Fuckin'...

360
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,217
May I help you?

361
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,915
-Are you a cobbler?
-Nop.

362
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,050
That's too bad.

363
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,542
Yep' that's too bad.

364
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,581
Where you going like this ?

365
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,369
Well I don't know I'm gonna take a cab.

366
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,813
'cause the fucking cops impounded my car!

367
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:14,053
The station, it's.. it's quite far,
you're not gonna cross it like that...

368
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,324
Yeah you're right but...

369
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,496
I'll give you a ride.

370
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,532
That would be great, It's nice of you

371
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,050
Take this.

372
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,661
And you ?

373
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:26,083
I don't need it.

374
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,693
Be carefull, 'cause they're real..

375
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,429
..real assholes!

376
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,253
Yeah, I know, I know.

377
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:44,138
See you later.

378
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:53,424
Oups!
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,387
Voilà

380
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,430
Thanks a lot

381
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:59,333
You're welcome. Wait a sec... it often gets stuck

382
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,153
There you go, carefull

383
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,584
And I'm sorry I insulted your collegues.

384
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:08,103
Oh you know I'm used to it.

385
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,475
Was he goodlooking ?

386
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,194
Yeah, but whatever, I'm not gonna screw a cop
that'd be all I need.

387
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,560
For one night!
Short and sweet...

388
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,295
Na, not my type...

389
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,729
Who, the guy ?

390
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,985
No, the one night stand...

391
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,801
Well, I'm telling you...

392
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:29,405
If I was divorced,
I'd screw everything that moves...

393
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,700
What'd you do if you were divorced?

394
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,222
Nothing, nothing..

395
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,830
Yes, yes, yes!

396
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,911
I'd get laid by one guy,
every night just like "you" do!

397
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,086
-Who's that, "you"?
-"you"..

398
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:42,686
-..men.
-Oh us!

399
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,031
The big assholes congregation!

400
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,600
But you can't do what we do, sweetheart!

401
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,152
And why is that ?

402
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:51,190
-Everything's fine kiddos ?
-It's all right.

403
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,110
By the way ma, I don't know if you knew, but

404
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:54,668
Julien has a moto.

405
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,704
-So ?
-So I was thinking it could

406
00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:00,304
..help me not being late
-No, no, never!

407
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:04,210
-Seriously, you got a moto ?
-Dad says it's not dangerous.

408
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:07,124
I'll take you to Garches Hospital to show you people
in their wheelchair.

409
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:10,029
Lola, if I ever see you on a moto...

410
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:11,637
And what are you doing exactly ?

411
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,429
I'm getting some food up in the room

412
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,092
'cause I'm gonna show Julien
some things on the computer.

413
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:16,343
That's not cool
I laid the table

414
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,737
-OK!
-We'll get down for the desert.

415
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:21,313
You too should go to Garshes Hospital, she's right you know

416
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,043
Oh! Come on that's not cool...

417
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:27,298
We just go upstair to watch some stuff
Dad we can, right ?

418
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:28,521
Yeah

419
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:31,588
-It's okay, we'll be in peace
-Plus, old people's conversations... you get it

420
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,282
-Well educated, my daughter!
-Well.

421
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,327
-She's very nice, it's the kinda things I appreciate
-It's lovely

422
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,228
-This tall kid huging you...
-The tall kid has ears you know?

423
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:45,482
-Dady he can't resist
-Mummy, come on, it's all right

424
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,919
You're tiresome
You say yes to everything!

425
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:49,093
The moto?

426
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:53,430
-Yes, for the moto, for going upstairs
-All right, let's eat, dinner's ready!

427
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,069
So what do you think ?

428
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,243
Not bat, what is it?

429
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,717
-It's a friend.
-Do you mind if I roll a joint ?

430
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:08,440
Sure! But I'm gonna close the door...

431
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:18,079
She smokes Lola ?

432
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:19,552
Are you nuts ?

433
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:22,197
Wait... No I don't want it...
That's what you think!

434
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,937
Did she ever see you smoking ?

435
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,672
I try to avoid it...

436
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:28,717
Julien,..

437
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:31,721
..he's at war, he hates drugs.
I don't worry about it.

438
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,221
I'm gonna do my surfing training course with the UCPA.

439
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:39,566
That's nice.

440
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:40,987
And you, what do plan on doing?

441
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:42,466
I don't know 'cause dad is screwing mum again.

442
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,600
No!

443
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,637
Yep! Maybe it'll change everything.

444
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,500
And you're happy about it ?

445
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,843
I don't believe in their story anymore.

446
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,886
Not very optimistic!

447
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,611
Tell me sth, Julien...

448
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,303
I wanted to ask you a favor...

449
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:00,824
hmm ?

450
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,984
Can we have sex ?

451
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,025
No, no

452
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,276
You women, you don't get laid
just like that

453
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:18,538
You need feelings...
-fee.. what ?

454
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:20,176
You don't go to prostitutes

455
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:21,999
Why, do you ?

456
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:24,958
No but in general, you can't say that

457
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:27,823
..sexuality is the same for men and women

458
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:31,119
And what's so different ?

459
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:33,804
I mean, explain it to me!
I'm guessing I'll be interested

460
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:37,974
-Yeah me too
-You, I don't talk to you anymore anyway.

461
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:41,079
Ah come on it's not like I asked you euthanasia

462
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,094
Even if I wanted to, and that's not the case, I couldn't do it

463
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,356
Why ?

464
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,956
I have too much respect for you

465
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:50,603
Fuck you guys with your respect

466
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,998
Girls!

467
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,558
When we don't respect you, we're assholes
and when we do,

468
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,818
..it fuckin bothers you!

469
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:59,243
-We've known each other for 8 years
-That's the point Lola

470
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:03,671
Do I walk around and ask
"hey do you wanna have sex with me" ?

471
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,450
What would you say ?

472
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:06,919
I'd say 'yes'

473
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,869
-Well I    say   no
-Gotcha

474
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:11,691
Do it with your boyfriend

475
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,775
-With my boyfriend ?
-It seems more logic!

476
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,502
No I told him I already did it.
He can't know that I lied.

477
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,023
Man! Women really are insane!

478
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:26,574
Na, we ain't insane!
Look at Lucie, she's living the life

479
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,573
-Damn right she does!
-Yeah!

480
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,352
Since she got seperated,
she met tons of men.

481
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,671
and not even on Meetic.

482
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:35,136
She fucks whoever she wants

483
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:38,318
She doesn't get bored with the same
guy with a stincky mouth

484
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,206
Welcome in the 21e century, sweetheart!

485
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,328
-Well Lucie she's a whore, sorry to tell you!
-Come on!

486
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,629
Having lovers doesn't make a woman a whore.

487
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:50,798
Whatever, I'm the only man here so...

488
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:53,706
-Poor you!
-And Alain, do you see him sometimes ?

489
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,697
Na, just for the kids.
Just that.

490
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:59,995
Oh! We saw him with a bitch.

491
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:03,122
-huh, what ?
-Alain, we saw him with a bitch.

492
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,113
-A blonde.
-We don't know if he was with her...

493
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:09,809
"we don't know"!
He had his tongue in her mouth

494
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,797
..and his hand on her ass!
What more do you want, Colombo?

495
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:18,450
What?

496
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,701
Did I do something wrong ?

497
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:22,609
-Is it a problem for you ?
-No no why ?

498
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,217
It's just that... I don't know...

499
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,425
Do you want some pie ?

500
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,152
Sssssh, take off your shoes

501
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:33,674
They're sleeping

502
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,973
The stairs are making noise

503
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,147
Like a robber in my own house.

504
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,621
Former home

505
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:53,812
You don't see other women, do you ?

506
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:55,286
Who ?

507
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,765
You heard me.

508
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,785
You mean, if I sleep with women
other than you ?

509
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,309
You got it!

510
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:09,559
Are you nuts or something ?

511
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:12,605
So you see no other women except me ?

512
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,990
But...

513
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,155
I don't know. To me we're..

514
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:21,590
..we're together
I don't understand, it's crazy!

515
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,023
Crazy!
Crazy, huh ?

516
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,087
Wait a sec! Shhh!

517
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:39,467
Yeah mum. I'm at Arthur's right now

518
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:42,152
I'm finishing a math lesson

519
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,675
Kiss

520
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:45,281
Gotta go

521
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,374
Man forget it

522
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,838
I have no choice.
Plus Medhi isn't here

523
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:52,995
That's the point! Medhi doesn't come
And you gotta go after 5 min... Come on

524
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:55,441
-Don't worry we'll kill it
-We ain't gonna kill nothin man, it's a competition

525
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:57,853
with guys from Dunkerque or Rennes or something

526
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,912
Music is the only thing they got in life

527
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:03,385
Me too man, you think I wanna end up
like my father ?

528
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,372
I call you if I can come back.
I'm sorry!

529
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:09,283
Drives me fuckin crazy...

530
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,148
-There!
-What's your band ?

531
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,579
No Shampoo.

532
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:13,716
What's that ?

533
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:14,967
Pop folk music

534
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,400
And what's that...

535
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:17,656
..folk music ?

536
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:19,694
What is it ?
It's not for you

537
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:24,194
-Since when do you hand flyers ?
-Since it's better when a gorgeous girl does it

538
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:26,251
Oh yeah, you're a pro at that kinda thing

539
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:27,768
Don't be jalous!

540
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:28,860
Don't worry about it

541
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,032
Oh no!

542
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,283
'No Shampoo' live!

543
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,766
No Shampoo!

544
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:34,927
Nobody gets out without a flyer

545
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,105
Principal's order
there!

546
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:39,572
It's for the festival Emergenza, in the 11th district

547
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,709
Where's that ?

548
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,748
Give it to your friend, or your grand ma'

549
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:37,378
-You killed it, guys
-We're preselected!

550
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:38,855
It's crazy!

551
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,237
I was so excited when all the hands were up

552
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:44,363
You were so handsome tonight

553
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:46,447
You're the most beautiful

554
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,103
Maël!

555
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:51,058
Maël!

556
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,309
Shall we go ?

557
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,304
-It's all right
-we're going

558
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:01,950
-Hi
-Ah!

559
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,422
Good evening. Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

560
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,550
Can we know where you were ?

561
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,455
I was with Arthur, I was finishing revising a math test.
It took longer than I thought.

562
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,357
-Did it go well ?
-Very well.

563
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:13,878
And you believe him ?

564
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,782
-You want some soup ?
-Yes, thank you.

565
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,515
Dad, I talked to you about a music festival called Emergenza.

566
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:31,587
And if you're selected you can record an album with real producers.

567
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,629
Thank you very much.
I'd like to do it.

568
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,056
Can you give me the salt, please?

569
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,613
Did you hear what I just said ?

570
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:44,429
You didn't hear what I just asked ?

571
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:47,728
Give him the salt

572
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,682
There!

573
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,332
Thank you.

574
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,499
You're welcome

575
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,134
-Come on that's it I know you love me

576
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,404
but stop following me!
-In your dreams yeah

577
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,135
Get the fuck out you filthy bitch

578
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:09,477
-Why do you fuckin treat me like that ?
-So exciting when you're pissed off

579
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,162
Stop it I'm so scared

580
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,158
-I'm done with your shit, damn it!
-Lola, stop it

581
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:17,630
Stop it! Stop it! Goddman you Arthur!
What you doin' like that ?

582
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:20,458
-Come on!
-How could I have dated this asshole ?

583
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,662
-Stop it, damn it!
-Stop acting the justice lover man!

584
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:25,182
What you're talkin' about ?

585
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,833
The Beatles split up because of a woman!

586
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,737
The Beatles ? Bullshit!

587
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:32,997
Arthur stop it!
I wanna kill him

588
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:39,073
I've had enough of him!

589
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,941
Where do you think you are ?

590
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:46,455
I swear to God, it ain't my fault!
He doesn't stop insulting me!

591
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:47,923
No but...

592
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,225
Don't call my mum please

593
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,077
Call your friend to tell them

594
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,641
your birthay party is cancelled

595
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,171
Please ma' you can't do that to me

596
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:57,728
Oh yes I can

597
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,637
The bad marks, all right, I can understand

598
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,305
But behavior problems, no!

599
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,848
But Arthur is calling me a whore!

600
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,684
So what ? I let him insult me ?

601
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:06,852
I say nothing ?

602
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:07,586
What ? Your Arthur ?

603
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:08,554
Yes.

604
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:10,021
And he's not my Arthur anymore.

605
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,193
Why did he insult you ?

606
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:14,356
I won't give you details it's my life.

607
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:17,256
-All right, all right, we cancel
-Ok but there..

608
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,657
..it's blackmailing

609
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:20,210
-Yes
-You have no rights

610
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,554
-I know
-You're rude!

611
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,349
We'll go to the theater instead

612
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:25,725
Great

613
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,342
All right, you win

614
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,708
Arthur slept with a girl last summer.

615
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:33,253
I acted like I didn't give a shit

616
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,717
So I told him I did the same.

617
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:37,361
You did ?

618
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:41,330
Of course not! That's the only thing you wanna know

619
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,435
No, not only that!

620
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,255
But I wouldn't want you
to do some stupid shit

621
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,519
just out of pique

622
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,769
Out of what ?

623
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,936
Uneducated generation

624
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:52,511
I'm kiddin

625
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,179
So, is it yes or no ?

626
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:56,456
For my birthday party

627
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:57,758
Hmmm...

628
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,359
Please...

629
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,658
Thank you so much mum

630
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:06,005
Will you lend me your collar ?

631
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:13,496
Don't you wanna tell me your name ?

632
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:15,195
No. Anonym. More Exciting...

633
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:33,943
Am I "in it" now ?

634
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:35,243
yeahhh

635
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,897
A chicken doesn't disappear just like that!

636
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:56,650
Léon!

637
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,428
-Did you take the chicken, Léon ?
-Damn it!

638
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:02,328
Léon!

639
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,766
Léon, will you answer me ?

640
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,752
Léon, where is the chicken ?

641
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,398
Do you hear me or what ?

642
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,620
What ?

643
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:14,619
Did you take the chicken ?

644
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,350
-I didn't do anything I swear!
-Nothing huh ?

645
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:19,261
Stop it, it's not me!
Why do you always accuse me ?

646
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,076
And that, ain't it a chicken ?

647
00:34:21,346 --> 00:34:22,602
I hate lies!

648
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:24,072
I swear to God!

649
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,207
I hate it!

650
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,021
I swear, it's not me

651
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,230
Fuck! I'm tired of this

652
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:35,052
Who are you leaving with ?

653
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,608
-With a friend
-Do I know her ?

654
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,996
No, you'll call the children
You got grand ma's number ?

655
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,732
-Yeah yeah
-Mum, you let her go shopping

656
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,033
And order some pizzas
Understood ? I know you

657
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:48,835
Be carefull, she'll do whatever shes wants

658
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,660
They're heartless, mum.

659
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,103
-Not at all!
-Come on, hurry up!

660
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,837
-Let's go mum!
-You're kicking me out!

661
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,365
-Yes
-Not at all!

662
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,138
-All right... bye
-bye!

663
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:05,601
-Admit it grand ma', you knew for mum and dad!
-Look at them!

664
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,254
-They look like teenagers
-Yeah

665
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,246
Unfortunatly teenagers aren't like that anymore.

666
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,357
Now let's have some vodka!

667
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:24,003
You want a funnel ?

668
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:25,273
a what ?

669
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:26,695
Forget it

670
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:30,559
There's too much of it!

671
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:33,252
Don't worry,
my mother takes 3 every day.

672
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:34,768
Yeah but still..

673
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,121
I'm not sure about this

674
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,977
She'll have the best time of her life, and us too!

675
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,880
Excuse me, mam.

676
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,796
-Yes
-You want a drink ?

677
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:49,618
-hmmm. Yes a coke please.

678
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,568
-With a lil bit of whisky.
-Damn!

679
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:54,082
What are you drinking ?

680
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,641
Just water

681
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:57,596
Very good

682
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:59,608
She'll be high as a kite, grand ma'

683
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:00,981
Don't say that

684
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:02,291
It's all right

685
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,324
-Isn't it dangerous with the meds ?
-no..

686
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:06,457
You sure ?

687
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,926
Of course I am! There!

688
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:09,401
No, you do it!

689
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:11,442
You're not funny.

690
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,520
There you go, mam.

691
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:16,996
Thank you

692
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,937
It is cold enough ?

693
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,938
It's perfect, thank you!

694
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,851
Charlotte!

695
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:30,403
-How you doin ?
-Fine, you ?

696
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:31,924
I'm all right.

697
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,560
This t-shirt, is it yours ?

698
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,548
It's my grand ma's but she lend it to me.

699
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,952
Don't fuck with me. Are there many of them out there ?

700
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:43,517
I can't really ask her she's dead.

701
00:36:44,693 --> 00:36:45,943
Damn!

702
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:50,453
Don't worry, she didn't suffer
Plus, it's a joke.

703
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:52,063
Thank you

704
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:53,581

00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:54,926

707
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:12,766
You sure she won't wake up ?

708
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,060
Don't worry, not with the dose I gave her.

709
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,752
You have condoms ?

710
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,804
Well no

711
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:21,656
Oh come on... I didn't expect we'd date again.

712
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,180

I'm sorry
I must have drunk too much

723
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:27,321
I don't know what's happening

724
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:29,369
Don't worry. We have all the time we want

725
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:32,095
Come on looks like we're in TV movie or something

<i>Damn right

728
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,682
We're too close

-Damn right, especialy these times
-Yeah, especialy these times

730
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,493
<i>A good and a bad news

731
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:58,031
<i>The good one: mum dumped my dad again

732
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,052
<i>He lied to her about who he was seeing

733
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:03,903
<i>The bad one is that because of that
she got home ealier.

734
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,491
<i>And honnestly we aren't done
with the cleaning yet.

735
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,806
Lola!

736
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:12,982

00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:17,149
How you doin mum ?

738
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:19,487
Do we start with the joints or the condoms ?

739
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:22,306
-It's not my fault
-Mum, that's not funny

740
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:24,177
-I'll explain it to you
-Yeah

741
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,693
Explain it to me

742
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:27,470
Stéphane and Medhi they did it again

743
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,666
They used the whole box of condoms ?

744
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,427
I can take out the trash...

745
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:32,513
Oh you

746
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:33,764

747
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:36,388
-I'm listenning
-Well I don't know really I wasn't with them

748
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,581
-I was there..
-Are you shitting me, Lola ?

749
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,472
Hell no, I promise!

750
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:42,443
-You shittin' me Lola?
-No....

751
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,920
Yes you are

752
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:45,904
Don't get pissed off for a few joints.

753
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,016
when you smoke some every night in your room

754
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:51,045
I'm sorry ? But I,
I'm 40, young lady!

755
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,922
I have my high school degree, my degree in architecture!

756
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,855
When you'll have all that then you'll talk!

757
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:57,702
If I see you again with that, you move the fuck out!

758
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:59,075
You go live with your father!

759
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:01,104
Well that's what you're waiting huh ?

760
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:03,171
That I move the fuck out, that I go live with dad ?

761
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:05,492
So you can live the life, like a teenager

762
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:08,439
Because you're jaelous of me!
Jalous of me!

763
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,504
Fuck!

764
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,291
You're so fucking bored with your life

765
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:15,387
..that you can't even find another man than dad.

766
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:16,824
You can't even...

767
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:18,602
..do that, in 40 years!

768
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:24,451
So you too, you get high with joints ?

769
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:25,973
Huh ?

770
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,191
Why is it that you all have

771
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:29,877
to fuck around with me today ?

772
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,327
That's it!
That's it!

773
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,654
It's over, no more favors like that.

774
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,501
-What do you want ?
-What do I want ?

775
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:50,231
I want us to stop fighting for nothing

776
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,627
Nothing ? You have sex with prostitutes!

777
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:55,483
I'm tired of all this
I won't make more effort, Alain.

778
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,395
You're both the best and the worst thing
that happened to me.

779
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:04,643
-Anne I promise you
-Stop promising...

780
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:06,841
And stop lying, all of you!

781
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,091
Shit!

782
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,689
"Hug ?"

783
00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:28,137
"CONFERENCE ON DRUGS. STUDENTS NEEDED"

784
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:31,678
Be quiet, please.

785
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,808
There are some empty chairs on the first rows

786
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,230
Come on! Hurry up!

787

00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:56,069
We won't start the conference

790
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:59,928
..until we get a complete silence. Thank you.

791
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:02,846
You're also conerned, Mr Collet.

792
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:05,058
Is it true that you banged Lola at her party ?

793
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,522
Bullshit man, you're so full of shit!

794
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,334
I knew my best friend coudn't do that to me.

795
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:09,401
I'm sure now.

796
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,653
So, let's get started.

797
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,651
*-The health minister informs you that...

798
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,017
"DRUG. A DANGER TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE"

799
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,379
Yeah, I know I know

800
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:25,881
So! here's the brain of a 15 year old boy

801
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,792
..who doesn't do drugs.

802
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:31,274
The blue area still has to grow until adult age.

803
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:34,216
Here, it's in contact with some THC

804
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:38,607
No way it'll happen to you, you ain't got a brain

805
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:41,635
You shut the fuck up!

806
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,805
still more dangerous

807
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:47,766
Damaged areas will stay damaged for life

808
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,233
which you give that in picture

809
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,619
You see that ?

810
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,354
What ?

811
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,260
"What ?" that! the soccer match just right there!

812
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,264
I don't smoke!

813
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:01,609
No

814
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,209
Sometimes, more rarely

815
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:08,856
..apparition of a mental disease called schyzophrenia.

816
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:11,581
Shit! you see that, drugs...

817
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:13,973
You can talk, with your meds

818
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:16,446
-You have a light ?
-We can't smoke here

819
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:18,573
-What ?
-We're in school

820
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,907
Goddamn it! Fuck!
I want a cigarette

821
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:23,650
Why you running ?

822
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,478
I don't wanna bump into someone

823
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,650
-Who ?
-Anne!

824
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,734
Hi

825
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:30,164
-I didn't see you. How you doin ?
-You ?

826
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:33,069
-It was interesting
-It was good no ?

827
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,002
Yes

828
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,975
I don't know if it'll change anything

829
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,239
It's a good thing to talk about it.

830
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,150
Hello.

831
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:39,235
Ah hello!

832
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:40,191
Hello

833
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:41,442
It was great

834
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:42,787
Thanks

835
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,694
Your heel, is it better ?

836
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:48,168
Oh the heel ? Yes it's fine

837
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:50,775
Well, I leave you two
See you later.

838
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,292
Ciao

839
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:55,242
Two times randomly, that's a lot!

840
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:56,804
They know each other ?

841
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:58,071
I don't know

842
00:43:58,072 --> 00:43:59,978
How about we have a drink ?

843
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:01,492
uhh...

844
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,888
It's not a question.

845
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:04,450
We'll have a drink.

846
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:05,967
All right. But...

847
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,652
This cop will cuff your mother to the bed

848
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:11,696
Yeah, whatever
I'll cuff you..

849
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,914
Check this out

850
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,483
THe sticky note is sticking to Maël

851
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:15,083
What a bitch!

852
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:16,334
She doesn't leave him alone

853
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:18,376
Let's go to a café
Ask your mother

854
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,509
OK

855
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,897
-So it's like that huh ?
-Mum ?

856
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:23,559
I'm gonna hang out with friends...

857
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:25,424
Lola, I introduce you to...

858
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:27,278
Lucas.

859
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:29,612
Lola, my daughter. No way, you go home.

860
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:31,435
But everybody's going

861
00:44:31,706 --> 00:44:33,483
No it's like that and
it's like that

862
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:35,087
Grand ma can't stay

863
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:37,158
So you go babysit the kids
and do your homework.

864
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,941
Okay. Fuck...

865
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:41,110
I'm sorry ?

866
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,793
No, nothing. See you later then.

867
00:44:45,594 --> 00:44:47,324
So is it okay ?

868
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:49,498
-I thought it wasn't a question!
-Oh yeah, right!

869
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,010
"Oh yeah right"!

870
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,528
Maël?

871
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:14,963
So was it good ?

872
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:17,402
Well listen yes it was very good

873
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:18,594
You're disgusting!

874
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:19,660
Was it good ?

875
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:20,999
What are you talking about ?

876
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:21,951
Oh come one!

877
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,913
At least take responsability when you do that....

878
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:25,164
What's wrong ?

879
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:26,738
What did you say to her ?

880
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,456
Nothing, we're chating.

881
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:30,021
Your girlfriend doesn't have any sense of humor.

882
00:45:30,122 --> 00:45:32,501
You ain't got nothing better to do ?
Lola!

883
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:43,650
What happened in those toilets stays in these toilets, got it ?

884
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:47,429
I get out. You wait 5 minutes
before getting out, is it clear ?

885
00:45:47,698 --> 00:45:50,032
Yeah, well... I guess it's clear.

886
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:54,380
Lola!

887
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:55,248
Leave me alone

888
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:56,208
What is this ?

889
00:45:56,209 --> 00:45:57,174
Leave me alone

890
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:59,817
Everybody knows that this slut sucks in the toillets.

891
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:01,453
What ?

892
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:05,141
At least there's one girl who knows that
you can't get it hard.

893
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:09,346
Impressive!

894
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,088
I think that settles it.

895
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,819
I think so yeah!

896
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:24,623
Fuck!

897
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:27,612
Lola?

898
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:32,694
Lola!

899
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:41,066
Lola...

900
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:45,450
Sweetheart?

901
00:46:47,502 --> 00:46:48,752
Are you okay?

902
00:46:49,857 --> 00:46:51,107
I'm fine

903
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:53,869
Come and eat.
One has to eat when one's sad.

904
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:55,825
I'm not hungry.

905
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,644
You're not gonna get anorexic, are you ?

906
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:01,687
You don't get anorexic just like that

907
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,378
I've seen it on a TV show, it comes quickly.

908
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:08,063
Don't worry

909
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:10,755
It's not that

910
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:13,920
You'll see.

911
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:18,872
It's not such a big deal.

912
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:26,858
<i>And I bend over you

913
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:30,891
<i>A drop of dew on your lips

914
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,234
<i>A beam on your fingers

915
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,480
<i>I can read in your dreams

916
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,695
<i>And you think like I do

00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:48,775
<i>An exile, an exile

918
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:53,072
<i>Far, far away from here

919
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:56,195
<i>Oh my muse

920
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:07,977
In the toillets with De Peyrefitte

921
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:09,046
But when ?

922
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:11,345
At the anti-drugs conference

923
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:12,858
Charlotte?

924
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:16,075
-And you're sure it was them ?
-Yes

925
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:17,587
There he is!

926
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:25,880
<i>I so wanna kill Maël
or De Peyrefitte.

927
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,401
<i>I so wanna get out

928
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,392
<i>And as a bad news never comes alone

930
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:49,269
I took some
You wanna see them ?

931
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:51,660
And this one, you see it ?

932
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:09,621
You didn't get the congratulations

933
00:49:09,892 --> 00:49:12,096
Yeah but I had encouragements

934
00:49:12,322 --> 00:49:14,525
That's my point, it's not as good as before

935
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:16,181
yes mum

936
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,816
Can you explain me this 112 in French ?

937
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:23,028
Woooo... Really, they're so messed up these teachers

938
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:24,819
Yeah, sure

939

5 in maths, 6 in French
6 in history and geography

2 in physics!

941

Are you kidding me ?

942
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:36,354
<i>No mum I don't. I just can't get interested

949
00:49:53,426 --> 00:49:55,805
Second trimester

950
00:50:01,276 --> 00:50:03,382
So who's the asshole we wanna get jaelous ?

951

the guy with his retard
the blondie just dehind

It's Julien.
Is it a problem for you ?

00:50:17,854 --> 00:50:19,105
No, absoluty not

You comin' ? We're gonna buy some cigars

959
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,399
Motos, it's so out of fashion

960
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,498
Not only the moto is out of fashion

961
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,163
I can't believe it
She blocked me.

962
00:50:37,428 --> 00:50:38,719
Fuck...

963
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,875
Come see your girlfriend instead of playin' poker.

964
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:20,388
I just wanna know if you come to sleep over at my home tonight

965
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:24,592
All right. I leave you the keys under the doormat.

966
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:26,598
"Your house 19pm ?"

967
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:28,843
Mehdi pisses me off, I swear to God.

968
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:30,706
We should have seen each other yesterday.

969
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:32,057
I'm still waiting!

970
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:35,441
He's an assholes, forget it.
Potatoes ou fries ?

971
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,786
Yeah, act like you don't see me!

972
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:38,836
Potatoes.

973
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:40,087
Two potatoes

974
00:51:40,226 --> 00:51:42,394
If he comes to talk to me, I blow him off.

975
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:43,626
What, mum ?

976
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:46,186
No I don't know where your grey cashmere is!

977
00:51:46,387 --> 00:51:48,851
No I'm not wearing it!
No!

978
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:50,733
My mother she drives me nuts

979
00:51:51,854 --> 00:51:53,105
Will it be all ?

980
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:54,705
A toffee sundae, please.

981
00:51:57,454 --> 00:51:59,753
Isn't Paul-Henri so ugly?

982
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,830
Damn right!

983
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:04,001
Oh yeah he is!
With his fry!

984
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,582
Isn't he disgusting ?

985
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:07,045
Revolting!

986
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:08,296
You're overstatin it

987
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:10,245
Could you date him ?

988
00:52:10,473 --> 00:52:11,723
Oh no, no way!

989
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:16,150
Stop looking at them they'll think we're interested in them

990
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,619
We're interested in them.

991
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,285
A lil bit you gotta admit.

992
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:21,010
Don't you think they obsessed with us ?

993
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,484
Last time I played poker I had a three ases!

994
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:25,288
And this guy he had a fifth!

995
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:26,356
I got fucked up!

996
00:52:26,357 --> 00:52:28,086
Calm down with the poker

997
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:30,643
I only got a pair of converse to bet

998
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,164
Why don't you bet your hair ?

999
00:52:34,266 --> 00:52:35,516
It's bad to play poker

1000
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:37,338
And it's bad to eat like a pig

1001
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:38,851
You're disgusting

1002
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:40,114
Maël, show what you got

1003
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,025
What ?

1004
00:52:41,026 --> 00:52:43,351
The founder of "ni pates ni sushis" (neither pastas nor sushis)

1005
00:52:43,351 --> 00:52:44,020
Oh damn!

1006
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:45,271
Not her...

1007
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,222
Lola, check this out!
All we needed right now!

1008
00:52:48,837 --> 00:52:50,389
Hi boys, how you doin'

1009
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,916
Fine, you ?

1010
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,350
He's comin'

1011
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,348
Who ?

1012
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:55,641
My ass!

1013
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:57,950
How you doin ?

1014
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:00,813
Can we hang out tonight ?

1015
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:02,676
-Sure
-At yours ?

1016
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:03,939
Well yeah

1017
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:05,156
See you then

1018
00:53:05,157 --> 00:53:06,407
Later

1019
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:08,193
<i>No comment.

1020
00:53:08,194 --> 00:53:10,835
The sticky note won't let him go!

1021
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,584
What a bitch!

1022
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:14,596
And my mother again

1023
00:53:14,997 --> 00:53:15,658
What mum ?

1024
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,523
Lola, have you seen your cupboard ?

1025
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:18,393
What a shithole!

1026
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:21,639
If I don't find my clothes, no more messenger!

1027
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,246
Shit!

1028
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:32,793
<i>-"One night, we were so fucking bored so

Why are you doing this ?

1037
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:22,151
What a goddamn fool I am!

1038
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:24,529
Unbelievable

1039
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:29,777
Shit!

1040
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:32,856
Yeah, hello ?

Yeah, I'm fine

1042

I was just leaving. Okay!

1043
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:40,371
In two minutes. All right, see you then.

-Djamel and Vincent, is that right ?
-And maybe Gilles

1045

Go straight to the Orfèvres

Sorry I'm late

Doesn't matter. How you doin' ?

1049
00:54:58,426 --> 00:54:59,676
Fine

1050
00:54:59,772 --> 00:55:01,062
Well ?

1051
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:03,848
What is it ?

He'll think it's me who makes you cry

What's the matter ?

1056
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,560
No no, nothing.

1057
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,987
It's only human to have looked in this diary!

1058
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:44,815
-You're not gonna feel guilty ?
-Yes, I feel guilty with kids.

1059
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:47,464
When I let them do what they want
I feel guilty

1060
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:50,815
When I yell, it's worse

1061
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,184
I got the feeling of being a cop.

1062
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:53,672
It sucks, doesn't it ?

1063
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,485
yeah...

1064
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:59,310
No but I don't how to say...
you see ?

1065
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:01,128
We've been fighting all our life

1066
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:03,387
..to have the same rights as you do,..

1067
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,988
..and have the same sexuality.

1068
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,296
-You, you said that ?
-You defended that ?

1069
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,939
Absolutly
I defended that!

1070
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:15,451
Whatever..
When you see your little girl like who

1071
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,392
..goes live her life as a freed women,

1072
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:19,407
you don't agree anymore.

1073
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:22,961
I swear
I don't even what to think

1074
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:25,170
You don't have to think anything.

1075
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:27,953
She sleeps with some boys, she does drugs...

1076
00:56:28,911 --> 00:56:32,905
She tried to have sex with a boy
and she smokes a little bit.

1077
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:34,699
No big deal.

1078
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,468
Look who's talking

1079
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:40,583
I know how to make the difference between
a teenager who's got issues..

1080
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:42,659
..and on who checks where the limits are.

1081
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,485
As long as it keeps hapening with people
the same age...

1082
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:50,606
You're telling me this to cheer me up ?

1083
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:54,295
I think that you think too much.

1084

1094
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:23,587
-Go. No.
-Saturday, I'll take you on saturday.

1095
00:57:23,856 --> 00:57:25,277
Tonight I can't

1096
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:26,501
Oh !

1097
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:28,019
Can you sign this ?

1098
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:29,838
I need both your signatures

1099
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:31,017

A parental approval for a trip to England.

1101
00:57:36,442 --> 00:57:37,692
Thanks

1102
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:46,545
-Where you going ?
-At Arthur's

1103
00:57:46,813 --> 00:57:50,013
-Are you shitting me ?
-I really don't have time

1104
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:51,813
That rings a bell ?

1105
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,981
You think I don't know what that is ?

1106
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:58,432
Listen to me! All we needed is a drug addict in our home

1107
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:00,435
Next year, it's boarding school!

1108
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,294
Waiting for that moment, no more music,
no more guitar

1109
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,037
What are you doing ?

1110
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:06,290
What the hell ?

1111
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,557
Stop it, goddamn it!

1112
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:10,347
I could have broken it on your head!

1113
00:58:10,447 --> 00:58:11,697
Freak!

1114
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,501
And that, it's confiscated

1115
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:16,015
You happy ? congrats!

1116
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:18,406
Fuck!

Thanks for listening to me

1118
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,002
It's part of my job mam!

1119
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:46,779
No, it's very nice of you!

1120
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:48,520
It's not nice

1121
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:52,598
It's interested

1122
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:54,073
-Oh yeah ?
-Yeah

1123
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:17,168
What are you doing here ?

1124
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:19,422
Alain. Lucas.

1125
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:21,942
the father of my kids

1126
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:24,845
Lola forgot some books

1127
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:27,844
Ok then...

1128
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,660
I leave you two...

1129
00:59:29,886 --> 00:59:31,136
Yeah

1130
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:43,242
-You okay ?
-Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

1131
00:59:44,468 --> 00:59:47,157
I'll let you feel guilty alone.

1132
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,757
yeah

1133
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:51,443
I'm sorry

1134
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:07,205
Maël's voicemail.
You can leave a message.

1135
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:12,495
Hey it's me Lola, you remember ?
THe girl you had a date with ?

1136
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,878
I've been standing here for an hour
Don't try to fool me.

1137
01:00:29,558 --> 01:00:30,944
Good evening sir.

1138
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:33,282
Good evening Etienne. Thank you.

1139
01:00:35,374 --> 01:00:36,795
It's my son!

1140
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,234
We can follow them if you want.

1141
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:41,747
Yeah if it's okay with you.

1142
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,260
I don't mind.

1143
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:52,248
Do I go pick him up ?

1144
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:55,205
No, I don't wanna cause a scene.

1145
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,322
But it's unreal! 2 am. in the middle of the week.

1146
01:00:59,547 --> 01:01:00,932
What are the parents doing ?

1147
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:03,184
Like you, sir.

1148
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,703
And what is that ?

1149
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:07,780
Thinking their children are sleeping.

1150
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:29,704
You think my daughter is a lesbian ?

1151
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:32,094
Hum.

1152
01:01:33,007 --> 01:01:35,601
"Hum" yes or "hum" no?

1153
01:01:35,872 --> 01:01:37,554
Hum.

1154
01:01:38,215 --> 01:01:42,290
Can you stop with your 'hum' and give
some real awnsers ?

1155
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:47,370
Is it more chocking if she sleeps with
a girl instead of a boy ?

1156
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:51,573
You know what, I prefer you 'hum'

1157
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:53,399
-You see ?
-Hum

1158
01:01:55,142 --> 01:01:57,865
Hey, how you doing ?

1159
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,214
You wanted...

1160
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,300
..to talk to me?

1161
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,983
We have to talk about Lola.

1162
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:05,461
Hum

1163
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:07,721
You're not gonna do that too?

1164
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,542
Do what ?

1165
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,359
My shrink always does some 'hum'
it drives me nuts

1166
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:16,401
Yeah, and you told her that you're
screwing another guy ?

1167
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:20,045
First, I'm not screwing anybody

1168
01:02:20,313 --> 01:02:22,825
Oh yeah that's right
I'm sorry

1169
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:26,897
Us, men, we fuck bitches but you women

1170
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:30,076
you make love with some extraordinary men.

1171
01:02:30,294 --> 01:02:32,105
Stop it!
It's not the time.

1172
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,533
For you.
Because everything's fine with me

1173
01:02:35,806 --> 01:02:38,531
I'm chating with 'Madam I give lessons'

1174
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,614
who causes a scene because she thinks
I'm "banging a bitch"

1175
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:46,437
You sure you wanna take this path ?

1176
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:49,684
Yeah, because you own me some explanation

1177
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:54,631
I own you explanation

1178
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:57,756
I remind you that we're divorced

1179
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,671
Yeah when you feel like it

1180
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:03,704
Well!

1181
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:06,959
Lola does drugs

1182
01:03:07,226 --> 01:03:08,476
What ?

1183
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:10,602
Joints, not yet some...

1184
01:03:13,562 --> 01:03:15,944
If you didn't leave your shit all over the house...

1185
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:19,542
I remind you that you are her model on Earth.

1186
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:22,454
If she follows you on the sex...

1187
01:03:25,236 --> 01:03:27,096
You're an asshole, you know that ?

1188
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:29,224
It's amazing how big of an asshole you are.

1189
01:03:30,576 --> 01:03:32,482
Wait a sec, wait

1190
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,430
I'm not an asshole, I'm just jealous

1191
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:37,114
I came to talk to you about Lola.

1192
01:03:37,388 --> 01:03:40,586
We should get her to a private school.

1193
01:03:40,586 --> 01:03:42,786
When you feel like talking, call me.

1194
01:03:55,182 --> 01:03:57,432
Hello ? Lola, I have to tell you

1195
01:03:57,655 --> 01:03:59,076
I got nothing to say

1196
01:03:59,347 --> 01:04:01,029
I really had some troubles

1197
01:04:01,302 --> 01:04:03,600
I'm sick of all your lies

1198
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:06,067
Are you kidding me ?
We're dining now!

1199
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:08,054
Come on give me a break

1200
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,415
No I don't give you a break

1201
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,098
What's with all the yelling ?

1202
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:14,311
I'm tired of all this mess!
Clean your room

1203
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:16,527
Okay so I don't dine ?

1204
01:04:16,795 --> 01:04:18,701
After diner!
Don't act stupid!

1205
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:20,302
And you stop it!

1206
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:23,035
I'm sick of your bad behavior!

1207
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:25,603
Me too I have a bad behavior ?

1208
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:30,370
Mrs Delgado, please.

1209
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:33,624
No, first I'll see the girl alone.

1210
01:04:45,351 --> 01:04:47,732
He! I don't wanna go to another school!

1211
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:49,903
It's all I have, my friends!

1212
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:52,467
You still has a familly!
That's nice!

1213
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:56,804
Oh yeah I forgot, a familly who
have sex without telling me

1214
01:04:57,025 --> 01:04:59,714
I don't give a fuck about having a familly

1215
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:04,574
No doubt, she's her father's daughter.

1216
01:05:04,837 --> 01:05:07,136
Yeah let's say that

1217
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:12,945
-Sweetheart ?
-Hmm?

1218
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,504
No, nothing

1219
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:25,054
Look at this bitch

1220
01:05:25,277 --> 01:05:28,222
She acts like she won the match.

1221
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:29,443
Pisses me off

1222
01:05:29,444 --> 01:05:31,517
It's not who Maël would chose

1223
01:05:31,517 --> 01:05:33,785
It's who every man would chose

1224
01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:37,037
She's ridiculous. You seen her shoes ?

1225
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:40,332
-So lame!
-and she's coming with us in England

1226
01:05:40,598 --> 01:05:43,014
We should stop lookin at them 'cause otherwise...

1227
01:05:43,288 --> 01:05:45,539
He's gonna imagine I'm interested in him

1228
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:47,322
Right

1229
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:49,405
Stop it!

1230
01:05:49,406 --> 01:05:50,874
Stop it

1231
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:54,129
Be quiet!

1232
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:01,463
Who wrote that ?

1233
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:02,471
Mehdi

1234
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:03,722
I'm sure

1235
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,679
So disgusting

1236
01:06:09,935 --> 01:06:11,451
Keep quiet

1237
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:15,090
You understood ? Not a noise.
And concentrate.

1238
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:23,660
<i>"Tamaget au baconnet" ?
(doesn't mean anything in French,)

1239
01:06:23,748 --> 01:06:25,947
<i>(doesn't mean anything in French,)

1240
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,501
<i>yeah yeah
(doesn't mean anything in French,)

1241
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,408
I'm warning you

1242
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,925
The next one who talks...
One more noise and I cancel..

1243
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:37,442
..the trip to England, you understand me ?

1244
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,302
No London!

1245
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,759
Hello

1246
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:58,494
Charlotte, how you doing ?

1247
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:00,049
Very well

1248
01:07:00,321 --> 01:07:01,658
Doing some shoping ?

1249
01:07:01,928 --> 01:07:03,178
Well yeah

1250
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:04,226
Very well

1251
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:06,229
You live around here ?

1252
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:07,350
Yes, as you can see

1253
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:08,643
You too I figure

1254
01:07:09,607 --> 01:07:11,549
Funny huh ?

1255
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:13,311
What's that ?

1256
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:14,077
Come on!

1257
01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:16,767
The probability for us to bump into each other

1258
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:18,889
..is what... ?

1259
01:07:19,156 --> 01:07:20,495
You could reckon it

1260
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:22,674
There you are!
Did you think about the milk ?

1261
01:07:22,714 --> 01:07:25,096
No, I forgot about it.

1262
01:07:25,362 --> 01:07:26,315
Mr Messier...

1263
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:27,556
.. my maths teacher

1264
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:28,807
Hello

1265
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:30,349
I'm sorry

1266
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:32,910
..for the lessons at home

1267
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,294
Lessons for Charlotte ?

1268
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,242
No no
I got confused with another studend

1269
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:42,283
Quite ambarassing having memory issues
when teachin maths!

1270
01:07:42,548 --> 01:07:44,194
Come on, let's go!

1271
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:45,542
Mam.

1272
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:48,398
I hope they're not all like him

1273
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,130
He was alone so he's single

1274
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,604
Why do you care ?

1275
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,823
You're not gonna fuck him ?

1276
01:07:55,923 --> 01:07:57,814
How can you be so sure ?

1277
01:07:58,215 --> 01:07:59,465
Gotta go

1278
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:01,984
My unknown person is doin some weird things

1279
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:03,501
Who is he ?

1280
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:05,199
Don't know

1281
01:08:05,462 --> 01:08:06,599
Don't know him

1282
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,718
You're insane

1283
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:10,620
Fucking insane
I have a double call, ciao.

1284
01:08:12,405 --> 01:08:13,697
He's fuckin insane

1285
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:14,808
Big breaking news

1286
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:15,833
What's that ?

1287
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:17,138
Guess who doesn't go to England

1288
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:18,306
Maël?

1289
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:18,963
Better

1290
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:19,826
Who ?

1291
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:21,119
*-De Peyrefitte. Appendicitis

1292
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:23,157
-you're kidding
-Awesome!

1293
01:08:23,386 --> 01:08:25,849
-And God exists
-Gotta go

1294
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,587
Ciao.
Ciao.

1295
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:33,709
Easy with the meds mum
I'm just going to England

1296
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:38,086
That's for bellyaches.
Will you remember ?

1297
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:39,613
I will

1298
01:08:39,879 --> 01:08:42,037
I write it down, "bellyache"

1299
01:08:42,237 --> 01:08:43,487
It's okay mum I have a brain

1300
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:46,677
Good for you baby. Good for you.

1301
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:50,022
I'll finish packing

1302
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,543
Okay

1303
01:08:56,889 --> 01:08:58,535
Thank you

1304
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:01,088
What's that ?

1305
01:09:01,318 --> 01:09:03,094
It belongs to Lola
Have to give it back to her

1306
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:05,088
You exchange your underwear ?

1307
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,910
No but she slept over once, and huh...

1308
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:10,512
And that ? and that ?

1309
01:09:10,777 --> 01:09:11,992
She forgot it

1310
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:13,853
oh yeah ? and that's Lola's too ?

1311
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,886
Are you kidding me ?
You haven't left yet, you know that ?

1312
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:21,142
I never want to see you
wearing that shit!

1313
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:24,478
Plus, you're a liar.
Straight to the trash bin.

1314
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:32,734
you're not taking many books

1315
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:37,289
Well no, I'm going there essentialy
for learning English

1316
01:09:38,422 --> 01:09:40,002
You'll be carefull right ?

1317
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:41,070
Sure!

1318
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:43,011
Why are you telling me this like that ?

1319
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:45,060
No because...

1320
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:48,401
No, not that one!

1321
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:49,872
Mum, please!

1322
01:09:49,873 --> 01:09:50,639
No way!

1323
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,245
I don't have any hot clothes

1324
01:09:52,614 --> 01:09:53,864
You got so many

1325
01:09:54,002 --> 01:09:56,314
it's itchy! Yours' soft

1326
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:57,664
High-end cashmere, you bet!

1327
01:09:58,342 --> 01:10:00,182
please! England is cold

1328
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:01,943
And English people...

1329
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:03,885
..they're real cheap on heating

1330
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,968
Lola will get a pneumonia
she'll die and you'll never see me again

1331
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:13,878
I can't believe you! All right take it

1332
01:10:14,139 --> 01:10:15,525
Thanks

1333
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:40,997
Get out

1334
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:44,688
Come on...

1335
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,288
Stop it!

1336
01:10:55,195 --> 01:10:56,615
Come on now

1337
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:09,898
Need a special device to see the colors or sth ?

1338
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:11,418
What a shitty weather!

1339
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,850
Check this out, a garden gnome!

1340
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:16,493
They sure look like winners
We're not gonna learn English

1341
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:18,836
..but suicide attempts

1342
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:23,571
I'm gonna ask to see their

1343
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:24,888
criminal record

1344
01:11:25,095 --> 01:11:29,125
The old one, with the odd chick
lucky like we are, it's for us

1345
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:32,074
Doesn't change too much
from your family

1346
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:48,088
Damn!
Man, I can't believe it!

1347
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,299
She freaks me out
Gotta get outta here

1348
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:54,987
A little tolerance

1349
01:11:55,214 --> 01:11:56,300
Dont' say that

1350
01:11:56,301 --> 01:11:58,859
You don't have monopoly of discrimination

1351
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:01,662
'More like the MPV of anxiety'
(French joke)

1352
01:12:03,678 --> 01:12:06,319
She's dribbling on me!

1353
01:12:06,586 --> 01:12:09,015
Ouch! Damn man can't believe it

1354
01:12:10,188 --> 01:12:12,048
Sorry

1355
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:29,189
No thank you

1356
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:32,919
You think they're Al Quaida members ?

1357
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:34,439
Stop it!

1358
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:38,779
I'd love to be taken hostage
by the mum or the daughter

1359
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:59,307
And is there a plug for the cellphone ?

1360
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,376
I had a nice trip

1361
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,186
Okay. Welcome to the feaks' home!

1362
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,580
I call you again when we have an adaptator

1363
01:13:17,847 --> 01:13:19,706
They don't have one

1364
01:13:20,537 --> 01:13:23,866
My family is very weird mum, very weird

1365
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,908
Yeah, I'll explain it to you

1366
01:13:27,178 --> 01:13:30,163
And how you doing ? Is everything all right ?

1367
01:13:30,432 --> 01:13:33,251
Okay, call whenever you want

1368
01:13:33,471 --> 01:13:36,288
-Kiss, my love
-Kiss mum

1369
01:13:36,551 --> 01:13:37,801
I love you Lola.
-kiss

1370
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:41,225
Shit! I forgot to give her an adaptator.

1371
01:13:42,496 --> 01:13:44,795
-I'm late.
-where you going ?

1372
01:13:45,057 --> 01:13:48,044
You go brush you teeth and then go to bed.

1373
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:50,518
Come on let's go, it's late already

1374
01:13:54,172 --> 01:13:55,553
So you like him ?

1375
01:13:56,753 --> 01:13:57,468
Who ?

1376
01:13:57,469 --> 01:13:58,719
Navarro.

1377
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:01,764
I asked you not to call him that

1378
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,236
I never thought about it

1379
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:07,511
You should have my love.

1380
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:08,838
It's high time for you to start over

1381
01:14:08,839 --> 01:14:12,951
I hate that expression.
As if we're lost without men.

1382
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:14,824
That's the truth

1383
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,298
-Kiss
-So tell me, where is he taking you ?

1384
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:20,982
It's a suprise

1385
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,310
You should wear a scarf

1386
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,376
I'm not 14!

1387
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,237
They look like Mum and Lola

1388
01:14:26,461 --> 01:14:27,752
See you later

1389
01:14:27,979 --> 01:14:29,229
What about your teeth ?

1390
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:31,661
-Done!
-Let me see.

1391
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:34,262
Yeah

1392
01:14:34,531 --> 01:14:37,516
For Lady Di they would
have turned the heating on

1393
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:39,253
Damn right! I'm so cold

1394
01:14:39,478 --> 01:14:41,290
I have to tell you sth

1395
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:42,731
What's that ?

1396
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:45,236
It wasn't Maël and De Perrefyte who
were fucking in the toillets

1397
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,022
I know, Maël to me in the bus

1398
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:49,539
Oh yeah ?

1399
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:51,932
And you, how do you know?

1400
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,314
Well, it was me

1401
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:55,753
It was you ?

1402
01:14:55,754 --> 01:14:56,578
Hmm

1403
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,652
It was you ?
But with who ?

1404
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:01,220
With Paul-Henri.

1405
01:15:01,437 --> 01:15:03,997
You fucked things up
you realize that ?

1406
01:15:04,261 --> 01:15:06,037
With Paul-Henri, nonetheless

1407
01:15:07,427 --> 01:15:09,073
Shit!
With Paul-Henri

1408
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:11,802
I'm sorry
I fucked things up

1409
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:14,405
I am sorry for you

1410
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,705
What do you do again ?

1411
01:16:56,184 --> 01:16:57,434
I'm a cop

1412
01:16:59,613 --> 01:17:00,863
oh ?

1413
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:02,947
narcotics

1414
01:17:03,259 --> 01:17:05,594
You're a narc ? really ?

1415
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:07,723
I'm used to it, don't worry.

1416
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:09,204
No no..

1417
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:10,288
It's all right

1418
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:11,331
Breathe

1419
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:12,671
You seem more anxious suddently

1420
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,451
No no, but it's..

1421
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:17,783
And is it a good job ?

1422
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:20,393
What a coward

1423
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,850
No big deal you know

1424
01:17:26,912 --> 01:17:28,333
-hum ?
-I didn't know

1425
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,602
-What ?

1426
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,853
That he was a...

1427
01:17:30,978 --> 01:17:32,941
What did you think I was...

1428
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,261
I don't know really...

1429
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:36,322
No seriously you don't look like..

1430
01:17:36,546 --> 01:17:39,885
..a cop
-Come on, he's not wearing the hat

1431
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:57,935
I fell like I'm in a movie

1432
01:17:57,935 --> 01:17:58,503
Shhh!

1433
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:01,194
Don't make any noise
Come on let's go

1434
01:18:37,997 --> 01:18:39,248
You're a genius

1435
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:41,730
Move

1436
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,233
Thanks man, you're the best

1437
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,554
Go fuck yourself!

1438
01:19:30,555 --> 01:19:31,805
All right

1439
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:39,519
It's weird here

1440
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,769
The decoration is so weird

1441
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:42,660
yeah

1442
01:19:43,573 --> 01:19:44,823
They're nice

1443
01:19:44,962 --> 01:19:46,562
Sure they are

1444
01:19:47,132 --> 01:19:49,951
-You think she believed us ?
-Don't think so

1445
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:52,418
"She's deaf and mute"

1446
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:56,322
Can I ask you a favor ?

1447
01:19:56,594 --> 01:20:00,209
Could you keep my guitar, back in Paris ?

1448
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,460
You the only one I trust

1449
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:03,441
No problem

1450
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,381
Why does it always go bad in Paris

1451
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:15,557
I don't know, Everything's complicated in Paris

1452
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:26,310
-Maël ?
-What is it ?

1453
01:20:26,538 --> 01:20:27,788
I have to tell you sth

1454
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:29,539
What is it ?

1455
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,390
Well...

1456
01:20:32,354 --> 01:20:33,905
It's the first time

1457
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,369
It's the first time...

1458
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:51,135
.. that I make love to another man than my husband

1459
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:53,958
shhh...

1460
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:39,004
I hope it won't be that cold in Paris

1461
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:07,778
<i>I'll have to tell Charlotte

1462
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:11,425
<i>..that love with man we love
must be different

1463
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:15,983
<i>maybe not better,especially when
we don't know it's only for one night

1464
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:19,845
<i>but it feels so great
that it ends up hurting

1465
01:22:20,112 --> 01:22:22,447
<i>I don't how one survives to that

1466
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:25,359
<i>no, honestly I don't know

1467
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,958
THIRD TRIMESTER

1468
01:22:29,096 --> 01:22:30,648
-They're here
-Anxious ?

1469
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:31,673
yeah

1470
01:22:31,674 --> 01:22:35,443
If he kisses you on the lips, he takes repsonsability
If he doesn't, it's over

1471
01:22:35,562 --> 01:22:37,114
-Hi
-How you doing ?

1472
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:39,414
-How you doing ?
-Fine, you ?

1473
01:22:39,643 --> 01:22:41,110
-Fine
-Everything went fine ?

1474
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:44,671
Why didn't you kiss me ?
you're ambarassed?

1475
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:46,666
-No no
-I thought...

1476
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,215
It's not that I don't love you

1477
01:22:50,664 --> 01:22:51,914
but it's hard to show it
in front of Arthur.

1478
01:22:52,064 --> 01:22:53,315
You understand ?

1479
01:22:53,465 --> 01:22:54,715
Yes.

1480
01:22:57,665 --> 01:22:58,915
For real ?

1481
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:01,814
No.

1482
01:23:09,716 --> 01:23:11,623
-Hey
-How you doing sweetheart?

1483
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,751
Fine

1484
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:16,743
So! You didn't tell me

1485
01:23:16,922 --> 01:23:18,172
tell you what ?

1486
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:19,474
Well, England!

1487
01:23:19,655 --> 01:23:21,598
Oh! It went very well

1488
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,290
What did you do ?

1489
01:23:23,562 --> 01:23:26,451
We visited... Nothing special really

1490
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:27,801
And you ?

1491
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:29,158
me ?

1492
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,409
What did you do ?

1493
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:33,581
Nothing... nothing
Nothing special either

1494
01:23:33,804 --> 01:23:35,189
all right

1495
01:23:36,843 --> 01:23:39,909
I do what's worse to do, betraye secrets!

1496
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,344
It's hard to live with it

1497
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:44,000
Tell her!

1498
01:23:44,175 --> 01:23:45,303
What ?

1499
01:23:45,304 --> 01:23:46,519
Everything

1500
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,156
That you found her diary, that you read everything

1501
01:23:50,641 --> 01:23:52,941
No way, she'll never forgive me!

1502
01:23:53,204 --> 01:23:55,063
hmmm

1503
01:24:00,928 --> 01:24:02,313
take it, take it!

1504
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:09,598
Hey!

1505
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:13,855
-Hello, mam
-'lo

1506
01:24:14,122 --> 01:24:15,803
-see ya
-see ya, Lola.

1507
01:24:18,157 --> 01:24:19,770
You saw how you said hello to her ?

1508
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,933
What do you mean ?

1509
01:24:20,934 --> 01:24:22,863
Cold as ice like "hello".

1510
01:24:23,582 --> 01:24:26,745
I'm not thrilled that you hang out with this girl

1511
01:24:27,009 --> 01:24:28,911
She's my best friend.

1512
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:30,133
I hand out with whoever I want to!

1513
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:31,220
It's my life!

1514
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:32,261
I'm sorry ?

1515
01:24:32,262 --> 01:24:33,814
It's my life

1516
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,244
You're my daughter, and you're not
18 yet, and there's a few things..

1517
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:41,498
..that I don't accept, you feel me ?

1518
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:42,372
And what might that be ?

1519
01:24:42,373 --> 01:24:44,672
That you're screwing up your life!

1520
01:24:44,934 --> 01:24:46,061
Not at all!

1521
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:48,964
You smoke joints, you get drunk,
you sleep with whoever is there...

1522
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,650
and you're not screwing up your life ???

1523
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:53,022
Bullshit! Where'd you get that from ?

1524
01:24:53,223 --> 01:24:54,609
I know everything, Lola!

1525
01:24:54,831 --> 01:24:55,739
What ?

1526
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:59,034
And stop acting like I'm a fool!
Like your father does

1527
01:24:59,256 --> 01:25:03,024
-You're so lame to say that
-I... I've read your diary!

1528
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:04,499
You what ?

1529
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:05,975
I didn't do it on purpose

1530
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,320
Stop it! I's hidden!

1531
01:25:08,543 --> 01:25:10,485
At least, we know what we're talking about

1532
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:14,440
You don't need to know about my life.
That's my private life

1533
01:25:14,662 --> 01:25:16,130
Don't try to be part of it

1534
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:18,947
Fuck I'm tired of this
You have no rights

1535
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,605
You're really a bitch!

1536
01:25:22,821 --> 01:25:26,327
You could write this one down on your diary!
Idiot!

1537
01:25:28,984 --> 01:25:30,584
-Lola!
-Mum!

1538
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:32,057
Lola!

1539
01:25:32,283 --> 01:25:33,533
Lola!

1540
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:38,089
Not enough men around here

1541
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:39,959
What about me ?

1542
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,958
Oh sweetheart...

1543
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,223
Open up right now

1544
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,287
It's my room

1545
01:25:45,288 --> 01:25:46,970
Even that you can't respect

1546
01:25:47,299 --> 01:25:49,019
We need to talk

1547
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:50,335
Never again

1548
01:25:50,336 --> 01:25:52,278
Go fuck yourself!

1549
01:25:52,506 --> 01:25:55,753
You have no idea what you'll get when...

1550
01:25:55,978 --> 01:25:57,660
I don't even tell you

1551
01:25:58,451 --> 01:26:00,181
Where you going ?
-To my father's

1552
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,181
You dreamnt about this. Is it a problem ?

1553
01:26:02,445 --> 01:26:03,960
Not a problem at all!

1554
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,560
I can even take you there

1555
01:26:06,783 --> 01:26:08,775
No need for that!
See you everybody!

1556
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:19,323
Where R U ?

1557
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:23,022
At my father's...

1558
01:26:25,836 --> 01:26:27,874
I add garlic to the sauce

1559
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:28,135
hmmm No

1560
01:26:28,136 --> 01:26:30,340
Huh... yes I add garlic to the sauce

1561
01:26:31,339 --> 01:26:33,739
I got into a fight with my mother!

1562
01:26:41,638 --> 01:26:43,738
And still your mother ain't like mine!

1563
01:26:47,058 --> 01:26:48,836
Charlotte!

1564
01:26:52,786 --> 01:26:54,599
Dinner's ready!

1565
01:26:54,783 --> 01:26:56,251
yes, I'm comin'

1566
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,449
Ready for a "tongue lesson" ??

1567
01:27:04,537 --> 01:27:06,478
So the image of the triangle J.F.K

1568
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,404
..by the translation of vector I.D

1569
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:11,700
..is the triangle E.F.J..

1570
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,485
..or E.A.F.?

1571
01:27:14,227 --> 01:27:15,477
I'm sorry ?

1572
01:27:16,396 --> 01:27:18,776
You know what a vector is ?

1573
01:27:19,043 --> 01:27:21,376
Yeah! a dvd 'vector'
(French joke: 'vecteur' (vector) is close to 'lecteur' (player))

1574
01:27:21,376 --> 01:27:26,370
-OK
(French joke: 'vecteur' (vector) is close to 'lecteur' (player))

1575
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:50,369
and where are you going ?

1576
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:54,627
hum... Well...
to the bathroom...

1577
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,490
With your shoes ?

1578
01:27:56,757 --> 01:28:00,264
Well some people read magazines
I like to have my shoes...

1579
01:28:00,532 --> 01:28:01,371
Stop it!

1580
01:28:01,372 --> 01:28:03,237
You see this door ?

1581
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:05,538
Brand new technology!

1582
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,428
-The same museums use
-Museums ?

1583
01:28:08,604 --> 01:28:11,636
You get close to it, the laser detects
what you're

1584
01:28:11,816 --> 01:28:13,983
trying to get out and the alarm turns on

1585
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,632
And.. you're punished

1586
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:19,358
I didn't want to get out,
just go to the bathroom

1587
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,696
Be careful!
You don't want it to turn on again!

1588
01:28:22,969 --> 01:28:25,090
Calm down, François!

1589
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:26,699
-Understood ?
-Yes

1590
01:28:26,919 --> 01:28:29,122
-Yes, who ?
-Yes dad

1591
01:28:29,653 --> 01:28:31,856
You goin to sleep my love ?

1592
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:33,154
See you tomorow

1593
01:28:33,155 --> 01:28:34,672
Good night

1594
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:36,240
Come to bed

1595
01:28:36,466 --> 01:28:39,890
Why don't you say "my love" to me too ?

1596
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:44,005
You'll see that by many aspects
that pig, or pork

1597
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:47,006
..shares many similarities with human.

1598
01:28:47,006 --> 01:28:48,825
For once we agree on sth..

1599
01:28:49,226 --> 01:28:53,124
-Mrs Clavel,
We don't need your comments, thank you.

1600
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:55,380
The valve

1601
01:28:55,475 --> 01:29:00,414
It's the most important part of the heart
that we're gonna study

1602
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,629
What's a valve ?

1603
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:04,539
Mr. Reynal?

1604
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,050
Isn't it like a vulva ?

1605
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,618
Epic

1606
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:11,010
..Mr. Reynal. Epic.

1607
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:14,700
Take your scalpel
and cut in a smooth

1608
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,385
..and frank way.

1609
01:29:16,385 --> 01:29:17,793
No way I'm touching that

1610
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:19,822
Let's get started

1611
01:29:19,823 --> 01:29:22,380
Hmmm...

1612
01:29:22,598 --> 01:29:24,151
Damn I like doing this

1613
01:29:24,379 --> 01:29:25,629
Freak!

1614
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:28,066
It's disgusting.
How many pigs

1615
01:29:28,328 --> 01:29:29,928
..did we kill for this class ?

1616
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:31,797
What's Greenpeace doing ?

1617
01:29:31,973 --> 01:29:34,875
The same thing they do for all
the wales they killed for you to wear

1618
01:29:34,935 --> 01:29:36,556
..this make-up only a whore would wear.

1619
01:29:37,484 --> 01:29:38,694
Stop saying women

1620
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:39,945
..are whores

1621
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:41,737
Honestly

1622
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:42,777
Thanks

1623
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:44,639
Straigh from the heart

1624
01:29:44,863 --> 01:29:46,113
How we doing over there ?

1625
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:48,505
A rabbit foot!

1626
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:49,932
That's harsh sir!

1627
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:51,971
no it's not!

1628
01:29:52,718 --> 01:29:55,099
You're not happy ? you can leave

1629
01:29:55,365 --> 01:29:57,402
We were right to get the fuck out

1630
01:29:57,664 --> 01:30:00,046
-"I don't touch pork" . You killed me

1631
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:03,001
Fuck you guys, with your religions
I was enjoying

1632
01:30:03,221 --> 01:30:04,471
Serial killer!

1633
01:30:04,523 --> 01:30:05,693
Give me a break!

1634
01:30:05,694 --> 01:30:07,636
oh no

1635
01:30:07,865 --> 01:30:09,464
Oh no, fuck!

1636
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:13,177
Before I even get here, you can all
take out your "teachers-to-parents note"
(French concept)

1637
01:30:13,246 --> 01:30:15,161
I don't have it

1638
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,725
We'll save some time

1639
01:30:17,325 --> 01:30:19,754
-What do we do ?
-Well... we'll see.

1640
01:30:19,972 --> 01:30:22,829
-It's because of her
-it'll be detention

1641
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:26,821
No more subway and the fresh air of Paris.

1642
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:30,554
I don't wanna go to boarding school
and leave the band

1643
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:34,540
I'm fuckin with you but
I'll miss all this. What d'ya think ?

1644
01:30:35,422 --> 01:30:37,625
Don't worry, I won't go

1645
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:40,583
Crying time!
the 2 best friends

1646
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,053
..on the balcony

1647
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:45,704
But for you and Lola, really
I don't give a fuck

1648
01:30:45,925 --> 01:30:47,311
You knew?

1649
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:48,781
well...

1650
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:50,306
You don't give a shit ?

1651
01:30:50,525 --> 01:30:54,553
I'm pleased.
I'm pleased more than anything else.

1652
01:30:54,778 --> 01:30:55,991
thanks dude

1653
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:57,853
Still don't abuse it,

1654
01:30:59,595 --> 01:31:02,283
Vanilla, I love it, but caramel not so much

1655
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:05,498
hmm. It's the contrary for me

1656
01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:07,621
I prefer caramel

1657
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,307
It's complicated huh ?

1658
01:31:13,526 --> 01:31:16,429
Yeah, complicated

1659
01:32:13,065 --> 01:32:14,464
It's mum, I miss you sweetheart!

1660
01:32:29,663 --> 01:32:31,762
And I'm so sorry I read your diary...

1661
01:32:35,288 --> 01:32:36,538
baby...

1662
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:41,401
For the Emerganza festival
11th district, as usual

1663
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:43,567
I didn't find it

1664
01:32:43,797 --> 01:32:46,569
Buy a map of the subway and fuckin eat it

1665
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:50,076
My father won't let me go out

1666
01:32:50,349 --> 01:32:52,778
-I thought you dealt with that
-I'm sorry

1667
01:32:52,996 --> 01:32:54,123
That's too bad

1668
01:32:54,124 --> 01:32:55,374
The same for me

1669
01:32:55,556 --> 01:32:57,334
Same shit for me

1670
01:32:57,597 --> 01:33:00,583
We won't have to cancel ?!

1671
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:02,489
I have a plan

1672
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,010
For real ?

1673
01:33:04,064 --> 01:33:05,840
I think I can pull it off

1674
01:33:06,059 --> 01:33:07,187
Lola!!

1675
01:33:07,188 --> 01:33:08,965
My Lou!

1676
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:11,087
-I missed you!
-Lola!

1677
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:13,952
I'm so happy to see you!

1678
01:33:14,217 --> 01:33:16,077
-My baby my baby
-Mum

1679
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:18,505
-I missed you
-Me too!

1680
01:33:18,777 --> 01:33:20,719
Lola's here

1681
01:33:21,772 --> 01:33:23,938
-Let me see you
-Have I changed ?

1682
01:33:24,156 --> 01:33:27,403
-I don't like it when you're not there
-me neither

1683
01:33:27,628 --> 01:33:29,927
-My little love
-We'll never leave each other

1684
01:33:32,011 --> 01:33:33,272
It feels so good

1685
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:34,094
Mum ?

1686
01:33:34,095 --> 01:33:36,098
Can I ask you sth ?

1687
01:33:36,098 --> 01:33:37,348
Already ?

1688
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:40,595
You're the best mum we ask that.

1689
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:41,992
Who's that "we" ?

1690
01:33:41,994 --> 01:33:44,082
-Well...

1691
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:44,901
Hello

1692
01:33:44,902 --> 01:33:46,502
-Hello
-Hello

1693
01:33:47,634 --> 01:33:48,884
Hello

1694
01:33:56,402 --> 01:33:58,737
He's not alone I can see..

1695
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:06,938
Maël?

1696
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:19,392
What an idiot!

1697
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:47,736
10 bucks

1698
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:24,584
-Maël!
-Maël!

1699
01:35:55,749 --> 01:35:57,265
Thanks a lot.

1700
01:35:57,484 --> 01:36:01,334
To someone who I really love...

1701
01:38:14,016 --> 01:38:15,272
Mum ?

1702
01:38:21,015 --> 01:38:25,271
Inspired by a true story...
