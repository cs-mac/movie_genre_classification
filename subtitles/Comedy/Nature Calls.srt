Are we supposed
to have scouts now?

Mikey, we just need to chat, okay?

7
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,558
Now, usually, we'd talk to you
like men should talk to a little boy,

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,462
but, today, we're gonna talk
like we're all men.

we talk about in here,

nobody's gonna cry, okay?
Agree?

Why would we cry?

Sometimes you don't see a thing
coming till it hits ya.

14
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,607
Then it goes in your ears,
it goes into your heart,

15
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,410
and you can feel it hurting
all the way down.

16

I mean, Mikey, you can feel it
hurting all the way down

to your little butt crack, you feel it.

18

It's like a punch
to your insides, man.

19

And you're not expecting this.

20

It's like a sucker punch.
Waah!

that we can depend on.

my dad's been sick for a long time,

around forever.

had time to think about this, but,

you know, our dads...

00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,454
Your dad loves you, man,
no matter what,

and no matter
where he might be.

RANDY:
Even if he goes away.

34
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,492
- Goes away forever.
- Forever?

35
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,336
Is he okay?

36
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,502
What? Wait.

37
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,142
Is he dead?

This is the sucker punch
that I was talking about.

What is the matter with you?

wouldn't you?

No, thank you. We're scouts,

so we will take
our business elsewhere.

There's a guy dying in the woods.
Now what do we do?

There's a guy bleeding to death

What do you do?

Stop the blood?
Stop the bleeding.

Yes, okay.
Now, think, think. What else?

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,178
Is he in shock?
Is he breathing?

There. Yeah. Okay. Perfect.

Well, what part of lifesaving
isn't scary?

I didn't think it was lifesaving.

803

I thought it was murder.

Murder? Eddie?

Stuart can't hike.

Yeah, man, you know what?

815
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,931
Maybe we should have stuck
with the broken leg exercise.

Okay. Yes.

Leonard!

1559
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,035
What did they do to you?

1560
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:35,642
Mom, it's okay. It's just tits.

1561
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:36,902
Leonard!

1562
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,545
Whoa!

1563
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,375
Ooh! Look at you!

1564
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,312
Smell it! I made testosterone!

1565
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,043
Oh, yes!

1566
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,983
Then you saw one
of his organs coming out,

1567
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:48,884
and then over there
you saw his heart pumping out.

1568
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,389
It was still beating,
it was like bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

1569
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,720
And then, after that,
you saw all the blood squirting,

1570
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:54,725
and you couldn't even see the fireworks

1571
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,158
because all the blood was like...
[mimics blood splashing]

1572
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:58,299
You just saw its insides,
and there was some black thing.

1573
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,455
It was like the game that I have.

1574
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,466
Hey, buddy,
be careful with that. Okay?

1575
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,627
Can I ask you a question?

1576
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,933
What were you thinking?

1577
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:07,938
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1578
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,804
Those women look like
they could have killed you.

1579
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:11,775
Yeah.

1580
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,607
I hate those women.

1581
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,340
They scare the shit out of me.

1582
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,952
But at least it worked out
for your father.

1583
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,522
Where is your father?

1584
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,192
Dwande?

1585
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,630
This guy did something
beautiful, baby.

1586
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:39,266
Dwande, you can do
whatever you want, okay?

1587
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:43,167
If you want to be a basketball player
or a dentist

1588
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,438
or a nightclub singer,
I don't give a crap.

1589
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,117
I'm just your dumb daddy,
and I love you.

1590
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:52,609
You can do whatever you want.

1591
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,661
Well, we don't have
to make the decision right now, uh...

1592
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,993
Let's not rush into anything.

1593
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,066
. Hey, Kirk! Ow'
' Ow! I

1594
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:09,225
Aah ha!

1595
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:10,837
Janine, please watch it.

1596
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:15,305
Oh, whoa, brother!
You look like a bag of shit, man!

1597
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,068
You're all burnt up!

1598
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:20,373
I'll be honest, I don't even think
plastic surgery's gonna help you.

1599
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,375
You need medical attention.

1600
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,644
And you probably ought to give
your family a little attention,

1601
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:26,980
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1602
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:29,917
Hey, it's probably a bad time,

1603
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,026
but I'm gonna go ahead
and put in my two weeks notice.

1604
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,859
I'm sorry.
I love ATM security, I do.

1605
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,190
You know I'm the best,

1606
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,333
but I just feel like
I need something more.

1607
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,766
And Caldwell,
he needs a babysitter,

1608
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,426
so, you know,
I'm great with kids.

1609
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:46,699
Probably the best,
and that's a natural fit.

1610
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:48,733
I hope you guys understand.

1611
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:50,377
And I hope you live.

1612
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,213
Anyway. Hey, Dwande,
do me a favor, bury that, all right?

1613
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,372
Thank you.

1614
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,610
Caldwell, I got shotgun, brah!

1615
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,552
- Dad.
- Yeah?

1616
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,054
We should go home.

1617
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,719
JANINE: Yeah. Let's get out of here.

1618
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,056
KIRK: Okay. Help Dad up.
