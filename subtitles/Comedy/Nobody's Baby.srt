<i>Mr. Beauregard!</i>

3
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,800
We have an answer for you
from New Orleans.

4
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
What 'd they say?

5
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,600
"Sundowner sails at 21st.
Stop.

6
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,500
Destination Europe.
Stop. Reservation...

7
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,700
confirmed. Stop.
Request deposit 5OO dollars. Stop."

8
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,900
- Hey! What about the 5OO dollars?
- Don't worry.

9
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,600
The important thing is
there's a ship.

10
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,600
Hey!

11
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
1O dollars!

12
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,400
How'd he do it, Pa?
I know he had one shot!

13
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,800
It 's a question of speed, son.

14
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Pa, ain't nobody faster than him?

15
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Faster than him?

16
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
Nobody.

17
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Red!

18
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
Too late to meet you.

19
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Who did it?

20
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
You did...

21
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,600
when you first started
looking for me.

22
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
Where's Nevada?

23
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,900
Hold up in Acoma.

24
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
He ain't about to move from there.

25
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,600
What were you doing here?
Who shot you?

26
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
- Go...
- Where?

27
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
You go screw yourself.

28
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
You and you alone...

29
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,800
was responsible to me and
my men for making the gold legal.

30
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Instead, Sullivan, you chase
after your own personal affairs!

31
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,500
You're leaving a trail of dead bodies
all the way across the state!

32
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,200
A trail that leads straight here.

33
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,000
- Jack Beauregard.
- Yeah.

34
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
We pay you 'cause
you're respectable.

35
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
A gentleman!

36
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Bought a worked out gold mine
and discovered a new vein.

37
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,500
But any suspicion that falls on you,
falls on the gold.

38
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
What are you afraid of?

39
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,400
You got everyone exactly
where you want them.

40
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,800
I've reached out the truth
from the rooftops.

41
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,100
I could bring the sheriff
in here and say:

42
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,700
"Look, if we didn't add
that stolen gold of yore...

43
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,100
this mine would
only produce rocks!"

44
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,600
I could even show them
and nobody would believe me.

45
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,500
- And they'd all be blind and deaf.
- But not dumb!

46
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
There's talk going around,
Sullivan.

47
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Talk has a way of getting into places
where there ain't no fear.

48
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
The ore that
comes out of this mine...

49
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,700
has got to be refined legally!

50
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
You keep your hands clean,
Sullivan.

51
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,800
But if I don't kill Beauregard first,
he'll kill me.

52
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
That 's right.

53
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Two things go straight to a
man's heart: bullets and gold.

54
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,700
You're telling me
to buy Jack Beauregard?

55
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
Why not?

56
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
We bought you.

57
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Buy him or kill him!
But do it fast.

58
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
Do you hear me?
Fast!

59
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,600
Hey! Load up 2O
of them horseshoes.

60
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,100
- Is it going to take much longer?
- Nearly that.

61
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,600
You got nothing but junk here.
Look at this.

62
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,500
Who's gonna buy this?

63
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
And this?

64
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Even a broken shoe.

65
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,900
Hey! You!

66
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Hey, where'd he come from?

67
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,900
What are you doing in there?

68
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,800
- Sleeping.
- This ain't no hotel.

69
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
- What are you looking for?
- A horse.

70
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,300
Hey, make him pay first!

71
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,200
Why?

72
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,500
'Cause you don't look like you're
gonna live long enough to get credit.

73
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Where are you going?

74
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,700
The secret of a long life
is to try not to shorten it.

75
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,200
Hey! Hold on there!

76
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,800
- Maybe I can get you a horse.
- Honest?

77
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sure. But first you got
to do me a little favor.

78
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Come here.

79
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
Gimme here!

80
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,400
There's a pal of mine
over there in that saloon.

81
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,800
You take him this basket. When
you get back, I'll find you a horse.

82
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,900
This pal of yours is
Jack Beauregard, huh?

83
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,900
A bargain is a bargain.

84
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,100
- A horse, huh?
- Sure, son.

85
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
The best.

86
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,000
I smell beans and bacon, Bonita.

87
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
That 's right. They're for
the three men out there.

88
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,200
Better let me have it. I don't think
they'll be hungry much longer.

89
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Is the ship still there?

90
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,200
"Sailing takes 16 days.
Stop.

91
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Must have 5OO dollars
to confirm reservation. Stop."

92
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,900
What should I tell
New Orleans, mister?

93
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,500
There's still 16 days.

94
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,000
16 days ain't very long.
Even for someone like you.

95
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,400
If you go away,
who's gonna be left?

96
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,900
Nobody.

97
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,500
Maybe so, but a man's
gotta quit sometime.

98
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Sometime.

99
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,900
But someone like you
gotta go out with style.

100
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,900
You come here
just to tell me that?

101
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Oh, no.

102
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,300
For me?

103
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,500
What 'd you think it 's in it?

104
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,900
I reckon it 's a bomb.

105
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,400
I reckon you're right.
Who sent it?

106
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,400
Three fellows out there.
Only three.

107
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,200
- Only?
- Yeah, like that time in El Paso.

108
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,100
5th of March, 1882.

109
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,300
Billy Mason...

110
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,800
John Murray...

111
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Fred Carson.

112
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
82 was one of your best years.
In April...

113
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,900
- Why'd you bring me this for?
- A horse.

114
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,000
Like I was saying, in April,
in Albuquerque...

115
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,000
four: Jackson,
Johnson, Murdoch...

116
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
and Champion.

117
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,100
How many horses do you
want to take it back?

118
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,000
None. My pleasure.

119
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,300
But it was in the fall
that you really scored.

120
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,900
September. Socorro.

121
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Five.

122
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Milton, Woolman, Firestone,
McDonald and Valence.

123
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,900
How come you know
so much about me?

124
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Everyone knows about
Jack Beauregard.

125
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,200
Only hope for law and order
in the West.

126
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,100
Son, let me give you
a little advice.

127
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
If you start admiring someone,
pretty soon you're envious...

128
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
so you start showing off,
taking chances.

129
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
Before you know it,
you're dead.

130
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,500
Well, it ain't good for some folks
to live too long.

131
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
And in Gila Blend,
how many did you get that time?

132
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,100
Six. Oh, no! Seven!

133
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,500
Counting that fellow that tried to gun
you when you were backwards to him.

134
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,400
He says he don't want it!

135
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,800
But you never got
15O all at once.

136
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,800
You know, since I was a boy
I always dreamed of you like that.

137
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
An immense open plain.

138
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
15O pure bred sons of bitches
on horseback...

139
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,500
and you facing them.
Alone.

140
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,200
Why only 15O?

141
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
The Wild Bunch.
They are only 15O. That 's why.

142
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,500
Yeah, 15O and shooting right
like there's thousands.

143
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,100
Who are you anyway?

144
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,300
- Who? Me? Nobody.
- Tell you what...

145
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,300
first you get to be somebody,
then you and me will surround them.

146
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,200
Yeah. Hey, that 's no good.
You got to face them alone!

147
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,100
You on one side,
and them on the other!

148
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,000
You won't need
to wash it this time!

149
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,300
What was in that basket?

150
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,900
Do you want a hand?

151
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,400
Hey, Jack!

152
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Jack, I've found a horse!
Wait!

153
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Turn around, you!

154
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,100
- You mean we gotta shoot it out?
- So you're Beauregard's friend?

155
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,900
I wish I was.
You know what they say?

156
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,400
He could draw his gun 3 times before
the other fellow even starts reaching.

157
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,500
Like this.

158
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,800
Well, if we gotta shoot it out,
I'm ready.

159
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,900
Well, just...

160
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,500
Hey, you gotta admit,
he did deliver the basket.

161
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, sure.

162
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,600
- But that son of...
- Beauregard. He didn't want it.

163
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,300
You're right!
Guess you won yourself a horse.

164
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Thanks, "amigo".
I'll take this one.

165
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
Help me!

166
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,600
"Arinauabecapicapa."

167
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,200
"Arinaua. Arinaua."

168
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
Blessed is the man who shares
his neighbor's burden.

169
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,500
Seen a white man around here?

170
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm looking for a white man.
Did you see him?

171
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Where is he?

172
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,600
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.
He's my brother.

173
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
What are you doing here?

174
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Praying.

175
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,100
- Good thing you are.
- Why?

176
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,100
'Cause you're always following me,
and I don't like it.

177
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,000
I got a lot of friends here.

178
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,800
Chief Broken Branch
died yesterday.

179
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,400
The priest got there in time,
but the Medicine men didn't.

180
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,200
What brings you here
among the ancients anyway?

181
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm looking for someone.

182
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,100
"Sam Peckinpah".

183
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,000
That 's a beautiful name
in Navajo.

184
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,200
- Friend or enemy?
- That 's my business.

185
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Listen to this one.

186
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,900
"Renapoknomoh".

187
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,900
- What 's his name?
- That 's his business.

188
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,100
"Nevada Kid".

189
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,500
You know where he is?

190
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,400
Must be down below.

191
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,200
It 's always the best
who are the first to go.

192
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,100
Which means you
ain't going nowhere.

193
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,800
Stay here with your
Indian friends for good.

194
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,800
What 's the matter, boy?
You gotta have a crowd watching?

195
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
You said you was nobody.

196
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,300
Here's your chance to make a name
for yourself on one of them.

197
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,400
Turn around!

198
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,100
Draw.

199
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,000
Let 's bring my personal
history up to date.

200
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,000
Today, June 3rd, 1899:
Nobody.

201
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,200
You're the kind that needs
an audience so you can show off.

202
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Four shots, one hole.
Just like the good old days.

203
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,100
There was never any
"good old days".

204
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,500
Tell me, what 's your game?

205
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
When I was a kid I used to make
believe I was Jack Beauregard.

206
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,700
And now that
you're all growed-up?

207
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm more cautious.
But sometimes running a little risk...

208
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,000
can bring bigger rewards,
you know?

209
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,200
If the risk is little,
the reward is little.

210
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,900
First Nevada... then Red.

211
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,200
- They even tried to get me twice.
- They'll try again.

212
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
What the hell are you up to?

213
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
You'll find out.

214
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
I see clear as crystal...

215
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,400
Jack Beauregard, standing alone,
facing the Wild Bunch.

216
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Just think of it. You'll be written up
in all the History books!

217
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,800
You'll be down on earth
reading them.

218
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,300
While I'm up there
playing on a harp.

219
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,600
You shine like a door
of a whorehouse.

220
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,700
A blind man can spot
you 1O miles off.

221
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,100
Well, I like folks to see me.

222
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,400
Maybe folks don't share
your pleasure.

223
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Thanks.

224
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,800
But I prefer my own. Lets the
air through. Charms the wits.

225
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,800
It 's just a matter of time before
someone's gonna shoot holes in yours!

226
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,000
Out of the way, shorty!

227
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,300
Or I'll crush you underfoot
like a flee!

228
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,600
You don't look so smart from up here.
I can't hardly see you!

229
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,600
You got the message?

230
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,600
See me better now?

231
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,000
I wish I'd never seen you!

232
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,200
Here's a go!
Anybody else?

233
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,900
Come on!
Anybody else wants to try?

234
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,900
I wanna try.

235
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
Have another try.

236
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,500
It 's like courting a woman, folks.

237
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,800
You give her the glad eye,
she gives you a black eye!

238
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You offer her a beefsteak,
she grinds your meat. Hurry, hurry!

239
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Come on out here and have a try!
Come on now, folks! Get ready!

240
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,900
He's all yours! If you're close
to him, he doesn't swing.

241
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,500
Use your skill to hit their heads!
Let 's see who gets the prize tonight!

242
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,600
He who scores five hits
will get the prize tonight!

243
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
Come on, folks!
Give them anything you want!

244
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,800
Three hits for only half a dollar!
Seven for only a dollar!

245
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And for the price of only two dollars,
I'll offer you six, I mean...

246
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,700
six ripe cantaloupes!
And when I say ripe, believe me...

247
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,400
...I mean ripe. Come on!
- Let me try it.

248
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Come on!
Move your arms now!

249
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,500
Come on, folks!
Give them what you want!

250
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Close it fast!
Let them thrown!

251
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,800
Come on!
Move your arms now!

252
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,100
Watch your aim!

253
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,200
Come on, everybody!
Give them everything you've got.

254
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,900
The fun of the game...

255
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
What did you say
the fun of the game is?

256
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,800
Son of a bitch!

257
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm gonna stay
as long as I like!

258
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,700
I got as much right
as anyone to be here!

259
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Sleep tight, grandpa!

260
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,100
You stinky-minding pokeheads!

261
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,900
One of these days, the worm is gonna
churn and nip you all right in the butt!

262
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,100
You tell your
stinking boss Sullivan!

263
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,400
Who the hell are you?

264
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,600
I'll take 3 on Squirrel!

265
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,400
Another 1O dollars on Squirrel.

266
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,900
Folks!

267
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
Bring them on on Squirrel!

268
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,200
He's a quick shot, folks,
but he can also miss!

269
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,900
Come on, now!
This could be your lucky chance!

270
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Hi.

271
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,300
Beer.

272
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,900
- How'd you like to play with this?
- Like that?

273
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,500
Hey, what 's the game?
Can I play too?

274
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,600
Sure.

275
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,100
Anyone can play.

276
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,100
If you can afford it,
if you can shoot...

277
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
and if you can drink.

278
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
Okay, I'll have a go.

279
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,700
- 1O... 2O.
- You know the rules:

280
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,400
you gotta hit the glass
before it hits the floor.

281
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,300
Come on, folks! Who'll take me on?
Place your bets.

282
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,000
Who'll take 2 to 1
on the stranger?

283
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,400
2 to 1! This is real special!
Any takers? Come on, folks!

284
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,500
Hey, Marshal!
Marshal, here!

285
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,100
Can I do with milk?

286
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,200
Okay, 5!
Come on, folks, 5 to 1!

287
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,200
Come on!
Who'll take me on?

288
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,900
Here's 6 for me, marshal!

289
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Lucky skunk!

290
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,300
That one got away.

291
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,800
Lucky bastard!

292
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,000
Come on now, 7 to 1!
Who'll take me on?

293
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,900
Lucky shit!

294
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,800
Hold it!

295
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,700
The game is over.

296
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,700
- Lucky...
- That he wasn't aiming at you.

297
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,600
Here you are. 2OO.

298
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,800
Give me a whisky.
These games sure make a man thirsty.

299
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,200
That evens
the score for glasses.

300
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,600
Now let 's try pistols.

301
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,800
These upside down pistols
of yours really worry me.

302
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,600
Fellows that carry them
like that are bad men.

303
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Clown.

304
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,300
- Now you can't miss.
- Smart aleck.

305
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,700
Those like you never
seem to catch on.

306
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,800
It 's actually very simple.

307
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,500
Now pay attention.

308
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,900
Have you?

309
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,400
We play for higher
stakes up here.

310
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,500
Look who's talking to you.

311
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,400
Why don't you join us?

312
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,100
It ain't nice to shoot
a man in the back.

313
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,600
Is it a game that two can play?

314
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,200
If you know the rules.

315
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,200
For me, every game
has the same rule.

316
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,700
Play to win.

317
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,000
The whole town's gotta
see this game.

318
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,600
Big audience, big take.

319
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,700
Two thousand.

320
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,000
Who's gonna lose this hand?

323
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,600
Loser will be here
tomorrow morning.

324
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,400
Name's Jack Beauregard.

325
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,000
That 's a name to reckon with.

326
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,100
How much do you reckon?

327
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,400
Five hundred?

328
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,600
A thousand more, perhaps.

329
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,100
I reckon I may never spend it.
Why Jack Beauregard?

330
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,700
Will this do for an answer?

331
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:15,300
You paid for a front row seat.
Don't miss the show.

332
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,700
I won't.

333
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,100
Hey!

334
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,200
That 's only three shots.
You still got one to go.

335
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,600
The next one might hit
a couple of inches lower.

336
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,900
Your life is hanging by a thread,
Mr. Beauregard.

337
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,800
Looks like you finally got your
audience, so I guess we can...

338
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,400
...wind up this little story.
- It 's an old story for you.

339
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,200
January '86. Madison.
Same situation, remember?

340
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,000
Except I was facing
three bastards that day.

341
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,300
Exactly.

342
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,400
Seems like that hole was just
aching for another bullet.

343
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,700
Remember, boys,
when the spirit is willing...

344
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,500
the flesh has the strength of ten.

345
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,800
- Can I send a telegram?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,700
It will cost you 25 cents a word.

347
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,900
Maritime Company,
New Orleans.

348
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:49,700
Request confirmation reservation
Sundowner sailing 12 day. Stop.

349
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,100
5OO dollar deposit follow.
Stop.

Signed: Jack Beauregard.

351
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,400
Look who's back.

352
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,300
What are you holding
that up there for?

353
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,100
Idiots!

354
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,700
You go catch those two.

355
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,700
He's gone into the corner room.

356
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,300
Come on. Quiet.

357
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Up there.
I guess he's asleep.

358
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,400
I heard him
setting his alarm clock.

359
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,400
Well, this'll awake him
quicker than any alarm.

360
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,300
He must be right up there.

361
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,700
I'll go.

362
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,000
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

363
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
- He must be on the other side.
- I'm here.

364
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,900
- Break a mirror is bad luck.
- Give me a match.

365
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,800
Light it.

366
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,900
Well, it only last one minute.

367
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,800
Light it!

368
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Don't... don't you think
I ought to get down?

369
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,000
People go around wasting days
and weeks and years...

370
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:28,000
and all of a sudden
there's only 3O seconds to go.

371
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,100
No! Wait!
I got stuck in!

372
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,300
It stopped.

373
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
It happens to everyone,
sooner or later.

374
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,400
Don John, where are you?

375
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,600
I'm here.

376
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,900
Me too.

377
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,900
Wait! Bang!

378
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,100
Thank you, man.

379
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,500
- It 's real funny!
- Nothing funny about death.

380
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,200
Shut up!

381
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,300
There are eight of them!

382
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,900
- Look!
- What a lot of nobody!

383
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,600
Reflection is one and all.
But in truth there's only one.

384
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,000
- Guess which is that son of a gun.
- The third one!

385
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,800
You really are slippin'.
Hold this.

386
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,600
Who? Me?

387
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
Yes, you!

388
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,500
- Well?
- Well...

389
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,600
Nevada and that other
sneak thief Wayne...

390
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,800
had pulled me out.

391
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,200
For 2OO dollars!

392
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:52,000
My part was all I had. My share
of the mine for 2OO stinking dollars!

393
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,200
And then the bank shifted.

394
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,800
I got so mad it gave me asthma!

395
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,900
That 's the way I'm forced to live now.
I have to breath this shit!

396
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,700
I don't want to talk no more
about that stinking business.

397
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,300
Ain't no use in persisting!

398
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,000
If you want to persist...

399
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,500
you'll have to persist harder!

400
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,200
It was Red himself who told me.

401
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,200
The whole story.

402
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,200
That ain't no mine.
It 's just a hole in the ground.

403
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,600
Nobody ain't never gonna
find no gold in there.

404
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,000
That city sleeker.
That Sullivan...

405
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,900
he wants to buy it
for 6OO dollars.

406
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,000
And that ain't hay dough.

407
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,800
But he could live on
your share of it for a year.

408
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,300
That 's what they told me.

409
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,900
- Then what?
- The year run out...

410
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,900
the money run out,
and the liquor run out.

411
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,700
Here, this'll quench your thirst.

412
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,700
And cut to the point 'cause
I got no more dough either.

413
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,200
Damnation! That mine
began pouring out gold...

414
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,000
like the mine was made of it.

415
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,200
And I say I deserve a share.

416
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,000
At least enough
to keep me in liquor.

417
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,700
And what did
Red and Nevada do?

418
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,300
They ran off somewhere.
The dirty coyotes!

419
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:04,200
Red and Nevada are dead.
You can drink to their memory.

420
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,300
It 's like I said, he who lives by
the sword will get nipped in the butt.

421
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,200
No, no, no!
I surrender!

422
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,200
Next time, knock before
you come busting in.

423
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,200
Are you playing games?

424
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,200
There'd been a lot of guys
trying to kill me...

425
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,200
just so they can brag about it
for the rest of their lives.

426
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,200
You had your audience this morning
and you had your target.

427
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,300
That kind of opportunity
don't knock twice.

428
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,900
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

429
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,300
- It 's a dangerous game.
- Yeah.

430
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,400
It ain't easy to make balls spin.

431
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,700
But even if you do, sooner or later,
they're bound to wind up in the hole.

432
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,900
It 's gone in! It 's gone in!

433
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,800
Missed by a hair!

434
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,200
Fact is you saved my life today.

435
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,400
But I'd rather is my fault I got shot,
than your fault I didn't.

436
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,900
That 's a pile of
horse manure, son.

437
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,300
It 's better not to get shot
for nobody's fault.

438
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,600
Why did you blow in these balls?
I don't count.

439
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,600
- I wanted to let out some air.
- While you're letting out all that air...

440
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,300
suppose you tell me why you were
sitting in the street this morning.

441
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,000
I got tired of standing.

442
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,700
You keep turning your back to me.

443
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:04,200
Seems like you trust me too much,
or maybe you trust yourself too much.

444
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,800
You ever heard the story
about the little birdy?

445
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,600
My grandpa used to tell it to me.

446
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,100
When I was a boy, man didn't live
long enough to become grandpas.

447
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,300
It wasn't easy, son,
but it could be that.

448
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,900
See?

449
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,400
There was this little birdie
who didn't even know how to fly yet.

450
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,500
One freezing cold night, he tumbles out
of his nest, lands on the ground.

451
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,900
well, he starts going...

452
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,600
like crazy 'cause he's
damn nearly freezing!

453
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,100
Lucky for him.
Along comes this cow...

454
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,800
sees him, and feels
sorry for him. So...

455
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,900
she lifts her tail...

456
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,400
and... drops a steaming hot
cowpat right on him.

457
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,300
The little birdie is nice
and warm again...

458
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,400
but it still ain't happy
and keeps going...

459
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,100
Iouder than ever.

460
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,700
A mean old coyote hears him
and comes on running.

461
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,000
He reaches out a paw...

462
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,300
and pulls him out of the cow pie.

463
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,500
He brushes the dirt
on him real nice...

464
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,100
and then...

465
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,100
swallows the birdie down
in one gulp!

466
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,500
Grandpa said there was
a moral there...

467
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,200
but you have to figure it out
for yourself.

468
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,200
Bird...

469
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:56,000
coyote... cow pie... don't make
no sense to me, not at all.

470
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,200
You still believe in fairy tales.

471
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,800
Yeah.

472
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,600
For example...

473
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,600
this is a good guy
who's gotta avenge his brother.

474
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,600
And this is the bad guy...

475
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,500
who's gonna get killed because
he shot the good guy's brother.

476
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,300
- And this...
- Is my blue-eyed angel...

477
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,600
who protects me from harm.

478
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,400
That 's Nobody.

479
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,600
That leaves you and me
face to face.

480
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,700
No.

481
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,200
That leaves you alone...

482
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,300
against 15O.

483
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,200
You're sure trying hard
to make a hero out of me.

484
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,600
You're that already.
You just need a special act.

485
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,700
Something to make
your name a legend.

486
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:14,400
What I don't understand is:
what difference it makes to you?

487
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,400
A man who is a man needs
someone to believe in.

488
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,300
I've had all kinds in my life...

489
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,600
thieves and killers...

490
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,300
pimps and prostitutes...

491
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,700
con men and preachers.

492
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,900
Even a few fellows
that told the truth.

493
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,100
The kind of man
you're talking about, never.

494
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,300
Maybe you've never met them...

495
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:56,000
but hardly ever they're
the only ones who count.

496
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,700
Reckon this fellow's name
is Sullivan?

497
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,000
I reckon it is.

498
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,700
Hey! Hey!

499
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,600
He's taking Sullivan away!

500
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,600
But Sullivan is nothing.
It 's the Wild Bunch on the back of him.

501
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,700
We've got to warn that gent fella.

502
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,000
Don't you see?
If he kills Sullivan...

503
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,100
he'll have 15O blood thirsty
cutthroats on his tail!

504
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,700
He's gonna make
trouble for himself.

505
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:38,300
No, he's gonna make
a name for himself.

506
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,000
The way he's galloping,
he must be in a hurry to make it.

507
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,500
If you kill me, the Wild Bunch will
know that you're on to their game.

508
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,400
They told me,
kill him or buy him.

509
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,700
I wouldn't have tried,
unless it was my last chance.

510
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,100
You know what Nevada was like.
We had a little agreement...

511
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,600
him, Red and me,
for an extra share between us.

512
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,500
But you know even better than
me how he hated sharing anything.

513
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,500
And he deserved the bullet he got.
Red did it.

514
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,800
But I kept his share.

515
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,700
And it 's yours now.
Take all you want.

516
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,700
You can live like a king
for 1OO years.

517
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,200
I don't intend to get that old.

518
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,600
I only need 5OO.

519
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,600
Is there a telegraph
office in town?

520
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,700
- How do I get a train for New Orleans?
- Follow the tracks east of Kimble.

521
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,700
There is a train
from there every Friday.

522
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Disappointed?

523
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,700
Yep.

524
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,200
I thought I could count
on your brotherly feeling.

525
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,600
Beats me how kids like you think
if a man's older than you...

526
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,500
he goes along with old
fashioned notions like...

527
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,400
like "blood is
thicker than water".

528
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,000
Sure Nevada was my brother...

529
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,500
but he was a grade A skunk
who shot people in the back.

530
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,400
And what 's more,
he stole 1O thousand dollars off me.

531
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,300
I ain't risking my life
to avenge him.

532
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,300
My, my! How modern
the old folks are becoming!

533
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,600
But a hero can't run away
from his destiny.

534
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,900
My destiny is to get
the hell out of here.

535
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,700
I've got an appointment with a ship
that 's sailing for Europe.

536
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,100
Sometimes you run smack
into your destiny...

537
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,500
on the very road you take
to get away from it.

538
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,800
If you're still thinking
about the Wild Bunch, forget it.

539
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I ain't taking them on.

540
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,100
You will, Jack.
You will.

541
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,900
Put it over there.

542
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,300
Hold it!

543
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,300
- Where is it going?
- Use your eyes, man.

544
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,700
Ain't it certain?

545
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,200
But...

546
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,200
who's driving it? Who?

547
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,000
They've stolen the train!

548
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,400
<i>There's only 150 of them...</i>

549
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,800
<i>but they rlde llke</i>
<i>they were thousands.</i>

550
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,700
<i>A man's gotta quit sometlme.</i>

551
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:58,200
<i>But someone llke you</i>
<i>has gotta go out with style.</i>

552
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,500
<i>Just thlnk of it.</i>

553
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:45,800
<i>150 pure bred sons of bitches</i>
<i>on horseback...</i>

554
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,800
<i>and you faclng them.</i>
<i>Alone.</i>

555
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,500
<i>You'll be written up</i>
<i>In all Hlstory books.</i>

556
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,600
<i>And you'll be down</i>
<i>on earth readlng them.</i>

557
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,900
<i>Whlle I'm under it</i>,
<i>In my grave.</i>

558
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,800
<i>You shlne llke a door</i>
<i>of a whorehouse.</i>

559
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
<i>I llke folks to see me.</i>

560
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,400
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

561
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,800
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

562
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,400
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

563
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,300
<i>You'll end In Hlstory.</i>

564
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,500
<i>You'll end In Hlstory!</i>

565
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,600
Well...

566
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,500
now you got me
in the History books...

567
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:21,200
...how do I quit?
- There's only one way.

568
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,000
How's that?

569
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,900
You gotta die.

570
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,900
Where?

571
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,000
Where there's lots of people.

572
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,300
They gonna shoot each other!

573
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,100
Come on!
Let 's get out of the way!

574
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,400
I told you your life was
hanging by a thread.

575
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,900
<i>Dear Nobody...</i>

576
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,000
<i>dylng Is not the worse thlng</i>
<i>that can happen to a man.</i>

577
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:59,700
<i>Look at me. I've been dead for3 days</i>
<i>and now I've flnally found my peace.</i>

578
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:03,300
<i>You used to say that my llfe</i>
<i>was hanglng by a thread.</i>

579
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,200
<i>Maybe so</i>,<i>but I'm afrald that's your</i>
<i>llfe that's hanglng by a thread now.</i>

580
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,100
Well, that 's one.

581
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,300
Let 's get the other!

582
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,800
<i>And there's quite a few people</i>
<i>who'd llke to cut that thread.</i>

583
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,300
<i>Yeah</i>,<i>I guess it's your</i>
<i>way of feellng allve.</i>

584
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,400
<i>You see</i>,<i>it's the whole dlfference</i>
<i>between you and me.</i>

585
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,300
<i>I've always trled to steer</i>
<i>away from trouble...</i>

586
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,800
<i>but you seem to be looklng</i>
<i>for it all the tlme.</i>

587
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,800
<i>But</i>,<i>I must admit</i>,<i>you've been</i>
<i>able to solve your share...</i>

588
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,400
<i>even If you llke others</i>
<i>to take the credit.</i>

589
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,300
<i>Thls way you can</i>
<i>remaln a Nobody.</i>

590
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,600
<i>You got it all nlcely flgured out.</i>
<i>But you gambled too blg thls tlme...</i>

591
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,900
<i>and there's too many people who</i>
<i>know you're somebody after all...</i>

592
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:55,600
<i>and you won't have much tlme</i>
<i>for playlng your funny games.</i>

593
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,500
<i>They'll make llfe harder</i>
<i>and harder foryou...</i>

594
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:02,400
<i>untll you too meet somebody who</i>
<i>wants to put you down In Hlstory.</i>

595
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:05,700
<i>And so you'll flnd out that the only</i>
<i>way to become a Nobody agaln...</i>

596
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:08,300
<i>Is to dle.</i>

597
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,600
<i>Anyhow</i>, <i>from now on</i>
<i>you'll be walklng In my boots...</i>

598
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,900
<i>and maybe you won't be</i>
<i>laughlng so loud anymore.</i>

599
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,700
<i>But you can stlll do one thlng:</i>

600
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,500
<i>you can preserve a</i>
<i>little of that Illuslon...</i>

601
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:25,100
<i>that made my generatlon tlck.</i>

602
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:28,100
<i>Maybe you'll do it In your</i>
<i>own funny way but...</i>

603
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,300
<i>we'll be grateful just the same.</i>

604
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,300
<i>'Cause looklng back...</i>

605
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:37,400
<i>seems to me we were all</i>
<i>a bunch of romantlc fools...</i>

606
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,400
<i>who stlll belleved</i>
<i>that a good plstol...</i>

607
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,100
<i>and qulck showdown</i>
<i>could solve everythlng.</i>

608
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,000
<i>But then the</i>
<i>West used to be wlde...</i>

609
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,300
<i>open spaces with lots</i>
<i>of elbow room...</i>

610
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:50,800
<i>when you never ran Into</i>
<i>the same person twlce.</i>

611
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,700
<i>At the tlme you came</i>
<i>along it was changed.</i>

612
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,200
<i>Got small and crowded...</i>

613
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,200
<i>and we kept bumplng on</i>
<i>the same people all the tlme.</i>

614
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:50,800
<i>But If you're able to run around In</i>
<i>the West peacefully</i>,<i>catchlng flles...</i>

615
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,300
<i>it's only because fellows</i>
<i>llke me were there flrst.</i>

616
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:58,600
<i>The same fellows you wanna see</i>
<i>written up In Hlstory books.</i>

617
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,600
<i>'Cause people need somethlng</i>
<i>to belleve In</i>,<i>llke you say.</i>

618
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,500
<i>But you won't be able to have it</i>
<i>yourown way much longer...</i>

619
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:09,000
<i>because the country aln't</i>
<i>the same anymore...</i>

620
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:13,100
<i>and I'm already feellng</i>
<i>the strange In myself.</i>

621
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:17,700

630
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,100
<i>Folks that throw dlrt on you</i>
