1
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,712
I'm going to take better care of myself.

2
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,882
- I won't nag.
- I'll always remember to call.

3
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:49,383
I will not lose my temper
in public any more.

4
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:52,555
- I'll gamble less.
- I'll worry less about money.

5
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:58,358
I'll worry less about money.
OK, let's synchronise your watch.

6
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:00,062
OK.

7
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:04,774
10.27, and I'll be finished at noon.
I can be home by 12.30.

8
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,948
I can shower, nap, have lunch.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,611
By 12.45, we could be having sex.

10
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,780
- You know, I figured out my problem.
- Yeah? Share it with me.

11
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,792
God hates me.

12
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,957
Jay, God loves everybody.

13
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:24,918
Not this horse.
That's why I'd like to have one day...

14
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,720
You'll never understand.
It's OK, it means nothing.

15
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:34,393
- It's not important.
- I'd like to understand. Explain it to me.

16
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:37,723
You can be walking around lucky
and not know it.

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,106
- Excuse me?
- The fortune.

18
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:46,905
That's what the fortune says. "You can
be walking around lucky and not know it."

19
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:51,279
Lovely.
Well, you know what mine says?

20
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,820
- "Stand by your man."
- Fabulous!

21
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,036
- I'll save that. Take another.
- You ruined it. I'll take this one.

22
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,920
- How could I ruin it?
- You touched it.

23
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,462
- I didn't open it.
- If you touch it, it's your fortune.

24
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,628
It's pointing to you.
How do you know what it means?

25
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,635
- There are rules.
- What?

26
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:14,306
The international rules of fortune cookie
taking? Want me to lose my temper?

27
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,260
- Look...
- Excuse me!

28
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:19,727
Sorry. What happens
when you touch someone else's cookie?

29
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,856
- It's no good any more.
- See?

30
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:27,812
- I never heard that.
- If you open it, then it's your fortune.

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,988
- Are you an authority? Shut up and eat!
- No, you got to eat it or it doesn't count!

32
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,159
I don't believe this!

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,327
It's not just a cookie!

34
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,850
- Where to?
- Ramada Inn.

35
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:04,021
He'll hear!

36
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:07,019
- He can't hear!
- I can't. My husband...

37
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,105
<i>...is a jealous man.</i>

38
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,232
OK, but I won't wear the pillowcase.

39
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,693
Can I call my wife?

40
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:47,142
<i>- The horse, it's worth 5 or 6 grand.</i>
<i>- Those the papers?</i>

41
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,563
<i>Sam, are you telling me</i>

42
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,855
you had the boy hold Charity back
for the last eight races?

43
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,116
That would be illegal.
Just give me the 5 grand. I'm good for it.

44
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:02,074
'Cause the track officials
will be all over your ass.

45
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:06,036
<i>The only way</i>
<i>Charity can lose on Saturday</i>

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,701
is if she's struck by lightning
in the starting gate.

47
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,446
<i>Bet heavy.</i>
<i>You'll laugh all the way to the bank.</i>

48
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:11,143
I got some fabulous smut
you're going to love! Listen to this.

49
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,024
I've no interest in your filth.

50
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:19,653
It's a piece of business! This guy puts
a pillowcase over this babe's head!

51
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:23,528
<i>Bet heavy.</i>
<i>You'll laugh all the way to the bank.</i>

52
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,983
- I went too far.
- What was that?

53
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:29,618
- Nothing. I want you to hear this!
- I want to hear that.

54
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,915
- It's nothing!
- If it's nothing, play it back.

55
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,912
<i>- What's my end?</i>
<i>- The tip of your life.</i>

Oh, my God!

63
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,520
My God!

64
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,739
This is incredible! I can't believe this!

65
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,568
- Who would believe bullshit like that?
- What?

66
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,661
Trotter!

67
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,664
- This is too good to be true.
- You are a jackass!

68
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,415
You know that? The man just said

69
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,045
the only way this horse can lose
is if lightning strikes!

70
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:29,418
- What? You like the odds on lightning?
- These are guys rehearsing for a play!

71
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:33,303
Give me a break! What did he say?
The horse runs on Saturday.

72
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:35,557
What is it now? It's...

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,684
...it's Saturday right now!

74
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,900
Trotter, what's the matter with you?

75
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,150
I don't know. I feel different.

76
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:49,317
Oh, yeah! Different than what?

77
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,948
- I can't explain this. Play the tape again.
- Trotter!

78
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:57,408
Remember something?
You gave up gambling.

79
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,541
This would not be gambling.

80
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:05,710
Gambling involves risk. It involves
chance. It involves uncertainty.

81
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:10,751
This is just taking advantage of an
extraordinary business opportunity.

82
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:22,719
<i>If Charity loses, I want my $5,000,</i>
<i>plus two grand for the taxi driver.</i>

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,683
<i>Watch my lips.</i>

84
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,606

94
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,693
The horse'll probably swallow its tongue.

95
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:56,567
We're putting everything we've got
on Charity's hot nose.

96
00:08:56,781 --> 00:09:00,196
Hot nose? What?
Is she sick or something?

97
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:04,780
Well, besides, I only got $10.

98
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,366
Don't worry. I got $100 put away
for a day just like this.

99
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,292
Well, I'm not you.

- Yeah.

101
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,837

102
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:07,925
Had the daily double!

103
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,142
Yes, sir! Here, have the daily double.

104
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:14,223
- Why buy that?
- He had the daily double.

105
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:17,012
Stop acting like a hick off the bus!

106
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,475
- 18 months ago!
- Sue me!

107
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:23,561
<i>100 tip sheets at $3 a piece.</i>
<i>That's seven racetracks a day.</i>

108
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:28,408

It's a lot! What can I say?

110
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,331
- You like Chiquita's Banana in the first?
- Who?

111
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,996
Had the daily double!

112
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:44,715
I got a bad leg. Take this $20
and bet the sixth horse for me.

113
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,797
Bring me back the ticket, honey.

114
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,809
It's a living.

115
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:00,017

- For me?

116
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:04,361
Put it under your tongue. Whoa!
Let's go across the street.

117
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,563
Let's get a beer.

118
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:13,318
I don't know, I feel different today.
Today is not like yesterday.

Well, yesterday was hot.
Today is very hot.

120
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:24,839
Hey, hey! How about a beer
and two aspirins? And two Maalox.

121
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,420
Hello, Vibes.

122
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:31,300
<i>No, this is bullshit, you talk bullshit!</i>

123
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:37,092
- I think he's dead.
- Hey, Looney, here it is.

124
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:40,265
- Charity, the four horse.
- Might be a late scratch.

125
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:45,641
- 40-1 odds in <i>The Morning Line!</i> Jesus!
- That'll go down. I like the Packers.

126
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:48,731
I'm not kidding. This horse is a real dog!

127
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:51,485
Listen to this, "Not in this lifetime."

128
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,028
Perfect!

129
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:58,237
I might bet a half on the Packers.
Who knows? They may not lose too bad.

130
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:02,536
Who knows? Maybe you'll get
a discount for coming close!

131
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:06,584
I told you about
my 32-star system, right?

132
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:11,045
Well, I haven't put up
a 40-star system in years.

133
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,961
First race, Blurred Image is it.

134
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,846
- It's a name that trips off your tongue.
- Give me its number.

135
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,385
- Seven.
- No way on earth!

136
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:26,396
Bullshit! You bet an American horse
with a foreign jockey up,

137
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,775
- there's bound to be...
- It's eight! I'd stake my life!

138
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:33,272
- There's a $2 minimum bet.
- Lo Fat? What's that, milk?

139
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,740
This horse stinks,
but I'm betting 150 on his nose.

140
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:39,869
- 150 what?
- The number's the key!

141
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,579
- The odds?
- The number came to me as you got in!

142
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:48,086
- I thought you were dead.
- No, I was getting the number. It's eight!

143
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:52,210
- First, I clear my mind of everything.
- That shouldn't take long.

144
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,924
- Look at that. Could be worse.
- You got to pay attention.

145
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,880
Just relax.

146
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:03,761
Good. You can't think of nothing.
Not even women.

147
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:07,311
Two jugs pop up,
it'll take 17 minutes to get rid of them.

148
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,063
How about a beer?

149
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,941
A number is going to flash! Four!

150
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:21,451
Six! Nine! It'll move like the
son of a bitch, so keep your eyes open!

151
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:25,031
In sports where you need teams,
letters appear!

152
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,452
- I see a D.
- That could be Dallas or Denver!

153
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,875
- Or "Da Giants".
- Right!

154
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:35,500
- What's the matter?
- I saw my life flash in front of my eyes.

155
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:38,634
- How was it?
- Going down the drain.

156
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:43,673
We just had a vibe
on the five horse, Sink Or Swim!

157
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:46,643
Your life is going down the drain, right?

158
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:50,304
Sink! Drain!
Don't you get this connection?

159
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:52,978
- Oh, God!
- That's incredible!

160
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:56,442
Hey, I'm trying to educate you guys!

161
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:03,660
The two horse in the second is a lock
and I'm going to wheel him!

162
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,574
Boys, meet Evangeline!

163
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:11,865
Evangeline, meet the boys! Looney,
Vibes, Marty. Where's Trotter?

164
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:20,508
I don't belong here with these losers,

165
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,676
you know that.

166
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:26,641
I belong over in the Jockey Club,

167
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,804
talking to guys with all their teeth.

168
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,679
Look, I...

169
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:35,851
I know you're trying to give me a break.

170
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:43,859
Just let me win this once.
Just let me win this one last one.

171
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:49,413
I can make everything up to Pam,
be out of the hole, and I'll be on my way.

172
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,698
OK? I will, I swear.

173
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,244
I'm due.

174
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,669
<i>- Yeah, so's Jesus!</i>
<i>- There's no soap over here.</i>

175
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,872
<i>- No shit!</i>
<i>- Let it ride!</i>

176
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,376
Let it ride? I hate this place.

177
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,717
Can I see some ID?

178
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:15,554
- She's 19!
- I got a dog of 19.

179
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:22,310
Who's her orthodontist? Ray Charles?

180
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,063
- Sidney! Don't...
- Let me. Let me.

181
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:27,776
Oh, I see. Let me.

182
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:31,906
I think I got it, I got it.
There you go. That better?

183
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:41,250
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>Today's main track is listed as fast.</i>

184
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,871
<i>The turf course, firm.</i>

185
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:56,639
<i>Please note that this afternoon's</i>
<i>main race has been taken off the turf</i>

186
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:01,599
<i>and will be run at a mile</i>
<i>and one-sixteenth on the main track.</i>

187
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:05,435
- That the one?
- Yeah, that's the one.

188
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,987
- Hi, Evangeline.
- Hi. It's my first time at the track.

189
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,986
- Over here!
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

190
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,577
There you go!

191
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,115
- Trotter.
- Sidney.

192
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,493
Look at the five horse.
Looks like it's asleep.

193
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:23,457
A horse with a large ass
in a field like this, it's a winner.

194
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,628
- Who do you like?
- Four.

195
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,461
Thanks for shooting your mouth off!

196
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:32,294
- The four horse? It's got leprosy.
- The coat's rough...

197
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:36,641
Why are you talking to people?
This isn't the Olympics.

198
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,930
I like Charity, too. He's got a cute nose.

199
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:45,144
- The five's a mortal lock.
- You can play a tune on the three's ribs.

200
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,351
They're so pretty!

201
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,443
Charity's conscious!

202
00:16:56,494 --> 00:17:00,539
- There's the guy and the other guy...
- Keep your voice down.

203
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,834
This is in the bag.

204
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,963
Last-minute strategy.

205
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:17,175
He's probably telling him
to go wide on the first turn.

206
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,806
Go fast and win.

207
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,485
He made the bet. Let's go.

208
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:38,368
You really think Charity can win?

209
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:42,532
- Do I really think Charity can win?
- Yeah.

210
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:45,535
I'm walking around in yesterday's suit.

211
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,665
And I recall recently telling my wife
I would stop gambling.

212
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:53,829
And that I was to move back home
right after work this morning.

213
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,511
If I listen closely, I hear my wife
telling our attorney, "Go for his balls!"

214
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:02,220
You're really asking me
if I think Charity can win?

215
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:05,434
Yes, I think Charity can win!

216
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:09,560
I think she'll lose by a nose.

217
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,578
<i>We are calling for trainer A J Brady.</i>

218
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>Trainer A J Brady</i>
<i>please contact the stewards.</i>

219
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,414
<i>Please note that</i>
<i>in this afternoon's eighth race,</i>

220
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:41,053
<i>number seven, Hasty Flier, will now</i>
<i>be included on today's placing list.</i>

221
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:47,050
Some relative die? I'm sorry.

222
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,510
Hi, Cheeseburger.

223
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:54,557
Hey, Trotter, who do you like in the first?
Who do you like? Come on!

224
00:18:54,775 --> 00:19:00,114
Come on, tell me. Come on, it's Cheese!
Who do you like? Come on, tell me!

225
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,822
- The number four horse.
- Come again?

226
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:06,490
- The number four horse.
- Four...

227
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,418
Nobody in his right mind
bets the four horse!

228
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:24,088
The four horse is a joke, Trotter!

229
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,846
I love this guy!

230
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:32,395
They put little kids on the four horse
to have their pictures taken.

231
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:38,143
The guy with Sammy Davis Jr round
his neck is bothering the customers.

232
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,151
- Can I get some help around here?
- Hey, Trotter's betting the four horse!

233
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:49,070
Hey, watch it, watch it!
The four horse is a goddamn Clydesdale!

234
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,158
One win ticket
on the number four horse, please.

235
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:59,832
This is the $50 window.

236
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:03,332
The $5 window is just over there.

237
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,710
Give me a win ticket on Charity!

238
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,354
- Thank you.
- It was nothing.

239
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:34,367
Yoo-hoo, Trotter! Isn't this exciting?
The flamingos, the fresh air!

240
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,372
- Did you bet?
- Yeah!

241
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:47,881
<i>The horses have now reached the</i>
<i>starting gate for the first race of the day.</i>

242
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:52,340
<i>A reminder of the late scratch in here,</i>
<i>Vagabond Star.</i>

243
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:56,506
Fresh air and conviviality
are important to one's well-being.

244
00:20:56,727 --> 00:21:01,721
Can we have two spots on the rail,
and I'll pay you after the fourth race?

245
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:09,644
- There you go!
<i>- $5 a space, 23 to 24 spaces a race,</i>

246
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,572
<i>9 races a day is...</i>

247
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:15,199
- $1,400 a day! That's a lot.
- Yeah, for being big.

248
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:19,076
<i>The horses have now reached</i>
<i>the starting gate.</i>

249
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,209
Marty's horse looks suicidal.

250
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,417
Who do you like in the first?
The four horse?

251
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:30,917
- Hey, down in front, you big lug!
- Who said that?

252
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:39,140
<i>The assistant starters</i>
<i>are taking hold of the runners.</i>

253
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:42,471
<i>Here's Burgles Delight</i>
<i>in the inside gate,</i>

254
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:46,222
<i>joined by Dream Roadblock,</i>
<i>going in quietly.</i>

255
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:49,976
<i>Shy Ruler will be next.</i>
<i>He goes without any problem.</i>

256
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:53,196
- Trotter, I got a bad feeling.
- No, no!

257
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:58,318
In order for you to have a bad feeling,
you've got to have had a good one first.

258
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:03,447
<i>Charity hesitated momentarily,</i>
<i>but there goes Charity, in quietly now.</i>

259
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,130
<i>Sink Or Swim coming forward, then it'll</i>
<i>be Chiquita Banana and Blurred lmage.</i>

260
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,416
<i>Guys And Dolls forward.</i>

261
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,466
<i>The flag is up!</i>

262
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:18,716
<i>Away they go!</i>

263
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,009
Go!

264
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,807
<i>It's Sink Or Swim, then Shy Ruler.</i>

265
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,766
<i>Then Dream Roadblock...</i>

266
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:32,653
- Still a long way to go.
- Shut up!

267
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,854
<i>... Guys And Dolls in last.</i>

268
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:41,027
<i>On to the back stretch, the long shot,</i>
<i>Charity, opens up to lead by 3 lengths.</i>

269
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:44,494
<i>Shy Ruler in second,</i>
<i>then Sink Or Swim.</i>

270
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:47,541
<i>The favourite, Blurred lmage, Lo Fat...</i>

271
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,668
<i>Guys And Dolls is last!</i>

272
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,876
<i>At the quarter pole, still Charity,</i>
<i>Blurred lmage on the outside!</i>

273
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,796
Blurred Image! That's Marty's horse!

274
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:01,545
<i>- Blurred lmage is coming in...</i>
- Don't do this to me!

275
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,302
<i>Blurred lmage, Charity's final try...</i>

276
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,260
She's dying!

277
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:12,230
<i>Charity on the inside,</i>
<i>Blurred lmage coming up alongside...</i>

278
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,849
I thought we had a deal!

279
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:22,658
Who won?

280
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,861
- Who won?
- Photo.

281
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,745
It was a photo?

282
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,874
Glad I didn't bet.

283
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:33,706
- You didn't?
- I would've had a heart attack.

284
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,040
That's why I only bet $2
on the longest shot,

285
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:39,546
so I don't get my heart pulled.

286
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,342
- Why is it on so long?
- Blurred Image was Marty's horse.

287
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,843
He'd be thrilled if he won.

288
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,928
I don't deserve this anguish.

289
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:11,990
Are you all right? Have some nice beer.

290
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,951
I quit drinking.

291
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,457
They got a winner.

292
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:24,458
<i>The winner of today's first race,</i>
<i>number four, Charity...</i>

293
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:27,251

<i>- ...second, Blurred lmage,</i>

294
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:30,224
<i>third, Dream Roadblock.</i>

295

<i>The winning time, one minute 36...</i>

296
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:36,223
Times 28.40, you're rich!

297
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,898
Is that official?

298
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:40,314
I can't believe I didn't bet that!

299
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:44,358
What wonderful people!

300
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:47,775
I'd hate to walk around this joint
with $700 cash!

301
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,697
710! You'll never have that problem,

302
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:54,115
because the only reason I won
is that you didn't bet!

303
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:58,032
You are the unluckiest person
in the world!

304
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:01,169
- Am not!
- Am!

305
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:06,549
- Who do you like in the second?
- The six horse looks good.

306
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:09,883
- Got a brother?
- In Cleveland.

307
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,300
Call him! Ask him who he likes.
I figure it's in the blood.

308
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:16,471
You had it! You were the one who had it!

309
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:19,889
You knew! You're the unluckiest
person in the world!

310
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:23,060
You don't have to get personal!

311
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:36,531
Congratulations. You got the long shot.

312
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,331
20, 40, 60, 80, one...

313
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:47,382
- Down payment on a new fridge.
- ...80, two...

314
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:51,292
- ...80, three...
- Towards the rent.

315
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:55,344
- ...80, four...
- Flowers for Pam. Dinner for both of us.

316
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:57,301
- ...six!
- Parking tickets.

317
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:00,353
This is $710.

318
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,309
I'm rich!

319
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,354
Hey, Trotter, long time no see!

320
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,866
<i>Let's see, what is that? 30 to 40 a day,</i>

321
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,701
<i>$ 180 to $200 a week, $720 a month...</i>

322
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,078
- It's not a lot of money.
- No, no.

323
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,507
I got kids in college.
This dollar will pay for a minute's tuition.

324
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,298
Buy a new joke.

325
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,172
- Walking tall.
- Thank you!

326
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:30,644
The beer's head has all the vitamins
and minerals. All you need to live.

327
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,850
A's, B's, C's...

328
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:38,315
- There. You don't take this?
- Are you serious?

329
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,284
You look a little taller.

330
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,870
Anybody want a beer before I go home?

331
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,792
- Hear you had a big win.
- He hit the long shot.

332
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,918
I'm buying.

333
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:08,678
I may not have a bunch of money,
but I know I did the right thing,

334
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,730
which is not betting on a sure thing.

335
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:18,652
I knew a guy once, comes to the track,
hits a $75 daily double.

336
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,318
Has to borrow money to get home.

337
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,950
You know, I told you guys which horse
I was going to bet.

338
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:38,086
Remember the time
you rat-holed a five up your ass?

339
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:41,418
He was so broke by the last race,

340
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:45,632
he had to drop his pants
in front of the window to get at it.

341
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,227
A winner knows when it's time to quit.

342
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:41,308
- What a race! I can't believe we won.
- It was that photo.

343
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:45,226
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Did you see that?

344
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,854
My name is Trotter.

345
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:51,739
I have a very close friend
who drives a cab.

346
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:55,321
It's a coincidence,
but he likes to make tapes...

347
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,908
- I knew something would go wrong!
- Got the tape?

348
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,917
What do you want?

349
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:06,371
- How much do you want?
- No, I won $710 and came to thank you.

350
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,252
How much?

351
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:11,422
- I was only here for the first race.
- What do you want?

352
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:13,927
I'm not a blackmailer.

353
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,556
- Take the tape.
- Where's the original?

354
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,770
That's it! There are no copies.
I'm not a crook.

355
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:25,938
Neither am I... Hey, I thought
we had it won, but you never know.

356
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:29,106
Even when you know, you never know.

357
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:32,738
- Yeah, I know!
- Exactly. This is the only tape?

358
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,319
- Yeah, that's it.
- How did you like that photo?

359
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:39,740
- Tense! Yes.
- You didn't make a copy?

360
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:45,243
I just came down here to say hello.

361
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:48,214
I'm on my way home.

362
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:53,216
There's a horse in the third race.
Got a good chance.

363
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,836
This is the only tape?

364
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,634
Absolutely.

365
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,632
The reason I like this horse a little,

366
00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:05,020
my jockey says the jockey
riding Faith Healer

367
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:07,687
has got a grand riding on him.

368
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,818
The last grand he saw
was the Grand Canyon.

369
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,986
Must have borrowed it.

370
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:18,358
- Faith Healer? Seven horse.
- I got a couple of bucks on him.

371
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:23,824
- Put $10 on him. Who knows?
- Who knows?

372
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,666
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

373
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:29,328
Look, I have to go home.

374
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,169
Take my seat at the Jockey Club.

375
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,178
And take this. You might need it.
You know? You never know.

376
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:45,341
- You never know.
- No, you never know! Yeah!

377
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,183
Yeah!

378
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,900
Oh, yeah.

379
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:12,209
- Give me a burger.
- One burger.

380
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:16,170
- Why do you like this Faith Healer?
- Talking to me?

381
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,542
I hear you're hot, Trotter.

382
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:22,638
- 'Cause I won on one lousy race?
- You never know.

383
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:26,015
Seen dumber guys than you
win two in a row.

384
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:28,634
- 25, 2, 3...
- The funny thing is,

385
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:32,437
if I'd only bet $2, I'd be up $28.

386
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,777
- I thought a hamburger cost $1.50?
- Honest mistake.

387
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:44,151
- Why do you like this Faith Healer?
- How do you know I like Faith Healer?

388
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:48,830
You might be walking around lucky
and not even know it.

389
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:51,707
You know what I mean?

390
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,340
I just work here.

391
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:05,253
- You finished with that?
- Knock yourself out, pal.

392
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:16,435
Yo, Mr Trotter!
Mr Trotter, you have a minute?

393
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,979
Yeah.

394
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:21,194
What do you like in the third?

395
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:25,533
- Yeah! Seven horse.
- Seven horse. All right!

396
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:31,954
I won't forget this. I will not forget this.

397
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,623
80...700.

398
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:38,963
Let it ride.

399
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:43,167
Welcome home.

400
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:46,424
On what?

401
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:51,134
A win ticket...on Faith Healer.

402
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:55,970
Most guys get lucky,
they bet $3 on the next race.

403
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:59,640
Just give me the $50 win tickets
on number seven.

404
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,329
Trotter, you've shrunk.

405
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:22,785
I got an idea to make big money. We
take the tape and confront the trainer.

406
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:26,790
With what he made,
he won't mind slipping us $5,000.

407
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,628
- I don't like blackmail, but...
- I got rid of the tape.

408
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:37,185
- I just saved you from a jail sentence.
- I'll get you for this!

409
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:41,642
<i>The horses have now reached</i>
<i>the starting gate.</i>

410
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,321
$50 on June Bug to win!

411
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,191
It's my cat's name.

412
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,577
<i>Away they go!</i>

413
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:09,881
<i>- ...Faith Healer going best of all...</i>
- Come on, Faith Healer!

414
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:14,382
Win, win, win!

415
00:35:14,598 --> 00:35:17,171
- Yes!
- Yes!

416
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:27,269
I'm never, never going to forget this!

417
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:29,359
Never!

418
00:35:35,118 --> 00:35:36,695
Well, well, well!

419
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:39,912
I shall require your autograph.

420
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,873
So will the IRS. You can't win
that kind of money without owning up.

421
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,469
$2,450.

422
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,766
Shoes?

423
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,450
Thank you very much, sir.

424
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:15,165
My name is Greenberg.

425
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,338
- Vicki.
- Trotter.

426
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,123
I'm pleased.

427
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:25,675
I didn't realise we were having
a beauty contest at the track today.

428
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:31,178
- He thinks you won a beauty contest!
- I could have.

429
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:35,062
- If you didn't, I would have bought it.
- Bernie is rich.

430
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:39,480
- Nice to meet both of you.
- Thanks. Likewise.

431
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:46,030
- What are you on in the fifth?
- Who do you like in the fifth?

432
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:51,578
- Bernie lost his ass already today.
- Whoa! Zip it!

433
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:55,659
Hey, you want to know my philosophy?

434
00:37:55,879 --> 00:38:00,042
Nobody knows you got money,
what's the use of having it?

435
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:05,548
I got a condo. The thing is worth
700% more than I paid for it.

436
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,097
I don't need a place that big.
Do I need that?

437
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:12,226
But I like space. Space!

438
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:16,185
- He likes space.
- Guess how many bathrooms it has.

439
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:19,565
I don't know! That's how many it has!

440
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,234
He found six.

441
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,238
Six bathrooms.

442
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:29,233
- I got to get even. I'll bet a grand now.
- Excuse me.

443
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:40,083
- She's got very long legs.
- Right.

444
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:45,089
They go from my ass all the way
to the floor. My legs.

445
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:46,760
True.

446
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:56,264
Would you like to drink, sir?

447
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:59,764
- Any Wild Turkey in season?
- Sir!

448
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,275
Kill one for me.

449
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,232
Thank you.

450
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:15,953
Have you a pen?

451
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,074
- Is a pencil OK?
- Thanks.

452
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,498
You're welcome.

453
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:23,953
May I buy you a drink?

454
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:27,126
I don't see why not. I'm on the pill.

455
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:31,632
Rum.

456
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:34,847
<i>The horses for the fifth race</i>
<i>are on the track.</i>

457
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:38,308
- I like the number six horse.
- Lord Byron?

458
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:46,440
- I enjoy gambling.
- I'm having a good day.

459
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,861
Lord Byron, Lord Byron...

460
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,652
Byron...poet,

461
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:57,652
poetas, poetamus, poetatus...

462
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,366
Poetic.

463
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,120
- Like this room.
- Yes.

464
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:09,793
Normally, I don't like to bet the favourite,
but $2,500 times two is $5,000.

465
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,051
Do you come here...

466
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,724
- ...often?
- Every day.

467
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:23,849
- Really? You gamble every day?
- Of course.

468
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:27,852
Do you...

469
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,939
Has gambling affected your home life?

470
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,077
Ruined it.

471
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:51,670
Has gambling affected your reputation?

472
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,333
Honey, some people like
to rub me for luck.

473
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,384
Hurry up with that rum!

474
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:03,891
- You feel lucky?
- I'm hot.

475
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,261
I can tell.

476
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:09,852
Lord...Byron.

477
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:13,151
- I like Lord Byron.
- I love Lord Byron.

478
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:21,572
I think I'll go bet it.

479
00:41:24,956 --> 00:41:26,913
- Hi, Charley.
- Hi, Vicki.

480
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,623
- Sorry!
- I'm terribly sorry.

481
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:32,876
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. Really.

482
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,758
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

483
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:38,718
- Flowers?
- No, thank you.

484
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,470
Quaaludes?

485
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,847
One more collision like that,
you're getting glasses!

486
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:51,595
Hey, what did I do? What did I do?

487
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:53,855
There he is!

488
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:57,519
- You won't be picking any more pockets!
- What's going on?

489
00:41:57,738 --> 00:42:03,194
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I want the right to bet Lord Byron!

490
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,743
- Let's go, Morgan!
- Morgan? I'm not Morgan!

491
00:42:06,955 --> 00:42:09,113
Vibes, tell them who I am!

492
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:11,870
Tell the police officers who I am!

493
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:14,706
I've never seen this man before.

494
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:18,669
I'll kill you! I can't believe
you did this to me!

495
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:21,967
- We got Morgan here.
- I'm not Morgan!

496
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:27,634
- Do I look like a Morgan?
- Sit down and shut up! We got Morgan!

497
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:32,642
- I am not Morgan, goddammit!
- Swearing in public's illegal.

498
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:35,772
- So is false arrest.
- Home address?

499
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:40,111
- You're not calling my wife?
<i>- The horses are at the starting gate.</i>

500
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,985
- This is costing me $5,000!
- Quiet!

501
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:55,701
- Blast him!
- You can't shoot a pickpocket!

502
00:42:56,711 --> 00:43:00,329
- Out of the way!
- It must be a commercial.

503
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:05,339
Why are you handcuffed?

504
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,219
Outta the way!

505
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:22,692
<i>He's going in. Vague Lady</i>
<i>a little restless inside the gate.</i>

506
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:25,359
<i>The flag is up!</i>

507
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,364
Don't! No! No!

508
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:30,492
- He did it!
- What did I do?

509
00:43:30,702 --> 00:43:32,529
Everything!

510
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:36,663
<i>Mismatch moves up on the outside...</i>

511
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,244
How do you explain
the $2,400 hidden in your shoes?

512
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:46,714
- I'm having a very good day!
- We're checking on a Mr J Trotter.

513
00:43:46,926 --> 00:43:48,504
I'll kill you!

514
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,848
2232 Flamingo Lane.

515
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:59,223
- He said he worked for you.
<i>- A shocking incident of bumping!</i>

516
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:03,816
<i>Lord Byron has lost the rider!</i>
<i>Going through, Splendid Reason...</i>

517
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:07,894
- You do know him?
<i>- Splendid Reason wins!</i>

518
00:44:08,114 --> 00:44:14,282
<i>Lord Byron leads, and Arctic Dancer...</i>
<i>A shocking incident of bumping!</i>

519
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:17,033
<i>Lord Byron has lost the rider!</i>

520
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:22,704
- That is a shocking incident of bumping.
<i>- Splendid Reason wins!</i>

521
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,589
- I didn't lose.
<i>- Arctic Dancer second...</i>

522
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,668
Weirder and weirder.

523
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:33,003
- I had the winner.
- I didn't lose.

524
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,135
I should have lost, but I didn't lose.

525
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,968
There's a fine line
between winning and losing.

526
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:43,263
Yes, the finish line.

527
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,441
When you're rich,
you don't worry about losing.

528
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:56,950
I sell envelopes.
If I lose 10 grand at the track,

529
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,538
I add half a cent to the prices
of my birthday envelopes.

530
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:04,121
I'll take six dozen.

531
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,123
<i>Dr Trotter, Dr J Trotter,</i>

532
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,874
<i>please pick up</i>
<i>the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

533
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,256
Excuse me.

534
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:21,594
Come back, Doctor.

535
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:24,353
Some doctor!

536
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:27,560
Right over there, sir.

537
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:30,016
<i>Calling trainer Mel Stutey.</i>

538
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:33,271
<i>- Please contact the jockey's room.</i>
- Dr Trotter.

539
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:35,148
Follow me, sir.

540
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,036
Miss Vicki.

541
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:51,083
- Is that caviar fresh?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:54,463
And a little champagne. Excellent.

543
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:56,668
Hi, honey, I knew it was you.

544
00:45:56,885 --> 00:46:01,547
Trotter, sweetheart, honey darling,
help me out here? What day is it?

545
00:46:01,765 --> 00:46:04,303
It's Saturday, babe. Why?

546
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:07,305
Saturday! Good. I see.

547
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:11,518
I don't want to assume something
I shouldn't. What time is it?

548
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,354
It's 1.45, doll.

549
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:18,816
"1.45, doll"!
And where are you right now?

550
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:21,071
The Jockey Club. You called me.

551
00:46:21,284 --> 00:46:26,195
Yes, of course.
So, if what you're saying is true,

552
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:31,040
you are in the Jockey Club at the
racetrack at 1.45 Saturday afternoon,

553
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:37,041
when you were supposed to be home
at 12.30 starting our marriage over!

554
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:41,338
Son of a bitch! What am I going
to do with you? You lousy bum!

555
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:44,223
- I hate your guts, as usual!
- Listen...

556
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:47,681
How could you do this to me?
What am I saying?

557
00:46:47,893 --> 00:46:52,602
How could you not do this? How could
I expect you to do anything but this?

558
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:54,558
You're hopeless!

559
00:46:54,775 --> 00:47:00,564
<i>I'm just as hopeless to think you'd have</i>
<i>any consideration for my feelings.</i>

560
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:02,738
<i>- Jesus!</i>
- Excuse me!

561
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:06,781
This is a private conversation.
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

562
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:08,904
You're gambling...

563
00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:13,582
I am not gambling! I am not gambling!
I am winning!

564
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:15,453
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

565
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,296
Really! I wouldn't kid you. I'm up $2,500.
I'm having a very good day.

566
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:23,628
Are you? Well, good day this, baby!

567
00:47:23,845 --> 00:47:27,924
I'm calling my attorney
and telling him to go for your balls!

568
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,343
- Listen...
- You know, I think this is it.

569
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,098
I'm finished. We are history!

570
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:40,316
- Pam, don't panic. Get all gussied up...
- You want me to get gussied up?

571
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,607
Come down here and see.
You won't believe what's going on!

572
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:48,572
If I do, it'll be you that won't believe
what's going on!

573
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,455
Be here in half an hour. I love you.

574
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:02,376
Bastard!

575
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:08,461
Maybe one more time.
But after that, no more.

576
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:13,174
I thought we'd find you at that dump
across the street.

577
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:17,472
- Marty's, where all the pigs wallow.
- I like your shoes.

578
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:21,982
- Buy them at a carpet sale?
- Let me throw him out the window.

579
00:48:22,193 --> 00:48:25,146
I hope someday you're two seconds late.

580
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,521
Where's your friend, Looney?

581
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,571
- He's not my friend.
- He's late with some money.

582
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:37,989
- I wouldn't know.
- Hundreds late. Sickeningly late.

583
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,992
Bernie, I swear to God, I hate this.

584
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,370
Makes my stomach turn.

585
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,543
Next week, it's me giving you this back.

586
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:57,175
The races make me nervous.
You can't beat an animal.

587
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:00,478
Looney's in trouble. He bet the Packers.

588
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,523
- So?
- He bet them pretty hard.

589
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:08,774
They lost 75-10, and your pal
Looney, went in for a nickel.

590
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,657
I thought he only bet $50.

591
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,531
Your friend's down $800,
and some change.

592
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,867
Which is a lot for a bum.

593
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:24,035
When you see your buddy, please
pass along this message, "Pay up."

594
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,462
PS, "Or else!"

595
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:33,051
I don't think I'll be seeing Mr Looney
any time soon. Excuse me.

596
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,472
Seen Looney?

597
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:42,889
I may go and draw some savings,
come back, and get back what we lost.

598
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:45,891
- I am pretty mad!
- Seen Looney?

599
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:49,807
- Everybody's looking for Looney.
- He said you were a jerk.

600
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:54,773
- Where is he?
- Lufkin's after him. He left a number.

601
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,908
Looney said you turned on your friends.

602
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,827
- He went to give blood.
- We could, and save a trip to the bank!

603
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,544
I am pretty cheesed off about that jockey
falling off that damn horse, Sid!

604
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:10,880
Looney!

605
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:14,090
- Looney!
- What?

606
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:19,547
What are you doing?

607
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:22,801
Being embalmed,
if it's any business of yours.

608
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:26,600
- Lufkin is looking for you.
- So?

609
00:50:26,813 --> 00:50:29,185
He says you're over the limit.

610
00:50:29,399 --> 00:50:32,768
- Dead men can't pay.
- Don't go back to the track.

611
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:34,943
You screwed me.

612
00:50:35,154 --> 00:50:38,654
I didn't! I made the bet that
we were both going to bet!

613
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:43,279
I lost $50 on the one named the same
as my cat! In the seventh,

614
00:50:43,496 --> 00:50:46,912
one's named the same
as my apartment. I'm going back.

615
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:51,252
I love the track. Great place to spend
time with your best friend.

616
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:54,629
- Until he sneaks off and screws you!
- You!

617
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,584
Out!

618
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:03,511
Give my regards to your new pals
at that whorehouse you're sitting in!

619
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:09,393
Look...

620
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:13,096
...tell that guy his blood is rare.

621
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:16,483
Say he gets $20, not the regular $10.

622
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:20,395
His blood is rare. He gets $75.

623
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,074
75?

624
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:28,286
75 twice a week is $150.
That's a lot of money!

625
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,872
- Some Banana Daiquiris.
- Banana King's in the next race.

626
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:37,332
- Really? Where?
- Where's the money?

627
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:42,001
- We're married.
- Oh. We're not.

628
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:46,674
- Why don't I keep the money?
- It's in my shoes.

629
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,132
Give me the money!

630
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:53,522
Purse snatchers are everywhere!

631
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:58,392
Put this on your list, Mr "I won't
gamble"! What happened to that?

632
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:04,648
At least give me some of the money and
you can keep $10, if you have to bet!

633
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:08,365
I don't see why you people
can't watch the horses run

634
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:10,701
and not bet on them.

635
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:17,040
- She's new!
- What's so damn funny?

636
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:21,167
Because there is no racing
without betting.

637
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:22,924
That's poetic.

638
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:26,051
- Please! Airhead.
- Excuse me?

639
00:52:26,262 --> 00:52:31,387
- I don't want you to lose all our money.
- Pam, darling, sweetheart,

640
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,222
I'm begging you, be quiet.

641
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:37,888
If you don't give it to me now,
I'll cause a scene.

642
00:52:38,107 --> 00:52:41,891
Remember your mother's house?
The plate glass window?

643
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,399
- I'm going to the men's room.
- Why?

644
00:52:44,613 --> 00:52:47,982
- To take my shoes off.
- I don't trust you one little bit!

645
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,117
You don't want me
to make a scene here!

646
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:12,463
Terribly sorry.

647
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:17,009
Here comes the champ!
I admit it, you are the champ!

648
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:20,063
You got more guts than sense. I love it!

649
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:23,641
- So, what do you want?
- I don't know.

650
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:27,228
- You have to give me a number.
- I'll be right back.

651
00:53:27,446 --> 00:53:29,569
I believe you will.

652
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:32,403
I'm taking a survey. Who do you like?

653
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:37,114
I like the two horse. It's got front wraps.
I always bet those horses.

654
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:43,748
- Excuse me, I'm taking a survey...
- Big money on the four. Real money.

655
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:46,583
- Who do you like?
- I like the six.

656
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:49,040
- Why?
- I always bet on five.

657
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,010
- Who do you like?
- Up Yours, number one.

658
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,793
- Thank you.
- I like the four.

659
00:53:55,014 --> 00:54:00,009
These other nags'll die. By the eighth
pole, they'll look like they're at a bus stop.

660
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:03,431
- It's my survey. Take your own.
- I like the six.

661
00:54:03,648 --> 00:54:05,439
- The four.
- The one.

662
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,689
I like the six horse.

663
00:54:12,573 --> 00:54:14,696
- Three!
- What do you mean?

664
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:17,660
Three to win. Let it ride.

665
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:22,328
Are you sure?
I mean, of sound mind and all that?

666
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:27,666
I'm not asking for a will. I want 48 $50
win tickets on three in the seventh race.

667
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:32,091
48 $50 win tickets
on the three horse in the seventh race?

668
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:38,884
- That's right.
- I have to give you 48 $50 win tickets

669
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:42,384
on the three horse in the seventh race?

670
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:48,055
How much does 48 $50 win tickets

671
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:51,560
on the three horse
in the seventh race pay?

672
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:59,069
48 $50 win tickets on the three horse
in the seventh race at...

673
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:02,155
...25-1 will pay you...

674
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:14,466
- ...approximately $69,000.
- This is a lot of money.

675
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:20,800
- You won't hold any back, just in case?
- In case what?

676
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:24,465
In case you get hungry or thirsty
before the race ends?

677
00:55:51,794 --> 00:55:53,253
Thanks.

678
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,676
It's quiet.

679
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:18,319
I do this for a living.
Been doing it for 15 years.

680
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:24,487
I play the circuit.
One track closes, another one opens.

681
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:27,986
Some big places, some dumps.

682
00:56:28,955 --> 00:56:34,411
I've met all kinds of characters but,
believe me, pal, you are the champ.

683
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:36,703
I really hope you win.

684
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,959
Yep, you're the greatest I've ever seen.

685
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:44,259
- I'll tell the grandchildren about you.
- Thanks.

686
00:56:53,687 --> 00:56:57,436
Escort this gentleman
until the end of the race.

687
00:56:57,649 --> 00:56:59,274
Yes, sir.

688
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:02,736
Hi.

689
00:57:04,698 --> 00:57:06,655
Coming through!

690
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:28,799
You've been arrested?
Where's the money?

691
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:34,850
No, no!

692
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,227
- These! No!
- I had to.

693
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,312
- Lying son of a bitch!
- Lay off him!

694
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:48,438
- Would you mind your own business?
- She's pert, if you like pert.

695
00:57:48,657 --> 00:57:50,696
Hardly nobody likes three.

696
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:54,195
- Who's she talking about?
- You want another round?

697
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:58,161
You're sick!
Somebody should put you in a hospital.

698
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:02,372
I just got it!
I just got something real important.

699
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:06,371
After all these years, it's not my gambling
that you despised.

700
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:08,583
It's been my losing!

701
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:15,926
I'm ending this marriage,
or I'll have a nervous breakdown.

702
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:18,811
I might be having one right now.

703
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,308
- I'm going home.
- Good.

704
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:27,059
- Shall I call when I win?
- Yes!

705
00:58:27,278 --> 00:58:29,069
Call this!

706
00:58:31,281 --> 00:58:32,740
My!

707
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,950
- We're having some problems.
- Poor Trotter.

708
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:40,080
Poor, poor Trotter.

709
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:45,288
You're looking at $69,000,
or you're looking at nothing.

710
00:58:50,008 --> 00:58:52,795
I've a house in the Bahamas. I love guts!

711
00:58:53,011 --> 00:58:55,965
He's mine! You're mine.

712
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:59,632
<i>The horses are approaching</i>
<i>the starting gate.</i>

713
00:59:08,985 --> 00:59:12,603
<i>The horses have now reached</i>
<i>the starting gate.</i>

714
00:59:22,164 --> 00:59:25,533
<i>The horses are all in line.</i>

715
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:30,791
<i>The flag is up!</i>

716
00:59:31,006 --> 00:59:36,047
<i>And away they go!</i>
<i>Here comes Rock It and Moon Beams,</i>

717
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:40,555
<i>Idle Threat behind him and,</i>
<i>in second last, it's Fleet Dreams...</i>

718
00:59:40,765 --> 00:59:46,886
- Come on, Fleet Dreams!
<i>- ... Up Yours on the inside, Rock lt...</i>

719
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:50,106
- Come on, four!
- Come on, Fleet Dreams!

720
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:54,314
- Come on, four!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

721
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,237
Come on, four!

722
00:59:57,949 --> 01:00:02,445
<i>- It's Up Yours, then Fleet Dreams...</i>
- Come on, baby, come on!

723
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:07,288
<i>- Rock It is in there, and Moon Beams...</i>
- Come on, you son of a bitch!

724
01:00:07,499 --> 01:00:12,375
<i>At second last, Banana King is</i>
<i>on the outside. They come for home!</i>

725
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:17,546
<i>It's Moon Beams and Fleet Dreams,</i>
<i>these two now. Up Yours at the rail...</i>

726
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:26,341
<i>Moon Beams is in front, Fleet Dreams</i>
<i>is coming after him on the inside!</i>

727
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:31,387
<i>Moon Beams and Fleet Dreams,</i>
<i>Up Yours and Banana King...</i>

728
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:35,686
<i>It's going to be Moon Beams</i>
<i>or Fleet Dreams!</i>

729
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:40,231
<i>- Fleet Dreams on the inside...</i>
- Come on, come on!

730
01:00:40,448 --> 01:00:45,157
<i>Fleet Dreams gets the lead! Coming</i>
<i>down to the wire, it's Fleet Dreams...</i>

731
01:00:51,459 --> 01:00:53,617
<i>Fleet Dreams has won it!</i>

732
01:00:53,836 --> 01:00:55,295
You won!

733
01:00:56,922 --> 01:00:58,831
Fleet Dreams won!

734
01:01:00,217 --> 01:01:04,297
- Your horse won. You're a millionaire!
- I've had enough!

735
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:08,593
- Come on! Get up, you crazy bitch!
- He's a millionaire!

736
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:11,726
Get out of here! Jesus Christ!

737
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:15,436
Did I win? Son of a bitch!

738
01:01:16,274 --> 01:01:20,486
I won! I won!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

739
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:23,649
Fucking flying son of a bitch!
Fucking flying whore!

740
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:25,525
God likes me!

741
01:01:25,742 --> 01:01:28,197
He really, really likes me!

742
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:33,369
Wow, what a day! What a day!
What a fabulous day!

743
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:36,287
I'm having a fabulous day!

744
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:40,547
They should guard the door,
so that sort doesn't get in!

745
01:01:42,049 --> 01:01:45,418
- Fix your skirt, for Christ's sakes!
- OK, Bernie.

746
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:51,721
- Have you ever seen such behaviour?
- Can't hold his liquor!

747
01:01:51,934 --> 01:01:55,766
- You might have mentioned.
- What?

748
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:59,514
The three horse. You might have
said you liked him.

749
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:04,940
- Think I'm so rich I don't need any extra?
- Want to know how I got the three?

750
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,693
You want to know how I got it?

751
01:02:07,908 --> 01:02:10,861
I went out in the thing and I...

752
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:13,537
Screw it!

753
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:19,666
I hate sneaky people. I knew a sissy kid
in school that covered up his answers.

754
01:02:19,877 --> 01:02:21,917
Who cares? Who cares?

755
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,709
Waiter! More champagne.

756
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:29,884
We're very busy, sir.

757
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:48,316
- That's for all you stuffy rat bastards!
- How dare he!

758
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:52,029
- That is...
- Why, it's outrageous behaviour!

759
01:02:53,577 --> 01:02:59,282
I'm going to collect $69,000!

760
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:00,958
How gross!

761
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,340
- I'm hiring you all day.
- Don't worry about a thing.

762
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:12,504
Anybody makes a funny move,
shoot them!

763
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,928
No, it's OK! I know this guy!

764
01:03:19,894 --> 01:03:22,599
- Pay up, you deadbeat!
- No!

765
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:25,600
Don't shoot yet! I haven't got my money!

766
01:03:25,816 --> 01:03:31,735
- I don't like you one fuck!
- Another curse, I'll blast your head off!

767
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:34,189
- Really?
- That's correct.

768
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:39,905
I lost the blood bank money!
Not on a horse! I got my pocket picked.

769
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:45,708
What is this? Social hour? You owe me,
you bastard! And I'm going to get it!

770
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:50,123
How much does Mr Looney owe you?

771
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,668
850.

772
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,380
I was on the phone.
I was going to bet $50.

773
01:03:57,597 --> 01:04:03,350
Next I'm saying, "500 on the Packers."
It was like somebody else saying it!

774
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:05,554
Let him kill me! I deserve it!

775
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,394
I'll pay for Looney
when I settle here, OK?

776
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,400
I can get it. I'll kill somebody.

777
01:04:15,614 --> 01:04:20,442
- Watch it!
- When did I last have a winning week?

778
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:28,866
December 3rd, three years ago. $22.

779
01:04:29,086 --> 01:04:32,205
- Ooh!
- I'm a loser! Let him kill me! I deserve it!

780
01:04:32,422 --> 01:04:34,960
When I collect, I settle his sheet.

781
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:39,753
I'll owe you for the rest of my life.
You're the greatest man that ever lived.

782
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:42,842
- I mean that.
- Sounds fine to me.

783
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:47,386
$69,000!

784
01:04:49,188 --> 01:04:53,138
Send champagne to Fleet Dreams'
stall and roses to the owner.

785
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:56,728
And a case of light beer to the jockey.
I'm not kidding!

786
01:04:56,946 --> 01:05:00,611
Government takes half. That's 34,500.

787
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:04,443
800 on the Buick, 450 on furniture,
Pam's cruise, that's...

788
01:05:04,662 --> 01:05:06,904
- 430.
- 17,000.

789
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:11,250
12 years' rent, 200 for champagne,
100 for roses.

790
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,789
- 40.
- 100 for breakages at the Jockey Club.

791
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:21,166
- 58.
- 850 for Looney's tab, leaves me with...

792
01:05:21,386 --> 01:05:22,715
...zero,

793
01:05:22,929 --> 01:05:24,922
zero, zero.

794
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,883
Congratulations!

795
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:29,852
I'm broke.

796
01:05:32,397 --> 01:05:36,525
- About that 850 you owe...
- There's all kinds of love in this world.

797
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:41,729
- I got bad news. I can't afford this...
- The love I got for you is man to man.

798
01:05:41,948 --> 01:05:44,569
You're a prince. You're my king.

799
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:47,904
- Ah, hell!
- He'll be back.

800
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,785
Not me, pal. I've seen the light.

801
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:55,498
- Hey, Loon!
- Mr Looney to you!

802
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,869
I'm owed change.

803
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:01,336
Nobody make a move!

804
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:06,634
He looks different.

805
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:16,764
I have peripheral vision. It's a gift.
I can see my ears.

806
01:06:16,982 --> 01:06:20,232
A guy's throwing up
on the pool table on my left.

807
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:26,197
Two guys are asleep on the table
on the right. A bulb's blown overhead.

808
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:30,357
- There's a fly on the money box.
- What is this crap?

809
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,368
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

810
01:06:39,587 --> 01:06:42,837
Don't "honey" me! Besides, I'm drunk.

811
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:48,090
Pam, you know that race?
The one you left before?

812
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:54,344
I've decided to become an alcoholic.
It's the healthiest thing I've ever done.

813
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:58,352
I won. We're pretty rich.

814
01:06:58,564 --> 01:07:02,015
I'm going to drink every day,
morning, noon and night.

815
01:07:02,234 --> 01:07:06,528
Bottles of gin, beer...
I'll hide the bottles around the house.

816
01:07:06,738 --> 01:07:10,154
I'm never going to cook, or clean.

817
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:15,361
Or take baths.
Sell the bed if you want. Bet with it.

818
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,913
I'll be passing out on the floor
from now on.

819
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,453
Because...

820
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:23,338
I don't care about the refrigerator. Sell it.

821
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:27,674
Pam, all of the money
is in a green box. I haven't spent any.

822
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:36,682
- Pam?
- I'm drinking and flicking ash around.

823
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:40,937
I couldn't leave you.
I decided this is the only way.

824
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:43,353
- Pam...
<i>- Go make your bet.</i>

825
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:47,812
Call me when you like. I'll be here...
Passed out in a pool of vomit.

826
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:52,239
- I think we have to talk.
- You can move back.

827
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,287
- I missed you all the time.
- Oh, Pam.

828
01:08:02,626 --> 01:08:06,125
- I really love you.
- Well, that's...

829
01:08:06,337 --> 01:08:08,710
...very sweet.

830
01:08:08,923 --> 01:08:10,252
<i>Pamela?</i>

831
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:15,627
Sorry, I dropped the phone. Could you
pick up some wine? I love you.

832
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,886
Do you mean that?

833
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:20,056
Of course I do.

834
01:08:21,352 --> 01:08:22,811
Mean what?

835
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:25,810
- Honey?
- Yeah?

836
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:44,579
What do you want to do
with the box of assets?

837
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:02,889
Honey, I'm home. Pam?

838
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:10,564
I didn't bet.

839
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:14,942
We're rich.

840
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:20,820
I got you a little bubbly.

841
01:09:21,035 --> 01:09:24,154
And I got you a nice little gift here.

842
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:36,582
Honey?

843
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:40,044
Sweetie honey?

844
01:09:42,764 --> 01:09:44,223
OK.

845
01:09:48,311 --> 01:09:51,016
$69,000!

846
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,357
Nine...piles of tiles?

847
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,361
What does that mean?

848
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,768
Five of clubs.

849
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,744
This horse could only be ridden
by a Chinese jockey.

850
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,910
- In the first race.
- They raced horses for generations.

851
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,747
It's him! It's him! He's here!

852
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,341
I knew it! I knew it!

853
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,047
I knew it.

854
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,602
Now, that's a man!

855
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:25,228
All these bums here said
you were nothing but a quitter.

856
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,566
- But I defended you.
- Yeah!

857
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:30,112
A toast!

858
01:11:30,326 --> 01:11:31,737
To Trotter!

859
01:11:34,497 --> 01:11:37,747
You're all great friends.

860
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:42,336
And who needs money
when you got friends?

861
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:47,255
Don't worry, because we'll all be here
to pick you up when it's over!

862
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:57,267
- I got an idea.
- You got a horse picked out?

863
01:11:59,188 --> 01:12:02,603
- I'm hot, right?
- Yeah!

864
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:05,437
I am truly hot!

865
01:12:05,652 --> 01:12:09,187
And there is nothing more important
than friendship.

866
01:12:09,406 --> 01:12:12,442
- Nothing!
- Here's what we're going to do.

867
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:17,368
We're going to take everything we've got.
Everything I've got!

868
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,700
- And everything you've got!
- Yeah!

869
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:23,408
- Every last cent!
- Yeah!

870
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:28,871
We're going to put it all together
into one big pile.

871
01:12:32,637 --> 01:12:35,388
And we're going to bet it together!

872
01:12:57,786 --> 01:12:59,660
I'm hot!

873
01:12:59,871 --> 01:13:02,576
I'm hot! Listen to me!

874
01:13:05,043 --> 01:13:08,459
This is the chance
that you have all been waiting for.

875
01:13:10,632 --> 01:13:16,136
Next race, I'm putting up 27 stars.
It's good, but I wouldn't bet my grandma.

876
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:20,557
- I wouldn't bet mine, either.
- You don't understand.

877
01:13:20,766 --> 01:13:22,759
- Sashay Around!
- Chocaholic!

878
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:28,102
What's the name of that six horse?
Let me see the jockey's name.

879
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:33,814
There's something about the sound.
Diamondback. I don't know what it is.

880
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:06,641
<i>Trainer Tony Kelly,</i>
<i>please contact the Steward's Office.</i>

881
01:14:11,232 --> 01:14:13,604
That's the guy.

882
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:18,862
Stay.

883
01:14:56,401 --> 01:14:58,025
Guess who?

884
01:14:58,236 --> 01:15:02,732
- A football salesman?
- No, it's me, Vicki.

885
01:15:02,949 --> 01:15:05,025
- Hi, Vicki.
- Hi, Trotter.

886
01:15:05,242 --> 01:15:10,200
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. What are you going to do?

887
01:15:10,414 --> 01:15:15,705
- I don't know. Where's your friend?
- Who, Bernie?

888
01:15:15,919 --> 01:15:18,790
You can do better than that.

889
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:23,798
A girl's gotta decide what's important,
money or love.

890
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:27,426
No one's giving anything away.
And Bernie's rich,

891
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:29,679
which can be handy.

892
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:32,050
You're a wonderful girl.

893
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:34,391
Thank you, Trotter!

894
01:15:36,272 --> 01:15:38,894
I'm getting a little nervous now.

895
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:43,651
I was thinking I'd come down
and ask you to go to bed with me,

896
01:15:43,863 --> 01:15:46,864
'cause I think you're kind of funny,
that's all.

897
01:15:48,576 --> 01:15:50,699
Am I having a good day, or what?

898
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:53,118
- Vicki.
- What?

899
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:55,537
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

900
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,747
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
But I love my wife.

901
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:08,628
I just thought I'd ask, that's all.

902
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:13,306
What is it they say?
Nothing ventured, nothing...ventured.

903
01:16:24,069 --> 01:16:25,978
Hey, Trotter.

904
01:16:26,196 --> 01:16:27,773
Hi.

905
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:34,115
- What are you going to do?
- I know what he's not going to do.

906
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:37,329
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

907
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:41,953
- Are you going to bet on this race?
- I don't know.

908
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:51,508
- Whatever you do, don't bet on that!
- Why not?

909
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,596
There's something wrong with its eyes.
It's blind. How can they put it in a race?

910
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:25,124
Let me get this straight,

911
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:28,835
whatever I do, don't bet this horse?

912
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:36,220
- Looney, Vicki.
- Nice to meet you.

913
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:47,596
I may faint. Don't worry.

914
01:17:47,816 --> 01:17:51,019
We got full medical coverage. I'll be OK.

915
01:17:55,782 --> 01:17:59,531
- Let it ride.
- Is it all in there?

916
01:17:59,744 --> 01:18:04,572
I spent some on the little woman,
but basically, yeah, it's all there.

917
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:09,287
- There are all kinds of balls.
- One of his is crystal!

918
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:16,759
I can't give you $50 win tickets.
That's over 1,300 tickets.

919
01:18:16,969 --> 01:18:18,962
It'll jam the machine.

920
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:25,016
We'll be here till Christmas!
The counting room!

921
01:18:25,227 --> 01:18:26,686
2,000...

922
01:18:42,077 --> 01:18:47,866
Right, I will now issue you with a receipt
to the value of your wager, $68,000,

923
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:51,915
on the number two horse,
which is called Hot-To-Trot.

924
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:55,747
- Should you lose this receipt...
- He won't lose it.

925
01:18:55,966 --> 01:19:00,960
Your bet will go through the computer
that adjusts the Tote board odds.

926
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:03,966
Hot-To-Trot's sitting at 40-1.

927
01:19:04,182 --> 01:19:08,131
A wager this size
is going to knock it down to maybe 8-1.

928
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:15,815
You're calm. Most guys come in here
are ready to gnaw the legs off the tables!

929
01:19:16,027 --> 01:19:18,185
That's 'cause I'm going to win.

930
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:21,073
You're a wonderful guy!

931
01:19:22,283 --> 01:19:24,240
What a guy!

932
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:33,458
- Some coke dealer went nuts again.
- Heavy better, make room!

933
01:19:38,131 --> 01:19:42,710
- Who do you like, Evangeline?
- I'm betting all of my $200

934
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:45,549
on the four horse, Stargazer, to show.

935
01:19:45,764 --> 01:19:48,433
Of course, I could lose. What if I lost?

936
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:52,141
- It's too late!
- Come on, Trotter! It doesn't matter.

937
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:55,438
All right. I had lobster, a few drinks.

938
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:58,898
Bought my wife a diamond necklace.
I'm OK.

939
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:05,230
I settled Looney's tab. Made friends,
like you and Vicki, the ticket seller.

940
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:08,735
You can't put a price on a day
like that, can you?

941
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:13,830
That's money for a ride home,
and dinner out somewhere, if I lose.

942
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:18,869
- But if I win, Reardon, if I win... !
- That is him!

943
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:30,137
- I was getting worried about you.
- I bet 20 on the favourite.

944
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,688
I put every penny
on the number two horse, Hot-To-Trot.

945
01:20:37,897 --> 01:20:43,140
You know, when the odds went to 8-1,
I knew it! He pissed it all away!

946
01:20:54,747 --> 01:20:57,416
- May the best horse win!
- The two!

947
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:08,543
- I think the two horse was limping!
- Shut up or die, you pessimistic jinx!

948
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:10,136
I can't see!

949
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:16,799
- Run, you son of a bitch!
- Come on, Hot-To-Trot!

950
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:22,730
- I swear I'll stop!
- I always swear I'll quit smoking.

951
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:26,392
- I don't think so.
- I bet you swore something secretly.

952
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:31,072
Who do you think you are,
Jimmy Swaggart? This is a horse race!

953
01:21:31,282 --> 01:21:36,324
- It just doesn't work that way!
- If my horse loses, I'll wring your neck!

954
01:21:39,123 --> 01:21:41,448
I can't see the two horse!

955
01:21:47,173 --> 01:21:51,087
- What do you see?
- Your horse is on the outside.

956
01:21:51,302 --> 01:21:54,172
- Stay on the track!
- It can't hear!

957
01:21:59,226 --> 01:22:01,847
Come on, Stargazer, move it!

958
01:22:02,062 --> 01:22:05,229
Keep it out of the money!
I'll give up all my smut!

959
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,524
Two horses pulled away,
and one's yours!

960
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,697
More ground to cover!

961
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:22,867
I'll leave Bernie. Pure love from now on.

962
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:26,036
I'll go for some poor guy with nothing.

963
01:22:29,964 --> 01:22:34,127
Let him have it.
I don't care about the lousy $200.

964
01:22:34,343 --> 01:22:36,170
Marry me?

965
01:22:37,346 --> 01:22:40,845
<i>They've got three eighths of a mile</i>
<i>left to go...</i>

966
01:22:44,895 --> 01:22:46,639
<i>It's Stargazer...</i>

967
01:22:56,365 --> 01:22:58,856
- They're pecker to pecker!
- Who?

968
01:22:59,076 --> 01:23:03,287
<i>- Stargazer on the inside...</i>
- Come on! Please!

969
01:23:05,373 --> 01:23:08,291
You can't shine a torch between them!

970
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,790
<i>It's Stargazer on the outside...</i>

971
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:14,254
- I'm getting something.
- Lord, give him a break!

972
01:23:14,465 --> 01:23:17,087
It's the two! Come on, two!

973
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:21,678
- Two!
- Go! Two!

974
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:24,724
- You can do it, two!
- Yes! Yes!

975
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:28,352
Come on!

976
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:36,986
I got it!

977
01:23:58,675 --> 01:24:04,594
<i>Stargazer just in front, but Hot-To-Trot's</i>
<i>coming up on the outside! Hot-To-Trot,</i>

978
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:08,590
<i>or Stargazer, and at the wire it's...</i>

979
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,138
<i>My God!</i>

980
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:13,393
Which was My God?

981
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:19,399
Thank God I'm poor and don't have
to worry about finishes like that!

982
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:22,648
I knew it! I knew it!

983
01:24:22,865 --> 01:24:26,565
- What the hell did he know?
- We knew it.

984
01:24:26,785 --> 01:24:29,572
Wouldn't it be hell if it gets disqualified?

985
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:31,580
Looney!

986
01:24:35,627 --> 01:24:37,584
I knew it!

987
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:43,673
Sorry. Excuse me.

988
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:52,636
Thanks. That was really sweet, honey.

989
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:54,346
This!

990
01:24:59,484 --> 01:25:03,730
I bet it all, honey. I let it all ride.

991
01:25:03,946 --> 01:25:06,318
It's only money.

992
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:11,945
- Let the guy have it, OK? He's sweet.
<i>- The winner of the tenth race,</i>

993
01:25:12,204 --> 01:25:14,161
<i>number two!</i>

994
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:18,584
Why are they cheering?

995
01:25:18,794 --> 01:25:22,792
Because they're having
a very good day.
