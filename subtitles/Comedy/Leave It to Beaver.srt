hand in an "A" paper and get away with it?

What about Hector?

You got him an "A" in Family Development.

Look, I've never written
anything for Hector. All right?

43
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,719
If he told you differently, he's a liar.

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,728
Hypothetically, had I written him something,

45
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,139
we would have
raised his grades incrementally.

46
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:32,300
And if that happened, then, yes,
he might have turned in an "A" paper.

47
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:35,404
He might even be making a "B"

- You and your dad?

158

Me and the Beaver.

- The Beaver?
- (DOOR OPENS)

160
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:33,651
Any idea where Walter
stuffed the power sander

161
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,415
you gave him two Christmases ago?

162
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:38,305
No?

163
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:40,782
No trouble. We'll make do.

164
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:43,884
MEREDITH: Walter, what's with the accent
and the puppet?

165

- Right.

Henry, mate, go see if you can find
that varnish we was talking about.

170

- I'll get it!
- Thanks, mate!

171

172
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,478
- Yes, I...
- Read the card.

173
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,455

- Read the card.

- No, hardly, love. Nothing funny about it.

Stop it with the puppet!

182
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,980
All right. I'm confused, Walter,
and I need some answers right now.

183
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,202
He said if I stick with it that maybe...

184
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,025
He? Who said that?

185
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,283
Dr. Macy.

186
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,429
Dr. Macy? You quit seeing him.

187
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,099
Well, I went back.

188
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,504
So this is some kind of a program?

189
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,447
I'll field that one. Yes, Meredith.
The answer is yes.

190
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,616
That is exactly what it is.

191
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:17,886
I know it seems radical,

192
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:21,752
but in cases like Walter's,
cases where all else has been known to fail,

193
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,823
it's proven quite effective.

194
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,563
But if it's going to work,
it's going to need your full support.

I'll come back this weekend, then.

No one sent me.

I really need help.

219

Look, you're the valedictorian, all right.
You have a 4.0.

220
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,433
I copy off of you in calculus.

221
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,778
Why would you want me
to write you a paper?

222
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:42,887
It's not a paper.

223
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,466
It's my graduation speech.

No one gives a shit about those things.

225

Yeah, well, my mom will. So...

226
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:57,341
Not that I'm saying that
you write other people's papers for them,

227
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:02,415
but if you did, I hear that you're really
good at making yourself sound like them.

228

Getting inside their heads.
That's what I need.

229
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,028
- No way.
- Why?

230
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:14,261
Because it's one thing for your little
anorexia squad to get by on their looks.

231
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:19,203
That's all they've got.
But for someone like you, it's just lazy.

232
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:21,024
Hold on.

233
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,059
Wait a minute.

234
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:25,435
Does this look lazy to you?

235
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,874
That is 428 pages of lazy.

236

And if you don't want to take my money
because you're just dying to see me

make an ass of myself, then that's fine.

how to actually make anything.

He was about your age, yeah. Cub Scouts.

269

He and his pop were supposed
to make a racecar for a contest.

Except, his pop weren't around
so he had to do it himself.

tools but no clue how to use them.

275

So, what he ended up making was so awful

of wheels onto a piece of dog crap.

00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:15,421
What the hell is this?

313
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,889
I have no idea.

314
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,051
This is layoffs, isn't it? Goddamn China.

315
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:20,867
WALTER: Nobody's getting laid off.

316
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,780
Get rid of you lot?

317
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,865
I'd have no one to boss around, yeah?

318
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:30,437
- The boss woke up and brought a friend.
- (PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

319
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:35,205
I think we should maintain some respect
until Mr. Black tells us...

320
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,626
Good morning, all.

321
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,479
I assume you all got the cards.

322
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,876
If not, allow me to briefly explain.

323
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:49,050
Walter Black ascended
to CEO of this company two years ago.

324
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:54,584
Not through any particular skill or merit,
but because Walter was next in line

325
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:59,257
rather than our infinitely more qualified VP
standing right here.

326
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:00,916
Hello, love.

327
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:05,166
It was a job Walter was, well,
ill-prepared to handle.

328
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,638
Basically, well...

329
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:10,600
Walter's been a loser.

330
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:18,277
Which is why, as of now, he is resigning
and putting me in charge.

331
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,855
So, before you decide to run me out on a rail
with all the flaming torches and pitchforks,

332
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:28,988
hear me out, give me five minutes,
then you may tear me to shreds, if you like.

333
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:33,829
First, I will be ceding control
of all individual projects

334
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,390
back to the teams themselves.

335
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,800
That means you will be free

336
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:40,430
and entrusted to do the jobs
you was hired to do in the first place.

337
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:41,557
Hello, Hank.

338
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:45,238
Second, we will revamp,
revitalize, re-launch

339
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:48,939
at the International Game
and Toy Manufacturers Expo

340
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,780
in six weeks' time.

341
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:57,179
Now, I know there's a very high degree
of skepticism about my ability to lead.

342
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:58,819
Isn't that right?

343
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:02,258
I mean, middle-aged man
with his arm stuck up my bum. Right?

344
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,659
Who wouldn't doubt me?
But I'll make you the following deal.

345
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:11,362
You give me two weeks, just two,
and at the end of that time,

346
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:14,668
anyone who wants to resign
will receive severance pay

347
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,970
and a glowing letter of recommendation.

348
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:20,206
- No questions asked, no exceptions.
- MAN: Excuse me?

349
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,266
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

350
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:25,449
Bollocks. Did I forget to introduce meself?

351
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,919
You may simply call me the Beaver.

352
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:37,787
Impressive.

353
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,412
So, what do you need to know?

354
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:46,431
Well, I guess the first thing is,
what do you want to say?

355
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:51,273
Well, that's kind of the problem.

356
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,807
I mean, I got good grades. Big deal.
What do I know?

357
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,646
Okay. Well, how do you want people to feel
when you're done?

358
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:04,514
I guess I just want them to feel not

359
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:06,785
let down.

360
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:07,975
"Not let down."

361
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:09,723
That's powerful.

362
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,490
"I'm excited, pumped. How are you doing?"

363
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,590
"Me? I'm not let down."

364
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:16,793
(LAUGHS)

365
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:19,666
I told you that I suck.
This is why I need you.

366
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:23,264
Okay, well, you're a cheerleader,
notorious hothead.

367
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:26,591
Could we talk about you getting expelled
from the eighth grade?

368
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:28,838
How did you find out about that?

369
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,574
No secrets on the Internet.

370
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,167
What did you do?

371
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,485
Did you steal some encyclopedias?

372
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,511
- Chew some nicotine gum?
- No.

373
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:38,488
What? Tease a fat kid?

374
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:40,073
Shut up.

375
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,725
All right. So, what is it?

376
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:45,526
I was tagging.

377
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,461
Tagging?

378
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,296
Like...

379
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:57,207
Like graffiti tagging?

380
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:01,568
More like art. It was just illegal.

381
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:06,972
Where's all this rebel-artist shit now?

382
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,509
That was a long time ago.

383
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:13,845
You still have some, don't you? Yeah.

384
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:16,150
- Show me, please.
- No.

385
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:20,596
If you show me, I will write you a speech
that you could free Tibet with.

386
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,097
Why do you want to see it so bad?

387
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,661
Because I like to be surprised.

388
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:31,805
- We have to be quick.
- All right.

389
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,439
Whose room is this?

390
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:37,043
NORAH: No one's.

391
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,584
Oh, wow.

392
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:03,298
I like to do it big.
Like freeways, buildings, billboards.

393
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:09,738
And fast.
Like I'm running a million miles an hour.

394
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,105
No thinking, you know?

395
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:16,813
Why did you stop?

396
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,048
'Cause I got caught
and my mom couldn't take it.

397
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:27,896
Anyway, I threw them all away.

398
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,404
Someone must have liked them.

399
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,266
Pulled them out of the trash, didn't they?

400
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:37,213
- Who was it?
- NORAH'S MOM: What are you doing in here?

401
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:41,709
I was just showing Porter around the house.

402
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,809
He's on the math team with me.

403
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:48,011
- Right.
- Time to go.

404
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:53,985
Hey, I'm sorry about my mom.

405
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:57,319
- She's just, you know...
- That's fine.

406
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,693
You know, you are

407
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,233
so much weirder...

408
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:14,232
Not weird, I just mean, like,
different, I guess.

409
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:18,244
You're a lot more different
than I thought you'd be.

410
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,548
You know, for someone I'm paying
a lot of money to write a speech for me,

411
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,039
you're not very articulate.

412
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,352
I'm much better on paper.

413
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,752
We'll see.

414
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,758
Thank you for not laughing, I guess.

415
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,278
I wouldn't do that.

416
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,123
I wouldn't laugh.

417
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,090
Good.

418
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,160
Very, very good.

- Walter. Walter, wake up. Wake up.
- Mmm. What?

439
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:29,474
It's Henry. He snuck out of his room.
He's down in the garage again by himself.

440
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,705
Well, tell him to come to bed.

441
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:36,613
I know. I tell him every night, but he needs
to hear it from, you know, you.

442
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,633
Yeah.

443
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:41,984
I'm on it.

444
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,989
Whoa, where are you going
this time of night?

445
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,329
I'm gonna tell the little guy
to knock it off so I can sleep.

446
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,380
Right.

447
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:55,799
I was going to the same place.
Come on. Let's triple-team him.

448
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,932
That's okay.
You've got your little furry friend.

449
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,124
Good night.

450
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,312
What are you making besides a racket?

451
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
You couldn't sleep, either?

452
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,453
Well, actually, mate,
I was having a brilliant kip

453
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,720
till you started banging away.

454
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,427
I just had this idea.

455
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,027
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's have the idea in the morning.

456
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,092
Just 10 more minutes, please?

457
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,796
Ten more minutes, all right, yes.

458
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:37,308
But no more mucking about with tools
when I'm not around. It's not safe.

459
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,138
Or when your mother's asked you not to.
Or at night.

460
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:44,080
Or in a toilet.
Or when you're climbing Mount Everest.

461
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,141
Or picking your nose. Agreed?

462
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,616
- Agreed.
- There you go.

463
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,519
Can you talk to me? I like it when you talk.

464
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,080
What do you want me to talk about?

465
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,562
Doesn't matter. Just talk.

466
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,030
You have a funny voice.

467
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:05,373
You're quite easily entertained, aren't you?

468
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,467
Give you a buzz saw, a block of wood,
and some chatter...

469
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:22,042
(WALTER HUMMING)

470
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,320
MEREDITH: Hey, Walter, did you talk to him?

471
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:27,290
Yes, and everything's fine.
He'll stick to the schedule.

472
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,684
What's going on?

473
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,455
I've had a breakthrough, love.
Got to get to work right away.

474
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,613
Now?

475
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,189
Not a moment to spare!

476
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,197
You're a goddess.

477
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,883
Sir? You're in early.

478
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,250
Just the woman I wanted to see.

479
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,372
Have a look at this.

480
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,221
Now, we need to get started on this
right away.

481
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,193
It's a beaver?

482
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,312
It's the future.

483
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:08,814
This?

484
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:11,322
WALTER: The Talking Beaver
Woodworking Set.

485
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:14,366
You get your basic tools, a block of wood

486
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:17,027
and a talking beaver
to work right alongside of you.

487
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,840
You should see the kids, love.

488
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,976
I mean, they've got their cell phones
and their computers,

489
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:23,612
but, wow, you give them a block of wood,
a hammer and a saw?

490
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:25,013
Bob's their bleeding auntie.

491
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:27,616
Their poor little brains are starving
for something like this.

492
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,018
So, you're talking about a new product line
for what? Christmas?

493
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,056
Christmas? I'm talking about right now,
woman. Today.

494
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,258
This morning.

495
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,190
I guess there could be an ancillary market
in more tools.

496
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:42,697
Maybe pre-cut lumber pieces?

497
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,790
Sort of like Lego kits but made of wood.

498
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,495
And you can work them
into shapes on your own.

499
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,965
Now, that's using your scone.

500
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,286
Not just made out of wood, is it? Let's go.

501
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,922
But this would mean, I mean,

502
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:57,777
even if we could get one ready in time,
this is all we would have for the Expo.

503
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,761
That's all we'll need, my darling.

504
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:12,159
<i>WALTER: (AS BEAVER)
And for every person that points out</i>

505
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,061
<i>that there's a rodent at the helm,</i>

506
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:19,625
<i>there's another to remind him or her that
production has already increased by 35%.</i>

507
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:23,802
<i>At the end of those first two weeks,
not one person resigns.</i>

508
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:25,356
<i>Not one.</i>

509
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:29,029
WALTER: Now, we're going to start with...

510
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:34,410
The Beaver, as a core item,
along with endless project kits

511
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:36,748
could produce an exponential return.

512
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:41,554
<i>The question is, do we want
to continue struggling merely to survive,</i>

513
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:46,526
or do we want to embrace something new,
something different,

514
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:48,687
<i>and see where it takes us?</i>

515
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,230
<i>WALTER: (AS BEAVER) Once again,
our beloved Jerry Co.</i>

516
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:59,501
has vision, power, energy, balls.

517
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:05,794
Item number three this morning,
we've got some fabrication concerns.

518
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,379
Why are you all laughing?

519
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,438
(PANTING)

520
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,556
Did you talk to Dr. Macy today?

521
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:56,890
Indeed. He says we're coming along
just brilliantly.

522
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:04,069
Well, did he give you some kind of a
timeline for when the treatment might be over?

523
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,402
No, nothing specific, love.

524
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:08,600
Like a week, or a month, or...

525
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:10,904
It's a process, love.

526
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:13,703
We'll know when the time is right.

527
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:19,418
Now, rest up, you delicious little tart.

528
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:21,920
There's more where that came from.

529
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:59,788
Hector, what do I always say, man?
Read it before you turn it in.

530
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:01,527
It was about your own family,
for Christ's sake.

531
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:04,495
I just figured since it was personal,
there wouldn't be no test questions on it.

532
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:07,659
- But your own grandma turned you in.
- Yes. She was so proud.

533
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:11,692
Talking about the stuff that you had wrote
about her back in the day in D.R.

534
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:14,472
And then all of a sudden,
she could just tell I knew nothing about it.

535
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:16,707
So, she starts crying.
She calls the principal, says she doesn't...

536
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,810
All right. My name stays out of this.
You understand that, right?

537
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:22,542
- She called me a liar and a cheater.
- All right, all right, all right. Look.

538
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:27,118
Okay, I'm gonna make
a dummy website, all right?

539
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,320
You tell them you sent in your money,
you got your paper.

540
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,346
That's all you know, okay?

541
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:34,592
Hector, look, I gotta go.

542
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:36,661
I'm gonna give you the website tomorrow,
all right?

543
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:38,789
- Hector!
- Yes, yes, yes.

544
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:40,195
Great. Good.

545
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:41,924
Norah!

546
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:43,692
- Hey.
- Hey.

547
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:48,067
- Why are you all sweaty?
- I was doing yoga.

548
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:51,469
- Manly.
- Downward Dog's a bitch.

549
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:56,376
- Are you busy tonight?
- Are you asking me out?

550
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:57,765
No. Not at all.

551
00:40:57,783 --> 00:41:01,014
I was just gonna casually inquire
if you're busy

552
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:04,354
without making it seem like I'd been
up all night planning something elaborate.

553
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:07,305
Have you been up all night
planning something elaborate?

554
00:41:07,306 --> 00:41:09,626
Yeah, I have, like, maps and stuff.

555
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:10,677
(LAUGHS)

556
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,094
You can pick me up at 7:00.
I have to be back at 12:00.

557
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,900
Awesome, so it's a date.
I mean, it is, right?

558
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,169
We'll see.

559
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:26,393
Cool.

560
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,508
Don't mess this up.

561
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,234
You let me lead, all right?

562
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:03,602
Are you almost ready? Reservation's at 8:00.

563
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:09,716
- Bloody hell, woman. Look at you.
- Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

564
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:12,087
- Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
- Yeah?

565
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:14,613
The girls whipped up
something special for me.

566
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,925
We're talking full-on tux, love.

567
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:24,599
Yeah. Just give us a minute to pop it on,
and we'll be off.

568
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,693
Wait, it's our anniversary, honey.

569
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:28,437
That's why I went for the penguin suit.

570
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:31,448
I do not want to celebrate
20 years of marriage with a puppet.

571
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:37,402
I'm sorry. I've been very patient
and I've been very supportive,

572
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,176
but I want you, not him.

573
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:45,920
Not tonight.

574
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:56,615
Hi.

575
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,530
Black, party of two.

576
00:43:12,281 --> 00:43:15,182
So, when do I get
to see some of your pages?

577
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,742
Never. It's a pyramid scheme.

578
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:20,188
- I didn't tell you that?
- No.

579
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,521
You didn't get the brochure?

580
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:25,389
- I'm kidding. I'll get it done.
- You better.

581
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:29,693
I'm not giving you 500 bucks just so you can
buy a flat screen for your dorm room.

582
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:32,495
I'm not buying a flat screen
for my dorm room.

583
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,618
Then, what?

584
00:43:34,636 --> 00:43:36,331
- A mummy.
- No mummy.

585
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,474
- Then, what? What's it going to?
- Nothing.

586
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,574
Mmm-mmm.

587
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:45,704
A guy like you
doesn't do anything for no reason.

588
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,442
You've got a plan.

589
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:59,426
I was listening to the radio and, apparently,
it's gonna be really hot this weekend.

590
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:04,661
Not hot-hot, just above average.

591
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:12,034
- So, how's work?
- Good. Yeah, busy.

592
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:14,558
Busy?

593
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:21,748
NORAH: Maps? That's what
you're saving all your money for?

594
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:22,807
Yeah.

595
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:26,119
Okay, explain, because right now, it's
looking like where you hide your bodies.

596
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,181
- It is. Every red dot is a dead body.
- (LAUGHING)

597
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:31,658
Just trying to be honest.

598
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:33,820
Okay, really, what's it for?

599
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:40,801
It's, like, all these places where
everything changed in the blink of an eye.

600
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:44,037
Like the balcony
where Martin Luther King got shot.

601
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:47,228
The train tracks where Woody Guthrie
hopped on his first train.

602
00:44:47,642 --> 00:44:48,692
And?

603
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:56,278
And I just visit them and then I end up
at Brown the day before school starts.

604
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,619
It's kind of like a find-yourself trip?

605
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:04,489
No. More like a lose-stuff trip.

606
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:08,789
What kind of stuff do you want to lose?

607
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:12,028
At last count, 49 things.

608
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:20,268
An elaborate, mysterious plan,
and a little weird.

609
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:23,792
But I like it.

610
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:27,241
It's your paper-writing dollars at work.

611
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:36,972
What was that for?

612
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,324
You said you liked to be surprised.

613
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:44,021
- Ready?
- For what?

614
00:45:58,044 --> 00:45:59,739
It's a great place.

615
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,340
It's kind of scary but beautiful.

616
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:09,720
Look, I wasn't sure which color you liked,
so I kind of got everything.

617
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,881
I hope you like sunburst yellow.

618
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:15,318
Porter? Porter, come on.
What are you doing?

619
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,322

794

<i>we just sink further and further down.</i>

799

<i>The only way to truly break out of the box</i>

800

<i>is just to get rid of it altogether.</i>

01:14:27,023 --> 01:14:28,115
Fine.

931
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:33,455
Just do something, all right?

932
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:36,726
Go outside, take a walk, steal a car.
I don't care.

933
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:39,825
I just don't want to find you back in bed
when I get home.

934
01:14:51,447 --> 01:14:53,210
NURSE: Your family's here.

935
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,753
It's okay. Go on.

936
01:15:14,436 --> 01:15:16,563
Hey, little fella. How are you?

937
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:18,431
Good.

938
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:20,200
What's that?

939
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:23,533
- It's a brain.
- Wow. It's a brain!

940
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:26,304
Mom says yours got broken.

941
01:15:26,715 --> 01:15:28,740
This will come in handy.

942
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:32,752
So, are you crazy?

943
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:36,213
Maybe.

944
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:37,552
We're working on it.

945
01:15:38,526 --> 01:15:41,393
Does that mean you can come home?

946
01:15:41,463 --> 01:15:42,783
We're working on that, too.

947
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:44,945
Hey, where's your brother?

948
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:49,428
Probably sleeping. It's all he does.

949
01:15:52,274 --> 01:15:53,639
Come here.

950
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:57,306
Come here! I'll bite you on your ear!

951

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

952
01:16:49,029 --> 01:16:50,291
Wow.

953
01:16:51,699 --> 01:16:53,929
I must have sent you 15 texts.

954
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,566
I'd given up on you.

955
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:02,133
Well, that makes two of us.

956
01:17:03,544 --> 01:17:07,344
You were right.
I guess I had some stuff to say.

957
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:12,273
Apparently, a lot of stuff.

958
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:17,845
Anyway, now you know what's on my mind,
so you can write my speech.

959
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:19,822
No.

960
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:22,554
I think I'm officially out of that business.

961
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:24,128
You owe me.

962
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:29,594
You made this for me.

963
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:32,032
Yesterday.

964
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,399
How come?

965
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,070
Because there's more
that belongs on a wall than,

966
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:40,543
"Norah has a dead brother."

967
01:17:42,715 --> 01:17:44,114
Even if it is a big mess.

968
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:47,115
It's amazing.

969
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:53,014
Funny. I think it's a mess,
and you think it's amazing.

970
01:17:53,092 --> 01:17:55,862
And I think you're amazing,
and you think you're a mess.

971
01:17:57,864 --> 01:18:01,425
You know what?
I don't want to think anymore.

972
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:09,006
You still owe me a speech.

973
01:18:09,742 --> 01:18:11,868
Just make sure it sounds like me.

974
01:18:19,184 --> 01:18:23,985
So, do I just sit here writing
and get arrested again?

975
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:26,616
No, take it with you, dummy.

976
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:29,960
Take it with me?

977
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,333

<i>Today I'm here to warn you
that you are being lied to.</i>

980
01:19:26,684 --> 01:19:31,553
<i>Our parents, our teachers, our doctors
have lied to us.</i>

981
01:19:31,655 --> 01:19:36,752
<i>And it's the exact same lie.
The same six words,</i>

982
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:39,329
<i>"Everything is going to be okay."</i>

983
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,128
<i>But what if it isn't?</i>

984
01:19:43,129 --> 01:19:47,303
<i>What if some of human experience
is just something you inherit,</i>

<i>like curly hair or blue eyes?</i>

986

<i>What if pain is just in your DNA

01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,330

01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:10,556
"Shit just happens."

992
01:20:11,094 --> 01:20:15,564
Okay, I'm sure, right now,
you're all thinking,

993
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:18,695
"Man, this is the darkest graduation speech
I've ever heard."

994
01:20:19,068 --> 01:20:22,037
And it is.
I agree with you, but I didn't write it.

995
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:31,506
I've spent so much time
waiting for this lie to come true

996
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:35,244
that I finally paid someone
to tell the truth for me.

997
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:40,212
I'm not okay.

998
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:42,224
Not at all.

999
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:46,891
The truth is,

1000
01:20:46,963 --> 01:20:49,227
I'm missing something,

1001
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,458
the thing I loved the most,

1002
01:20:53,736 --> 01:20:56,705
the face I wish
were in the front row right now.

1003
01:20:59,075 --> 01:21:01,771
The brother I'll never get back.

1004
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:08,942
So what do I do with that?

1005
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:14,647
What do any of us do,

1006
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:17,582
besides lie?

1007
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,023
This is what I believe.

1008
01:21:26,635 --> 01:21:31,368
Right now, in this auditorium,
there is someone who is with you.

1009
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,809
Someone who is willing to pick you up,
dust you off,

01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:37,139
kiss you, forgive you,

1011
01:21:38,113 --> 01:21:41,412
put up with you, wait for you, carry you,

1012
01:21:41,783 --> 01:21:43,182
<i>love you.</i>

1013
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,353
<i>So, while everything
may not always be okay,</i>

1014
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,452
<i>one thing I know is true.</i>

1015
01:21:53,128 --> 01:21:55,528
<i>You do not have to be alone.</i>

1016
01:22:38,005 --> 01:22:40,473
I didn't think you'd come.

1017
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:43,107
I didn't think I would, either.

1018
01:22:50,918 --> 01:22:52,783
I'm just glad you're still here.

1019
01:22:54,655 --> 01:22:56,520
Yeah, most of me, anyway.

1020
01:22:57,124 --> 01:22:58,648
Yeah.

1021
01:23:03,798 --> 01:23:05,766
You know, when I was a little kid,

1022
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:09,668
man, all I ever wanted was to be like you.

1023
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,206
Then I got older,

1024
01:23:16,876 --> 01:23:19,640
and I just wanted to be anybody else.

1025
01:23:26,386 --> 01:23:27,436
And now?

1026
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:34,952
Dad.
