1
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,674
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,136
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:16,969
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,754
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:24,138
Could be unrelated.

6
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,154
Could be.

7
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:29,908
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,930
No.

9
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,315
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,580
That’s what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,801
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,420
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,935
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,189
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,958
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:23,807
It’s kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,503
Go ahead.

18
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:33,375
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:35,390
See what I mean?

20
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:41,137
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,544
Tell me.

22
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,584
Well...

23
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,332
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,996
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:03,785
it’s not day or night...

26
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,668
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,799
But it looks just like this.

28
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:12,033
Except for the light.

29
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:16,477
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,485
Of all people...

31
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:23,306
you're standing right over there.

32
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:29,351
By that counter.

33
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,715
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:40,352
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,954
then I realize what it is.

36
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,873
There's a man...

37
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:55,900
in back of this place.

38
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,564
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,122
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,519
I can see his face.

41
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:18,380
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:30,630
That’s it.

43
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:35,011
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,341
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,384
Right then.

46
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,269
It’s around the back.

47
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:47,538
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:50,595
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,171
Hello?

50
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,258
The girl is still missing.

51
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:46,434
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,663
I can't believe it.

53
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,158
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:03,713
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:07,534
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:12,165
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,327
Won't that be the day?

58
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,792
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:21,173
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,411
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,610
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,411
Thank you.

63
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:40,760
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,107
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,461
Got it.

66
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,779
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,024
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:20,098
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:23,648
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,085
Wilkins!

71
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,331
Wilkins!

72
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:35,028
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:40,140
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:42,052
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,223
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:49,919
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:55,518
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:59,693
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

79
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,854
I can hardly wait.

80
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:13,267
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:18,760
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,443
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:25,129
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,630
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:31,142
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,959
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:03,871
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,622
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

89
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:12,497
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:17,128
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,879
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:22,904
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,719
What happened?

94
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,779
A car...

95
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:31,802
a car accident.

96
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,846
Are you okay?

97
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,194
I think so.

98
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,832
I was just...

99
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,133
taking a shower.

100
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:49,027
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:51,606
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:57,418
What’s your name?

103
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:05,066
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,008
My name is...

105
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,164
Rita.

106
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,817
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:55,099
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,533
it 's none of my business.

109
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:03,176
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,752
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:11,040
that 's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:13,577
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:17,720
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:20,921
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:24,359
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:27,946
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:35,350
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:40,055
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:44,989
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:54,845
Sit down.

121
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,237
Where were you hurt?

122
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:05,594
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:10,433
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:12,861
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,439
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:19,199
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:20,430
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:22,555
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,793
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:29,099
And that 's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:34,071
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,667
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,645
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,167
What was it the last time?

135
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:04,299
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,595
We'll see.

137
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,804
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,387
Please...

139
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,176
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:28,656
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:32,480
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

142
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:09,153
She's very pretty.

143
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:13,925
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,825
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,379
- What 's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,097
No, that 's it.

147
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:28,606
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,072
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,822
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,049
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:39,432
- What 's the photo for?
- It 's a recommendation.

152
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:43,253
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:47,876
- It 's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:52,475
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:57,000
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:30:57,213 --> 00:31:01,626
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:06,984
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,484
This is the girl.

159
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,861
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:14,359
Hold on?

161
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:17,148
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,194
Napkin.

163
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:36,831
Pardon?

164
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,544
Napkin.

165
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,978
Of course.

166
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,057
Excuse me.

167
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:01,815
Is that all, sir?

168
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:02,565
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,377
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,109
What 's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,805
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,056
It 's no longer your film.

173
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:30,119
This is the girl.

174
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,151
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,620
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,682
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:29,615
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:31,598
Beat it, pal.

179
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,150
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:23,715
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:27,129
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:33,292
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:38,055
I know they said...

184
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,981
Then?

185
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,217
Then...

186
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:47,624
that means we should...?

187
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,254
Yes?

188
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:57,674
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,974
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:12,397
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:45,374
Oh, man, that 's unheard of.

192
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:48,783
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:54,353
- It 's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,759
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:06,780
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:10,327
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,199
doing some stuff
for this guy.

198
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,333
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,209
Hardly.

200
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:22,539
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:26,396
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,640
Hey... man, it 's not that bad.

203
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,394
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:37,604
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,157
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,618
Hey, so that 's... that 's it, huh?

207
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:50,268
That 's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,870
The history of the world...

209
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,163
in phone numbers.

210
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,720
Oh, man!

211
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:45,131
Something bit me bad!

212
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,349
Hey, man!

213
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:40,169
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:44,738
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:50,581
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:12,605
Hey, man.

217
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:55,883
Oh, man!

218
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:17,738
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,132
inside out.

220
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:23,471
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,494
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,891
like a regular movie star.

223
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:30,961
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:34,196
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:36,279
Rita!

226
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,503
What do you mean?

227
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:41,632
She was in an accident.

228
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,494
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:49,679
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,360
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:56,454
She's sleeping.

232
00:41:57,438 --> 00:42:01,602
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:08,284
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:23,667
You're awake.

235
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:29,338
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,989
I thought you knew my aunt
and that 's why you were here.

237
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,639
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:45,062
Rita?

239
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,733
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,245
What is it, Rita?

241
00:42:56,692 --> 00:43:01,483
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,379
What 's wrong?

243
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,654
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:12,371
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:15,789
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,254
I don't know who I am.

247
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:32,485
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,693
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,998
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:18,252
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:20,310
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:22,813
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:26,398
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:31,866
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:39,514
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,683
No.

257
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:45,567
I haven't seen any.

258
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:49,007
A brunette?

259
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:51,860
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,575
No.

261
00:45:57,613 --> 00:46:01,196
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,520
You bet you will.

263
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,666
That money...

264
00:46:10,694 --> 00:46:13,612
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:20,465
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:25,444
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:30,312
There's something...

268
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:33,548
something...

269
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:36,539
there.

270
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:48,166
What did you say?

271
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:51,959
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:56,620
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,117
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,961
No.

275
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:07,754
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:09,553
I'm going home.

277
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:11,053
Home?

278
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,910
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:19,366
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:22,538
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:24,695
I'm going home.

282
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,563
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:44,008
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:50,891
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:55,306
That 's where I was going.

286
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:58,444
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,857
Maybe that 's where
the accident was.

288
00:48:03,563 --> 00:48:06,754
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,529
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:17,890
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:21,479
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,430
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:27,843
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:37,057
Okay.

295
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,565
But just...

296
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,812
just to see.

297
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:47,881
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:50,904
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:35,166
Lorraine?

300
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,642
You're home?

301
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:43,556
Lorraine?

302
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:05,541
Now you've done it!

303
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:11,209
Just forget you ever saw it.
It 's better that way.

304
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:17,026
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:31,426
What are you doing?

306
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:37,026
That 's my jewelry!

307
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:58,739
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,336
What are you doing?

309
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:10,666
Stop it!

310
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:12,239
Stop it!

311
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:14,499
Adam, stop it!

312
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,000
Stop it!

313
00:51:17,393 --> 00:51:18,745
Stop it!

314
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:25,382
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:51:25,603 --> 00:51:27,548
You're hurting me!

316
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:34,367
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,981
Throw him out!

318
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:40,138
Throw him out!

319
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:42,964
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,324
Throw him out!

321
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,358
Get out!

322
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:34,865
Let 's hide it.

323
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:22,113
There's one.

324
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:40,870
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:45,465
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:51,002
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:57,539
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,564
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:02,831
Yes, there was.

330
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,958
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:08,912
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,922
There was an accident.

333
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,781
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:26,000
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:28,534
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:36,336
Maybe it happened so late it 's
not in today's paper.

337
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:38,764
There's nothing?

338
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,316
Not that I can see.

339
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:45,381
That 's okay.

340
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,884
Thanks.

341
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:55,292
Diane.

342
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,562
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:05,378
Rita, you want something?

344
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:11,890
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:55:19,237 --> 00:55:21,313
What is it, Rita?

346
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:33,740
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:55:36,772 --> 00:55:40,212
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:55:40,426 --> 00:55:42,822
Maybe that 's my name!

349
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:51,349
"D. Selwyn." It 's the only one.

350
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:54,021
I'm gonna call.

351
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:05,753
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it 's not me.

352
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:16,427
Hello, it's me.

353
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:18,721
Leave a message.

354
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,966
That 's not my voice.

355
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:27,039
But I know her!

356
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,135
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that 's your roommate.

357
00:56:34,355 --> 00:56:38,661
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:41,936
Maybe.

359
00:56:42,322 --> 00:56:44,539
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:20,484
Adam Kesher?

361
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:26,542
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:29,255
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:57:29,466 --> 00:57:30,711
Get out!

364
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,607
Adam Kesher?

365
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:43,547
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:57:45,192 --> 00:57:47,730
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:49,993
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:57:50,202 --> 00:57:51,590
Gene!

369
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:53,434
Get out!

370
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:55,629
Get out!

371
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,500
Adam Kesher?

372
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:27,149
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:30,872
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:34,068
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:58:36,128 --> 00:58:40,197
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,663
My bank?

377
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:46,420
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:49,833
What 'd they say?

379
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:53,724
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:57,204
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:01,004
That 's unbelievable.

382
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:04,373
Well, look...

383
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:11,751
I don't know what 's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:59:14,227 --> 00:59:20,028
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:25,844
But I'm sorry, it 's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,891
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,779
they know where you are.

388
00:59:35,902 --> 00:59:37,705
Right.

389
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:40,702
I'm sorry.

390
01:00:04,293 --> 01:00:05,324
Hello?

391
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:09,291
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:13,994
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,409
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:20,885
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,452
I'm not broke!

396
01:00:22,977 --> 01:00:25,266
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:31,041
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:33,302
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,609
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:41,442
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:44,686
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:48,784
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:52,300
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:55,951
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what 's happening.

405
01:00:57,143 --> 01:01:00,547
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:05,871
- What 's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:09,865
And getting stranger.

408
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:14,882
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:01:15,653 --> 01:01:20,101
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:01:20,524 --> 01:01:25,875
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:29,460
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:32,102
Will you meet with him?

413
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:33,529
Yeah.

414
01:01:33,746 --> 01:01:37,814
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:41,878
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:46,885
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:52,463
- I don't think that 'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:55,972
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:01:56,188 --> 01:01:59,177
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:01:59,388 --> 01:02:02,934
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:02:03,146 --> 01:02:06,100
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:02:18,211 --> 01:02:22,315
It 's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It 's not too far away.

423
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:25,960
What 's wrong with that?

424
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:29,130
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:33,588
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:37,204
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:02:37,868 --> 01:02:41,451
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:43,713
and we'll find out.

429
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:59,153
It'll be okay.

430
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:03,926
It 's probably Coco.

431
01:03:07,512 --> 01:03:11,925
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,031
Who are you?

433
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:19,508
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:24,345
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:28,380
No, it 's not!
That 's not what she said.

436
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,874
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:37,148
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:40,768
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:03:41,435 --> 01:03:46,061
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:49,497
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:03:49,715 --> 01:03:52,776
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:56,733
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:03:56,952 --> 01:03:59,906
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:05,362
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:09,614
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:12,637
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:15,249
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:04:15,462 --> 01:04:17,478
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:04:17,689 --> 01:04:20,844
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:24,954
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:28,328
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,147
Good night.

453
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,173
Cowboy...

454
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:22,653
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:06:25,238 --> 01:06:27,527
Beautiful evening.

456
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:34,551
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:36,789
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:06:38,355 --> 01:06:41,451
No problem.
What 's on your mind?

459
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:45,480
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,820
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:50,875
Whatever.

462
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:54,774
A man's attitude...

463
01:06:55,021 --> 01:07:00,099
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,335
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:05,868
Sure!

466
01:07:06,086 --> 01:07:09,906
Did you answer because that 's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:07:10,122 --> 01:07:12,174
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:07:12,383 --> 01:07:16,618
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:07:17,394 --> 01:07:21,107
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:25,944
What 'd I say?

471
01:07:27,832 --> 01:07:31,759
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:35,795
So since you agree...

473
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:41,085
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:43,309
How's that?

475
01:07:44,844 --> 01:07:47,169
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:51,274
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:56,698
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:05,753
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:10,791
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:13,227
Can you try that for me?

481
01:08:13,444 --> 01:08:17,121
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:08:18,071 --> 01:08:23,314
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:25,478
One.

484
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:29,441
So let 's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:34,308
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:39,048
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:08:40,027 --> 01:08:45,899
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:51,852
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:08:52,274 --> 01:08:55,228
"This is the girl."

490
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:59,219
The rest of the cast can stay.
That 's up to you.

491
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,434
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:09:05,389 --> 01:09:09,909
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:09:10,921 --> 01:09:15,963
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:18,182
Good night.

495
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:48,038
- You're still here?
- I thought that 's what you wanted.

496
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:52,324
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:09:52,534 --> 01:09:55,559
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:59,839
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:04,041
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,415
it 's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:10:07,634 --> 01:10:09,995
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

502
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:13,612
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:10:13,827 --> 01:10:16,852
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:10:17,063 --> 01:10:19,210
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:22,276
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:26,381
Stop! Just stop it! That 's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:30,448
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,098
Get out of here before...

509
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:37,269
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:42,076
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:49,101
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:10:49,315 --> 01:10:52,305
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:59,083
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:02,529
Thank you, darling.

515
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:19,954
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:24,970
Betty?

517
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:34,784
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:50,751
What is it, Coco?

519
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,459
Your aunt called.

520
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:55,486
I was afraid of that.

521
01:11:55,697 --> 01:11:58,579
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:02,407
It 's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,981
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:08,291
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:12:08,501 --> 01:12:10,339
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:12:10,554 --> 01:12:12,843
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:12:14,102 --> 01:12:18,171
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:20,185
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:23,556
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,485
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:29,129
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:33,090
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:37,262
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:41,473
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:12:41,694 --> 01:12:45,965
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:57,628
Is everything all right?

537
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:03,045
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:08,472
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:13:28,385 --> 01:13:30,817
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:34,263
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:38,364
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:09,814
"Voilà!"

543
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:13,540
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:15,937
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:14:17,026 --> 01:14:20,122
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:22,657
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:25,469
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:27,706
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:32,297
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,568
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:14:35,778 --> 01:14:39,942
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,630
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:47,878
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:14:48,686 --> 01:14:54,107
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:14:56,481 --> 01:14:57,761
Hi.

556
01:14:58,429 --> 01:15:02,070
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:06,596
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:15:06,813 --> 01:15:08,687
No, I'm fine.

559
01:15:08,901 --> 01:15:11,891
Well then,
let 's everyone take a seat.

560
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:21,076
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:24,277
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:27,643
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:15:27,863 --> 01:15:30,366
No. It 's not a contest.

564
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:33,459
The two of them...

565
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,908
with themselves.

566
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:41,285
So don't play it for real...

567
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,420
until it gets real.

568
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,202
Okay.

569
01:15:51,836 --> 01:15:54,090
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:15:54,307 --> 01:15:55,374
What?

571
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:59,271
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:15:59,629 --> 01:16:03,069
what 's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:07,446
That 's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,442
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:17,333
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:21,024
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:24,605
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,135
- What 's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:31,392
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:16:31,604 --> 01:16:37,334
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:16:40,094 --> 01:16:42,940
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:45,624
Bob?

583
01:16:47,956 --> 01:16:49,486
And...

584
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:52,020
action!

585
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:57,904
You're still here.

586
01:16:59,508 --> 01:17:00,931
I came back.

587
01:17:01,387 --> 01:17:04,648
- I thought that 's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:17:04,866 --> 01:17:06,361
Really?

589
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:10,676
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:17:10,885 --> 01:17:12,617
So, surprise!

591
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:18,223
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:17:34,265 --> 01:17:37,254
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:41,283
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:44,177
it 's not gonna work.

595
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:50,021
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

596
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:54,752
Get out.

597
01:17:56,707 --> 01:17:59,340
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:03,732
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:06,726
best friend.

600
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:13,436
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:19,522
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:18:20,123 --> 01:18:22,068
Stop.

603
01:18:22,558 --> 01:18:24,574
Stop it.

604
01:18:26,037 --> 01:18:28,849
That 's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:34,589
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,875
So get out of here...

607
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,897
before...

608
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:51,566
Before what?

609
01:19:09,563 --> 01:19:11,615
Before...

610
01:19:12,242 --> 01:19:14,982
I kill you.

611
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:32,346
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:43,308
I hate you.

613
01:19:44,286 --> 01:19:46,469
I hate us both.

614
01:20:02,622 --> 01:20:05,017
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:20:09,058 --> 01:20:11,525
Well, there it was.

616
01:20:12,189 --> 01:20:17,089
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:20:18,034 --> 01:20:19,244
Bob?

618
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:23,660
Very good. Really.

619
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:30,243
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:35,047
Very good. Really!

621
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,337
Really.

622
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:47,910
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:49,755
I mean, it was...

624
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:51,884
extraordinary.

625
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:54,249
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:58,211
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:20:58,429 --> 01:21:02,771
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,738
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:10,738
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:21:10,955 --> 01:21:14,395
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:19,021
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:21:19,235 --> 01:21:22,046
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:21:22,262 --> 01:21:25,489
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:27,263
Bye.

635
01:21:28,907 --> 01:21:30,531
Bye!

636
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:37,913
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:21:38,545 --> 01:21:40,621
God, that was awful!

638
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:45,984
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:50,505
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:21:50,722 --> 01:21:53,818
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:21:54,062 --> 01:21:56,079
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:21:56,289 --> 01:22:00,773
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:22:00,986 --> 01:22:04,592
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:22:04,814 --> 01:22:07,447
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt 's.

645
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:10,763
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:22:10,972 --> 01:22:13,997
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:22:14,381 --> 01:22:20,111
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:22:20,922 --> 01:22:23,698
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:22:23,915 --> 01:22:25,647
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:28,188
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:31,212
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:35,772
Sixteen reasons

653
01:22:35,988 --> 01:22:41,718
Why I love you

654
01:22:42,703 --> 01:22:46,072
- One
- The way you hold my hand

655
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:48,991
- Two
- Your laughing eyes

656
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:52,470
- Three
- The way you understand

657
01:22:52,688 --> 01:22:55,713
- Four
- Your secret sighs

658
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:01,900
They are part
of sixteen reasons

659
01:23:02,117 --> 01:23:07,397
Why I love you

660
01:23:08,657 --> 01:23:11,753
- Five
- The way you comb your hair

661
01:23:11,963 --> 01:23:15,059
- Six
- Your freckled nose

662
01:23:15,268 --> 01:23:18,638
- Seven
- The way you say you care

663
01:23:18,852 --> 01:23:22,328
- Eight
- Your crazy clothes

664
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,829
That's just half

665
01:23:25,045 --> 01:23:27,715
Of sixteen reasons

666
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:33,213
Why I love you

667
01:23:34,648 --> 01:23:37,982
- Nine
- Snuggling in the car

668
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:40,938
- Ten
- Your wish upon a star

669
01:23:41,155 --> 01:23:44,701
- Eleven
- Whispering on the phone

670
01:23:44,913 --> 01:23:47,618
- Twelve
- Your kiss when we're alone

671
01:23:47,835 --> 01:23:50,646
- Thirteen
- The way you thrill my heart

672
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:54,017
- Fourteen
- Your voice so neat

673
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:57,262
- Fifteen
- You say we'll never part

674
01:23:57,473 --> 01:24:00,877
- Sixteen
- Our love's complete

675
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,625
Those are all

676
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,579
Of sixteen reasons

677
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:12,467
Why I love you

678
01:24:13,754 --> 01:24:17,016
Sixteen reasons

679
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:22,276
Why I love you

680
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:28,984
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:31,741
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:24:32,438 --> 01:24:35,036
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:24:35,257 --> 01:24:38,139
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:24:38,354 --> 01:24:41,308
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,880
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:24:44,094 --> 01:24:48,816
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:24:49,035 --> 01:24:52,095
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:24:52,306 --> 01:24:55,117
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:58,854
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:24:59,348 --> 01:25:01,815
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:25:03,174 --> 01:25:05,571
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,362
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:25:15,631 --> 01:25:19,237
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:22,308
Okay, here we go.
Let 's lock it up, please.

695
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:25,403
- Roll sound, please.
- That 's fit.

696
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:27,490
Playback and action.

697
01:25:41,447 --> 01:25:43,807
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,494
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,512
Every little star

700
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:53,998
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:58,486
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:25:59,191 --> 01:26:03,462
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:26:05,767 --> 01:26:09,622
Made my heart an open book

704
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:14,917
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,588
Friends ask me
Am I in love

706
01:26:21,806 --> 01:26:25,661
I always answer “yes"

707
01:26:25,877 --> 01:26:29,732
Might as well confess

708
01:26:29,948 --> 01:26:33,494
If the answer's yes

709
01:26:33,879 --> 01:26:37,877
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:42,052
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:26:42,508 --> 01:26:45,948
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:26:56,772 --> 01:26:58,883
This is the girl.

713
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,478
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:27:17,892 --> 01:27:19,836
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,460
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,958
I promised a friend.

717
01:27:34,836 --> 01:27:38,442
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:28:02,845 --> 01:28:04,921
Should be around here.

719
01:28:05,802 --> 01:28:08,163
259O. That 's it.

720
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:11,362
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,812
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:26,602
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:30,669
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:29:19,423 --> 01:29:22,164
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:48,226
Now you got me scared.

726
01:30:12,552 --> 01:30:13,939
You see?

727
01:30:14,152 --> 01:30:17,177
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:31:19,005 --> 01:31:20,393
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,431
Don't.

730
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:53,377
No one's home.

731
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,215
Yes?

732
01:31:56,582 --> 01:31:58,420
Diane?

733
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:02,277
Number 17.

734
01:32:04,062 --> 01:32:06,600
But it said number 12.

735
01:32:08,376 --> 01:32:10,357
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:14,423
She's in 17.
It 's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:32:19,058 --> 01:32:21,976
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:32:24,103 --> 01:32:26,391
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,588
I'll go with you.

740
01:32:30,609 --> 01:32:33,076
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:32:38,507 --> 01:32:41,424
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:32:56,425 --> 01:33:00,067
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:40,430
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:34:09,837 --> 01:34:12,435
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:34:13,595 --> 01:34:16,228
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:34:17,005 --> 01:34:18,594
No!

747
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:24,895
Come on.

748
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:31,057
Come on!

749
01:36:56,599 --> 01:36:59,375
I know what you're doing.

750
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:22,827
I know what you have to do.

751
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:27,801
But let me do it.

752
01:37:35,985 --> 01:37:38,867
Let me do it.

753
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:04,435
You look like someone else.

754
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,030
Good night, Betty.

755
01:38:28,243 --> 01:38:31,019
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,964
What?

757
01:38:33,184 --> 01:38:34,987
The wig!

758
01:38:35,202 --> 01:38:40,587
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:38:41,256 --> 01:38:43,723
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:38:43,935 --> 01:38:48,098
- No, it 's okay.
- No, it 's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:50,534
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:26,062
It 's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:39:35,288 --> 01:39:37,435
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:39:38,141 --> 01:39:42,863
It 's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:39:43,082 --> 01:39:44,885
No, I mean...

766
01:39:45,692 --> 01:39:47,874
thank you for everything.

767
01:39:52,129 --> 01:39:53,753
You're welcome.

768
01:40:03,923 --> 01:40:06,390
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:40:16,032 --> 01:40:18,143
Good night.

770
01:40:59,974 --> 01:41:02,644
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:06,156
I don't know.

772
01:41:06,376 --> 01:41:07,965
Have you?

773
01:41:22,102 --> 01:41:25,020
I want to with you.

774
01:41:50,598 --> 01:41:53,623
I'm in love with you.

775
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:10,600
I'm in love with you.

776
01:42:36,732 --> 01:42:39,543
Silence.

777
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:42,711
Silence.

778
01:42:44,143 --> 01:42:46,681
Silence.

779
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:50,292
There's no band.

780
01:42:51,276 --> 01:42:53,874
There's no band.

781
01:42:54,755 --> 01:42:57,566
There's no orchestra.

782
01:42:59,104 --> 01:43:01,216
Silence!

783
01:43:16,396 --> 01:43:19,457
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:43:20,015 --> 01:43:22,375
Rita, wake up!

785
01:43:26,276 --> 01:43:27,901
It 's okay. It 's okay.

786
01:43:28,121 --> 01:43:30,138
No, it 's not okay.

787
01:43:31,078 --> 01:43:33,439
What 's wrong?

788
01:43:34,175 --> 01:43:36,880
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:43:38,315 --> 01:43:41,755
It 's two o'clock. It 's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:43:45,413 --> 01:43:48,438
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:43:48,649 --> 01:43:50,665
Sure.

792
01:43:50,876 --> 01:43:52,370
Now?

793
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,056
Right now.

794
01:45:30,278 --> 01:45:33,303
There's no band!

795
01:45:34,175 --> 01:45:37,271
There is no band!

796
01:45:42,317 --> 01:45:44,226
This is all...

797
01:45:44,857 --> 01:45:47,253
a tape recording.

798
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:50,420
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:45:51,258 --> 01:45:53,761
we hear a band.

800
01:45:54,286 --> 01:45:57,382
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:45:57,939 --> 01:45:59,813
listen...

802
01:46:13,491 --> 01:46:16,682
A muted trombone.

803
01:46:30,713 --> 01:46:34,568
A muted trumpet.

804
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:55,205
It 's all recorded.

805
01:46:57,609 --> 01:47:00,563
There's no band!

806
01:47:01,923 --> 01:47:03,867
It is all...

807
01:47:04,463 --> 01:47:06,824
a tape.

808
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:23,877
It is an illusion.

809
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:30,517
Listen!

810
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:50,021
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:48:50,476 --> 01:48:53,217
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:48:53,433 --> 01:48:56,659
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:19,732
I was all right

814
01:49:19,945 --> 01:49:23,006
For a while

815
01:49:23,215 --> 01:49:29,717
I could smile for a while

816
01:49:29,931 --> 01:49:33,335
But I saw you last night

817
01:49:33,549 --> 01:49:37,547
You held my hand so tight

818
01:49:37,759 --> 01:49:44,711
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:49:45,135 --> 01:49:49,762
You wished me well and you

820
01:49:49,971 --> 01:49:53,233
Couldn't tell

821
01:49:53,451 --> 01:49:59,146
That I've been crying

822
01:49:59,366 --> 01:50:02,355
Over you

823
01:50:02,567 --> 01:50:06,007
Crying

824
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,817
Over you

825
01:50:09,351 --> 01:50:15,224
Since you said “so long"

826
01:50:15,788 --> 01:50:22,288
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:50:22,711 --> 01:50:26,566
Lonesome and crying

828
01:50:27,094 --> 01:50:30,049
Crying

829
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:33,804
Crying

830
01:50:34,018 --> 01:50:36,521
Crying

831
01:50:36,733 --> 01:50:43,435
It's hard to understand

832
01:50:43,656 --> 01:50:50,158
That upon seeing you again

833
01:50:50,372 --> 01:50:54,643
I'd be crying

834
01:50:55,381 --> 01:50:58,501
I thought

835
01:50:58,722 --> 01:51:01,818
That I was over you

836
01:51:02,027 --> 01:51:08,979
But it's true, so true

837
01:51:09,195 --> 01:51:12,670
I love you even more

838
01:51:12,883 --> 01:51:16,429
Much more than I did before

839
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:22,513
But darling, what can I do

840
01:51:22,729 --> 01:51:28,566
You don't love me anymore

841
01:51:28,783 --> 01:51:35,735
And I will always be

842
01:51:36,299 --> 01:51:42,906
Crying over you

843
01:51:43,116 --> 01:51:49,202
Crying over you

844
01:51:49,414 --> 01:51:55,702
Your love has captured

845
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,721
The whole of my heart

846
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:05,689
That was left crying

847
01:52:05,907 --> 01:52:09,168
Crying

848
01:52:09,385 --> 01:52:12,541
Crying

849
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:16,201
Crying

850
01:53:36,939 --> 01:53:38,991
Betty?

851
01:53:42,018 --> 01:53:43,750
Betty?

852
01:53:55,831 --> 01:53:58,643
Where are you?

853
01:56:41,757 --> 01:56:43,596
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:56:44,576 --> 01:56:46,520
Time to wake up.

855
01:58:23,631 --> 01:58:26,691
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:58:27,354 --> 01:58:30,308
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:58:32,119 --> 01:58:35,037
Come on, Diane,
it 's been three weeks.

858
01:58:37,408 --> 01:58:40,504
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:59:00,441 --> 01:59:04,082
- That 's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:59:15,854 --> 01:59:20,196
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
01:59:29,597 --> 01:59:31,744
This is it?

862
01:59:37,357 --> 01:59:40,903
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
02:00:34,868 --> 02:00:36,980
Camilla!

864
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:41,854
You've come back.

865
02:02:23,318 --> 02:02:26,307
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
02:02:26,832 --> 02:02:28,599
I said...

867
02:02:29,058 --> 02:02:31,798
you drive me wild.

868
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:46,798
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
02:02:53,169 --> 02:02:55,529
Don't say that.

870
02:03:00,232 --> 02:03:03,150
Don't ever say that.

871
02:03:03,364 --> 02:03:05,273
Don't, Diane!

872
02:03:05,486 --> 02:03:06,944
Stop it!

873
02:03:07,156 --> 02:03:08,816
Diane, stop!

874
02:03:09,975 --> 02:03:12,680
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
02:03:21,178 --> 02:03:23,431
It 's him, isn't it?

876
02:03:35,026 --> 02:03:38,324
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
02:03:39,584 --> 02:03:42,609
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
02:03:47,133 --> 02:03:50,431
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
02:03:50,647 --> 02:03:52,141
just relax.

880
02:03:53,013 --> 02:03:57,141
Now, the two of you are alone
and it 's real comfortable.

881
02:03:58,789 --> 02:04:01,421
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:04,939
Even if you don't say anything,
it 's real comfortable.

883
02:04:06,651 --> 02:04:10,127
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:13,222
- Let 's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
02:04:13,436 --> 02:04:16,033
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
02:04:17,089 --> 02:04:20,351
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
02:04:20,568 --> 02:04:24,114
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
02:04:24,326 --> 02:04:26,129
Diane!

889
02:04:31,528 --> 02:04:34,897
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
02:04:37,026 --> 02:04:41,854
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
02:04:45,829 --> 02:04:47,881
And when you kiss her...

892
02:04:49,447 --> 02:04:52,436
it 's just a continuation
of that move.

893
02:04:54,805 --> 02:04:56,916
There's no break.

894
02:05:21,839 --> 02:05:24,056
Kill the lights!

895
02:05:34,433 --> 02:05:37,209
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:05:37,425 --> 02:05:41,066
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:05:41,287 --> 02:05:44,134
No fucking way!
It 's not gonna be!

898
02:05:44,906 --> 02:05:47,444
- It 's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:07:11,575 --> 02:07:14,837
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:07:17,559 --> 02:07:19,291
Diane?

901
02:07:23,822 --> 02:07:26,740
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:07:28,345 --> 02:07:29,768
Camilla.

903
02:07:29,981 --> 02:07:33,871
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:07:34,817 --> 02:07:37,070
You coming?

905
02:07:42,541 --> 02:07:46,812
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:07:47,551 --> 02:07:51,192
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:07:51,622 --> 02:07:54,398
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:00,487
Okay.

909
02:08:00,702 --> 02:08:04,665
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:08:05,608 --> 02:08:07,790
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:09:17,212 --> 02:09:20,581
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:27,510
A surprise.

913
02:09:50,438 --> 02:09:52,277
Shortcut.

914
02:09:54,856 --> 02:09:57,359
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:10:02,685 --> 02:10:04,630
It 's beautiful.

916
02:10:04,843 --> 02:10:07,168
A secret path.

917
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,063
Perfect timing.

918
02:11:17,768 --> 02:11:19,915
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:11:25,527 --> 02:11:29,073
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:11:39,617 --> 02:11:42,464
Here's to love.

921
02:11:47,238 --> 02:11:49,385
Here she is!

922
02:11:57,954 --> 02:12:00,801
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:12:01,503 --> 02:12:03,934
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:12:04,147 --> 02:12:07,825
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:12:08,218 --> 02:12:11,136
Well, let 's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:12:17,471 --> 02:12:19,583
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:12:40,018 --> 02:12:42,651
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:12:43,219 --> 02:12:47,003
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:12:49,864 --> 02:12:52,640
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:12:53,448 --> 02:12:56,639
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:12:57,345 --> 02:13:00,501
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:13:01,102 --> 02:13:04,507
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:13:05,208 --> 02:13:07,675
When my aunt died...

934
02:13:08,861 --> 02:13:11,815
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:15,254
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:13:16,376 --> 02:13:17,764
Yes.

937
02:13:19,229 --> 02:13:21,555
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:13:23,335 --> 02:13:27,190
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:13:27,406 --> 02:13:30,360
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:13:30,572 --> 02:13:33,205
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:13:42,819 --> 02:13:45,736
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:13:47,168 --> 02:13:50,572
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:13:53,709 --> 02:13:55,654
The director...

944
02:13:55,865 --> 02:13:57,810
Bob Rooker?

945
02:13:58,023 --> 02:13:59,790
Yes.

946
02:14:02,338 --> 02:14:05,149
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:14:09,331 --> 02:14:12,177
Anyway, that 's when
we became friends.

948
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:15,303
She helped me...

949
02:14:15,837 --> 02:14:18,933
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:14:21,265 --> 02:14:23,317
I see.

951
02:14:38,174 --> 02:14:42,338
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:14:44,715 --> 02:14:48,642
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:14:55,257 --> 02:14:58,033
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:15:51,726 --> 02:15:54,466
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,324
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:16:05,086 --> 02:16:07,518
Camilla and I...

957
02:16:19,665 --> 02:16:21,467
are going to be...

958
02:16:34,069 --> 02:16:36,121
Sorry about that.

959
02:16:43,601 --> 02:16:45,713
No, I'm fine.

960
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:54,004
This is the girl.

961
02:16:55,013 --> 02:16:57,931
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:16:58,632 --> 02:17:01,893
It 's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:17:03,503 --> 02:17:05,935
You got the money?

964
02:17:06,148 --> 02:17:08,224
I sure do.

965
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:23,152
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it 's a done deal.

966
02:17:26,606 --> 02:17:29,144
You sure you want this?

967
02:17:33,982 --> 02:17:36,900
More than anything in this world.

968
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:50,541
When it 's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:18:04,321 --> 02:18:07,132
What 's it open?

970
02:22:32,259 --> 02:22:35,249
Silence!

971
02:22:31,859 --> 02:22:34,361
Silencio.
