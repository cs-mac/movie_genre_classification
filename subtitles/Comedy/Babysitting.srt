1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,400
<I> I'm That Franck Amory. Pretty in pictures but less real. </ I>

2
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,800
<I> I work at Publisher Schaudel, who spends a lot of comics. </ I>

3
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,400
<I> As a child I was fond of drawing and especially manga. </ I>

4
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,200
<I> The two next to me are my best friends. </ I>

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
<I> We are all changed ... Yet almost all of them. </ I>

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,300
<I> The guy with the Ray-Ban is Sam. </ I>

7
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,200
<I> He works at Manpower. Since he works </ i>

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,000
<I> the number of female workers has increased from 32 to 80%. </ I>

9
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,000
<I> This is Alex, the nicest guy I know, but also the weirdest. </ I>

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
<I> He works as a courier, to the chagrin of his boss. </ I>

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
<I> He loves speed and Fast and Furious. </ I>

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
<I> Today is June 25. </ I>

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,800
<I> A special day for me because it's my birthday. </ I>

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,900
<I> Happy birthday, Franck. Kisses. </ I>

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
<I> Day Sonia. Thanks. See you soon, I hope. </ I>

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,300
Happy birthday.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Thanks, buddy. That's sweet. - Please.

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Just kidding. It is a package for Aurelie Goudart.

19
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
Look what I found in the van.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Should you deliver anywhere? - As long as he does not claim it ...

21
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Fantastic, eh.

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
And such a great zoom.

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,100
I'll see you, fatso.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,100
What a fat guy. - I have to go.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,100
See you for the groceries. Day.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,300
That's like me. This guy takes me to his home.

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,500
He starts to fuck me. But then his girlfriend inside

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,600
while we are doing. You would not do that.

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,400
She's gonna freak out, "You fucked my friend."

30
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,400
I said, "Wait a minute, I fuck him, so he is my love."

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,800
And you know what she said? "What is your problem?"

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,400
I say ". Nothing What is your problem?" And when she held her tongue.

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,300
I fuck him, that's all.

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,700
Estelle, I ... - I fuck him, he fucks me, nothing more.

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Wait, Mom. What?

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,000
I have to see the boss. - Why?

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
Hope for a better life. - Hurry.

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm going to do everything alone.

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Sorry, what did you say?

40
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
What floor are you going?

41
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
<I> Is that Scream 4? </ I>

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,400
And then? If you have no friends, go on Facebook.

43
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,800
What are you gawking at me like that? I'm not your sweetheart.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Get out of here.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,700
Imbecile.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,900
Sidney's cousin is the killer.

47
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Goodbye, pus.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,700
The rear is cut reason. A lousy courier.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Not really? On the contrary. I do not want to arrive in a wreck.

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,400
At one time we both have a break I want to take advantage of the convertible.

51
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
I have to show. Kiss.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,700
What are you doing here? Are you new?

53
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,700
I've been working for two years at the reception. I'm Franck Amory.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
What are you doing in my office?

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,100
I draw comics. I work here and hope I can show my drawings.

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,000
And today I thought, "I'm just going to ask and" ...

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you for calling me back.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
ASAP.

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,300
Why, a week? It's just a mirror.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
But it just depends what loose.

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I come to you, I'll be there in five minutes.

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Mr. Schaudel?

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,900
Do a squirrel after.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
And now a dinosaur. - No.

65
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,600
Come on. One million views on YouTube, you get money.

66
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Your grandmother is a prehistoric animal.

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,300
Come on, Sam, please. - Stop it.

68
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,900
My camera, now look.

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
Boys, so much alcohol?

70
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,600
You are 30. You want us to buy Kidibul?

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
But so much.

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Laure comes. That there are already 33 - 33?

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Who all? - Sandrine, Laure, Lucie, Claire ...

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,500
Who? I know of no one. - That's nothing. They are handsome chicks.

75
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Especially Lucie, new on the job, with huge boobs.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She is married, but we forgive her.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Are there any chicks you do not like handsome? - Yes, your exes.

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,600
That is not love for your mother.

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,100
This is not for my birthday. You organize this party for you.

80
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,700
Well, if not confirm your friends ...

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,300
Who has not confirmed? - Sébastien, Sylvain, Sonia Lamar ...

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
Sonia Lamar, who does not.

83
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
Who is that? - My ex.

84
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,500
She also worked at Schaudel. Now she sells cupcakes.

85
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,400
I do not know her. When was that?

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,700
Last year, on her farewell drink.

87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,100
<I> She kissed me on I Want You Back by The Jackson 5. </ I>

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
His long you been together?

89
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes and no ... - When did you see her last?

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,400
At her farewell drink.

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,700
That was quite a relationship. - Many plans made sure?

92
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,100
Just stop. I gotta get back to work.

93
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
And do not laugh, you. You must pay for your chicks.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,200
That again is not love for his mother.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
<I> Hi, honey. Everything good? - Yes </ i>.

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
<I> The babysitter was attacked in the subway. </ I>

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,500
<I> That's terrible. - Yes, they can not come three weeks, </ i>.

98
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,500
No, I mean for us. Who is the little fit?

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
<I> If you go alone, I watch out Remi. </ I>

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,100
But it is the night of the publishers.

101
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,000
Everyone comes with his partner. What about me?

102
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll find a solution. Big kiss.

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
My best Franáois, that's good.

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Franck. - Also good. Do you have plans tonight?

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,700
Yes. - Okay, you come watch my son.

106
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,600
That is difficult. My birthday and ... - Franáois.

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,100
Would you like me Monday show your drawings?

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Yes, but ... - Perfect.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,000
19 hours, Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,100
We have everything in the house, but what could I say?

111
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
This opportunity I can not pass up.

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,400
Besides, can you bring me? - Where is it?

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,400
Forget about it. I do not have my passport. - Is it so far?

115
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,800
<I> Yeah, who's there? - Hello, I'm babysitting </ i>.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,900
Franáois day. - Franck.

117
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry, Franck. I'm Claire.

118
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Thank you for coming fit Rami.

119
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,500
You're welcome.

120
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,700
Franáois day. That lasted long.

121
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
It is far away. Half hours.

122
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,600
Had said that, you could have a ride with me.

123
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,000
Good. I'll show you the house.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Come on in.

125
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Can you take off your shoes? - Sure.

126
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
Thanks.

127
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,500
There is an artist in your son. - That's mine.

128
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,200
I paint since I stay home for Rami.

129
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,900
This is the sitting room, the remote controls

130
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,200
the television, the DVD player

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,300
the blinds, the curtains, and the fireplace.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,700
The fish I have given food.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,100
And Phoenix also.

134
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,800
A beautiful beast. - Marc is fascinated by ornithology.

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
A rare species. He has him for twenty years.

136
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,800
He got him before we knew each other.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
There is the kitchen.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Rami takes morning Nesquik, a roll with Nutella.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Why in the morning? - We come back tomorrow around 18 hours.

140
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,700
Ah so? - I forget the most important.

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Rami has asthma. This is his puffer in the case of.

142
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
In the cabinets ...

143
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
No, you can put anything on the cabinet.

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,700
That sign is all that Marc has his father.

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
He is extremely attached to it.

146
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,000
Your room is upstairs next to the playroom Rami. I will call him.

147
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Rami, you can just come down?

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
This is Franck.

149
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
Say day, Rami. - Day Rami.

150
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,600
He is shy, within two hours is about.

151
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,600
Go give your daddy a kiss? He is loading.

152
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,700
Why does not he? - Please, darling. He's busy.

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
As usual. - What are we waiting for?

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,500
What's wrong? - You should come to the football.

155
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,600
I have to it for my work, not to play golf.

156
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Next time I will definitely participate, I promise. - But it is the final.

157
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,900
The next time then. And I buy a sweater from PSG. Okay?

158
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,000
The pot.

159
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,400
I buy everything he wants and he is still not satisfied.

160
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
That's for you. We'll call you later.

161
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
Thank you. - See you tomorrow.

162
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,100
See you tomorrow. Good trip.

163
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,800
That's cool.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
Mr. Schaudel! - Yes?

165
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Your hedge is over seven feet tall.

166
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,100
I'm going to complain to the town if you do nothing about it.

167
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
Well you said, sir Monet.

168
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,300
Zagevent.

169
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
Rami?

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,900
Rami?

171
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,100
Au, damn.

172
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,400
Who said you could come in?

173
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
We are not so well begun, but that does not matter.

174
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,700
It's not too late. Will you come watch a movie?

175
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,900
Within 3 count my room if I say that you've been to me.

176
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,000
What? - One.

177
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
Two.

178
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,700
I hope everything goes well.

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Do not worry. He's a serious guy.

180
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
I mean Rami.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
Why would not it go well?

182
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,200
He becomes difficult.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
This is normal. For example, children of his age.

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
We were rebellious when we were ten years.

185
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,800
He is disappointed about the football match.

186
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,800
We can ask the babysitter to take him.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,300
Which car? Your brand new 4x4?

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
My Range? You can see that from here.

189
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,700
It's not the final, but you see him play again.

190
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,100
My dad never came to see the rugby and I've still a successful life.

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Speaking well?

192
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
<I> Take off your shoes. </ I>

193
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,600
<I> Your shoes. </ I>

194
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
<I> I have your old man well known. </ I>

195
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
<I> Do you know that he is deceased? </ I>

196
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,400
<I> I did not know. How did he die? </ I>

197
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,900
Everything okay, Rami?

198
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,000
<I> Do you need something? - That was his weakness </ i>.

199
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,600
<I> How do you know? </ I>

200
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,500
<I> Do you want to watch the movie? - I tell you that he had a weakness </ i>.

201
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
<I> Listen ... - He could be someone </ i>.

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,800
You should not ... I know you ... - Take me to the carnival.

203
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,700
No. I stand before you and I do not want you getting hurt.

204
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,500
<I> Watch for The Departed. A good movie. </ I>

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,400
No. That I have seen.

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,200
DiCaprio dies at the end.

207
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,100
<I> Hello? - It is Claire </ i>.

208
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,500
<I> Day Claire. Arrived safely? - Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </ I>

209
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,500
<I> Yes, very good. - May I speak Rami </ i>?

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,900
<I> He sleeps all. </ I>

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,900
Already?

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,600
<I> We have played a lot, so he sleeps very well. </ I>

213
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,300
<I> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </ i>.

214
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,700
<I> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - See you tomorrow. Thank you. </ I>

215
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Where were you?

216
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,300
I walk you search for an hour. - I wanted to know how it was with Rami.

217
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
Patronize him not so. Here.

218
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,600
Who is it? - No one, to take a picture of me.

219
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,000
Come on, quickly, quickly.

220
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,600
You look beautiful. - Thank you.

221
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,400
<I> Yeah? - Hello, Mr. Schaudel </ i>?

222
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
<I> Yes. - This is the police </ i>.

223
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,300
If you live on the Rue de la ferme 7?

224
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, why?

225
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,000
<I> There's been an incident tonight at home. </ I>

226
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,800
An incident? What happened?

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Difficult to explain on the phone. - Is Rami?

228
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,700
<I> Is it our son? - Your son </ i>

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,100
Yes, he is at home with the babysitter.

230
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,100
<I> I'm sorry, but there's no one here. - Why, no one </ i>?

231
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
<I> Hello? - Franck, it's Claire Schaudel </ i>.

232
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
No, ma'am, the police again.

233
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,500
<I> Apparently the babysitter left his phone at home. </ I>

234
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,400
What's ...

235
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
What happened?

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
Commissioner Laville.

237
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,500
Mr. and Mrs. Schaudel? - Yes.

238
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Have you found my son? - Not yet.

239
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
There is a crisis created and sent out an APB.

240
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,200
Emitted at 3 am.

241
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
This is a nightmare. - Who warned you?

242
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,700
Your car was involved in one-run. That's why we were here.

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
My Range? - Yes.

244
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,700
This is agent Caillaud.

245
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,500
He proposes profiles of criminals.

246
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
The babysitter might have abducted our son?

247
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,900
That's hard to say now.

248
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,400
He is not known to the police and he has no criminal record.

249
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,900
But the biggest psychopaths often are not.

250
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,100
The biggest psychopaths? Do you mean child murderers?

251
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,400
Not required. Also rapists or organ traffickers.

252
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Then we'll find them alive.

253
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,400
But not too optimistic that brings misfortune.

254
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,300
Did you have a dispute with the babysitter? - No.

255
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,600
This was below the bench. Perhaps a clue.

256
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,200
Is this yours? - No.

257
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,300
Enter here, it's maybe a snuff movie.

258
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,600
What is a snuff movie? - A murder filmed with an amateur camera.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,700
We're going to watch it directly.

260
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,400
Connect it at that.

261
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Quiet.

262
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Ready, boss. - Can we start?

263
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,500
Go ahead.

264
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,500
<I> Good evening everyone and welcome to Alex TV </ i>

265
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,000
<I> "Laughter blown" with the aim of one million views on YouTube. </ I>

266
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,300
I know. What does he do for my home? - Who is that?

267
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Idiotic courier who hit me yesterday.

268
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,200
Let you format a PV?

269
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,800
No, I have no points on ... he ran.

270
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
<I> We go over to our reporter, Sam. </ I>

271
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,500
<I> This is a big night as we come to the birthday of our size Franck. </ I>

272
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,700
<I> Is he crying? Laugh? Crying with laughter? </ I>

273
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,300
<I> We'll now explore. </ I>

274
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,600
<I> Exciting. - His boss there is well-off </ i>.

275
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,600
<I> He pays no taxes and put everything in Swiss accounts. </ I>

276
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,900
<I> He pays workers in black. </ I>

277
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,400
That is not true. What nonsense.

278
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
Yes, what nonsense.

279
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,200
There he is. Happy birthday.

280
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
What are you doing here? - Your birthday.

281
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
You want me to get fired?

282
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
And the small sleeps. - I love children.

283
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,700
"I love children." That does not sound good.

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Sonia comes. - Sonia? That's a joke?

285
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,600
No, they confirmed on Facebook. - No way. Get out.

286
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,700
Call her to cancel.

287
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,600
I got her number. - Say it like it is here.

288
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,200
Let us inside. - I have the little fit.

289
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
We have thought of everything.

290
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
What is that? - A sedative.

291
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,100
Are you crazy? Why not ecstasy?

292
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Ecstasy is too dangerous for a child.

293
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,400
A sedative as well. - It is vegetable.

294
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,900
Give him half a different dose.

295
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,000
No way. No party and I stand by.

296
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,900
Goodbye.

297
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,400
Are you sure he does not wake up? - They sleep until tomorrow.

298
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Hold on. It's still risky. I hope it is not dangerous.

299
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,900
What time did Sonia come? - That there will be.

300
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
What a piece.

301
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
The mother is super handsome. But he does not get out.

302
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,100
He seems to be Gollum. - You are a bastard.

303
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,500
Why? - You insult Gollum.

304
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,300
They drugging my son and laugh at me. And I'm Gollum?

305
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Wait till they encounter Gollum. On their bakkes.

306
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,200
And I'm Gollum?

307
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Who is Gollum anyway?

308
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,400
I don’t know.

309
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
<I> Damn, calling the mother. </ I>

310
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Put them my regards.

311
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,600
Silent. From the room. - Madam, I love you.

312
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,600
Silence you. - I did not say anything.

313
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,400
<I> It's Claire. </ I>

314
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,800
Claire day. Arrived safely?

315
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
<I> Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </ I>

316
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,600
Yes, very well.

317
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,100
<I> May I speak Rami? - He sleeps all </ i>.

318
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,300
<I> Now all? </ I>

319
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,200
We have played a lot so he sleeps very well.

320
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,500
<I> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </ i>.

321
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,300
<I> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - Until tomorrow </ i>.

322
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,500
Sleep well, Adolfje.

323
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,500
Leave him alone, damn.

324
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,000
That's still not bad.

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
What is that? - The bell.

326
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
Sonia?

327
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
What is all this? You said only Sonia would come.

328
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,200
No, she would come. Not that she was the only one.

329
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,000
Excuse me, excuse me.

330
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Good evening, everyone. Excuse.

331
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,100
It is very nice that you have come for my birthday.

332
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
And for the beer ...

333
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,700
And for the beer. A small problem. I fear that ...

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Franck day.

335
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Happy birthday. - Sonia.

336
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,500
What is she doing there? - Who is that?

337
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,600
She has worked for me. Until last year.

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,000
Sonia Lamar. I never forget a face.

339
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,400
Love that you came. - I had nothing else to do.

340
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,500
Well ... Welcome everyone.

341
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,700
Can you take your shoes off?

342
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
I told you he was funny.

343
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,500
No, really. Can you ... I mean it.

344
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Where can I put this? - The kitchen is there.

345
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,400
Have you had problems with her? Dismissal, sexual harassment?

346
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,300
Not at all.

347
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,300
Rigot, I want the number for that Sonia Lamar.

348
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,400
This resembles the case Pascal René.

349
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,200
The case Pascal René? - A child that has disappeared.

350
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Have you found him? - Yes, but not in one piece.

351
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Look at the labels.

352
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Just old wine. All expire. Look.

353
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,400
Stop it. I do not feel well. - What is it?

354
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Have you seen Sonia? - Yes, and then?

355
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
Turn that off.

356
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,600
What's wrong with Sonia? - What a killer bitch.

357
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,100
I would leave my family for her. - You have no family.

358
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,400
Then it is less painful for them.

359
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,600
That you can not do Franck tonight. - I know.

360
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,500
Tomorrow. - You're right, I'm stuck.

361
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,300
Tonight I see Lucie, a married woman.

362
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
What do you do? - I'll take what Ruinart.

363
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,100
You take nothing with it. Back to top. - One bottle.

364
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,000
Put that back. Upwards. - What are we drinking?

365
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,200
Come on, Alex.

366
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,700
Have they given you drink?

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
It's nice, but far. - Yes.

368
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,300
Sonia, my friends, Sam and Alex. - Hello.

369
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Hello.

370
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,500
This is Ernest. My sex buddy.

371
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,400
But no, he is my cousin. He is married.

372
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
And love. Hello.

373
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,500
Pleased to meet you. Sonia talks a lot about you.

374
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,100
Sylvain here, there Sylvain Sylvain did this ...

375
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,400
My name is Franck. - I see.

376
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
That's not bad. You also see a nice guy out.

377
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,500
Who wants a drink? Sonia, I Ruinart.

378
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
No, I do not drink alcohol anymore. - Why not?

379
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm really freaked out at my farewell drink at Schaudel.

380
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,100
I was so drunk that I remember nothing more.

381
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,400
Nothing at all? - A total blackout.

382
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,100
I want a glass of Ruinart.

383
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Not prefer a Schweppes? - No, Ruinart is good.

384
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,900
Everything okay? - Yes.

385
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Want a drink? - Yes.

386
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,700
A chicken. - A goat.

387
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,800
A velociraptor. - Yes.

388
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,100
Earlier, the mother of Franck. - I can also imitate a tortoise.

389
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
That is cool.

390
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,400
Great.

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm a fan.

392
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Amazing what you do with your body. - I can do much more.

393
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,500
I can well imitate a sea lion. - Display.

394
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,300
The sea lion.

395
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
You will also work with Manpower? - Yes.

396
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,200
My wife also. - That's cool.

397
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,700
There is the Ruinart.

398
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
You go mobile, Sonia.

399
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,900
That's my friend. - You have a boyfriend?

400
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,600
Did you want me maybe decorate?

401
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,100
Sonia, I'm sorry. - Simpleton.

402
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
Sorry. Where he flew against?

403
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
My mouth. What a fool.

404
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,200
I am sorry - Now you've got it all made.

405
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,400
You're bleeding not?

406
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,000
I am sorry He flew right out. I do not often open bottles.

407
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Is it? - It goes, it goes.

408
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,500
It's all right.

409
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm going to open it. - Do you see anything?

410
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,100
Surprise. - Where's the party?

411
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Damn, guys. You believe that?

412
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,900
Is not it a costume party? - No, sorry.

413
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,800
Great. - We are so come by subway.

414
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,300
Here, with this being the better.

415
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,100
I knew nothing. I organize not.

416
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,300
We sound at Franck and our student years.

417
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,300
With Blanchard. - The Professor economy?

418
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes. - The sex bomb of the class.

419
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,000
The brunette. Anyone who fucked.

420
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
What a mattress. And no entrance fee.

421
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,900
The slut.

422
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,800
She ate a pig, but she went himself as a beast rampage.

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
What was her name? - No idea.

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,700
Myriam? - Yes, Myriam Elalaoui.

425
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,000
That's my sister. - Really?

426
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll see if the minor is still asleep.

427
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Grease Lapps.

428
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900
Same name. - We have fucked his sister.

429
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,000
We fucked his sister. - I've also fucked.

430
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,800
Bastard. - Everyone has been served.

431
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Look, Gérard de Gaulle.

432
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
What a ridiculous mustache.

433
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,700
Happy birthday, Francky.

434
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,300
Happy birthday, Franck.

435
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,900
Happy birthday, Franck.

436
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,500
Say happy birthday, Coco.

437
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Happy birthday, Franck.

438
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,600
Would you like to drink? Are you thirsty? Wait a minute.

439
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,100
Here, that is Ruinart.

440
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Nice, huh? Okay, enough, or you are still addicted to the drink.

441
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,200
What? Want some?

442
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,300
Damn, he does not move. I think he's dead.

443
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
We have slain him? Damn.

444
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,400
Now what? - We have to resuscitate him.

445
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,300
Quick, before Franck sees.

446
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,700
Put it in your briefs. - That stinks.

447
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,400
And then? He's dead, he still smells nothing.

448
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,400
What are you doing here? Is he dead?

449
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,900
No. - Yes, he seems dead.

450
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,000
No, not yet.

451
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,400
<I> Wait. One, two, three, four ... </ i>

452
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,000
<I> five and six. One, two, three, four. </ I>

453
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,700
<I> It's an animal. Do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. </ I>

454
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,700
<I> One, two, three ... one, two, three ... </ i>

455
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,500
<I> one, two, three ... one, two, three ... </ i>

456
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,400
<I> Wake up, Coco. Wait, I'm going to take his pulse. </ I>

457
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,600
<I> We have to think of something. </ I>

458
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,600
<I> Wait, do not move. </ I>

459
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,300
<I> Fly, Coco. </ I>

460
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Commissioner Sonia Lamar is unreachable.

461
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,900
Leave a message. Ask if they call back.

462
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
The whole house has been searched. No trace of the child.

463
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
Have you looked in the freezer?

464
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,700
No, it's not true. - That can not.

465
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,100
Enough is enough.

466
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,000
Now blown fuses? - Happy birthday, buddy.

467
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,800
Blow them out.

468
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,800
Forward.

469
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,000
Good job.

470
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,500
Take it, I made them.

471
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,000
Really? - Yes.

472
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
Take it, I've made myself.

473
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,100
What is it? - That's vanilla and chicken.

474
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,700
That is chocolate and chilli.

475
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,000
And the pink is ratatouille and blueberries.

476
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Is it good? - Yes, very nice.

477
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,400
Delicious. - Really?

478
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,900
Come on, a speech. - Speech, speech.

479
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,900
I do not give speeches.

480
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,400
Thanks for coming to my birthday. - And for the beer.

481
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
But I must ask you to leave.

482
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,900
This is the house of my boss and I only here on his child.

483
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,100
I hope you understand that. I am sorry

484
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,900
That's a joke. - Very funny, though.

485
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,700
I'm looking for the owner.

486
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Good evening, police. I'm looking for the owner.

487
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
I am that. No, but it's complicated. Why?

488
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Are you or not? - No, but I pass on their child.

489
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,800
There is a complaint from neighbors about the noise.

490
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,100
I need to speak directly to the owners.

491
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,900
Do not bother, that people just went away.

492
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,700
Have you been drinking? - Just a little.

493
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,000
While you can fit on a child? - A glass ...

494
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
You come along. - That is not necessary.

495
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Everyone went away. What do you do?

496
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,300
I swear. Those people were just leaving. That is no joke.

497
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Happy birthday, buddy.

498
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,500
Happy birthday, buddy. - I filmed everything.

499
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,800
You enjoyed it, huh?

500
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,200
I wanted to be in your place. - That will do.

501
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,800
Do not worry, I've found another shirt.

502
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,900
Gang bastards. Something to do with Sonia there.

503
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,600
It was to laugh. You are still enjoyed it.

504
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,400
With an ass of a stranger in my face, with Sonia there?

505
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,000
I have not enjoyed it. I can imagine nothing worse.

506
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,900
Franck? - What is it?

507
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,600
Behind you.

508
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,700
He does not sleep.

509
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,800
He sleepwalking fixed. That must be it.

510
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,000
Rami.

511
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,200
Rami! Wait!

512
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
I will explain.

513
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,300
I am 30 and this was the idea of ??my friends.

514
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,300
I try to send them away.

515
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,000
I wish your father knows nothing of. Can you remain silent?

516
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,700
Of course. But then I want 300 euros.

517
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,900
What? - 300 euros. Or I call my father.

518
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,600
How do I get 300 euros?

519
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,000
My parents still give you money? You have three seconds: one ...

520
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,000
Rami, are you crazy or what?

521
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
Otherwise, I'll call my father.

522
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Satisfied? - 100 euro too little. I'll call my dad.

523
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,000
Wait, I have not.

524
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,000
Wait in your room upon me.

525
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,500
Would you borrow me some money?

526
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,500
Of course, Sylvain.

527
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,700
I'll pay you back definitely. - How much? Do you have a pen?

528
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,200
What do you want? Money? - No, no, never mind.

529
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,900
I only have five euros.

530
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Rami, I have 30 euros.

531
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Rami? Where is he? - No idea.

532
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,600
Rami? - Rami?

533
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,800
Your mobile phone is on that chair. - Damn.

534
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
What is all this? - What is it?

535
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,900
13 missed calls.

536
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,100
The pus. He has a text message sent to all women.

537
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,900
What text?

538
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,800
You want to fuck your ass.

539
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,300
Apparently there is someone interested.

540
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,000
I killed him. I make him.

541
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,500
<I> I killed him. </ I>

542
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,700
"I killed him."

543
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,200
Amory goes to a psychologist?

544
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,000
No idea. I hardly know him. I've seen him twice.

545
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,700
You said you knew him well. You let our child to a stranger?

546
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,000
Is it my fault that your babysitter us in the lurch?

547
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,100
Are you crazy? Your evening goes on Rami?

548
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
You're the most selfish man I know.

549
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,100
I would not be so self-centered?

550
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,900
You call your name when we make love.

551
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
<I> Rami? </ I>

552
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,400
<I> Rami? </ I>

553
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,900
<I> Is he in the garden? - No </ i>.

554
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,200
Sam. The small is gone. Come and search it.

555
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,200
Do not worry. I find him.

556
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Rami.

557
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Where is that little pus?

558
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,400
That bedroom is crazy. - Where are you? It's not funny.

559
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
She would have seen me? - Yes, I've seen you.

560
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm sorry, Sonia. - Not very.

561
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
I've seen her panties.

562
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,100
Sam, have you seen him?

563
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Searched everywhere, nothing found.

564
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,200
Day guys. What's the plan? Want to play Scrabble?

565
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,200
No time. We are looking for a child.

566
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
Rami? - Yes.

567
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,200
The small, sweater, red hood? - Yes, that's him.

568
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,100
No, not seen.

569
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,200
I was joking. He is at home with the bike.

570
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,600
This is his home. - I do not know where he went.

571
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
A runaway. That there is still lacked.

572
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,300
I get a car and then go look for him.

573
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,900
Damn.

574
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,100
I have found a car.

575
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,100
What a container. I go in the front.

576
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,600
Where are you going? - The small is off.

577
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,600
You're not serious. - Yes it is.

578
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Wait, I'll go.

579
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,300
Come on. I'll explain.

580
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,000
We have a problem and have to leave.

581
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,700
Can you anyone outside of work?

582
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,800
No problem. - Everything is under control.

583
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,500
Thanks, guys. Forward. Get out.

584
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,000
Where can he go?

585
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,900
We have to be in place. Where would he go?

586
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,000
I am as a child once runaway. - To where?

587
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,700
After 3 days, still they missed me not.

588
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,300
I then went home.

589
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,300
Look there.

590
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,000
The carnival. Of course. There we go.

591
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,600
And we look for that kid later.

592
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,300
Damn, I had forgotten her.

593
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,300
Who? - Lucie, who married woman.

594
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,500
As my wife is too. - A married woman?

595
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,300
To help the couple. She's frustrated.

596
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,200
What are you sympathetic. - Exactly. Look how happy she is.

597
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
<I> Hello? -? Hi </ i>

598
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,300
Plans have changed. The party is over.

599
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,200
<I> I was just about to leave. Will you come to my house? </ I>

600
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,500
I'm far from the 15th arrondissement.

601
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,300
That is not far. I come from there. At most 25 minutes.

602
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,600
I can be there in 25 minutes.

603
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
<I> Perfect. My husband is still not home. </ I>

604
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
<I> Are you sure? - Yes, very definitely </ i>.

605
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,000
<I> He is with his niece to a party in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. </ I>

606
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,800
<I> Hello! </ I>

607
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,000
Ha.

608
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,800
I'm going to show. - Give that phone here.

609
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
<I> Lucie? - Ernest </ i>?

610
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,400
<I> Poepie, is that you? </ I>

611
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,300
Yes, it is poepie, slut.

612
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,800
I'll make you fall!

613
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,400
I could not have known. - You fuck my wife.

614
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Quiet. - I want to get off.

615
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,100
Stop immediately, I want to get off.

616
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,600
Sam fucks the wife of Ernest.

617
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,600
Stop filming.

618
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,700
The door. - The door, damn it.

619
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,400
Ernest, is it? - You can go to hell.

620
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,900
Nice friends you have.

621
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,900
Wait, Ernest. It is a misunderstanding.

622
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,300
A misunderstanding. Lucie's 15th who calls her husband Poepie.

623
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
I Poepie. And you fucking my wife.

624
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
Ernest, come back.

625
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,400
The cops. Also that yet. Hold this, Sam.

626
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,200
I did not know.

627
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,600
Good evening. Can you shut the engine down

628
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,100
and give the papers of the car? - Of course.

629
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,900
No problem. - Stop!

630
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,500
Alex, what are you doing? - Everything under control.

631
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Nothing in control. - Stop, Alex!

632
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,000
I have no license and no papers of the car.

633
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,200
No papers? Where did you find that car?

634
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,800
In the garage of the family Schaudel.

635
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,400
I'll bring it tomorrow to the garage of a friend.

636
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Guys, there Rami.

637
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,300
Turn back. - The cops are behind us.

638
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Turn back. - The cops are behind us.

639
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,400
This can not be. - Stop!

640
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,700
Damn, there they are.

641
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,800
Good evening. - Stop immediately.

642
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,900
Yes, we are going to stop. Stop, asshole.

643
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,000
I have my identity not. Stop, please.

644
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,300
Stop the car, now.

645
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,600
I do not see you, I do not see you.

646
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,100
I do not see you. I do not see you.

647
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,000
Stop, Alex. Please.

648
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Alex, if we crash, I'll kill you!

649
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,300
Do not worry, I'm going to lose them.

650
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,800
I've fucked.

651
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,700
I'm going to give everything.

652
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,400
Sam, look.

653
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,400
Who's Sebastien Loeb of the woods? IK.

654
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Now you really should stop. - Stop, damn it!

655
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,200
I have everything under control. - The rear!

656
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,400
Look how I maneuver. A rally, left, right.

657
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,900
It's fast!

658
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,400
I've shaken. Can not thank you wonder?

659
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,100
Fortunately, he is not broken.

660
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,400
Do not pull that face.

661
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,600
It does look impressive, but it's not so bad.

662
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,300
I got them anyway shaken off, huh?

663
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
I want to die.

664
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,700
And I want you dead.

665
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,800
Now just find Rami, somewhere dead in the woods.

666
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,800
And then it's done. - Do not worry.

667
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,400
He is now eating solid candy. We're going to look for him.

668
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,500
The cops are coming. We gotta get outta here.

669
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,500
Look, it's down there. There's the fair.

670
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Fast. - I see nothing.

671
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,000
Hurry up, they are going to be so here.

672
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,700
What have they done to my Range?

673
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,200
You Range can be stolen. And your house too.

674
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,400
Are there not more important things?

675
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,300
Who is it? - Your mother.

676
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,200
For APB. Do not you take on?

677
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
No, it's bad enough.

678
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,700
I did not mean it. You know her. That will take hours.

679
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,700
I had more to her to listen.

680
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,300
And? - He does not answer. He gets home?

681
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,000
Sam, now you can go to his wife.

682
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,800
Shut up, Alex.

683
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What a mess.

684
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,900
Are you sure it's down here? - No idea.

685
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,800
And all the men here? Is there a parking lot?

686
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,000
Parking for dicks.

687
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,700
This is a bunch of prostitutes.

688
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,800
Really? - Yes.

689
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Good evening. - Good evening.

690
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,600
I was there for an investigation. - A large study.

691
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,800
What?

692
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,800
Good evening. - Good evening.

693
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Where are we?

694
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,300
Here we are.

695
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,500
Watch out.

696
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,000
Thank you.

697
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,900
Did you see how she looked at me? - It was a whore.

698
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,400
And then? What do you know of women?

699
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,400
She looked at me. - It's a whore.

700
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,500
She looked at you like that? No. Well then.

701
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,700
That's not bad. It's a whore.

702
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,000
She would make me want to. - 50 Euro.

703
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,400
She does that for 25 euros.

704
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,500
In that case, ...

705
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,800
That reminds me of the time I was carefree and silly.

706
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,200
Last week?

707
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,300
Let's go find Rami and then we're gone. Come on.

708
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,800
Rami.

709
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
Rami.

710
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,100
That's not him.

711
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,500
I found him there.

712
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,900
Rami ...

713
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,100
Excuse me, sir. There he is.

714
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,100
Rami. - Franck.

715
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,600
Make me so worried. Home.

716
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
No way. - Yes it is. Come on.

717
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,300
Stressful enough for today. Get out of here.

718
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,100
Enough played with my balls. We're gone.

719
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,900
Go. Let me go.

720
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,600
Help. I get kidnapped. - Stop that. Come on.

721
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,800
Help, they are pedof ... - It's okay. I'm going to let go.

722
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,500
He makes a joke. Does not it?

723
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,100
We eat a waffle.

724
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,700
Eat your waffle on because we do not stay long.

725
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,400
It's nice here. Do you eat him. That will relax you.

726
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,800
I do not want your waffle. - Yes, to excuse me.

727
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I do not want. - Please to excuse me.

728
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Okay, very funny. What we have fun.

729
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,200
Say rather what attraction you want.

730
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,700
There!

731
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,700
Since you're too small.

732
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,500
If there is someone, do it.

733
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
But I tell you that it should not.

734
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,500
Come on, I want to do this. Do not be a sissy.

735
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,400
You're not very brave.

736
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,300
Franck is not brave. I'll go with it.

737
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,700
No, I'll go. I just do not think he is ill.

738
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,100
Where can I buy tickets? - There.

739
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,100
You know you can do from there? - Yes.

740
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Would you like? - No, you know.

741
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,700
Because then I ask it.

742
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,900
Relax, Franck.

743
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,400
I am relaxed.

744
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,500
What power.

745
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,200
There are women who orgasm in something.

746
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Really? - Yes. We can go together if you want.

747
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,800
Do you have something need to make a girl orgasm?

748
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,100
But no, it's just ...

749
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,000
Something to make orgasm a girl. - But no.

750
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,400
The loser.

751
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,500
Have you done in your pants?

752
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,800
Franck, it is against you.

753
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,600
Have you done in your pants? - No.

754
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
Are you OK? - So cool. Watch the video.

755
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,500
That face.

756
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,000
A stretchy mouth.

757
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,400
You were more afraid than I am. Look, you're scared.

758
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,900
You see well that you're more afraid than I am.

759
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,100
Look, yes.

760
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,000
Makes you sick in. We do not do that anymore.

761
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,200
<I> Where do we go? </ I>

762
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,200
<I> I do not know. </ I>

763
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,100
Oh shoot

764
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,000
What was that? Is it done?

765
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,400
I do not feel so good.

766
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,100
Is that for me? - What do I get in return?

767
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,900
A kiss.

768
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,000
Have you seen a ghost? - Here.

769
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
Can I exchange it?

770
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,700
No, there are some nice attractions. - Come on.

771
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,600
What is a dark room? - There it is dark.

772
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,000
What? What is it?

773
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,200
Along true?

774
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,000
What was that? - I walked from somewhere.

775
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,800
Careful. - Alex, where are you?

776
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,800
Right behind you. - Who is that?

777
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,100
I am that. - That is Sonia.

778
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,400
I see nothing. - Me neither.

779
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,900
What did you think of the attraction?

780
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,100
I've never had so many jitters.

781
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,500
Really? - Yes.

782
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,800
Do you like it? - I would do it again.

783
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,400
Why are you laughing?

784
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,300
I filmed everything. - Wow say.

785
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,600
Why are you laughing?

786
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,100
We will see the show, but promise you're not going mugs.

787
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,700
No problem. - What?

788
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,200
It was to laugh. - I see the humor in it.

789
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,100
Come on.

790
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,200
I should be angry. You do not notice that you're a man coast.

791
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,800
Great. Nice atmosphere.

792
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,600
And Rami, what would you be?

793
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,300
Your boyfriend. If you're still looking.

794
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,200
Dreams can not hurt. - He's right.

795
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,500
What is your dream, Alex?

796
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,500
Okay, thank you, Alex.

797
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,300
The last 30 minutes forgotten. - Remember that now anyway.

798
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,300
Publishing his own comic. - I can forget.

799
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,200
Seriously now, Rami. A real dream ...

800
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,100
My father is watching as I play football.

801
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,200
I do not like football.

802
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,500
<I> What is your dream, Sonia? - So much </ i>.

803
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,800
Have a penis for an hour, to know what that is.

804
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,700
A cupcake chain open worldwide.

805
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,100
A beautiful experience love with a good man. For once.

806
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,400
And Franck and Sam stop mugs. - Yes, I agree.

807
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,200
Okay, what an atmosphere. Great.

808
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,600
What will you do?

809
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,500
What did you ask? - Something that makes you smile again.

810
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,300
What then? - Come on.

811
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,700
No, I'm not. - Come sing. Come on.

812
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,800
Forward, Francky. - Just like old times.

813
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,300
I can not sing. - Come on.

814
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,500
No, I can not sing.

815
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,900
â ™ ª When I had you to myself I did not want you around â ™ ª

816
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,300
â ™ ª Those pretty face always made you stand out in a crowd â ™ ª

817
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,900
â ™ ª But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it fired â ™ ª

818
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,200
â ™ ª Now it's much too late for me to take a second look â ™ ª

819
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,100
â ™ ª Oh baby, give me one more chance â ™ ª

820
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,300
â ™ ª show you That I Love You - Will not you please let me â ™ ª

821
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,100
â ™ ª Back in your heart - Oh darlin ', I was blind to let you go â ™ ª

822
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,000
â ™ ª Let you go, baby - Will not you please let me go â ™ ª

823
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,900
â ™ ª â ™ ª Okay

824
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
â ™ ª I want you back â ™ ª

825
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
â ™ ª I want you back â ™ ª

826
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,300
â ™ ª Tryin 'to live without your love is one long sleepless night â ™ ª

827
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,500
â ™ ª Let me show you, girl, That I know wrong from right â ™ ª

828
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,100
â ™ ª Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground â ™ ª

829
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,200
â ™ ª Following the girl, I did not even around for â ™ ª

830
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,500
â ™ ª Oh baby, give me one more chance â ™ ª

831
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,600
â ™ ª Will not you please let me â ™ ª

832
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,900
â ™ ª Back in your heart? â ™ ª

833
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,000
That was great. - Very fat.

834
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,900
Not bad.

835
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,000
You're jealous. - Thanks.

836
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,100
It was still funny. You have to let go some more.

837
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,400
I'm not a stiff rake. - Then this button loose.

838
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
I'm not going to eat.

839
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,700
Do you remember all of your farewell drink.

840
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,600
Why did you say to the contrary?

841
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,300
Because you never called me back.

842
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,200
Surely you've got a friend.

843
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,400
If you can call it that. I know him from yesterday.

844
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,600
How far is your house? - 30 minutes.

845
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,600
What a bad luck, too bad we do not have a car anymore.

846
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,600
At the dinner for idiots gonna be all alone.

847
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,100
What are you doing? - Ernest.

848
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,200
Ernest, come down there.

849
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,500
What is it? - What's the problem?

850
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,100
Are you his size? Do you know him?

851
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,800
Yes, why? - Pay no. Drinking beer.

852
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,100
He eats fries. He keeps me fooled.

853
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,600
What do you mean no? - Nothing.

854
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,200
You laughing at me? Is that your boyfriend?

855
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,400
He says he has eaten and drunk and refuses to pay.

856
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,200
We laugh you out. We did not understand.

857
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,700
We're going to pay you. How much is it?

858
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,300
This is for ...

859
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,600
Ernest, you idiot.

860
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,600
My goodness. - Come Rami, get out.

861
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,800
That was quite a blow.

862
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Hide. There. - Yes, there.

863
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,200
Are you crazy? - He fucked my wife.

864
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,100
The fairground behind us. - Those are not normal.

865
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,000
Even Chuck Norris let the fairground alone.

866
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,100
There they are. Hide.

867
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,500
They are gone. We can go. - I can not.

868
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,200
What is it, Rami? - Got my puffer at?

869
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,700
You puffer? I do not have to.

870
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,400
His asthma. - It'll be okay.

871
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,100
This is serious. My brother is so dead.

872
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,900
I do not want to hear.

873
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,700
He is deceased ... - What do we just say?

874
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,100
I've been saying nothing.

875
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,000
We have to call the fire department. - Then stand the fairground here.

876
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,700
And calling his parents.

877
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,400
Another 30 minutes steps. Now what?

878
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,400
30 minutes, that is. - Shut up.

879
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,500
There are go-karts. - Yes, go-karts.

880
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,000
I think not. Forget about it.

881
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,500
Do you have a better idea? - Forward.

882
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,700
I drive super good.

883
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,400
Do not touch me.

884
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,300
What an idiot. I do not know if he can drive.

885
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,400
Leave the camera here. - Hurry up, hurry up.

886
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Hurry.

887
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,100
Beware, Sam, behind you!

888
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,600
Accelerate, accelerate. Grab the camera.

889
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
What are you doing? We have to help Sam.

890
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,600
No, he can well judo. We can not do anything there.

891
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,000
You have to flip. - I flip.

892
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,800
Film job, awesome is that.

893
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,800
Watch out!

894
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,900
Out of the way!

895
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,600
Out of the way.

896
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,700
This is fantastic!

897
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,400
<I> Fast and Furious, Sonia, Fast and Furious. </ I>

898
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Vin Diesel can not compete here!

899
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,700
Watch out!

900
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,900
Where is Sam? - Who had a problem.

901
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,000
What kind of problem?

902
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,300
The fairground. Throw away the banana. - What?

903
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,700
You banana. Throw your banana to them.

904
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,600
Well done.

905
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,500
Look out for you. Watch out.

906
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,700
Great. Is this your dream, Sonia?

907
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,800
How is Rami?

908
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,100
We must not dawdle.

909
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,500
Help me with his helmet.

910
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,600
Is it? - Yeah, you know, why?

911
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
Puts his helmet. Come on.

912
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,600
Come on, boy. Here we are. Come on.

913
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,700
Hold on, it'll be fine. - Out of the way.

914
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,400
Sorry, Rami. That was not intentional.

915
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,300
But we're there and you're a strong boy.

916
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,900
Very strong. - Ernest is knockout.

917
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,900
What is going on here?

918
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,800
<I> What's this? - We must do something </ i>.

919
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,500
Make some place and give me the puffer.

920
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,100
Out of the way, damn it. - Rami.

921
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,700
Breath, Rami. Again.

922
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,200
Going, Rami? - Super Cool, that go-kart.

923
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,400
I have 14 pizzas for Franck Amory. Do you know who that is?

924
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,400
No idea. - He should pay me.

925
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,400
Mr. Schaudel! Now!

926
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,600
You're like that old cartoon from that.

927
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,700
<I> Yes, from Up. - From Up </ i>.

928
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,800
Come on, people. The party is over.

929
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,800
It's done. It's done. Done drinking.

930
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,100
What a mess. Get out and done drinking.

931
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,100
Come on down. What is that?

932
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,000
And samurai, come on down.

933
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,000
You are not there. - Why not?

934
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,900
You have no bracelet. - No.

935
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,600
Then you will not be there. - I know the owner.

936
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,800
Look, the fish eat ecstasy.

937
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,700
Look, he smokes a cigar with his ass.

938
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,400
Hi, I'm Mr. Schaudel.

939
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,900
I stink out of my mouth as I have a strontkop.

940
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,600
Where did you find that? - Quiet.

941
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,400
Where did you find that? - In the cigar box.

942
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
I told you to stop.

943
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,800
Turn off the music.

944
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,700
Girls, which is a leather seat. Come off it.

945
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,100
The party of the weirdos.

946
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,600
No. Done drinking.

947
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,900
Hey, dude. Want some stuff?

948
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,300
Get out of here with that trade.

949
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,400
What do you do? No, that's not ...

950
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,200
I found a child.

951
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,900
Paul, I'll break your neck.

952
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Franck, I was just about to call.

953
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,100
Hopeless, people do not want road.

954
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,800
I will ask again to leave.

955
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,900
No, we go in the jacuzzi. - Yes.

956
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,600
Let those little alone.

957
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,100
Let those little alone, I say.

958
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,300
This may in the sangria?

959
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,600
No. Where did you find that? - In the basement.

960
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,100
Stay down there.

961
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,600
Where is the jacuzzi anyway?

962
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,200
They're going to throw him out the window.

963
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,600
Going, Rami?

964
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,000
Stay there, I'll get you.

965
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,700
Fatso. That's for those dirty fuck SMS.

966
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,800
No one comes to my ass. Fuck you, fatso.

967
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,400
And stop filming me if I'm doing my dog ??fuck your mother.

968
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,000
Alex, help me to get it out.

969
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,300
Come, Rami.

970
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,000
Is your camera waterproof?

971
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,300
My camera. - Your camera can not care.

972
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,500
Do you think we have to do anything else?

973
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,700
Thank you, ma'am.

974
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,500
We're going to dry in your room. - Excuse me.

975
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,700
What is that smell?

976
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,300
You're an asshole, I got you through. In line like everyone else.

977
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,900
What are you doing? - There he is.

978
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,600
He gets a sausage for his birthday.

979
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Damn, that burns. - Okay, away.

980
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,000
You away! Everybody out!

981
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,500
Everybody out. Everyone away. Fuck off, everyone!

982
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,000
What's that?

983
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,200
What a battlefield.

984
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,700
Forward, home. - No Christmas presents for you.

985
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,000
Yes.

986
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,300
Get out. Go home to sleep.

987
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,900
Look. Look.

988
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,500
Look what you've done.

989
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,700
Come on, get up. Go home.

990
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,800
This is your fault. I hate you.

991
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,600
<I> It's just a bit messy. </ I>

992
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,100
<I> I'm home now, but tomorrow at 9 am I'll help clean up. </ I>

993
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,200
And what about all that is broken? As the car ...

994
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,600
<I> That is stolen while you slept and you have not heard. </ I>

995
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,400
<I> And for the house you say ... </ i>

996
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,600
<I> That men Greenpeace invaded. </ I>

997
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,300
<I> That they all might smash as Schaudel not recycle. </ I>

998
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,000
<I> You did what you could, just for the bird was too late. </ I>

999
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,400
<I> The bird? - I think they have him break them </ i>.

1000
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,700
<I> Rami is saved. - The pizzas are paid </ i>.

1001
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,400
Yes? - You do not remember.

1002
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,000
Alex, you've slain the parrot? - No, that was Greenpeace.

1003
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,000
What happened to it? - It was Greenpeace.

1004
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,000
What's with the parrot? - It is ...

1005
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,500
Franck day. You'll see this video ever do receive.

1006
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,000
I want to thank you. I have never been so well amused.

1007
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,800
Even though you are sometimes annoying.

1008
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,700
I would like to have a dad like you want.

1009
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,900
<I> Someone who does nice things with me and play with me </ i>

1010
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,500
<I> and who thinks of me, not to himself. </ I>

1011
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,700
<I> So if you are looking for work, I take you as dad. </ I>

1012
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,300
<I> Not the easiest profession </ i>

1013
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,000
<I> but you get paid well. </ I>

1014
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,000
<I> And you get shorter working hours. </ I>

1015
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,700
<I> Rami, where are you? - I'll be </ i>.

1016
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,700
<I> Where are you? - On the crapper. I'm coming. </ I>

1017
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,600
<I> That's what I meant by annoying. </ I>

1018
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,700
<I> I have to go. Happy birthday. </ I>

1019
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
<I> This was it. </ I>

1020
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,100
<I> I hope you liked it with us. </ I>

1021
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,600
Franck, a balance for your birthday?

1022
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,200
Perhaps my last because tomorrow I'm dead.

1023
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,400
I do not know what I can expect.

1024
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,700
Please. - Thank you.

1025
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,200
Drink and go to bed, because tomorrow we get up early.

1026
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,700
I'm hungry. - Would you like a cupcake?

1027
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,800
No, I'm not such a big appetite.

1028
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,300
What's that noise?

1029
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,600
What's this?

1030
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,100
There are still people out there? - No.

1031
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,300
My camera. My camera, fast.

1032
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,300
Common, common.

1033
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,200
To vultures.

1034
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,400
<I> Look, the gentleman from Up. </ I>

1035
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,100
Real. - I want to talk to Mr. Schaudel.

1036
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,400
Leave him alone.

1037
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,000
I want to speak to Ms Schaudel.

1038
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,800
Done with that nonsense. Stop laughing.

1039
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,700
There is a problem. - Yes, you!

1040
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,700
<I> Like that guy from Up. </ I>

1041
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,600
What is here?

1042
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,100
Stop him. Let the balloons empty.

1043
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,200
Throw stones at!

1044
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,600
Shooting, Rami.

1045
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,700
<I> This is the craziest thing I've ever filmed. </ I>

1046
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,500
<I> This will definitely get a million views on YouTube. </ I>

1047
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,100
<I> It flashes? The battery is flat. </ I>

1048
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,600
Back to square one. Now we know nothing yet.

1049
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,600
On the contrary. I think we know more.

1050
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,800
He lacks a father like you.

1051
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,500
That's possible, but we do not know where the little one is.

1052
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,600
I have it!

1053
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,800
What? - Gollum, from earlier.

1054
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,800
We did not know who it was.

1055
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,100
<I> That's the ugly monster from the movie Lord of the Rings. </ I>

1056
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,700
Caillaud. - Yes?

1057
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,000
Go wait in the office. What quickly.

1058
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,800
Even the painting of the boy is spoiled.

1059
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,400
That is not the boy, damn it!

1060
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,200
Ok

1061
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,900
They had to get up early this morning.

1062
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,100
Do you know why? Apparently not to clean up.

1063
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,900
Wait ...

1064
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,600
What are you looking for?

1065
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,900
I know where they are.

1066
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,100
Franck, I am.

1067
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,700
What a hell to stand on. Such headaches.

1068
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,500
I have a product to the walls.

1069
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,300
Mr. and Mrs. Schaudel, you're back.

1070
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,000
What happened here tonight ... Unbelievable.

1071
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,800
Men Greenpeace invaded here.

1072
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,000
We have seen the video.

1073
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,400
Listen Mr. Schaudel,

1074
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,400
it's gotten out of hand, but we have a lot saved.

1075
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,300
Your board example, where you are so attached to.

1076
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

1077
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,900
That's because Golblem.

1078
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,900
Damn.

1079
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,900
Let me go. I will not say anything.

1080
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,900
The Franck's his fault.

1081
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,500
I swear. Let me go.

1082
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,700
Come on, Rami. Come on.

1083
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,900
Hello.

1084
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,200
Hello.

1085
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,300
Back already? You would only be back to 18 hours.

1086
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,400
Is the ceremony went well?

1087
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,700
Good job.

1088
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:51,200
Coming just on or have you been home?

1089
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,700
Listen, it's not what you think.

1090
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,600
Men of Greenpeace ...

1091
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,800
Maybe it's not ... - Shut up.

1092
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,900
I could not save you from my wife. Do not mess with me.

1093
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,400
Now that's a football match.

1094
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,200
I forgot the dog.

1095
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,000
Marc ... - Mr. Schaudel.

1096
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,400
I'm not here for you. They did.

1097
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,600
You will not be picked up here.

1098
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,300
I do not want to ruin the final. They wait for you.

1099
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,100
Range Rover: 85,000 euros.

1100
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,200
A Steinway piano: 24,000 euros.

1101
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,200
22 bottles of grand cru, a shirt

1102
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,200
and moral damage to the board and the parrot.

1103
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,800
You're in the shit. Listen carefully ...

1104
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,800
No, you listen to me.

1105
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,200
Okay, we made some fur in your home.

1106
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,600
But Rami is completely blossomed.

1107
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,200
Without us you were not even here today.

1108
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,700
Besides, I have no money to pay you back.

1109
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,300
One more thing: You do not come Monday.

1110
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
What did he say?

1111
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,700
I should not come Monday.

1112
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:53,100
Given a day off? Cool. Cause I'm broken.

1113
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,300
Young man, I have a signature?

1114
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,000
Papa.

1115
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,300
Have you seen my goal?

1116
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,800
Yes, I've seen it. And against such opponents.

1117
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,400
Have you seen it, Mom? - Yes, honey.

1118
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,900
Will we?

1119
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,100
Okay, we gotta go.
