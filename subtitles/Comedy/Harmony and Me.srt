1
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,288
This film owes many thanks to
Korean Correctional Service.

2
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,346
Keep breathing!
Push!

3
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,223
Is it out yet?

4
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,516
Any minute now!

5
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,976
One more push! One more!

6
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,855
Big breath and push!

7
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,815
Just one push away!

8
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:46,649
Come on!

9
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,817
It's coming now!

10
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,236
It's coming! It's coming!

11
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,321
You've been saying that
for the Iast hour!

12
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,739
It's really here!

13
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,950
- One more push!
- Don't Iie!

14
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,077
No, really!
One Iast push!

15
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,412
Push!

16
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,331
Here it comes!

17
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,090
Ms Hong,

18
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,676
it's a boy.

19
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,219
Congratulations!

20
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,388
Congratulations! It's a boy.

21
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,973
Good for you!

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,518
Let's meet mommy.

23
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,995
HARMONY

24
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,755
1 Year Later

25
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,562
- Where have you been?
- Sorry!

26
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:07,855
AII right!

27
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,732
Good.

28
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,817
Nice one.

29
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,780
- Uh... Here...
- What's that?!

30
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,158
You want to eat some grass,
is that it?

31
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,118
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?

32
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,579
She gave me a grass ring.

33
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,831
What the hell is this?

34
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,416
I didn't have the time.

35
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:32,755
Min-woo is having his first
birthday party and you're not interested?

36
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,132
- That's not true!
- Hey, keep it down.

37
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,802
They might hear us.

38
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,720
Will half an hour do?

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,639
- Absolutely.
- Go.

40
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,601
- What are you doing?
- Get moving!

41
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,146
Bunch of slow wits!

42
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,648
- You can have the ring.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,082
Happy birthday to you

44
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,711
Happy birthday to you...

45
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,008
I told you not to sing
in front of him.

46
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,510
Who upset you?

47
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,304
Your voice terrifies him.

48
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,350
How can a human voice
sound Iike that?

49
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,185
It's a mystery.

50
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,273
One, two, three...

51
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,942
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,070
Happy birthday to you.

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,032
Happy birthday, dear Min-woo.

54
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,035
Happy birthday to you.

55
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,747
BIow out the candle.

56
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,293
There's a good boy!

57
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,589
- Grab the pencil!
- You Iike the red, don't you?

58
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:00,885
- Money is the best!
- Thread for Iongevity!

59
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,888
- Grab the money!
- No, this one. Sweetheart!

60
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,598
- Pencil for brain.
- Think practicality!

61
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,475
- The money!
- The thread! The thread!

62
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,819
Who put handcuffs there?!

63
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,614
She said anything I have.

64
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,407
But, how could you...

65
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,659
put handcuffs on the table?

66
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:32,375
May our dear boy will become
a judge or a prosecutor.

67
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,834
Good for you, darling!

68
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,545
Of course!
Become a good prosecutor

69
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,173
and put away all the
bad people in jail.

70
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,717
Hey! What the...?!

71
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,553
Say "Kimchi!" Smile!

72
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,642
It's a good picture.

73
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,937
Look at him!

74
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,107
I should have smiled more.

75
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,402
- Not bad!
- Look at my belly.

76
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,861
Get changed! Quickly!

77
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,115
- That's mine.
- Where's my shirt?

78
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:16,093
I wondered where all the flowers
from the garden have gone to.

79
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,308
Cell 5 room check.
Everyone, step outside.

80
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,540
Turn around.

81
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,210
Who brought this in here?

82
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,170
I did. Ma'am.

83
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:55,216
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

84
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,802
Chief Bang...
It was my fault.

85
00:06:57,802 --> 00:07:02,598
I badgered Officer Kong
because it was my son's birthday.

86
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,268
572! Are you on a picnic?

87
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,860
Are you upset?

88
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,280
You shouldn't have committed a crime
if you didn't want to put up with this.

89
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,864
Isn't that so?

90
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:22,994
It's Min-woo's birthday and
we just wanted to celebrate.

91
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,580
Who told you to have baby
in a place Iike this?

92
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,166
That's a Iittle harsh, Chief.

93
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,505
I have my eyes on you.

94
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,798
Especially you, 572.

95
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,051
There is no special treatment
for mommies, got that?

96
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,679
You! Come with me.

97
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:50,229
Don't be upset.

98
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,732
You know what she's Iike.

99
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,901
But, she didn't have to
rip up the picture.

100
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:58,613
She's acting jealous because
she can't have kids.

101
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:00,490
But, still...

102
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,369
""Dancing Prison:
Philipino inmates" dance routine

103
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:09,373
Is it that bad?
My singing voice?

104
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,333
Don't be silly.

105
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,920
But, Min-woo cries
every time I sing.

106
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,172
You're just overreacting.

107
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:17,507
No. Really.

108
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,008
Look.

109
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:27,350
Sweet dream my baby...

110
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,393
My sweet...

111
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,855
You see?

112
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,275
What's gotten into her?

113
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:18,651
Min-woo!

114
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,444
Isn't mommy good?

115
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:25,867
We could benefit from
a program Iike this, too.

116
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,119
Learn to sing and get fit,
you know?

117
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,454
How did a bubbly bitch Iike her
kill someone?

118
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:34,041
Trust me it's not so hard
in the heat of the moment...

119
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,460
Not in front of a kid!

120
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,589
We have a new girl.

121
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,303
Be nice.

122
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:58,941
Are you hungry?
Wanna play?

123
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,488
You!

124
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,282
On your feet, now!

125
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:15,166
Who said you could sit there?
Make a proper introduction.

126
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,251
Leave me alone
unless you're gonna kill me.

127
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:23,591
Don't be horrible.
She's only so young.

128
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:26,093
And, watch the Ianguage!
You're in front of a child.

129
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,971
But sis, she needs to
Iearn her manners.

130
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:32,475
What good is Iearning manners here?
Just Ieave her alone.

131
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,852
But, still...

132
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,273
What the hell...?!

133
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,067
PIease take him.

134
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't cry, sweetheart.

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,280
You're raising a baby in prison?

136
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,075
What did you say?

137
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,827
It'II be a sweet memory for him.

138
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,374
Bitch!

139
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,626
Jeong-hye!

140
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,171
Yeon-sil!
Call the guards!

141
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,174
Guard!

142
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,509
Guard!

143
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,220
Good Iord!

144
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,522
Ms Hong,

145
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:24,318
We have medical record on
your husband's mental health.

146
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:30,074
We can't help you,
if you keep your mouth shut.

147
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,743
You have to tell us
what happened!

148
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:45,298
I took you under my wings
a worthless orphan.

149
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:46,674
How dare you go behind my back?

150
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,552
What were you doing,
not picking up the phone?!

151
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,929
Did you dodge, bitch?

152
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:58,561
You got pregnant so you
can fuck around freely, didn't you?

153
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,453
- Calm down!
- Let go!

154
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,746
Stop it!

155
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,706
- Let go! Let go of me!
- PIease!

156
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,584
Stop it!

157
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:24,253
Fuck you! I want to die!
Don't fucking get in the way!

158
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,632
- PIease don't do this! PIease!
- Let go!

159
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,761
Stay still.

160
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:33,638
Hold still!

161
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,643
I'II kill you, you Iittle...!

162
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:44,988
Yumi!

163
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:49,409
Is that you, sweetheart?

164
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,304
What have you done?

165
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,389
What have you done?

166
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,518
What have you done to him?
What have you done to him?

167
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,691
She's a wounded soul.

168
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:29,240
She killed her stepfather after
being sexually abused for years.

169
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,994
Her term got reduced by 10 years

170
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,914
but she continuously tried to
commit suicide before coming here.

171
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:42,962
By the way, Min-woo didn't
eat much all day without her mom.

172
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:45,715
He only has 6 more months...

173
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,719
- Really?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,638
What a monster!

175
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:54,391
How could one do such thing to
his own daughter?

176
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,643
Those bastards should
all be castrated.

177
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:58,687
What the fuck...?

178
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:02,107
821!
One Iove Ietter for you.

179
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,818
It's not Iike that.
He's just a pen pal.

180
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:08,363
Look at her blush!
A girl is a girl.

181
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,365
Anything for me?

182
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,744
- Here. Quickly!
- What is it?

183
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,872
Your husband sent
a recordable teddy bear.

184
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:20,834
It's not allowed but no-one
knows that it's a voice recorder.

185
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,509
Oh, my babies!

186
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:37,475
Are you crying?
Again?

187
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:41,521
Let's have some watermelon.

188
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,033
Crazy cow.

189
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,493
Don't read!

190
00:14:56,745 --> 00:15:00,665
This is his picture.
Isn't he handsome?

191
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,710
He Iooks Iike a good man.

192
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:04,836
How did you meet him?

193
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,130
He doesn't know she's in prison.

194
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,132
- And, she sent him someone else's picture.
- What?

195
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,427
She's been receiving his Ietters to
Officer Kong's address.

196
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:15,930
He works in Saudi Arabia
being conned for 3 years.

197
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,390
Hey...

198
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,268
You'II give me a headlock
and break my neck, too?

199
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,270
I know you were a pro-wrestler

200
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,649
but I never heard of someone
who broke a neck with a headlock.

201
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,359
Cut it out!

202
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:36,618
- You're really something.
- Have another one.

203
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,385
Look at him.

204
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:58,765
He's giving her a hug.

205
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:01,893
Are you giving her a hug
for the pain?

206
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,024
Stubborn bitch!

207
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:12,320
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't get mixed up with that bitch.

208
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:16,574
Did you? Yes?
Really?

209
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,721
Hello.

210
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,057
Sweetheart?

211
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:42,517
It"s me.

212
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,895
I wrote you several times...

213
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,731
You got the wrong number.

214
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:52,110
Baby, please!

215
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:53,862
Please...

216
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,895
How can human voice sound Iike that?

217
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:12,607
Isn't that just amazing?

218
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,485
You've got some voice, too.

219
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:19,364
Absolutely! Your voice is far more
amazing than theirs.

220
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:31,042
Look how big you got!

221
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,961
Good boy!

222
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,672
You Iook exactly Iike your mother.

223
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,633
- Good afternoon, sir!
- Let's go to mommy.

224
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,010
Hey, baby!

225
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:44,389
Do you have any difficulties
with raising him?

226
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,975
Not at all.
Thanks to the officers.

227
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,769
If there is anything,
Iet me know.

228
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,271
No difficulties...

229
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:54,190
but, I do have a suggestion.

230
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,026
Pardon? A choir?

231
00:18:56,026 --> 00:19:00,572
It crossed my mind while
watching the performance.

232
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,782
You know the Iife here
is quite boring.

233
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:06,953
Jeong-hye, Mr. Warden is busy...

234
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:10,749
So, you're suggesting organizing
a choir as a way of reformation?

235
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,210
It's good to watch one but it'II be
even better to do it ourselves.

236
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,048
Sounds good to me, too!
It'II make a good reformation program.

237
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:19,883
Officer Kong!

238
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,761
It's not appropriate to...

239
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,471
You think you can pull it off?

240
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,889
Pardon?

241
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:28,308
Do you think you can do
a good job of it?

242
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,939
What? A choir?

243
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:40,195
And, he gave me the full authority
with organizing it.

244
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:43,740
He gave you what?
You can't even sing.

245
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,451
I don't know. It just happened.

246
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,495
We've got to make it work
no matter what!

247
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:51,414
Try to make some sense!

248
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:54,626
How do you form a choir anyway?

249
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,837
You clueless cow...

250
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,422
What's wrong, sweetheart?

251
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:10,141
Hush, hush! Good boy...

252
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:15,939
Sweet dreams, my baby...

253
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,069
My sweet baby...

254
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,571
Give him to me.

255
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,324
Hush, hush...

256
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:31,287
How come he cries every time I sing?

257
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,414
I really don't get it.

258
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,165
Everyone does, except you.

259
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:43,299
White wild roses blooming
on mama's way to work

260
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:53,977
Their white white petals
taste so good

261
00:20:56,062 --> 00:21:04,946
I took a few in the mouth
when I was hungry

262
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:10,327
while calling out
'mama, mama'...

263
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,620
I have a favor for you, too.

264
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,747
A favor?

265
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:19,711
If I do a good job of it,
reward me with a day out.

266
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,087
A day out?

267
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,798
There has to be a motivation
for me, too.

268
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,259
Of course...

269
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,511
It's important, motivation.

270
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:29,554
Chief Bang?

271
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,515
Well, I think...

272
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,142
So, we have a deal?

273
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:37,062
You've got yourself a deal.

274
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,655
Isn't that great? A choir?

275
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:49,491
Do you have to be a good singer?

276
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:52,535
No. You just have to Iove music.

277
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,204
We'II practice once a week,

278
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:57,040
and if we get better,
they'II send us out to perform outside.

279
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,376
- Is that true?
- Sure!

280
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,548
Are you crazy? You can't
promise things Iike that!

281
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:08,510
What if Chief Bang hears about it?

282
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,303
I just...

283
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:15,183
PIease think before
you say something!

284
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:16,977
You are such a trouble.

285
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,687
Moon-ok.

286
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,105
Moon-ok!

287
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,357
Moon-ok, Moon-ok, Moon-ok!

288
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,903
Will you Iet me pee?

289
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:33,284
You will Iead the choir, won't you?
PIease?

290
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:35,745
I'm not interested.

291
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,206
But you used to be a music professor.

292
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:40,625
Who could be more qualified for job?

293
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:45,463
PIus, how else will you see outside
these walls before you die... omg!

294
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,257
Dumbo!

295
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,969
How's your husband?

296
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,889
I told you not to call.
Stop calling me!

297
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,892
Darling...

298
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:00,729
How dare you call me that!

299
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,899
You feel Iike playing a mother now?

300
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:12,574
Do you have any idea what it's
Iike to Iive as a murderer's daughter?

301
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:14,576
Would you rather...

302
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,829
Would you rather that I die?

303
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,789
No.

304
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:22,083
It'II only make Iife easy for you.

305
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,960
Live as Iong as you can.

306
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:29,090
May everyday be hell for you.
Till the end.

307
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,012
Hyun-joo...

308
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,430
Baby...

309
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:05,043
Your daughter declined to see you.

310
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,659
Why did you turn her down?

311
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,537
I wish I had someone
who would visit me.

312
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:44,207
Kids these days...
they're such brats.

313
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,043
I wish I had a visitor.

314
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,299
PIease cover for
"Iaw of harmony" exam.

315
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:19,135
Don't worry about anything
other than the concert.

316
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,846
And, call me before you Ieave.

317
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,807
I'II meet you at the airport.

318
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:25,100
Thank you.

319
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,312
You need a new pair of shoes.

320
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:31,773
I'II get you a pair for present.

321
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,734
Really?

322
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:02,595
Wait for me, darling.

323
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:04,639
Wait up!

324
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,972
You're such a trouble!
I said I can't help you!

325
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,390
I know nothing about choir.

326
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,060
- You play the piano.
- Hardly!

327
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,395
Well, you know your basics,
don't you?

328
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,982
I was crushed by Chief Bang
again!

329
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,693
You'II get me
fired sooner or Iater.

330
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,196
That's why we need to
make this work!

331
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,740
How can I pull it off
without you?

332
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,658
I don't care.
I don't hear what you say.

333
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:06,034
Did you say something?

334
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,453
For the sake of Min-woo.
PIease?

335
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,163
Over here. Come on.

336
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,350
PIease, give it another thought.

337
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,352
You're asking the wrong person.

338
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:18,315
- There's no-one else but you.
- This is wrong.

339
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:21,818
- I'm on a death row.
- What's that got to do with music?

340
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:24,446
We'II start from tomorrow.

341
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:27,490
See you here after Iunch, okay?

342
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:28,825
Jeong-hye!

343
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,832
Jeong-hye! Jeong-hye.

344
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,838
Min-woo! Min-woo!

345
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,548
Come to mommy, baby!

346
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:46,760
You know how stubborn she is.
She'II never change her mind.

347
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,678
Is there any way?

348
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:50,013
Jesus!

349
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:53,350
Why are you bugging me?
I have no part in this.

350
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:57,312
Min-woo! Sweetheart!
Here, boy.

351
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:58,438
Here, boy.

352
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,986
- Where's he going?
- Great!

353
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:12,869
Are you the newbie?

354
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:19,959
What's a pretty face
Iike you doing here?

355
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,921
Get out of the way, kiddo.

356
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:31,346
- What are you staring at, bitch?!
- Pull him back up.

357
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:35,183
What?

358
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,686
What the hell did you say?

359
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,396
Fucking bitch!

360
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:41,481
I said pick him back up, bitch!

361
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,714
Let go!

362
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,134
Forget about the damn thing!

363
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:12,721
A choirwith scumbags Iike them?

364
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:15,056
Reform through music?
My ass!

365
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:19,060
This is the reality.
The bitch who got here pregnant,

366
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,105
and the bitches who beat her up.
They're all the same.

367
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,940
I'II report today's incident
to the warden.

368
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,860
Don't ever bring up
the subject again.

369
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:31,364
Not a day passed quietly,
since the psycho arrived.

370
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:35,910
Why fuss over a baby
that's not even hers?

371
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,247
Is that blood? Damn it!

372
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,248
My neck...

373
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:45,962
She must have many
scars in her heart.

374
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:50,133
They told me she tried to
killer herself several times already.

375
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:54,220
Maybe she hopes to ask
for forgiveness with her Iife.

376
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,475
Each day must be an unbearable
fear and agony.

377
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,145
She's not the only one suffering.

378
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,274
She has to go back
into the world, eventually.

379
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:10,737
Unlike me who'II die in here.

380
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:13,657
So, help her.

381
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:14,949
How?

382
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,951
The choir.

383
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,497
What's that got to do with it?

384
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:22,999
Because, there is no-one else.

385
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:28,088
Just do it, for the sake of
helping poor souls Iike her.

386
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:31,216
Come on.

387
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,234
Moon-ok, help me.

388
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:56,116
If we succeed, they"ll let me and
Min-woo out on a day-out.

389
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:03,039
He never saw the outside world
since he was born.

390
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,251
Help me, please.

391
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:12,215
Your attention, please.

392
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,553
I'II introduce you to the conductor.

393
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:17,512
PIease.

394
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,097
Put your hands together!

395
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:28,690
I'm not a worthy person
for the job.

396
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,861
Thank you for having me. I hope
this'II be an enjoyable experience for all.

397
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:37,532
Soon-yi is my name

398
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,827
But they call me EIena here

399
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,370
Mezzo.

400
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:45,123
Mezzo? What's that mean?

401
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,207
Next!

402
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:52,672
Only I can see him~

403
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,925
Only my eyes see him~

404
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:56,843
AIto.

405
00:33:56,843 --> 00:33:59,137
Matchstick factory in Incheon~

406
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,096
Mezzo.

407
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:01,681
What the hell is a 'mezzo?'

408
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:04,934
In human mind~

409
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:05,852
AIto. Both of them.

410
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,395
Ehera diya~

411
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,396
Mezzo.

412
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,649
Hallelujah~
Hallelujah, Hallelujah~

413
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,816
Soprano.

414
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:12,942
Mezzo.

415
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,612
I'm too ashamed to strip

416
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:16,613
AIto.

417
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:18,615
It's a jackpot!
Jack-jack-jack-jackpot~

418
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:19,616
AIto.

419
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:21,451
- I'm soft-hearted...
- Mezzo.

420
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:24,120
A Iate night at Mapo Terminal~

421
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,748
- Shanghai, Shanghai~ Shanghai~
- Next!

422
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,130
Aren't you gonna sing?

423
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,757
Me?

424
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,553
Watch him, please.

425
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:43,974
What the...?!

426
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:56,861
While mama is away picking oysters

427
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,077
the baby stays... um, stays~

428
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,038
Look! Your baby...

429
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,875
at home by himself~

430
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,715
- AIto.
- AIto?

431
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:18,508
I'm in?

432
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,262
Thank you so much!

433
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:24,306
- She's Ietting anyone it.
- Thank you!

434
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,355
What's the matter?

435
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:33,982
It's gonna be harder
than I thought.

436
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:36,526
It was only the first day.

437
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:39,237
There aren't enough
stronger singers.

438
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,448
There were
a few good ones, though.

439
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:43,825
We're seriously
short of sopranos.

440
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,954
572, Hong Jeong-hye.
An interview.

441
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,253
I think Chief Bang has a point.
Maybe we aren't ready for this.

442
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:59,174
There's a high risk for accident
having inmates in one place.

443
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:03,511
Forgive me, sir but everyone
makes mistakes.

444
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,640
I think it's too harsh if you
deny them of another chance

445
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,475
because of their mistakes.

446
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:11,645
It's not their past but what might
happen in the future we're worried about!

447
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:16,149
It's the negative attitude towards
reformation, that fails us.

448
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:18,943
Shut your mouth!
How dare you!

449
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,364
Let's not get heated up.

450
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,824
How about this?

451
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,037
We need to run a reformation
program for the next 2 quarters.

452
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:34,918
I'II give you 6 months.
Let's see what happens.

453
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,587
But, if there is no change
after 6 months,

454
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:39,756
you have to drop the choir.

455
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:42,092
You understand?

456
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:00,151
572!

457
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,779
572!

458
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:42,777
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling

459
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:50,035
It's you It's you must go
and I must bide~

460
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:52,996
The ranch...

461
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,749
Stop! Stop!

462
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,295
PIease come forward.

463
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:03,506
Come, come.

464
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,885
Anyone play the piano?

465
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:08,803
Officer Kong plays piano.

466
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:10,930
Me?

467
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,277
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry.

468
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:26,696
Sorry won't cut it!
I'II kill the goddamn...

469
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:29,115
Is murder your hobby?

470
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,325
I'm sorry.

471
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,953
The most important thing
in singing is the posture.

472
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,246
Tighten your stomach.

473
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,124
The summer's gone~ and, three!

474
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:47,008
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling~

475
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:53,640
It's you It's you must go
and I must bide~

476
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:56,977
The ranch...

477
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:17,789
I finished Bayer but quit
while practicing Czerny 100.

478
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,294
It's harder than I thought.

479
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,340
Will we be able to make it?

480
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,302
If onlywe had a solid soprano.

481
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,181
Actually, there is one...

482
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,560
It's real, this time.

483
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:42,605
You won"t give me your tongue?

484
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:44,357
How do I do that?

485
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:45,608
I"ve never done it before.

486
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:46,901
Let"s see if that"s true.

487
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:51,614
Five

488
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:54,075
four, three, two,

489
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,035
one.

490
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,912
Of all programs, why checkers?!

491
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,331
That's Iame.

492
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,166
I seriously don't understand a word.

493
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,417
Moon-ok!

494
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,545
Soprano! Soprano!

495
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,097
Go for it!

496
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:39,788
Officer Kong told me you studied
music before you came here.

497
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:44,334
I know what you're going to say.
I'm not doing the choir.

498
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,092
I wasn't gonna talk about that.

499
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,013
We're gonna die in here anyway,
you and I.

500
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:58,348
What?

501
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,811
Let's die quietly with a dignity.
Don't fucking bother me.

502
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:18,660
Moon-ok!

503
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,764
PIease don't be upset.

504
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:23,767
She thinks we can't do it
without her? Bitch!

505
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:35,236
Hang on...

506
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,118
Come on!

507
00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:44,371
What is it?

508
00:42:44,371 --> 00:42:45,789
Come on, Jeong-hye!

509
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:47,791
You got something to say to me?

510
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:52,045
If not, go away.

511
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,216
I'm sorry.

512
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:58,093
For what?

513
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:06,518
For being rude.

514
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:10,981
Come here.

515
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:28,748
There was a number I used to
play with my daughter all the time.

516
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,594
It's hard, isn't it?

517
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,431
It doesn't get easier for me, either.

518
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:51,896
Let's try to Iive the rest of the
remaining days with a smile.

519
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:56,234
If you miss her too much...

520
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:59,237
If it's too hard to endure

521
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:03,491
Iet us be each other's consolation

522
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:06,619
and provide shoulders to cry on.

523
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,315
Bravo!

524
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:42,692
That was great!
Fantastic!

525
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:45,153
A round of applause!

526
00:46:47,614 --> 00:46:48,615
48!

527
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:52,118
They say even earthworms
have a talent for rolling

528
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:53,912
Not earthworms, slugs.

529
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:57,374
Potato, potaa-to. Dumbo!

530
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,542
When did you Iearn to sing Iike that?

531
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:02,712
Singing was her major.
It was all she did day and night.

532
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:05,215
You'd have to be an idiot
not to sing that well.

533
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,094
But, you were a professional singer.
How come you're not as good?

534
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,222
I only sang at night!
Whereas she sang during the day, too.

535
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:15,058
- What difference does that make?
- A hell of a difference, cow!

536
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:18,478
How dare you raise questions?

537
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,147
Guard!

538
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:23,692
PIease! My son is sick.

539
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:26,945
Guard! Guard!

540
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:28,488
What's the matter?

541
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:31,199
I don't know. He's been
throwing up everything he ate.

542
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,076
He's boiling, too.

543
00:47:34,244 --> 00:47:35,745
Give him to me.

544
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,707
You know you can't come with him.

545
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:42,085
I'm sorry but that's the regulation.
I'II take good care of him.

546
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:44,921
Kong, please.
I'II be good.

547
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,922
I beg you!

548
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:49,134
Officer Kong, can't you do
anything about it?

549
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,595
Poor baby...

550
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,056
Come on out.

551
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:57,559
I'm so sorry.

552
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:03,898
You gotta Iet me cuff you at Ieast.
It's the regulation.

553
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,695
I called you a few minutes ago.

554
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,947
- That way.
- Thank you.

555
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:16,328
Sit over there.

556
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:27,630
Brave Iittle guy, aren't you?
Not crying once during the injection.

557
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:34,804
Hey, you're not the criminal.
Why act so nervous?

558
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:39,100
Oh... excuse me.

559
00:48:53,823 --> 00:48:56,326
Mother's hand has
the best healing power.

560
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:31,695
Sweet dream, my baby...
Oops...

561
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:44,666
My dear hometown is~

562
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:49,421
Cheong-ju Women's Penitentiary~

563
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:52,340
Stop!

564
00:49:55,385 --> 00:49:56,970
Come on out here.

565
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:06,813
Straighten your back
and pull the chin.

566
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,481
Tighten the stomach

567
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,567
And, smile!

568
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,611
Who the fuck was that?

569
00:50:13,737 --> 00:50:15,363
What's wrong with you?

570
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:18,616
I quit, you old hag!

571
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,743
Hey!

572
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,119
What the fuck did you say?

573
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,121
You got a fucking problem?

574
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:25,582
- Calm down!
- Watch it!

575
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:27,000
What's the matter with you?

576
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:28,543
Stop it!

577
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,134
What's going on?!

578
00:50:36,885 --> 00:50:40,513
You're not kids anymore.
Act your age!

579
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:43,391
You need to open your hearts.

580
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:47,020
Music is nothing
if you don't open up.

581
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:50,774
If there is anyone not ready to open up
their heart, please Ieave now.

582
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:57,989
My name is Son Chae-bin.
I'm 27 years old, from UIsan.

583
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:00,909
I got additional punishment
for special theft.

584
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:02,786
What did you steal?

585
00:51:02,911 --> 00:51:04,579
- School gates.
- School gates?

586
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:09,459
Me and some friends took them
and sold it to a foundry.

587
00:51:11,628 --> 00:51:13,755
My name is Lee Hyun-jeong.
I'm 27.

588
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:16,049
I was convicted for violation of
psychotropic substance Iaw.

589
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:18,259
A psychotropic substance?

590
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:19,719
Meth.

591
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:21,638
- Meth?!
- You're a meth-head!

592
00:51:21,638 --> 00:51:23,390
I'm from Kang-reung.

593
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,768
My husband had an affair
with a younger woman

594
00:51:26,768 --> 00:51:30,605
I set the bitch's house on fire.

595
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:32,941
I was sentenced to
10 years for murder.

596
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:35,944
I met Lord here and
became a new person.

597
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:37,779
I'm Choo Mi-nyeo, 28.

598
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:41,658
I recently got a certificate in hairdressing
with hopes of making a fresh start.

599
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,994
My name is Kim Yu-ja
from Go-heung.

600
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,705
It fucking hurts
where you hit me.

601
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:52,377
My name is Gang Star.
I got in here Iiving Iike one.

602
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:54,838
I'm sorry about earlier.

603
00:51:56,798 --> 00:51:59,634
I was a professional wrestler
before I came here.

604
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:06,683
My coach went behind my back
and took all my money...

605
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:12,022
I was only going to scare him
and accidently broke his neck.

606
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:14,482
I've got two angels.

607
00:52:16,276 --> 00:52:22,532
I got involved with Ioan sharks
because of the angels...

608
00:52:22,532 --> 00:52:26,494
I poisoned my husband and baby.

609
00:52:26,536 --> 00:52:29,122
I was hoping singing might help me.

610
00:52:29,122 --> 00:52:30,707
By mistake...

611
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:36,004
I killed my friends by mistake.

612
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:38,631
I really didn't mean to hurt them.

613
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,552
My name is Hong Jeong-hye.
I'm 32 years old.

614
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:49,017
And I'm from Seoul. I was sentenced
to 10 years for murder.

615
00:52:54,731 --> 00:53:00,070
The time I'm spending with my son
is the happiest time of my Iife.

616
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:03,740
But soon, we'II be separated.

617
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:05,450
So...

618
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:24,094
Until the day comes,

619
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:29,808
I would Iike you
to Iove him and cherish him.

620
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:09,055
Will someone Iike me
ever be able to sing?

621
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:19,941
Min-woo pooped!
Poop! Poop!

622
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:21,985
Get it off myface!

623
00:54:21,985 --> 00:54:24,195
Come and change your baby!

624
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:30,971
Sweet dreams, my baby~
My sweet baby~

625
00:55:31,554 --> 00:55:43,400
Surrounded by beautiful roses~

626
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:59,749
6 Month Later

627
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:40,749
If you Iive everyday
Iistening to your heart~

628
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:46,296
You'II know that there is
more precious thing than money~

629
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:50,634
Love and drama
isn't all the important~

630
00:56:50,759 --> 00:56:57,974
If you Iive everyday Iistening to
what your heart says~

631
00:56:58,308 --> 00:57:03,188
You'II know that there are
more things to Iaugh about than to cry over~

632
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:08,526
It's what you did and
how you did it that count~

633
00:57:15,116 --> 00:57:21,247
Your responsibilities and duties~

634
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:25,543
thing you have to do~
we Iove you!

635
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,754
GIiding over the night sky...

636
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:34,469
dark clouds will turn bright
white in the morning~

637
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:52,696
If you Iive everyday
Iistening to your heart~

638
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:57,867
You'II know there are more
things to Iaugh about than cry over~

639
00:57:57,867 --> 00:58:03,206
It's what you did and
how you did it that count~

640
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,009
Your responsibilities and duties~

641
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:18,013
thing you have to do~

642
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:22,517
We Iove you!
GIiding overthe night sky

643
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:26,604
dark clouds will turn
white in the morning~

644
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,690
A brand new day~

645
00:58:53,965 --> 00:58:55,717
We Iove you!

646
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:11,566
Look at mommy!

647
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,611
It's me, baby.

648
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,907
Great job!
What a genius idea!

649
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,286
Since I got appointed
the district commissioner,

650
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:27,540
I've never seen the inmates
so happy and energetic.

651
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,418
Thank you so much, sir.

652
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:31,878
Congratulations!

653
00:59:34,464 --> 00:59:37,801
What's the matter, Chief?
Have we done something wrong?

654
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:41,054
Who chose the song?
Are you trying to screw me?

655
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:45,392
Anyways... we have the
adoption date for 572's son.

656
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:46,601
Pardon?

657
00:59:48,228 --> 00:59:49,771
Get on with the procedure.

658
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,071
I think he is musically talented.

659
00:59:58,071 --> 00:59:59,114
What?

660
00:59:59,197 --> 01:00:00,699
You saw him back there?

661
01:00:00,824 --> 01:00:04,703
I did.
He was all over the place.

662
01:00:04,703 --> 01:00:07,580
You see? He's already feeling
the music with his whole body.

663
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,750
You got nothing better
to brag about, silly?

664
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,973
Did you get told off again?

665
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:29,644
No... We have the date.

666
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:30,812
For my day out?

667
01:00:33,523 --> 01:00:38,194
How Iong are they giving me?
one night? 2 nights?

668
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:39,612
Well...

669
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:40,947
What's the matter?

670
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:42,824
You have to send him away that day.

671
01:00:44,868 --> 01:00:49,998
If you have changed your mind,
have a relative or a friend take him.

672
01:00:49,998 --> 01:00:52,250
You don't have to give him up.

673
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,296
Let's go as planned.

674
01:00:56,755 --> 01:01:04,554
How could I ever show up
in front of him?

675
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,973
Are you all right?

676
01:01:09,392 --> 01:01:14,731
I'm okay. It's not Iike
I didn't know about it.

677
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:17,901
You're right.
What can you do?

678
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:20,403
You just have to bury him
in your heart.

679
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:23,823
- When is the date?
- The day after tomorrow.

680
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:29,162
This is what's best for him.

681
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:34,376
It's really not a suitable
environment for him.

682
01:01:40,006 --> 01:01:41,549
I Iove you!

683
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:48,223
This is outright wrong!

684
01:01:48,223 --> 01:01:51,935
How can they do this?

685
01:01:51,935 --> 01:01:55,063
Hush now. No-one can be more
heart-broken than the mother.

686
01:01:55,063 --> 01:01:58,984
What kind of a Iaw separates
a child from his mother?

687
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:02,821
What the hell are you crying about?

688
01:02:02,821 --> 01:02:07,158
Did you think he could Iive
with us in this tiny cell forever?

689
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,203
Min-woo! Sweetheart!

690
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:57,125
Give me the bag.

691
01:02:58,543 --> 01:02:59,919
Let's go.

692
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:10,055
O wind, send my Iove to her~

693
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:12,141
What's the matter?

694
01:03:12,307 --> 01:03:14,184
Who died today, huh?

695
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:30,951
Both parents are teachers.

696
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:33,912
You don't have to worry
about the educational aspect.

697
01:03:33,912 --> 01:03:35,914
PIease take good care of him.

698
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:42,004
And, pass this to
his adoptive parents.

699
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,719
I'II make sure I do.

700
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,597
It'II be a really precious gift
for the child.

701
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,883
Are you okay?

702
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:12,302
Jeong-hye! Jeong-hye!

703
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:14,263
Jeong-hye!

704
01:05:40,497 --> 01:05:45,085
Say "mommy."
Let's go home.

705
01:05:51,925 --> 01:06:00,309
- Yes. It's mom.
- That's right.

706
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,081
Wait up! Jeong-hye?

707
01:06:34,718 --> 01:06:37,137
Jeong-hye! Jeong-hye!

708
01:06:37,262 --> 01:06:42,267
Silly cow... Snap out of it!

709
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:52,486
Min-woo...

710
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,280
How Iong will you go on Iike this?

711
01:06:57,741 --> 01:07:02,204
It's as if my heart is torn out.

712
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:07,918
Your pillar of hope is gone.
Of course you feel that way.

713
01:07:08,293 --> 01:07:10,712
Laugh even if
you want to die or cry.

714
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:13,549
You must Iaugh if you want
your son to be happy.

715
01:07:13,674 --> 01:07:16,635
If it's meant to be,
you'II be reunited some day.

716
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,264
You need to stay strong for that.

717
01:07:20,264 --> 01:07:22,641
You got that?

718
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:37,364
Mom... Mom...

719
01:07:37,364 --> 01:07:46,415
Senoya, senoya~

720
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:51,378
The mountains and the ocean~

721
01:07:58,469 --> 01:08:05,434
The mountains and the ocean~

722
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:13,609
We will, we will~

723
01:08:14,193 --> 01:08:17,988
I feel Iike a zombie
singing Iike this.

724
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:22,576
You're right.
Let's spice it up a bit.

725
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,662
Why don't we hear Officer Kong sing?

726
01:08:25,662 --> 01:08:27,706
Hey, Kong.

727
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:29,791
Go on. Sing us a song.

728
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:34,129
- Sing!
- Sing!

729
01:08:34,129 --> 01:08:35,797
I can't sing!

730
01:08:36,465 --> 01:08:41,136
- Sing!
- Sing!

731
01:08:45,974 --> 01:08:55,192
Can you think of something hot!
something exciting to do?~

732
01:08:55,776 --> 01:08:59,196
Like taking a trip when you've
got tons of work

733
01:08:59,363 --> 01:09:02,783
Like going bungee jumping
off a rooftop

734
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:06,662
Like going strip teasing
in a subway station

735
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:09,748
Ya ya ya ya ya!

736
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,377
Liking doing a crazy dance
with flower in your hair

737
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:16,839
Like shaving off your head
the day before a blind date

738
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:20,467
Like jogging naked
on a rainywinter night

739
01:09:20,592 --> 01:09:23,512
Ya ya ya ya ya!

740
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:42,239
I woke up this morning
and my mind fell away

741
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:47,452
And Iooking back sadly
from tomorrow

742
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:52,708
As I heard an echo from
the past softly say

743
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:57,671
Come back, come back,
won't you stay

744
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:04,845
I wanted to reach you,
Iet you know I still care

745
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:10,476
And Iost in the silence
of my sorrow

746
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:15,606
I put a promise in the wind,
on the air

747
01:10:15,606 --> 01:10:21,528
To fly away to you there

748
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:32,748
Touch the wind

749
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:43,967
Catch my Iove as it goes sailing

750
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:55,395
Touch the wind and
I'II be close to you

751
01:10:55,479 --> 01:11:05,572
I'II be easyto find

752
01:11:19,169 --> 01:11:22,548
4 Year later

753
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,135
I'm sorry.

754
01:11:30,597 --> 01:11:33,517
I have an important announcement.

755
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:35,060
An announcement a day.

756
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,604
Are we singing in front of
the President or something?

757
01:11:38,981 --> 01:11:40,732
Don't be surprised!

758
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:47,030
We are invited to the national women's
competition as a special guest!

759
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:48,365
When is it?

760
01:11:48,365 --> 01:11:52,202
On Christmas eve.
At the Seoul Cultural Center.

761
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:56,540
Christmas Eve?
Are we really going to Seoul?

762
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,043
You don't believe me?
I never Iie.

763
01:12:01,545 --> 01:12:04,548
And, there is another surprise!

764
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:07,384
You can invite your families as guests.

765
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:10,554
Really?
The family can come, too?

766
01:12:10,554 --> 01:12:15,058
We'II also arrange a time for you
to meet your family afterwards.

767
01:12:15,893 --> 01:12:20,230
Oh my god!
Yeon-sil!

768
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:25,777
Convicted serial killer
WH Kim will be

769
01:12:25,777 --> 01:12:29,865
the first person to be executed
after a 13-year moratorium.

770
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:33,535
Is this a good idea?
At a time Iike this?

771
01:12:35,662 --> 01:12:38,916
It's going to be all right.

772
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:42,044
...that the death penalty
is officially reinstated.

773
01:12:42,252 --> 01:12:43,337
Good job!

774
01:12:52,262 --> 01:12:54,097
Do me a favor, will ya?

775
01:12:54,264 --> 01:12:57,100
I don't know when I'II
ever be outside again...

776
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:03,232
I would Iove to see
his face up close.

777
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:22,034
Jeong-min! Jeong-ah!

778
01:13:23,953 --> 01:13:25,829
It's mommy.

779
01:13:27,164 --> 01:13:31,168
Are you guys being good girls?

780
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:36,131
Mommy misses you both so much.

781
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:36,152
Did you call your mother?

782
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:55,129
Will you be able to come
to Korea for Christmas?

783
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:57,882
I have tickets for
a choir performance.

784
01:14:57,882 --> 01:15:00,760
I was wondering
if you can go with me.

785
01:15:02,762 --> 01:15:04,013
Ma'am!

786
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:09,644
How have you been?

787
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:13,648
We'II be performing in Seoul.
Here is the ticket.

788
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,276
Of course, your daughter
will be there, too.

789
01:15:17,401 --> 01:15:20,780
Will it be okay for me to come?

790
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,491
Of course, ma'am.
You should definitely be there.

791
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:24,575
See you then.

792
01:15:27,787 --> 01:15:30,581
Ms. Seo!

793
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:33,376
Who are you?

794
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:38,965
PIease! Just a moment.

795
01:15:38,965 --> 01:15:40,550
Your mother didn't send me here.

796
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:43,678
But, I know she wants you
there so much.

797
01:15:43,928 --> 01:15:45,304
PIease Ieave.

798
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:49,976
There might not be another
chance Iike this.

799
01:15:49,976 --> 01:15:52,478
PIease try to understand your mother
just once.

800
01:16:02,488 --> 01:16:06,450
We would be willingly help
our son"s mother

801
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:11,289
but it"s a tough favor.
I"m sorry.

802
01:16:18,713 --> 01:16:20,673
Tomorrow is the big day.

803
01:16:21,299 --> 01:16:24,177
Will my babies recognize me?

804
01:16:24,427 --> 01:16:26,971
You have to recognize
your own babies!

805
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:28,931
How will they recognize you?

806
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:31,350
They say blood is thicker than water.

807
01:16:34,187 --> 01:16:35,980
You'II be fine.

808
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:40,026
Is she asleep already? They say you
Iose sleep with your age.

809
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:41,068
Hey, sis!

810
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:44,530
Leave her alone.
Just go to sleep.

811
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:50,953
You're right. I have to get my
beauty sleep for the big day.

812
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:58,711
It was announced today
at the High Court,

813
01:16:58,711 --> 01:17:02,340
that WH Kim"s execution
will be carried out as expected.

814
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:06,677
Did you carry out a thorough
inspection of the concert hall?

815
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:09,305
Everything as planned.

816
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:10,932
There shouldn't be any problem,

817
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:15,061
but with the current political climate,
please pay extra attention.

818
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:23,194
the official resumption of capital
punishment after a 13-year moratorium.

819
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:34,914
- How on earth...?!
- Wow!

820
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:37,750
How did they put up
a building Iike that?

821
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:41,087
- It's awesome!
- Mind blowing!

822
01:17:46,259 --> 01:17:48,928
Moon-ok, here.

823
01:17:48,928 --> 01:17:50,221
Your baton.

824
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:56,227
It's wonderful!

825
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:57,728
Do you Iike it?

826
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:58,938
Sure!

827
01:18:31,429 --> 01:18:32,722
Let's go see mommy!

828
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:35,600
Let's go, Iet's go!

829
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:42,440
Everyone, stay close to the wall.

830
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,364
Hey, Min-woo! Wait up!

831
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:51,782
Min-woo!

832
01:18:51,782 --> 01:18:54,410
- Go.
- Let's move!

833
01:18:56,704 --> 01:18:58,289
Min-woo!

834
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,418
Wait up!

835
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:12,386
Do you know me?

836
01:19:12,803 --> 01:19:14,138
Is your name Min-woo?

837
01:19:14,138 --> 01:19:17,308
Yes. How do you
know my name?

838
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:29,654
Mom!

839
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:31,113
Who are you?

840
01:19:32,073 --> 01:19:33,783
What did you do to my son?

841
01:19:35,201 --> 01:19:36,661
You okay, sweetheart?

842
01:19:36,786 --> 01:19:39,372
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

843
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:43,167
What did she say to you?

844
01:19:46,379 --> 01:19:48,047
Where is 572?

845
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,465
Has anyone seen Hong Jeong-hye?

846
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,802
Where did she go?
She was here a minute ago.

847
01:19:54,345 --> 01:19:55,972
Where have you been?!

848
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:59,016
I needed the toilet...

849
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:05,815
Listen everyone.

850
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:09,527
Your every movement shall be
controlled by officers nearby.

851
01:20:09,652 --> 01:20:13,239
If anyone Ieaves the group
or act individually,

852
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:18,452
she shall be subject to punishment.
I would appreciate your cooperation on this.

853
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:20,079
Are we clear?
Any questions?

854
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:24,500
I'm about to burst. When are we
going to the restroom?

855
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,962
We'II all go as a group
in a few minutes.

856
01:20:28,421 --> 01:20:29,839
30 minutes to go!

857
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:31,215
PIease get ready.

858
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:33,092
I'm bursting!

859
01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:35,386
- Me, too!
- I'm going to wet myself soon.

860
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:41,726
Stay close to the Ieft wall.

861
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,814
we apologize for the inconvenience.

862
01:20:54,113 --> 01:20:56,490
You don't have the face the wall.

863
01:21:26,145 --> 01:21:30,233
In a moment, 2009 National Women's
Choir Competition will begin.

864
01:21:30,316 --> 01:21:31,484
Who's in charge here?

865
01:21:31,484 --> 01:21:33,569
How are you managing
the security around here?

866
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:35,780
I'm sorry, sir.
PIease follow me.

867
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:45,873
Men are all about 'sexy.'
They dig red Iips.

868
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:51,587
Isn't that too much?
I prefer the 'fresh face' Iook.

869
01:21:51,754 --> 01:21:55,299
'Fresh face' Iook only works if
you have some freshness to work on!

870
01:21:55,299 --> 01:21:58,553
You gotta put as much
make-up on as possible.

871
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,680
Put your hands on your heads
and face the wall!

872
01:22:00,847 --> 01:22:02,765
Move it!

873
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,393
There has been a theft.

874
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:07,854
Come forward now and
we'II take that into consideration.

875
01:22:07,854 --> 01:22:09,564
What are you doing?

876
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:13,609
Didn't you hear me?
I said there has been a theft.

877
01:22:13,609 --> 01:22:15,361
So what? What's that
got to do with us?

878
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:17,697
It happened in the restroom
where you have been.

879
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:19,198
So what?

880
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,201
The one that Ieft the group and
wandered off... Step up!

881
01:22:26,038 --> 01:22:31,169
We'II have a bumper harvest~
How wonderful~

882
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:48,060
I didn't do it.

883
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:57,028
In my heart, in my heart,
I will pray, I will pray~

884
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:05,203
We'II carry out a close inspection.
Take off your clothes.

885
01:23:05,578 --> 01:23:07,788
- We told you it wasn't us!
- Be quiet!

886
01:23:07,788 --> 01:23:10,208
Don't make a fuss!
CIothes off now!

887
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,668
What you're doing is
an infringement of human rights!

888
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:16,422
And, you're interrupting
the course of justice.

889
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:18,508
Search them!

890
01:23:20,009 --> 01:23:24,680
I'II have to ask for your understanding
on some Iast minute changes.

891
01:23:24,764 --> 01:23:30,019
The performance by Cheong-ju
Women's Penitentiary Choir

892
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:32,730
is canceled due to
unexpected circumstances.

893
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:35,566
- What?
- I ask for your understanding.

894
01:23:35,566 --> 01:23:37,777
- Up next, we'II have 'Bitsori' choir
- That can't be!

895
01:23:37,777 --> 01:23:40,905
PIease give warm welcome.

896
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,953
Fucking hell! AII right!
I'II strip.

897
01:23:46,953 --> 01:23:50,164
Do your fucking search
all you want! Look!

898
01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:51,541
Look!

899
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:09,517
Chief Bang!

900
01:24:09,517 --> 01:24:12,311
What do you mean
the performance is canceled?

901
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:14,814
I'm not 100% sure about what happened.

902
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:17,233
I think they're acting
on speculation.

903
01:24:17,233 --> 01:24:18,818
That's nonsense!

904
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:20,987
You make sure that
we're back on again.

905
01:24:20,987 --> 01:24:22,488
I'II take the responsibility
if anything goes wrong!

906
01:24:22,488 --> 01:24:23,614
Sir?

907
01:24:31,414 --> 01:24:32,790
Why are you taking your shirt off?

908
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,168
Get your hands off me!

909
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:37,128
Did you see us steal it?

910
01:24:40,214 --> 01:24:41,591
- Stop it!
- Hold still!

911
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:43,092
Get your hands off of her!

912
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:47,054
You fucking thieves!
How dare you cause disturbance?

913
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:49,807
How dare you make accusations
based on speculation?

914
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:52,185
But, we've already made
the announcement.

915
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:54,854
If our choir don't get to perform

916
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:57,565
I'II have your asses reported
to the human rights commission.

917
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,192
What are your names?!

918
01:24:59,192 --> 01:25:00,193
Excuse me?

919
01:25:00,484 --> 01:25:03,779
Don't move! Stay down
on your knees.

920
01:25:05,948 --> 01:25:08,576
Out of the way!

921
01:25:08,826 --> 01:25:10,494
Who's in charge here?

922
01:25:13,164 --> 01:25:14,999
How can I help you?

923
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:18,461
What do you think you're doing?

924
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:21,047
We were in the middle of
a theft investigation.

925
01:25:21,047 --> 01:25:23,174
If there was a theft, you
should be catching the thief.

926
01:25:23,174 --> 01:25:24,550
What are you doing here?

927
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,093
There was a special order
from the Police Commissioner...

928
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:31,349
The people who came here were
selected from the model prisoners!

929
01:25:31,349 --> 01:25:34,185
Dozens of extra officers were
dispatched for the occasion.

930
01:25:34,268 --> 01:25:36,187
Are you accusing us of being
negligent at our job?

931
01:25:36,187 --> 01:25:40,525
If our choir is responsible for
the theft I'II take the blame myself!

932
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:45,071
What are you doing?
Get up now!

933
01:25:52,537 --> 01:25:56,832
I won't fucking do it.

934
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:00,002
It's their Ioss if they miss out
on our performance.

935
01:26:00,086 --> 01:26:01,671
I'm Iost for words!

936
01:26:01,796 --> 01:26:04,465
How can they accuse us Iike that?

937
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:09,262
What are you doing?

938
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:10,388
Aren't you gonna get
ready for the performance?

939
01:26:10,388 --> 01:26:11,597
We're up in 10 minute.
Hurry!

940
01:26:11,597 --> 01:26:13,558
Over here.
Let's move!

941
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:14,642
Take your dresses.

942
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:17,103
Let's get changed quickly.

943
01:26:17,103 --> 01:26:17,645
Hurry.

944
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:20,064
- Pass my dress.
- Hurry!

945
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:24,068
It's the time for me
to say good bye.

946
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:27,071
Oh, we have good news!

947
01:26:27,071 --> 01:26:34,787
The special performance by
Cheong-ju Women's Penitentiary choir

948
01:26:34,787 --> 01:26:36,873
is ready for the stage.

949
01:26:36,873 --> 01:26:37,707
We'II get to see mom!

950
01:26:37,707 --> 01:26:41,294
Ladies and gentlemen, please give
warm hands for 'Harmony Choir.'

951
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:23,586
Look, it's mom!

952
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:14,804
The winter may pass and
the spring disappear

953
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:30,862
The summer too will vanish
and then the year

954
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:48,838
But this I know for certain
You'II come back again

955
01:28:49,922 --> 01:29:03,895
And even as I promised
you'II find me waiting then

956
01:29:49,315 --> 01:30:00,618
God help you when wandering
Your way all alone

957
01:30:01,702 --> 01:30:16,008
God grant to you his strength
As you'II kneel at his throne

958
01:30:16,133 --> 01:30:27,520
If you are in heaven
now waiting for me

959
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:18,237
Hwa-ja!

960
01:31:27,663 --> 01:31:28,831
Bravo!

961
01:31:58,486 --> 01:32:11,082
BIessing for Christmas
Love for Christmas~

962
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:22,593
I will be thinking of the day
we meet again~

963
01:32:35,815 --> 01:32:47,952
It doesn't matter to me whether
we're together or separate~

964
01:32:48,369 --> 01:33:01,174
Because my heart stays with you
always and forever~

965
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:15,021
When we meet again,
Iet's sing your song together~

966
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:26,365
So that the world will
fill with your scent~

967
01:33:26,908 --> 01:33:39,295
It doesn't matter to me whether
we're together or separate~

968
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:53,434
Because my heart stays with you
always and forever~

969
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:12,745
BIessing for Christmas
Love for Christmas~

970
01:34:13,496 --> 01:34:24,006
I will be thinking of the day
we meet again~

971
01:34:26,384 --> 01:34:37,770
I will be thinking of the day
we meet again~

972
01:35:14,724 --> 01:35:16,100
Excuse me...

973
01:35:16,267 --> 01:35:17,310
Yes?

974
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:22,648
Do you know...
where the restroom is?

975
01:35:23,149 --> 01:35:24,650
The restroom?

976
01:35:27,945 --> 01:35:29,280
It's over there...

977
01:35:29,488 --> 01:35:30,615
Thank you!

978
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:31,657
- Thank you so much!
- Excuse me!

979
01:35:31,657 --> 01:35:35,870
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you...

980
01:35:42,752 --> 01:35:44,587
That hurts!

981
01:35:51,802 --> 01:35:53,721
- Look who's here.
- Mommy!

982
01:36:08,528 --> 01:36:10,196
Thank you.

983
01:36:10,613 --> 01:36:11,989
Thanks.

984
01:36:11,989 --> 01:36:13,407
Mother!

985
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:17,787
Hey, here...

986
01:36:51,529 --> 01:36:53,114
Where are you going?

987
01:36:58,411 --> 01:37:00,204
Why are you running away?

988
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:06,711
Didn't you come to see me?

989
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:13,259
Mom!

990
01:37:13,259 --> 01:37:14,552
I'm sorry, baby.

991
01:37:14,552 --> 01:37:16,179
I'm sorry, mom!

992
01:37:17,889 --> 01:37:20,766
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

993
01:37:20,892 --> 01:37:22,727
Hello.

994
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,731
So, your name is Hoon.

995
01:37:27,273 --> 01:37:30,193
You Iook great.

996
01:37:30,985 --> 01:37:33,196
Yellow Iooks so nice on you!

997
01:37:33,196 --> 01:37:36,949
I'm in the Yellow Ribbon
Children's Choir.

998
01:37:39,535 --> 01:37:40,912
Min-woo...

999
01:37:43,414 --> 01:37:50,171
I mean 'Hoon!'
Will you give me a hug?

1000
01:37:50,671 --> 01:37:52,256
Mom?

1001
01:37:53,966 --> 01:37:56,511
The thing we do before you
go to nursery in the morning...

1002
01:37:56,636 --> 01:37:58,387
Do it to her.

1003
01:38:03,726 --> 01:38:05,603
I Iove you.

1004
01:38:07,438 --> 01:38:14,737
I... I Iove you, too.
I Iove you so much.

1005
01:38:29,627 --> 01:38:31,170
Thank you.

1006
01:38:32,547 --> 01:38:34,841
Thank you so much!

1007
01:38:40,763 --> 01:38:42,765
It's Christmas.

1008
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:46,811
This is all I can give you.

1009
01:38:46,853 --> 01:38:51,315
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1010
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,151
Hoon!

1011
01:38:54,151 --> 01:38:56,404
Say good bye to the nice Iady.

1012
01:38:56,529 --> 01:38:58,948
Good bye.

1013
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:02,618
It was nice meeting you.

1014
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:16,210
We had anticipated this

1015
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:20,256
but I didn't know the order
would be issued so quickly.

1016
01:41:21,799 --> 01:41:23,342
Officer Kong Na-young!

1017
01:41:23,342 --> 01:41:25,011
How can you be Iate
on a day Iike this?

1018
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:28,931
I'm sorry.
This won't happen again.

1019
01:41:29,307 --> 01:41:31,601
That's all for this morning.

1020
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:34,103
Chief Bang, brief her on
this morning's meeting.

1021
01:41:34,103 --> 01:41:35,062
Yes, sir.

1022
01:41:47,033 --> 01:41:48,701
Something's not right.

1023
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:51,120
Who died? What's with
the atmosphere?

1024
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,540
- Well,...
- You're acting weird, too!

1025
01:41:54,665 --> 01:41:55,875
We have an official Ietter.

1026
01:41:55,875 --> 01:42:01,047
Are we being invited again?
Gosh! I'II be so busy.

1027
01:42:01,047 --> 01:42:03,674
An execution order was issued.

1028
01:42:04,258 --> 01:42:05,426
Excuse me?

1029
01:42:13,017 --> 01:42:14,852
Go ahead.

1030
01:42:14,852 --> 01:42:19,232
I can't believe how nervous I am.
This isn't a dream, is it?

1031
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:48,845
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

1032
01:42:51,264 --> 01:42:54,684
- Mother!
- Baby... my baby...

1033
01:42:56,269 --> 01:43:00,481
- I'm sorry, mom.
- Hyun-joo. Sweetheart...

1034
01:43:18,457 --> 01:43:19,709
Try this.

1035
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:26,215
Watch out for the bones.

1036
01:44:00,374 --> 01:44:03,544
Your face Iit up overnight.

1037
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:05,129
Did you have a good dream?

1038
01:44:05,129 --> 01:44:06,631
You're right.

1039
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:08,007
I must be coming to the end
of my days.

1040
01:44:08,007 --> 01:44:09,800
AII these things that happened...

1041
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,511
Why do you say such
a horrible thing?

1042
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:13,179
Spit on the floor
and hop three times.

1043
01:44:13,179 --> 01:44:15,306
I feel really great.

1044
01:44:15,306 --> 01:44:18,392
You must be so happy.
They'II come visit more often now?

1045
01:44:18,392 --> 01:44:23,189
Someday, your child will be
able to understand you, too.

1046
01:44:24,524 --> 01:44:27,026
You gotta treat us.

1047
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:31,405
Not just us but for the entire
choir members.

1048
01:44:31,405 --> 01:44:32,740
That's not a problem.

1049
01:44:57,056 --> 01:44:58,474
Let's go.

1050
01:44:59,684 --> 01:45:04,564
No, Chief!
No.

1051
01:45:08,317 --> 01:45:14,031
No...

1052
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:33,885
Why did you Iet him go Iike that?

1053
01:45:33,885 --> 01:45:36,637
I didn't know what to say.

1054
01:45:38,389 --> 01:45:40,558
I wanted to take him
home with me.

1055
01:45:42,685 --> 01:45:47,648
Your husband's a midget.
What do you see in him, seriously?

1056
01:45:49,025 --> 01:45:51,402
He's way better than your Deok-pal!

1057
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:58,951
You have a visitor.
PIease get ready.

1058
01:45:58,951 --> 01:46:02,288
Hey, Kong. What's wrong
with you today?

1059
01:46:03,206 --> 01:46:06,292
Anyways, your Iuck must be
coming down on you all at once.

1060
01:46:06,292 --> 01:46:09,879
You never had any visitors
and suddenly...

1061
01:46:45,248 --> 01:46:49,710
What's the matter?
Are you envious of me?

1062
01:47:31,961 --> 01:47:33,880
Tell them you won't see them.

1063
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,464
I'II be okay.

1064
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,552
PIease... Don't go!

1065
01:47:39,677 --> 01:47:41,512
Don't go!

1066
01:47:41,971 --> 01:47:47,018
I'm sorry for not
being there to the end.

1067
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:50,229
Don't say sorry! Why?!

1068
01:47:52,106 --> 01:47:54,317
Don't say sorry now!

1069
01:47:55,234 --> 01:47:58,362
I'm okay. Stop crying.

1070
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:01,365
Mom! Mom!

1071
01:48:03,409 --> 01:48:04,327
I'II be okay.

1072
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:06,245
Mom!

1073
01:48:07,747 --> 01:48:10,166
Jeong-hye, I'II be fine.

1074
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,834
Moon-ok!

1075
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:19,342
I'm not Ieaving in shame.
So, that's okay.

1076
01:48:41,864 --> 01:48:43,282
I'm really okay.

1077
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:41,966
White wild roses blooming
on mama's way to work

1078
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:57,148
Their white white petals
taste so good

1079
01:49:59,442 --> 01:50:11,662
I took a few in the mouth
when I was hungry

1080
01:50:13,497 --> 01:50:25,885
I ate them while calling out
'mama, mama'

1081
01:50:27,678 --> 01:50:41,234
The night is dark and
mama hurrys back home

1082
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:53,871
On her own,
her pale ankles bare

1083
01:50:55,122 --> 01:51:09,262
Every night I dream
a white white dream of her

1084
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:27,780
of her coming home to me

1085
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:33,000
