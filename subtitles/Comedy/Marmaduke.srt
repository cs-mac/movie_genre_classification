00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,884
Being a teenager,
it can be rough,

6
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,653
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

7
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:15,306
But if you're a teenager,
and the world doesn't
fit you,

8
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:16,508
you're totally hosed!

being a big, awkward teenager

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,171

This little Padawan here
is Brian.

he loves to hang out with me.

Come on, buddy.
I can't see!

Yeah, I'm pretty busy myself.
I'll catch you later.

And this social

She loves to
play ball with me.

Okay, Barb,
you throw and I catch.

Not like that.

She slips me a steak here,
some turkey there.

Which is why I think
she doesn't even care
when I help myself.

How cute is she?
And she's my biggest fan.

57
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,951
You know, it's important
for them to get exercise
at this age,

58
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,086

for a walk every day.

Then there's
my owner, Phil.

He's a marketing guy for

I call him
Doctor No sometimes,

but rules with him.

No slobbering.

No barking.
No tackling the mailman.

Look, everybody's
got a weakness.
Sit.

Hey, Sarah,

83
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,206
Stay.

about getting a bath,
except for this!

Not again.

I like to give Phil
a little exercise, too.

90
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,788
He's cooped up in
the office all day.
Come on, Phil.

00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,491
That's the spirit!

install a new dog door?

when they got this.

But when you grow up
into this, I get it.
Not pretty.

hold things against Phil.

After all,
he's only human.

In the big leagues,
they take steroids and
cheat with supermodels.

with an organic

No, I'll save it
for dessert.

what that is.

Well, if this is our shot,
then we should take it.

Interesting.

313
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,165
I'm picking up
something else
here, also.

314
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,135
Absolutely not a purebred.

315
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,602
Really?

316
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,290
I'm sensing a little
English Mastiff.

Hey, watch it!

318
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,843
Your guess is
as good as mine.

319
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,065
You don't know your own
best friend, Phil?

320
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,466
Sure. Uh...

321
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,819
I love dogs.

322
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,022
I can tell a lot
about a man by the way
he treats his dog.

323
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,559
That's why I like
working out here.

324
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,563
I can measure, first-hand,
who I'm dealing with.

Watch it, Phil.
He can smell your fear.

327
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:00,705
Plus, you get all this
fresh air for
out-of-the-box thinking.

328
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:04,842
And, most importantly,
I get to spend time
with my little girl.

329
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,827
Jezebel.

00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,399
Hello, Cali!

332
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,353
Look at that fur!

333
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,073
Right. Take off your
shoes and let's walk.

334
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,575
You don't wear
shoes out here?

335
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,378
Come on, Phil.
Channel your inner canine.

336
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,847
Get some earth
between your toes.

337
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:30,184
It's not the earth
I'm worried about.

338
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,819
Stay out of trouble.
Good luck, Phil.

339
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,086
You're gonna need it.

340
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,890

He's definitely Midwest.

I'm gonna say Kansas.

MARMADUKE:
How did you know?

347
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,486
It's a gift.
What's your handle, newbie?

348
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,604
My name's Marmaduke.

349
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:53,373
Yikes!
Immediately moving on.

350

Meet the gang.

351
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,343
The egghead, here,
is Raisin.

(BRITISH ACCENT)
Marmaduke.

353

A unique synthesis
of "marma",

354
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:02,416
the scientific name for
the jumping spider family...

355
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,218
Oh! Oh!
I hate spiders.

...and the Duke
of Marlborough,

And the ultra-confident
Chinese Crested over here
is Giuseppe.

Before you ask,
yes, I'm a real dog.
No, I'm not a chew toy.

360
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,567
And I just get a little
nervous sometimes because
we live in California.

361
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,151
This is the land
of the puma!

362
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,437
There are no pumas
in Southern California.

Good to meet you guys.
Hey, you come here a lot?

366
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:36,283
It's the dog park, man.
It's like high school
for dogs,

367
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,685
which means
there's a few packs
to know about.

368
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,806
First,
you got your jocks.

369
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,424
FEMALE DOG:
Nice catch, Brad.

370
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,642
The only muscle
they don't use
is their brain.

371
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,177
O-M-G, Brad is H-O-T!

372
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,680
MAZIE: They mostly date
Afghans. Who actually
have no brain.

373
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,214
Oh! Frisbee!

374
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,717
Then you got
your drama geeks.

Somebody stop
this thing, man.
I got to get off, bro!

00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,728
MARMADUKE: (SIGHS) So far,
I'm not seeing anyone I'd
really fit in with.

384
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,865
Well, if you think you
got the game, you could
roll with our crew.

They're rich,
and they're spoiled

392
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,680
and they act like
their fleas don't bite.
It's ridiculous!

The little land shrimps
are Thunder and Lightning.

394

Dog Vader over there
is the man himself, Bosco.

that tough.

is Miss Perfect, Jezebel.

And he's super-jealous,

or he'll turn you into...

salivating on my girlfriend.

have anyone in mind?

776
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,817
Not specifically,
just thinking out
loud here.

777
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,604
Oh! (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

778
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:42,141
Right, right, okay.
No one specific.
That's good.

779
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,329
(SIGHS SADLY) Okay...

780
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,014
Listen up, Barkanova.

781
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:52,535
If it were me,
I'd want him to take me
to the junkyard.

782
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,887
It's really
romantic there at night.

783
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:57,773
There'd be a blanket
with some treats spread out,

784
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,194
music from an old car
radio playing softly.

785
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:04,697
Yeah, and lots of
great old stuff
to pee on, right?

786
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:07,217
Oh! You've got
so much to learn.

787
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:11,087
Here's the deal.
Girls want romance.

788
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:12,538
You know? Mystery.

789
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:14,540
Wow.

790
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:16,709
What?

791
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:20,379
You know, I never
really noticed before,
but you have really pretty...

Hey, buddy,
we're talking here.

Fire truck!

Oh, sorry.
Where were we?

00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,573
Uh... You said I
have really pretty...

Work to do.

No! Wait, Phil,
no, not now!

800
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,127
Hey, where are you going?

801
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,445

Phil, I need this.

802
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,281
Come on. Let's go.
MAZIE: "Really pretty" what?

803
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:39,515

MARMADUKE: (MUFFLED)
Carlos, let me
ask you something.

806
00:33:45,505 --> 00:33:47,306
Is my breath
really that bad?

807
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:48,874
CARLOS: A tube
of toothpaste
is a good start,

808
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,528
but you're gonna
need more than that.

809

(EXCLAIMS)
Dude, watch it!

810
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,763
Just gave myself
a tongue-bath.

815
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,355
Refreshingly minty.

Who am I kidding?
Minty breath,
better posture.

817

This stuff's
never gonna work.

These guys have real skills.
I could never speak gopher.

is even tougher. (BELCHES)

I just don't get it.

I'm a dog
and you're a cat,
we get along great.

That's because
you're my  hermano.

Say, does anybody
smell that?

I smell a cat
and I hate cats.

Cat! There's
no cat here.

No, no, no.
This one's mine, fellas.

Is this a dog park?
I must be horribly lost.

Oh, yeah,
you must be lost, cat,

843

is for dogs only.

I got the tail!

You said there'd
only be a few dogs.

It's a dog park.

want me to do?

hurt me, Mister.

cool and confident.

it's working.

be the large nostrils.
