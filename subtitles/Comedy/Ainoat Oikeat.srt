1
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,875
THE TWO AND ONLY

2
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:38,098
Nice to do something healthy
for a change. - It's bloody cold.

3
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:44,229
What a little darling!
Aren't you cute!

4
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,690
Is it a girl? - A boy.

5
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:52,654
He's a little charmer.
Aren't you? Adorable cheeks.

6
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,991
Yeah, they're nice.

7
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:03,165
His technique is wrong.
He'll strain his back.

8
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:08,337
Let's get some hot chocolate. - Now?

9
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,551
Here we go.

10
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:26,396
I thought we'd have hot chocolate.
- There's some chocolate in it, too.

11
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,278
These guys are
past their sell-by-date.

12
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,242
Yes, Timo is out, too! - Yippee!

13
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:42,996
His wife is at some seminar.
- I'll always find something.

14
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,791
Hi! Having fun?

15
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:51,380
Can I offer you girls
something? - Sure.

16
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:03,183
That can't be so easy!
- Picking up men, you mean?

17
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,603
Look, he needs a snorkel.

18
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,608
You could have anyone,
but you're too picky.

19
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,778
I'll only have the one and only.

20
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:22,286
You're really pretty.
- Thanks. And you're really young.

21
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,957
Thanks!
I've been to the army already.

22
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,713
So your testicles
have descended then?

23
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,924
From where?

24
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:58,155
Hi! You want a ride?
- No thanks, I don't have a long way.

25
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,516
Whore.
I'll teach you to refuse a ride.

26
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,062
Run all you like, it won't help.

27
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,650
Whore!

28
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,589
Are you a robber or a cop?

29
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,635
Did you hurt yourself?

30
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,224
Are you okay?
- That car just now...

31
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,770
Did he do something to you? - No...

32
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,237
You're an excellent...
creep repellant!

33
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,414
I've been hollered at
from cars before -

34
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,543
but this guy really
gave me the shudders.

35
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:41,800
Where exactly are we going?
- I'll be fine from here on.

36
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:47,097
Do you really think I'd leave you
at the mercy of perverts?

37
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:16,293
I have the same song in my head!
- Really? I don't even know it.

38
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:25,928
<i>The time is right
And you just might</i>

39
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,973
<i>See the rising sun...</i>

40
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:44,279
<i>And I hear you</i>

41
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,824
<i>Calling me</i>

42
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,954
That's how it goes.

43
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:07,594
What? - That song.
It was playing in that pervert's car.

44
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,146
We met ten minutes ago,
and we already have a song.

45
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,567
It's my and the pervert's song!

46
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,420
We stopped.
- Yeah. I live here.

47
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:49,261
Then you're safe.
- I think you need to walk me inside.

48
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:55,559
There are still many dangers.
- Like those stairs.

49
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,645
They look really steep.

50
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:05,027
I have a lift, too.
- Many have become stuck in those.

51
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,912
And the door needs to be opened.

52
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,879
I'm out of responses.
But that doesn't sound safe either.

53
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:12,970
Hey, Sisu!
What's in there? Hey, love!

54
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:33,282
Hanna, I had amazing sex last night.
- Me too.

55
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,411
The guy was more vigorous
than he looked.

56
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,997
I didn't sleep a wink.
- Me neither.

57
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,749
Hold on, Attila the Hen is here.

58
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,211
Maybe a little work?
- It's Kimi Räikkönen's wife.

59
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:50,799
And I'm Mika Häkkinen's girlfriend.
- Imagine, I'm Jenni Räikkönen.

60
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:55,721
I have to go, but you need to do
something about your life.

61
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:00,767
It's more boring than...
I don't know who to compare you to!

62
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,271
Try having joyful sex
with no strings attached.

63
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:09,276
It's cathartic when your pussy
gets a good pounding.

64
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,487
I know.

65
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,919
See you on Friday. - Can't wait
for you to torture me again.

66
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
All right.

67
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,601
How does it look? - Good.

68
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:29,273
Jenna is progressing as expected.
She's a tough girl.

69
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,985
Luckily she was fit to begin with.
- That's nice to hear.

70
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:38,532
Come on!
- Alright. Thank you. Bye!

71
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:45,539
Yes. Your appointment
is still with Doctor Pitkänen.

72
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:50,335
Yes, that's right. Goodbye.

73
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:55,299
Thanks. - You're welcome.
Have you been a bad girl?

74
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,303
Let's just say
I needed the morning off.

75
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,805
Any dirty details?

76
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,102
Can you take care of those
right away? - Sure.

77
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,314
Hanna?

78
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,775
How are you doing
with Jenna Miettinen? - Fine.

79
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:18,238
Now that her mother trusts me enough
not to intervene. - Now, now.

80
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:23,619
The Prime Minister's sister
is an important customer.

81
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,544
You're going somewhere.
- So are you.

82
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,947
What? - I was wondering
which was better.

83
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:48,370
What we did just now,
or when in August '97 -

84
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:55,669
Dennis Bergkamp scored
his first hat trick for Arsenal -

85
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,923
and finished it with
an incredible goal -

86
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:06,346
in which he took the ball
in his control with one touch and...

87
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,066
You know what's funny? - What?

88
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,489
I know almost everything
about Dennis Nicolaas Bergkamp -

89
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:30,037
but about you, I know just
the surname on your door.

90
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,417
Well, my name is Hanna.
- Hanna...

91
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,006
I'm Markus.

92
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,680
Can we leave it at that?

93
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:53,560
Joyful sex with no strings attached
suits me perfectly.

94
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:02,277
You're married.

95
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,072
Most definitely not.

96
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,204
That wasn't exactly
what I expected.

97
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:19,086
But I'm not going to be the first man
in history to refuse such an offer.

98
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,048
An order of joyful sex
with no strings attached coming up.

99
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,927
Who said anything about one order?

100
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:14,641
Are you a nymphomaniac, Miss?
- Hold that face!

101
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:36,371
<i>Morning. - Where the hell are you?
Celibate and on a retreat?</i>

102
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:42,669
This is so amazing.
That guy is so amazing!

103
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:47,007
Casual single sex is so amazing!
Elli, you're a genius.

104
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,136
You can't be serious!
It's the First Lady.

105
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:55,057
You fucking idiot,
what are you playing at?

106
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,145
He's the man of your dreams.
You're head over heels in love!

107
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,231
You're right.

108
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:09,238
I'm in love. He's the man
of my dreams. What do I do now?

109
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:14,368
Tell him tonight, when he comes over
with some plant in his mouth.

110
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:21,083
I told him: Nothing serious.
- He may just be waiting to propose.

111
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,419
Some men are like that.
When they get some pussy -

112
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:29,633
they start dreaming about your
wedding dress or future children.

113
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,678
<i>It's bloody irritating.</i>

114
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,138
<i>Hanna?</i>

115
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,140
<i>Hanna!</i>

116
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:44,815
Male strippers at the Market Square.
- Did the First Lady tip you off?

117
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,776
Looking at her is almost
like having a life of my own.

118
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,363
We're making
a fur hat from that cat.

119
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:56,201
First, tell us again that you really
picked up a man from the street -

120
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:00,789
took him home and screwed
his brains out. You! - Me.

121
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:05,002
Hanna, honestly.
Was he really that good?

122
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:11,466
He rubbed his stubble
against my neck without asking.

123
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,218
Oh crap.

124
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,183
Read it again.

125
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:26,607
"Morning, Hanna. Thank you
for another amazing night."

126
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,529
"I know you don't want more
and this arrangement suits you."

127
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,950
"I thought it suited me too, but..."

128
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,537
"I watched you this morning
while you were sleeping -

129
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,833
and one thing became
very clear to me."

130
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,421
"I want to wake up
next to you every morning."

131
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,261
"The ball's in your court now."

132
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,765
"If you don't call,
I won't come round again -

133
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:04,353
although I'll probably have to
chain myself to a radiator."

134
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,064
Poetry.

135
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,401
Go on.
- I can't make out the end.

136
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,695
There's still the best bit.

137
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:18,659
"Call me if you feel that
this could turn into something."

138
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:24,289
"We could do something fun today.
Go to the cinema or...

139
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:28,210
...buy a house in the country
and have ten children."

140
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,090
Show it to me. - You saw the number
before the vase tipped over?

141
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:37,052
Maybe for a second.
- What was the number? Say it!

142
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,765
Could that be a five? 5, 3...

143
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,394
Give it to me.

144
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,689
I know what it says. - What?

145
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:54,444
"Your tits are too small but
your arse is great." -You're awful!

146
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,406
Do you have a picture of him? - Yeah!

147
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:02,035
I could print it and
put it on our noticeboard.

148
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,878
It's all blurry.

149
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:15,174
You should've snapped his willy.
Elli might have recognised it.

150
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,303
<i>Your archives are extensive.
- And now, breaking news.</i>

151
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:23,807
<i>Prime Minister Ismo Majuri
was seriously injured -</i>

152
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,476
<i>in a car accident near Mäntsälä.</i>

153
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,980
<i>The Prime Minister was
on his way home to Lahti -</i>

154
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,234
<i>when his official car
collided with a lorry.</i>

155
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,740
<i>His bodyguard, who drove the car,
suffered the worst injuries.</i>

156
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,243
<i>Firemen are still
removing him from the car.</i>

157
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:48,290
How terrible.
- Yeah. That Majuri guy is quite hot.

158
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,919
Yeah, I'm worried you won't
get a chance to bed him.

159
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:57,007
<i>Screw you. - The Prime Minister
visited our studio this morning -</i>

160
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,012
<i>for a talk show that was
scheduled to be aired tonight.</i>

161
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,891
<i>He left the studio
straight to Lahti.</i>

162
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,186
Don't worry, love,
we'll find him.

163
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:13,315
No one can disappear
from the world.

164
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:25,619
RECOGNISE THIS MAN?
- Could it be Jesus?

165
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:41,176
Help me find Markus!
Handsome, tall, dark, handsome...

166
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,816
6842...

167
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,881
MP Mikael Jungner.

168
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,846
Give me a Markus update.
- There's nothing to update.

169
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,225
If that guy ever shows up,
I'll kill him. - Me too.

170
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,356
Here we go.

171
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,824
So Timo can't make it tonight?
- They're spending the night at home.

172
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,660
Pizza, sauna, and all that.

173
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,090
Sorry.

174
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,140
This almost turned out
to be a good evening.

175
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,777
It's become quite an obsession.
- You think?

176
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:34,331
This works. - Is Markus
disappearing from your head?

177
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,668
Markus who?

178
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:45,133
Hey, what's the matter? Well?

179
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,845
It's nothing. - Kimi...

180
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:53,600
This just brought back memories.
My dad died in a similar accident.

181
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:59,398
Same-coloured lorry and all.
Except he drove an old Mazda.

182
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,280
Elli, let's practise.

183
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,869
I'm going to miss you guys!

184
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:26,300
You got a postcard. "In Thailand
we put the flag up for you."

185
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:32,181
"Here's something for Cortex's
boring break room. Elli and Paula."

186
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:36,351
Annika wants to see you.
She's with the PM's aide.

187
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,689
The one who's been on the news.
Anders something.

188
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:46,403
"Thoracic vertebrae injured,
partial paraplegia, Th12..."

189
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,491
You have the most experience
with these sort of injuries.

190
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:54,119
Anders, I, and Ismo's sister Sari
have chosen you -

191
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:58,832
as the Prime Minister's
personal physiotherapist.

192
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:08,509
Let me just say...
that trust is essential.

193
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,637
The Prime Minister
is not a regular patient.

194
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,684
You can't talk about the treatments.
- That goes without saying.

195
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:24,691
This looks good. That is, if Hanna
agrees to the other conditions.

196
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:30,822
What conditions? - Ismo won't be
rehabilitated here, but at his home.

197
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:35,536
It's undoubtedly helpful
that the therapist...

198
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:40,666
...and the receiver of treatment
are in vicinity of each other.

199
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,711
He means that you need
to move in with Ismo. - In Lahti?

200
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:49,466
Yes, is it a problem? - You'll be
duly compensated, of course.

201
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,638
Let me just say that
in addition to your normal salary -

202
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:59,184
we'll pay extra.
A considerable amount.

203
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,522
I've always liked Lahti.

204
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:16,618
Prime Minister
at the power plant opening

205
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,249
Bodyguard still in coma

206
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,468
Are you sure someone
won't have a little accident?

207
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:37,181
Leather seats.
- I'll try to hold it.

208
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,517
Lake Vesijärvi.

209
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:46,481
Let me just say that they're
a little simple here in Lahti.

210
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:52,279
They named their lake
"Water Lake" -

211
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,617
so they'd remember
what it contains.

212
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:43,914
Let me just say that
the view is worth mentioning.

213
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:23,328
It seems our torture chamber
meets all the necessary criteria.

214
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,125
It'll do.

215
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:34,840
But as an inquisitor,
I have to make a complaint -

216
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,719
about the lack of stretching rack
and whipping pole.

217
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:42,306
Not to mention pliers.
- Ismo Majuri.

218
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:48,228
First names are fine. I don't want
to be formal with a woman -

219
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,899
who wants to pull out my teeth.

220
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,986
Hanna Palo. I thought I'd start
by tearing out your nails.

221
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:02,159
<i>Is everything alright here?
Alles in Ordnung?</i>

222
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,370
We've already noticed
a few shortcomings.

223
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:10,667
I can assure you that all
the equipment has been delivered.

224
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:16,381
There's no stretching rack.
- Stretching rack...

225
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,969
Pliers.
- Breaking wheel.

226
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:24,056
Whipping pole.
- Thumbscrew.

227
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,228
I'm familiar with
Ismo's sense of humour -

228
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:35,651
but I expected a little more
from a healthcare professional.

229
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,195
That was a misjudgment from you.

230
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,502
<i>Left hand forward,
right foot forward.</i>

231
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,633
Good. Put your weight on it.
And straighten.

232
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:05,222
There, the other hand.
Left foot. Move your weight.

233
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:10,102
And straighten.
The hand comes after that.

234
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:14,231
Are you sure you want to begin
at six a.m. Every morning?

235
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:17,109
And another session at seven p.m.

236
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,155
I thought we were done
with the inquisition jokes.

237
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:24,992
You don't understand
the big picture.

238
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:29,580
I'm technically on sick leave,
but in reality I'm not.

239
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:34,418
I'm running things from here,
but that can't go on forever.

240
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:40,048
The idea is to return to office
as soon as possible.

241
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:44,094
It's going to be really hard.
- I'm prepared for that.

242
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,264
I'm not sure if you are.

243
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:51,894
You haven't used these muscles
for weeks. They'll become sore.

244
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,439
I have a high pain threshold.

245
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:59,902
There's a little Dudeson in us all.
Right, Anders? - A what?

246
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:07,493
Goddammit! Bloody hell...

247
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:26,428
If you weren't so damn nice,
I'd send hit men after you.

248
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:31,558
Don't mess with me, or I'll put
a video of you swearing on YouTube.

249
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:36,605
Let me just say that
there should be a limit to humour.

250
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,942
Shower.
- Yes, please.

251
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:53,664
<i>Hi! Are you in Finland already?
- We've been here for hours.</i>

252
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,792
<i>Give us a Markus update.</i>

253
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:00,212
There's nothing.
I've missed you terribly.

254
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:05,843
<i>Where are you? We thought
you'd be at the bar waiting for us.</i>

255
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:10,597
<i>I'm in Lahti.
- Who kidnapped you?</i>

256
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,141
The Prime Minister.

257
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,060
...the same reform
we suggested two years ago.

258
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:41,688
Now they're presenting it
as their own -

259
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:47,027
as if they'd found
the philosopher's stone!

260
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:54,827
Let me just say that this hygiene
between the coalition partners...

261
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:32,281
Delete

262
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:47,254
Hi! Wonderful to see you!
- You too, darling!

263
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:51,842
What a palace! Let's stay here.
- No, we won't.

264
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,597
Has he hit on you yet?
- Don't be silly.

265
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,350
It's a good customer relationship
and maybe... - Sexual.

266
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:04,229
Friendship! - Yeah, right.

267
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:08,317
Neither of us thinks about
anything else. - Except fucking.

268
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,905
Stop it! - We were
at the local last week.

269
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:17,284
I did the PR for this new movie,
and the producer was with us.

270
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:21,830
He kept rubbing Elli's thigh
under the table.

271
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:27,085
Supposedly in secret,
but everyone saw it. - Including Kimi?

272
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:32,174
The producer went to the loo,
and Kimi came to say to Elli:

273
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:37,179
"If that guy doesn't take
his hand off, I'll rip his head off."

274
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:42,017
What happened then?
- I went to bed with Kimi.

275
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:48,190
Finally! - I couldn't very well
sleep with the producer.

276
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:51,151
Why not?
- I had fucked him already.

277
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:57,366
For the first time, it was sexy
when a man lost his hard-on.

278
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:01,954
I'm sorry. - We were trying out
something with toys...

279
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:06,416
<i>Mary had a little lamb...
- Do you want to hear this or not?</i>

280
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,171
Yes. - It hurt me a little,
and I told that to Kimi.

281
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:16,134
He stopped, put my hand
on his limp dick and said:

282
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:21,014
"See what happened when you said
it hurt? I'll never hurt you again."

283
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:24,560
Oh, Kimi!
- Are you together now?

284
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:29,606
I can't fuck him for the second time.
- I would if I were you.

285
00:36:54,673 --> 00:37:00,345
Looks like I'm alone in the hotel.
Want to stay there? - Food first.

286
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:08,270
We haven't talked about you.
What's new with you?

287
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:12,691
Nothing much. - Darling!

288
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:17,529
Timo! - Nothing much, huh?

289
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,624
He's left Marianne.
- For good.

290
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:33,378
We're moving in together
and trying for a baby.

291
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,715
So nothing new with you!

292
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:47,119
Couldn't you sleep?
- I was waiting for you to come home.

293
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:54,042
Technically, this isn't my home.

294
00:38:55,419 --> 00:39:00,132
I knew you'd forgotten the gate code.
- Why didn't you text me?

295
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:03,427
Okay, I was worried.

296
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:07,556
There was no sign of you,
and the bars closed hours ago.

297
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,559
Ismo, I'm an adult.

298
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,354
So it's okay to get blind drunk
and stir all kinds of talk.

299
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:18,233
What talk? - Well, talk.

300
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,364
You're working for me,
and if the press finds out...

301
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:30,954
My job is not public.
Anders has made that perfectly clear.

302
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,249
Right.

303
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:39,046
What's your problem?
- You really don't know?

304
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,673
No.

305
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,142
Jealousy is my problem.

306
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,314
I'm madly in love with you.

307
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,251
I miss upstairs.
- The view will wait for you.

308
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:25,425
I know you don't return my feelings.

309
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:32,266
That's because I've never
thought about you like that.

310
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:37,271
It would be
really unprofessional of me.

311
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:42,442
Of course,
you may be in love with me -

312
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:47,906
but I can't know that for sure,
and neither can you.

313
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:54,997
You may have Stockholm syndrome.
You're my hostage.

314
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,208
I make unreasonable demands
and cause you pain.

315
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:04,506
You're in my control.
- That may be so.

316
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:12,139
Why don't we finish this project
and take it from there?

317
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,225
If my feelings haven't changed then -

318
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:20,647
I'll ride to you on a white horse
and offer you half the kingdom.

319
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,488
<i>And who else can offer that?</i>

320
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,482
Stop pouting, Hanna.

321
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:11,406
I think you shouldn't go
roaming around Helsinki.

322
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,743
It could set you back by weeks.

323
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:21,083
When a man wakes up from weeks of
coma, I can't just send a postcard.

324
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,838
I feel responsible for all of this.

325
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,068
Good afternoon.

326
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,291
Hello! - The press has no business
in the patient's room.

327
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:06,420
He's not in the condition
to judge for himself.

328
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:11,258
So that's not negotiable.
- Not a problem.

329
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:14,178
Could you please wait downstairs?

330
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:18,390
Let's have a small
press conference later. Thank you.

331
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,069
Are you coming?
- I'll wait here.

332
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:00,557
Great!

333
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,978
Thank you.

334
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:41,265
I walked upstairs
without stopping once.

335
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:46,937
Wow. Pity I didn't get to see it.

336
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,984
I'm going back to work.

337
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,281
On Thursday.
- Finally someone talks sense.

338
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:01,994
We'll have the press conference
at the Government Palace.

339
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:07,040
Then they'll see me climb upstairs
to chair a Government session.

340
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:11,295
Sounds good, if we agree
on a couple of things.

341
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:14,131
You'll wear a support corset -

342
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:19,928
take enough painkillers,
and use crutches.

343
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:26,018
The corset is good. It tickles
the Marshal Mannerheim in me.

344
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,438
This is not a joke.
- I could enter on a horse.

345
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:36,445
On an ass. - The preparations.
Parliament, press, bulletin.

346
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:44,953
If you're going back to work,
my work here is done.

347
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:52,878
I'll tell Cortex to start
booking appointments for me.

348
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:09,061
Something needs to end
for something new to begin.

349
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:47,266
The view will wait for you.

350
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:04,741
Once we've taken your bags upstairs,
let's go eat somewhere.

351
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:37,691
Now you stop working for me.
- I guess so.

352
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:43,113
In that case...

353
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,329
No, stop! - I'm sorry.

354
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:57,252
Let me just say that...
I forbid you to lift anything heavy.

355
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:27,866
I'm a typical politician.
All promises and no action.

356
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:33,413
We talked about this.

357
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:40,003
Besides, this form of rehab
has only just started.

358
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:48,345
You mean there's
more sweaty business ahead?

359
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,222
Absolutely.

360
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:54,518
But before that...

361
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:59,523
Where's the food I was promised?

362
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:05,195
Well, technically the Government
didn't promise food, but stated -

363
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,034
that there's a possibility of food
if things progress as desired and...

364
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:30,262
Have some.

365
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,975
These are good.

366
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:09,551
<i>Hi, honey. - Goddammit, woman.
You're on a magazine cover!</i>

367
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:12,638
WHO'S THE PM'S SECRET LOVE?

368
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:17,226
It looks like Ismo picked up
a drunken prostitute -

369
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:21,063
and is trying to hold her up.

370
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:25,692
I'll be frank. I understand something
like this happening to Hanna.

371
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:31,073
She's not used to publicity,
but how did you fuck up like this?

372
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:38,330
I wanted to be a regular guy in love
for a moment. - A fool in love!

373
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:42,709
It's Paula. - Hanna...

374
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:47,589
This isn't so bad.
You look good in this picture.

375
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,634
Hi. - Hi.

376
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:56,640
What a circus downstairs!
A picket line of reporters.

377
00:50:56,723 --> 00:51:01,562
Your bodyguard is rattled.
- It's good they have something to do.

378
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:10,154
I'll get it.

379
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,624
You know what's going on.

380
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:26,211
I just wanted to tell you
everything's under control.

381
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:30,716
The party headquarters is making
a statement denying everything.

382
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,721
You can't even tell who
these people are in this picture.

383
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:40,434
<i>Anders, Elli from The Evening Paper
and Paula from PR agency Amatson.</i>

384
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:44,938
<i>The Evening Paper?
- We hired Paula as Hanna's publicist.</i>

385
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:49,568
<i>Tell headquarters everything is
under control. - The Evening Paper?</i>

386
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:53,238
The public needs
true information about the romance.

387
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:58,285
Otherwise, we'll get headlines like:
"Fit for a hit of love".

388
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:01,538
That's a good headline, Paula.

389
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:06,126
I suggest you give Elli
an exclusive interview and tell all.

390
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,298
What the hell is going on?
- Hanna, you'll wear this.

391
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:14,510
Shall I wear a suit? - Don't.

392
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:19,890
You're the only politician
who doesn't look silly in jeans.

393
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:22,059
I apologise for my colleagues.

394
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:26,480
Hanna got your arse into shape.
You need to show it to the people.

395
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:29,566
Thanks. - Ismo...

396
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:35,113
Let me just say that
these women are raving mad.

397
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:40,828
I don't see anything good
coming out of this.

398
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:44,081
LOVE HIT LIKE A LIGHTNING!

399
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:50,754
You have a lot to learn, son.
This kind of publicity is never bad.

400
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:55,592
"I'm sure they're a good match"

401
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,848
Timo...

402
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:08,814
PASSION IN THE POOL!

403
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:24,538
Pesonen, goddammit.
Why is this bottle in the picture?

404
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:28,792
The beer bottle was removed. - Good.

405
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:34,882
What are these?

406
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,471
Did you order these? - No.

407
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:52,733
<i>Hi, honey. - Timo left me.</i>

408
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,666
Too bad this isn't champagne.

409
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,712
You would've deserved it
after getting rid of that creep.

410
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:36,485
You must be Elli. You can guess
I've heard a lot about you.

411
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:39,613
Kimi hasn't brought
his woman to meet me -

412
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:46,161
so I had to check out
his girlfriend for myself.

413
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:49,832
I'm Jussi, Kimi's father.

414
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,960
Oh, hi.

415
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,464
Can we talk in private?
- I'm busy.

416
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:03,887
It's not every day you meet
your non-boyfriend's dead father.

417
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:11,436
I just tried to get
into your pants. - What?

418
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,025
I tried to get into your pants.
Pity is as good a way as any.

419
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:24,449
Just out of curiosity...
How did I die?

420
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:29,872
Kimi told her you were
hit by a lorry in an old Mazda.

421
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,833
I've never had a Mazda in my life.

422
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:37,462
Hey... Don't be mad at the boy.

423
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:42,676
He's a fool, but you should hear
how he talks about you.

424
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:47,389
Your girlfriend?
Me, your girlfriend?

425
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:50,726
I'm nobody's fucking girlfriend!

426
00:55:55,147 --> 00:56:00,819
Kimi's mum took off
when he was about a year old.

427
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:06,909
His raising was left to a guy
like me. - You did a really good job.

428
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,262
This is a beautiful room.

429
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:31,934
I was an easy catch
for the estate agent.

430
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:36,396
He let me stand here until he got
my signature and dragged me out.

431
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,565
I didn't even see the rest.

432
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:54,122
I see...
Rehabilitation continues.

433
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,753
Again, sorry we rushed here
unannounced.

434
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:05,717
We're going to our cottage tomorrow
and thought we'd come to see you.

435
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:09,012
You saw me all right.

436
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:13,517
I hope you weren't traumatised.
- I hope you weren't either.

437
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,772
I'm going to need therapy.
My development was disturbed.

438
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:25,529
Jenna has progressed wonderfully.

439
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,954
We're very grateful.
For everything.

440
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:39,626
We feared that Jenna
would never walk again.

441
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,296
My parents were upset.

442
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:46,300
They accept that there won't be
any more grandchildren -

443
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:50,012
but losing Jenna...

444
00:57:55,225 --> 00:58:00,522
My ex and I got tested
when she didn't get pregnant.

445
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:05,611
My sperm count is low,
and even the few are lazy swimmers.

446
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:09,823
And the accident
didn't improve things.

447
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,578
It didn't affect
your little swimmers.

448
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:20,417
We've figured out ways
to keep them moving.

449
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:24,296
Many commendably good ways.

450
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:29,676
Did you think
that if you told me -

451
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:36,642
I'd take off to find a virile man
to impregnate me?

452
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:39,478
Something like that.

453
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,650
Maybe I'll finish this wine first.
- And after that?

454
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,406
We can always adopt.

455
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:14,179
Stop fucking
and bring out the glasses!

456
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:17,975
I thought you had security here.
- So did I.

457
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:21,228
Paula is knocked up. - Yeah!

458
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:24,481
I can't believe it!

459
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:30,696
Congratulations.

460
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,116
I'm having a baby!

461
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:39,997
I mean, we're having a baby!

462
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:51,383
I thought that was nice.
- You can't be serious. Are you nuts?

463
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,844
Your mum is nuts.

464
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,024
Hi. - Hi.

465
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:10,486
What's this
emergency meeting about?

466
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:16,116
If you don't know that, the PM
needs a more suitable girlfriend.

467
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,912
I'll ask Ismo who's next in line.

468
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:23,332
The Independence Day ball
is two months away.

469
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:27,336
Exactly, we're late.
We haven't even chosen the designer.

470
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:32,090
I thought I'd just
buy a dress off the rack.

471
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,760
From a bridal store.

472
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:39,681
Or, the dress I wore
at my school ball may still fit.

473
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:44,061
A national costume? - Don't talk dirty
in front of my baby.

474
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:48,023
Be serious.
What kind of dress do you want?

475
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:51,360
Something with pockets.

476
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,542
I'll get it!

477
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:55,549
Hi.

478
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:04,224
You're early. We're trying to
hide her hump and cover her scars.

479
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:07,561
Hi! - Hi.

480
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:10,939
I need to have a word with her.

481
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:17,779
Okay. We can take a little break.

482
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:22,117
And maybe go to that café nearby.

483
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:26,371
And maybe go to that café nearby.

484
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,418
Paula...

485
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:38,258
Hi. Why did you come so early?

486
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:43,889
Well, I thought that... Oh Jesus.

487
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:53,732
Sorry, I'm messing you up.
- That can be fixed.

488
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:17,047
Come on!
- I want to hear this!

489
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:23,178
We're going for coffee now!

490
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,537
Aren't you supposed to
ask me something?

491
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,039
Does it fit?

492
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:08,056
I'm so nervous about the ball
I'm going to wee my pants.

493
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:12,352
And now I have
half a kingdom on my finger.

494
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:19,359
Not everyone needs to
know about it yet. - Thank you.

495
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,008
Turn up the volume.

496
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:51,308
<i>There they are! - Now one of
the most anticipated couples -</i>

497
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:55,729
<i>Prime Minister Ismo Majuri
and his lady friend Hanna Palo.</i>

498
01:04:55,813 --> 01:05:00,400
<i>Our fashion expert gives
a nod of approval to her dress.</i>

499
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:07,157
<i>Absolutely gorgeous. If someone else
becomes the belle of the ball -</i>

500
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:11,829
<i>her dress really has to be
something special.</i>

501
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:24,091
Happy interference day.
- Happy Independence Day.

502
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:30,097
What did she say? - Did she say
"happy interference day"?

503
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:47,072
I knew you'd be here.
- Where else would I be?

504
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:54,329
Marianne and I separated.
- Oh. Again?

505
01:05:54,997 --> 01:06:00,127
No... This time it's final.

506
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:07,509
Marianne moved in with
her personal trainer.

507
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,512
Kicked me out. - Who?

508
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:15,350
What? - Who kicked you out?
Marianne or the personal trainer?

509
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:23,692
<i>You said "happy interference day"
to the President. - Forget that!</i>

510
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:27,654
Okay, honey. Let's talk about
how you're always on camera.

511
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:30,782
They probably have one
following just you.

512
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:33,619
Hopefully not right now.

513
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:39,500
Hey, buddy! A pint of lager,
a double whisky, and...

514
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:42,961
...a glass of red wine for the lady.

515
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:48,425
Jussi, this is Timo,
my ex-colleague.

516
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:53,472
Timo, this is Jussi, my...

517
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:57,476
The father of your future child.

518
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:04,316
If you were here, you'd get
a big scoop for tomorrow. - No!

519
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:09,404
But don't publish it, okay?
- I won't, I won't.

520
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:12,115
Paula!

521
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:16,245
They're engaged! - Wonderful!

522
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:19,873
Who are engaged?
- None of your business.

523
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:23,460
Honey, don't...
- You have no honey here.

524
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:27,589
Not even sugar or syrup.

525
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:33,846
Here's the thing. There's
absolutely nothing for you here.

526
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:39,476
<i>It's time to move on
to the dance floor.</i>

527
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:45,691
<i>People's eyes will surely be
on the Prime Minister and Hanna Palo.</i>

528
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:55,075
I want to introduce you to someone
who's returned to work.

529
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:11,425
Markus... Hanna Palo.
Markus Rinne, my bodyguard.

530
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:15,429
Good evening. - Evening.

531
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,809
Nice to meet you.
- Happy "interference day".

532
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:34,740
I have a headache.
My head's about to explode.

533
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:39,077
Markus? Send for the car.
Hanna is ill, we're going home.

534
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:41,997
You don't have to leave.

535
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,001
Are you sure? - Of course.

536
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:49,922
Alright. Markus will drive you.
- I'll take a taxi.

537
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:54,843
You're not taking a taxi in that
condition. Markus will drive you.

538
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,692
Wait.

539
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:16,240
I need to tell you this.

540
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,589
I was unconscious for a long time
after the accident.

541
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:21,930
My brain was swollen,
and they kept me in a coma.

542
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:29,396
Then one day, my friend
visited me in the hospital -

543
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,191
and brought me the paper.

544
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:37,863
You were on the cover.
With Ismo.

545
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:47,247
Fate played a cruel trick on us.

546
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:37,381
Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister.
How about a little interview?

547
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:43,595
We heard from a reliable source
that you've got engaged.

548
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:28,474
You shouldn't have told me
about the letter.

549
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:33,145
I know. It was selfish and stupid.

550
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:38,192
Had I not known, I could've
left you alone. - Could you?

551
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:27,282
No sandwiches this time.

552
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:31,161
No. Not this time.

553
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:38,627
I'm not hungry anyway.

554
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:52,224
I figured you probably
need some time to think.

555
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:55,394
About Ismo and everything.

556
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:27,050
Hanna, last night was...

557
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:30,262
Yeah... - I've never...

558
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,723
I have a lot to think about.

559
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:44,776
Maybe it's best that...
Because I have a lot to think about.

560
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:52,284
Bye then.

561
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:57,623
Hey, everything's going to be fine...

562
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,311
Oops.

563
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:28,612
Are you ready to get dressed?
We need to go soon.

564
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:32,574
Where? - To Ismo, of course.

565
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:38,372
Let me just say
that he's frantic -

566
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:42,918
because someone hasn't
answered her phone all morning.

567
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:47,714
We need to work out this situation.

568
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,677
What situation?

569
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,890
ENGAGED!

570
01:15:56,974 --> 01:16:02,980
Oh, your paper's little bird just
happened to ask if we're engaged -

571
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:06,692
since the tip came
from a reliable source?

572
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,486
Where else?

573
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:14,825
I thought I could trust you.
We would've given you an interview!

574
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:18,328
Put Paula on, now!

575
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:26,295
Of course it was Elli!
She couldn't help dropping a hint.

576
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:30,549
Why are you defending her?
You're defending her!

577
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:37,181
Have fun in your little club,
you two! Bye!

578
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:40,184
There's a lesson for you.

579
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:44,813
You should be more careful of
what you tell people.

580
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:48,150
You're a little too naive.

581
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:55,908
What should we do?

582
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:05,375
You could start by...
congratulating us.

583
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:08,712
Yes. Congratulations.

584
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:22,059
What's this?
- You're the Prime Minister's fiancée.

585
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:25,354
You have an official status
and a bodyguard. Me.

586
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:30,442
No, I don't. Shut up.
- The Prime Minister asked me himself.

587
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:36,073
He thought this would be an easy gig
after my sick leave.

588
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:43,038
What happened to the gentleman
who wanted to give me time to think?

589
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,918
He left you in the morning
only to read from a headline -

590
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:51,588
that he had just banged
the Prime Minister's fiancée.

591
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:55,133
The gentleman quit.
- I forgot all about it.

592
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:57,845
Your own engagement?
- I saw you and...

593
01:17:57,928 --> 01:18:03,809
You forgot you'd announced your
engagement? - It wasn't like that.

594
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,938
I'll get a ticket soon.
Would you please get in?

595
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:12,776
I'm not getting in that car.
- Come on!

596
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,948
Soft seats and tinted windows.
We can pick up where we left off.

597
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:22,953
The ring didn't stop you then.
Or does it work best on your finger?

598
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:28,417
Magically. It can tell the difference
between gentlemen and arseholes!

599
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:33,672
Your own car and driver.

600
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:39,511
Dating the country's number one man
has its advantages.

601
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,972
It sure has.

602
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:56,403
I've got myself into a total mess.
What am I going to do?

603
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,739
We know. - But can't help.

604
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:04,745
Because you won't talk to us.
- Markus doesn't look half bad.

605
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:08,790
Be quiet!
- Did you say something?

606
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,836
I said be quiet.

607
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:18,467
This is a good song.

608
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,519
<i>The time is right...</i>

609
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:35,692
When I read about
your firm's history, it struck me -

610
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:40,239
how in many ways,
its old operations models -

611
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:44,409
would still be perfectly
applicable today.

612
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:52,042
Maybe this is the secret
of your longevity and success.

613
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:58,674
You haven't followed others,
but led the way.

614
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:02,052
Even internationally.

615
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:06,431
I wish I could see more of
the same confidence in this country.

616
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:25,367
Cool party.
- Right up your alley.

617
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,205
Markus isn't half bad,
by the way.

618
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:47,973
Are you okay?
- Of course.

619
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:51,727
Are you sure?
You looked a little pale in there.

620
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:56,064
I'm feeling a little weird.

621
01:20:56,148 --> 01:21:00,819
Must be the shrimp pizza
I ate earlier today.

622
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:10,954
Are you already tired of being
the Prime Minister's other half?

623
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:17,836
I might be, if I were only that.

624
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,674
Last time I checked,
I still had a job.

625
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:27,679
You must be good at what you do.

626
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:31,725
You should hear how Ismo praises you
when you're not around.

627
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:36,313
He says he'd still be
in a wheelchair without you.

628
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,399
I doubt it.

629
01:21:39,483 --> 01:21:45,572
My physiotherapist was a guy.
Two metres tall and 130 kilos.

630
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:49,493
If I didn't walk across the room,
he'd throw me over there.

631
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:52,287
He did a good job.

632
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:59,503
You look fine. I don't think
there are even any scars.

633
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:05,592
Yes, there are.

634
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:09,513
Where?

635
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:20,983
How did I not notice this
the other night?

636
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:24,695
We were a little occupied.

637
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:36,498
What's the matter?
Did the cat tip over your vase?

638
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:43,005
Are you really so childish
that you believed the cat tale?

639
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:08,822
Can you book me a gynaecologist?
Soon. - Is everything okay?

640
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:14,536
Yeah. I just... My ovulation
has been a little painful.

641
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:19,124
Cortex clinic, how may I help you?
Good morning.

642
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:26,632
Leena could see you at one.
He's available from three onward.

643
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:32,387
When's the next appointment for
Tarja Virtanen? - Painful ovulation?

644
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:36,683
Are you going to push your ovaries
out? She's our best obstetrician.

645
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:41,313
Just find the appointment, please.
- Next Thursday at two.

646
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:45,150
Do you want this? - Yes.

647
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:58,997
We need to talk. About us.
- So there's a "we" again?

648
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:05,170
How about we get in the back seat?
Or we could go to your place.

649
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:09,800
Wild sex whenever it's convenient
and you take off the ring.

650
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:14,429
Breathe! I'd hate to have to give you
mouth-to-mouth in the street.

651
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:17,599
In the street is fine, too.

652
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:22,896
Enough! You were the one
who took off.

653
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:28,443
I looked all over for you.
You just didn't realise what we had.

654
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:31,780
I didn't realise?

655
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:36,952
Why couldn't you wake me up
and tell me you loved me?

656
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:41,999
Don't feed me any more of that...

657
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:46,920
...cat-vase-
worldwide-search-of-Markus crap.

658
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:52,551
When I started to get mushy,
you found your casual sex elsewhere.

659
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:06,732
RECOGNISE THIS MAN?
- Supersharp pictures, great price!

660
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:10,861
I have to tell you something.

661
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:21,121
I know this will break your heart
and mine too.

662
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:26,210
But I... Goddammit!

663
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:34,343
I'm pregnant,
and the baby is not yours.

664
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:51,109
Here stands
the happiest man in the world.

665
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:53,237
I ran into your boss.

666
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:59,117
She congratulated me.
She didn't realise I didn't know yet.

667
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:03,330
All those swimming lessons
didn't go to waste.

668
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:08,669
When do you think it was conceived?
- Around Independence Day.

669
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:10,754
Oh, then.

670
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:16,969
Put the flowers in a vase, Mummy,
and Daddy will have a whisky.

671
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:26,770
Bring me one too, Daddy.

672
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:37,322
Hi. How was the performance?

673
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:42,411
I'll walk. - Hanna...

674
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:45,956
I'll walk!

675
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:56,842
Hi. Want a ride?
- No, thanks.

676
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:01,513
Are you too good for a ride, whore?

677
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:08,187
What are you doing, whore?
Put the phone away!

678
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:14,568
I'd like to report a stalker in
a car. His registration number is...

679
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:23,118
You neglected your duties
by letting Hanna wander off alone.

680
01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:28,123
Ismo, I simply refused a ride.
I needed some fresh air.

681
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:33,921
You have to promise
it won't happen again.

682
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:39,218
You're responsible for
an extremely important package.

683
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:47,142
Hanna and I are having a baby.

684
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:54,733
Congratulations. To both of you.

685
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:02,658
You must be
very careful from now on.

686
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,919
Markus!

687
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:18,298
Don't say a word.
What could you possibly say?

688
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:24,179
Tell him. - You have to tell him.

689
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:28,100
It's yours! - The baby is yours!

690
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:55,210
I don't really see the point of
this interview. - Are you kidding?

691
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:58,797
You're too modest.

692
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:05,762
The police are so impressed
that you helped catch that stalker.

693
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:11,560
Attila the Hen is excited
about the story. - Yes, I am.

694
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:13,562
Hello.

695
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:18,901
You were famous here even before
you started dating the PM.

696
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,862
Yes, through Elli.

697
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:26,700
Where is she, by the way?

698
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:30,537
Or did she escape
when she found out I was here?

699
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:36,335
I know you've fallen out of love,
but don't you know anything?

700
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:39,922
Elli is on a leave of absence.

701
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:43,258
To be honest, I...

702
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:49,723
I haven't forgiven her for
leaking the engagement news.

703
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:55,979
To you.
- I received a text from... her.

704
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:00,776
And I got a call
from Timo Aalio. - Timo?

705
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:04,571
An old friend
from my advertising days.

706
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:09,868
Your own talk show!
How could I have missed that?

707
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:13,330
The ads start running next week.
- It's been great.

708
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:18,001
The only annoying thing is
I can't swear on prime time.

709
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:22,840
Are you sure you've forgiven me
for blaming you? - Almost.

710
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:25,759
What would it take to forgive me?

711
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:31,598
You and Ismo coming as guests
for my first live show.

712
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:35,602
I don't know...
- Elli has a good reason.

713
01:30:35,686 --> 01:30:39,189
You just have to.

714
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:44,903
Okay! It's okay by me,
but Ismo may have an opinion, too.

715
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:49,700
Give us an Ismo update.
- No, a Hanna update.

716
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:54,454
I'm pregnant.
- What the hell?

717
01:30:54,538 --> 01:30:58,208
What's the matter with you two,
breeding like rabbits?

718
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:03,589
Elli, you cannot bring this up
at the interview. Promise?

719
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:07,551
I promise. Of course I won't.
Maybe you believe me this time.

720
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,064
Oh dear.

721
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:27,988
Don't worry, Daddy will be with you.
We should go already.

722
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:32,367
We're not talking about this
on the show. Promise me!

723
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:38,957
Yeah, yeah. If you promise to wear
something a bit more feminine.

724
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:44,880
Camera two, now! Three, now!

725
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:48,926
We're almost out of time -

726
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:53,972
but I won't get home alive
if I don't ask you the big question.

727
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:57,476
When's the wedding?

728
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:05,359
Let's just say you won't find
an invitation in the post tomorrow.

729
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:11,782
Do you want a big wedding?
- We haven't really talked about it.

730
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:15,160
I don't want to make
my dreams public, but...

731
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:20,791
If you want to know, I don't care
about the size of our wedding.

732
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:25,337
As long as I make an honest woman
out of her as soon as possible.

733
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:31,677
Are you going to live
both in Lahti and Helsinki?

734
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,347
They're having a baby!
Ask if they're having a baby!

735
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:39,226
Yeah, I think so.

736
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:43,397
If we're going to be married,
I'm sure we'll move in together.

737
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,902
The two of us and my cat, Sisu.
- We need to redecorate anyway...

738
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:51,113
Oh, you have a cat? - Yeah.

739
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:57,077
I've always been a cat woman...
cat lover. - Let the PM talk!

740
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:02,791
I know I promised you,
but this atmosphere is so warm.

741
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:06,879
My heart is full of love...
- You said your cat's name was Sisu?

742
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:11,925
I have to tell you that Hanna and I
are having a baby.

743
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:29,943
Ten years ago, my ex-wife and I
were trying for a baby.

744
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:34,364
We found out that my sperm
is not exactly first-rate.

745
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:40,204
The doctors said I should stop
dreaming about biological children.

746
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:46,752
That it would be a miracle,
but here's that little miracle now.

747
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,672
Hanna didn't want to
make this public yet -

748
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:55,260
but a safe amount of time has passed
since our engagement day.

749
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:59,723
It may not be yours. - What?

750
01:34:03,602 --> 01:34:05,562
What did she say?

751
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:14,404
What's going on?

752
01:34:16,824 --> 01:34:19,743
Is it mine? - Markus!

753
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:24,248
Hanna, his name is Markus.
Is he your Markus?

754
01:34:25,874 --> 01:34:31,421
Is it mine or not? - Let it roll!
Don't go there! This is great.

755
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:34,299
Why didn't you tell me
you found him?

756
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:37,553
I'd never have let you
make a fucking fool of yourself!

757
01:34:37,636 --> 01:34:42,432
Don't swear, this is prime time!
- Tell me the truth. Is it mine?

758
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:44,893
Hanna, is it his?

759
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:47,688
Camera one, now!

760
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:56,738
Yes.

761
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:00,868
It's probably his.

762
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:14,965
HANNA CHEATED ON ISMO!

763
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,927
Fuck.

764
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:26,226
Was it planned?
- How did this happen?

765
01:35:30,564 --> 01:35:34,776
Elli, this is my job!
- Pesonen, this is my friend.

766
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,280
Where's Markus?
- Aren't you ashamed?

767
01:36:08,018 --> 01:36:10,354
Whore.

768
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:15,484
Leave it be. - No, I won't.

769
01:36:22,825 --> 01:36:25,577
This must be yours.

770
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,131
These letters are useless.
Can we play in Polish?

771
01:36:56,692 --> 01:37:02,030
If you can form a word from these,
you may come in.

772
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:05,242
"Vhyckru". - That'll do.

773
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:13,667
Evening. - Do you want something?
Tea? Whisky?

774
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:17,838
One pregnant bloody idiot?

775
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:24,720
I talked to Ismo. Looks like the baby
is 90-percent certainly mine.

776
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:27,014
That's right.

777
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:32,394
I want a DNA test
as soon as it's born.

778
01:37:32,478 --> 01:37:37,441
If it's mine, I absolutely want
to be a part of its life.

779
01:37:40,944 --> 01:37:44,406
I want joint custody!
- It's my child.

780
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:47,367
You can see it sometimes, but...

781
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:51,622
You would've given my child
to another man!

782
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:56,585
If I had a choice, do you think
I'd ever want to see you again?

783
01:37:56,668 --> 01:38:00,964
I tried to tell you! - You tried!
You're a bloody good trier!

784
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:04,468
You're a bloody bad listener!

785
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:10,307
I think my water just broke.

786
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:15,687
You've been drinking.
- You don't have a licence.

787
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:37,417
How's Paula?
- She's working hard in there.

788
01:38:38,919 --> 01:38:43,924
Can you let me know
if everything went well?

789
01:38:57,146 --> 01:39:00,190
I want to know one thing.

790
01:39:00,274 --> 01:39:04,695
Did you just use me as a sperm donor?
- Is that what you think?

791
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:10,325
Ismo can't have children,
and I was conveniently there.

792
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:17,916
Yeah, I threw you my keys
so you could come wank into a mug.

793
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:33,182
I want to be present at the delivery.
- Paula doesn't want you there!

794
01:39:33,265 --> 01:39:38,145
At our baby's delivery!
- Absolutely not.

795
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:43,066
Besides, Elli is already coming.
You're coming to my delivery.

796
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:48,405
No fucking way...
would I ever miss it.

797
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:29,947
"I've lost a whole family"

798
01:40:31,865 --> 01:40:36,411
Ismo Majuri opens up:
"A loved one's betrayal hurts!"

799
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:44,837
Surge of sympathy in Gallup polls

800
01:41:01,854 --> 01:41:04,857
You're doing great, Hanna!
Don't give up!

801
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:08,277
What do people
usually yell in here?

802
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,281
Nothing usually, but sometimes
mothers yell "goddammit".

803
01:41:12,364 --> 01:41:15,117
There! - Shut up, goddammit!

804
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,871
This one's tough for you both,
but go for it.

805
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:22,207
It's coming!
- I can see the head.

806
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:28,005
You won't believe what's going on!
You'll never recover from this!

807
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:33,594
Enough. Well done. There...

808
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:47,274
Wave at your godmother.

809
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:59,203
Tell me if he needs to be
strangled or something.

810
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:19,765
Perfect.

811
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:26,772
Red and wrinkly.
She looks a hundred years old.

812
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:30,400
Perfect.

813
01:42:34,029 --> 01:42:38,742
Why don't we take the sample now
and get it over with?

814
01:42:40,994 --> 01:42:47,042
This won't hurt at all.
Help me a little.

815
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:52,756
There, good. That was it.

816
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:59,888
Try to have some rest.

817
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:17,698
Let's wait for the results
before agreeing on the joint custody.

818
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,553
I hear we need another sample.

819
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:45,225
Let me just say... that she's right.

820
01:43:45,809 --> 01:43:51,023
The party wants to be
absolutely sure. - The party?

821
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:53,484
I mean Ismo.

822
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:56,028
Thank you.

823
01:44:07,456 --> 01:44:10,167
You open it.

824
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,834
Thank you.

825
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:47,139
Okay. First, take this stuff
and put it in.

826
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:52,269
And put that one on properly.

827
01:45:52,352 --> 01:45:55,981
Here are all the sheets and stuff -

828
01:45:56,064 --> 01:46:01,612
and she'll need this
when she goes to bed...

829
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:06,617
Bye, darling.

830
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:09,077
Bye bye...
Hey, where's her bottle?

831
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:20,858
Thanks for coming.

832
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:26,613
The fever has gone down, but she
would've run wild at your place.

833
01:47:26,697 --> 01:47:29,491
This is fine.

834
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:36,874
Mummy, where are you going?
- Out with your godmothers.

835
01:47:45,174 --> 01:47:48,260
Is your boyfriend coming too?

836
01:47:49,845 --> 01:47:54,099
Risto and I are no longer together.

837
01:48:02,107 --> 01:48:04,526
Okay, bye.

838
01:48:09,656 --> 01:48:13,744
Hi! What weather!
You look gorgeous.

839
01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:22,461
I'll bring you more soon. - Stay away.
We're having a girls' night.

840
01:48:30,761 --> 01:48:33,931
<i>Here he comes.
- Opposition leader Ismo Majuri.</i>

841
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:37,309
Did they come together?
Oh my God!

842
01:48:37,392 --> 01:48:41,438
<i>The rumours are true.
The ex-PM's date -</i>

843
01:48:41,522 --> 01:48:45,984
<i>is the main owner of Cortex clinic,
Annika Lund.</i>

844
01:48:46,944 --> 01:48:49,947
What did she say?

845
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:55,661
Did she say "happy interference day"?
- Oh, she did, too?

846
01:49:07,214 --> 01:49:11,593
We shouldn't have left the local.
- Or home.

847
01:49:13,846 --> 01:49:17,057
Have we become old? - No!

848
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:29,486
Happy Independence Day.

849
01:49:30,821 --> 01:49:33,907
You've practised that.

850
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:44,543
Hanna!

851
01:49:46,962 --> 01:49:48,922
Go ahead.

852
01:49:55,429 --> 01:49:59,183
If I asked you to visit me in Lahti,
would you come?

853
01:49:59,266 --> 01:50:01,435
To look at the view.

854
01:50:11,987 --> 01:50:15,991
Did you ever love me?
- Yes, I did.

855
01:50:21,246 --> 01:50:23,123
But not enough.

856
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:43,852
You have some nerve.

857
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:48,524
Do you think you're forgiven?

858
01:50:51,693 --> 01:50:56,198
Silly you.
You've messed up a couple of lives.

859
01:50:57,991 --> 01:51:03,372
Can you turn back time? Can you?

860
01:51:05,332 --> 01:51:11,255
If you can, do it.
You little rascal.

861
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:46,457
<i>Hi. - Hi.</i>

862
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,127
It's Hanna. - Yeah.

863
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:55,966
<i>I got your letter. - What?</i>

864
01:51:57,384 --> 01:52:02,931
<i>The one you left between the vase
and the salmon sandwiches.</i>

865
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:09,021
<i>Oh, that. - You know what?</i>

866
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:14,735
I'd love to go
to the cinema tonight.

867
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:19,448
Or move to the country
and have ten children.

868
01:53:33,438 --> 01:53:38,569
LET'S KEEP FINLAND AFLOAT!
Ismo Majuri for President

869
01:54:56,980 --> 01:55:01,193
Peace for the Middle East
