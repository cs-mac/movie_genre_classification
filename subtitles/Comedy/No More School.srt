00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,190
I know that it's shameless but please accept me.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,210
Are you crazy?

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,470
Do you not know where this is? Get out.

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,470

20

Go back.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,030
I don't here alone and

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,330
even with just being responsible for Seul Bi is plentifully difficult.

23
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,990
Don't even you be like this.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,790
You heard right. You were just thrown away again.

Why did you not tell me?

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,180
If there was an issue you should have told me first...

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,450
I'm your father.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,140
Since you're my dad I couldn't tell you.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,050

It will get colder very soon.

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,100
I wonder if he brought some thicker clothes.

48
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,880
I have to discuss it with Sung Yeol's dad

49
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,920
and while you're here don't make any issues with Sung Yeol.

Woo Hyun, you should go back tomorrow.

Because of me, I don't like that it's become more difficult for you.

Aiyoo, you're too much. I came here to protect you.

53
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,880
I know but

54
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,570
are you outside because it feels strange to be here? I'll come outside too.

55
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,310
Stop. Don't come out. I don't want to get pegged (as not doing the right thing) from the first day.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,740
I can't let you catch cold by yourself.

Oh, my Seul Bi is completely full of loyalty...

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,900
I am a bit. <br>...is what you thought I would say, right?

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,330
If you're sick I have to do all the store work by myself. Plus, I have to go to school by myself.

60
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,060
You can't. Don't ever get sick. Even if someone gets sick it'll be me.

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,650
Then hurry up and get inside.

62
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,290
Sung Yeol hasn't come home yet.

63
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,560
He left with Ahjussi, so don't worry.

I'll look for a solution.

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,980
Will you throw your own son back out on the street?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,710
Or will you let just the two of them live alone again?

74

What do you want me to do?

75
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,420
How can the fellow who entrusted his son to you know that?

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,770
But

77
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,880
when you throw your own son out like that I'm afraid how bad Sung Yeol must have it.

Oops, my mistake.

127
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,330
It is better to have Sung Yeol as a family than a stranger.

128
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,190
You guys knew each other well.

129
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,630
You can't share family members.

130
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,140
You said family is always on your side.

131
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,000
You said you don't share them, <br>but you can be together with them.

132

Yes, I told you that wise saying to you, <br> who has a good memory.

I was so hungry while waiting for you.

134
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,980
I guess the cure worked.

135
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,700
You easily got drunk by drinking water <br>with a same cup that was for alcohol.

136
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,070
I guess you take after your mother.

137
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,740
I don't want to take after anyone; including you and mom.

138
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,360
Right. Don't be like me.

139
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm trying.

140
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,830
Woo Hyun must have his reasons.

He's not my friend.

Give me my wage; 31500 won (approx. $31.5).

148
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,740
My wage is 5210 won, but why do you always exclude 210 won?

149
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't come again from now on.

150
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,470

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,530
<i> democratic, capitalism, nationalism...</i>

164
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:19,530
<i> Please do it with the perspective of society today.</i>

165
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,480
<i> Second, apart from today's social ideas,</i>

166
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,790
No cell phones during class. You didn't know that?

167
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,740
You can have it. I will just buy a new one.

168
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,040
Is that so? I will take it anyways.

169
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,860
You should open a store for cell phones now.

170
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,890
Hand in the career paper next time. That's it.

171
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,670
Teacher!

172
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,990
You live with Sung Yeol.

173
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,230
Doesn't Sul Bi live with Sung Yeol, too?

174
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,040
Isn't that right?

175
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,130
How about you study hard with that curiosity?

176
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,020
What is Sung Yeol to you?

177
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,510
He's my son.

178
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,110
Daebak!

179
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,100
Son?

180
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,320
Come.

181
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,000
Lee Sul Bi. You're blessed.

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,570
What did you do?

183
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,000
Living with boys - is that your specialty?

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,120
Sleeping together is same as living together. <br> It is not like what you guys think, though.

185
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,240
There is a reason for that.

186
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,370
A dog that was chasing a chicken is now fixing a barn. <br> (It is a saying in Korean, and it is actually "a dog that was chasing a chicken is now looking up at roof".)

187
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,960
So idiotic.

188
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,760
Shut your mouth before I beat you up.

189
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,710
I was only telling the truth...

190
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,080
I didn't allow you to talk with me.

191
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,820
I know your sad because of Sung Yeol. <br> Then why are you mad at me? You should be mad at Sul Bi.

192
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,430
Isn't all you have to do is get along with Sung Yeol?

193
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:35,390
What do you do now? You tried everything to get Woo Hyun. <br> But look at you now.

194
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,850
Is she your real mother? Or a new one?

195
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,640
Oh sorry. I think I hurt your feelings.

196
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,370
Good job.

197
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,580
Good job? <br> - You should go around babbling like that i the future too.

198
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,520
It is hard for me to talk about them.

199
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,940
Take this back, and don't you dare care about me.

200
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,640
You should go on an audition if you want to become a singer.

201
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,720
Why are you doing that in karaoke?

202
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,300
You know I don't keep secrets.

203
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,730
You are threatening now?

204
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,880
You use money or threaten...

205
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,230
Ah, you don't have friends.

206
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,270
I had a hard time until now. Because of her.

207
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,690
If you were threatened. <br>You must have done something to get threatened.

208
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,310
That fits you better than being a singer.

209
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,030
Don't you feel glad to see this?

210
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,150
Why do you always hide your feelings?

211
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,140
Young Eun was looking for you because she was worried about you

212
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,390
And you also pushed me down the stairs because you wanted to be closer to Young Eun again

213
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,150
That's not it. You wouldn't know.

214
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,720
Your eyes are sweating

215
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,830
Human tears are warm too

216
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,850
Mom she keeps making fun of me!

217
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,220
What was with those ahjusshis?

218
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,130
Those men? They were a CEO and manager of an agency.

219
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,710
All my effort was ruined because of you.

220
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,220
Is that the only agency? Do you want me to open an agency for you?

221
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,170
Am I funny to you? Is my dream amusing?

222
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,320
I know too that I don't have any talent

223
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,270
But if I don't things like that, do you think I would ever be able to stand on a stage?

224
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,610
With no money or connections,

225
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,190
Is it not ok to have a dream?

226
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,270
You without a dream is more pathetic than me.

227
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,730
Be careful with that side of your shoulders. Don't use it too much and if it gets worse, go take an X-ray

228
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you.

229
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,700
Oh! Is Sung Yeol's mom really the ethics teacher?

230
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,570
It was all the school was talking about

231
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,910
I should've known... Whenever it came to Sung Yeol, she reacted totally differently.

232
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:05,440
Wait, then isn't the ethics teacher Sung Yeol's step-mom then?

233
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
Everything's suddenly going so badly for Sung Yeol...

234
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Why? Because she's not the birth mother?<br>- Yes.

235
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,320
My mom said that only one new thing that's bad is a new mom (step-mom)

236
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,530
It's a joke. Apparently now step-mom's are better

237
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,120
What's the difference between a birth mother and a stepmother?

238
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:34,530
I guess, well, closer or less close... why are you taking this so seriously...?

239
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,700
What's up with him?

240
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,220
2,100 won, please.

241
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,600
Is there anything else you need?

242
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,620
Give me 31500 won (about $30)

243
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,690
This is recording well right?

244
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,220
Even if it's a student, if they lose hard earned money,

245
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,710
do you think they would feel good?

246
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,030
Should I officially report you to the labor department?

247
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,950
Who?

248
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,050
Who are you?

249
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,870
210 won (about $0.19) per hour for five hours a day

250
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,770
31500 won (about $30) for one month

251
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,700
Are you going to admit it or not?

252
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,740
I'll give this to Joo Ah

253
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,650
Next time when you pay your part-timers,

254
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,470
Start with "Good job" or "Thank you"

255
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,860
To our kids.

256
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,570
Yes.

257
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,300
It looks like humans are often born to hurt each other

258
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,150
Scar?

259
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,740
The sweat that comes out of eyes is warm because the human is warm right?

260
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,710
Sweat that comes from eyes are normally warm.

261
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,170
If your tears were cold too, it'd be more sad wouldn't it?

262
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,780
There's nothing you don't know.

263
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,750
This isn't a commercial

264
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,900
I'll go help at the store a little before I go. Could you keep it a secret from teacher though?

265
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,890
You're lying now.

266
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,000
If Teacher told you not to come to the shop, I'm okay. Go.

267
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,310
Still, it'll be hard by yourself.

268
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,310
I have Ki Soo and Chun Sik so don't worry.

269
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,230
Bring her home carefully

270
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,720
Go.

271
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm a thing that hurts you

272
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,670
I'll stop by at the bookstore before I go. I had something to buy but I completely forgot.

273
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,830
We can go together.

274
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,640
No, I can go by myself. I'll be right back.

275
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,670
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Let's Love Team@Viki</i>

276
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,300
800 won.

277
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,000
You even took out a loan to save Woo Hyun's store?

278
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,910
The loan and the interest I'll work it well and repay it.

279
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,780
That's not what I'm talking about right now. You should have at least discussed it with me.

280
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,420
What am I to you? Why do you keep disappointing me this way?

281
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,820
I couldn't look the other way and I couldn't discuss it with you.

282
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,180
How could I be so shameless as to even ask?

283
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,360
How can I know what else you're hiding from me?

284
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,580
Honey, honey, I'm sorry. I'm not hiding anything else form you, really.

285
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,350
Those words right now are the most unbelievable.

286
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,460
You even helped them with the Ddeokbokki shop?

287
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,050
You wanted to help them too.

288
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,760
Is then and now the same?

289
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,540
That's the money that Dad worked all night and earned with difficulty.

290
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,250
That wasn't your father's money.

291
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,640
It's the money I saved so difficultly while living apart from my son

292
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,000
thinking to get a small house.

293
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,230
In the end you were thinking of throwing me and my father away and living with your son.

294
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,660
While thinking that why did you reveal to the kids that I was your son?

295
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,900
Since you are my son too.

296
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,800
Then I'd better reveal that Woo Hyun is your biological son too.

297
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,540
Fine. Reveal it as quickly as you can

298
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,100
so that at least at school I can look at him comfortably.

299
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,780
You knew, right? About Sung Yeol and the ethics teacher.

300
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,900
That you didn't tell me that kind of big news? Were we only of that kind of relationship?

301
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,920
Has the affection cooled?

302
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,950
Hey, the ddeokbokki will cool. Hurry up and go.

303
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,820
But anyway, Seul Bi and Sung Yeol in one house.

304
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,450
Would it be all right?

305
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,930
If a man and woman keep looking at each others' faces they say that even ugly things appear pretty.

306
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,390
Hey, then to you I must forever look pretty since I see you everyday.

307
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,680
Hey, that's not true!

308
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,690
Not true my butt. <br> What's he talking about?

309
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,220
Go well and come back safely.

310
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,760
How did you come?

311
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,620
Sung Yeol told me that you were busy and to come help you.

312
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,540
Even your lies show on your face.

313
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,660
What should I start with?

314
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,870
Go help Joo Ah.

315
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,430
Congrats on your first day of work.

316
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,770
Thanks. Isn't it sad to live in someone else's house?

317
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,890
It's not sad but it is a little difficult being watchful of their notice.

318
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,050
Living in someone else's house is like that normally. You have to be the first to wake up and the last to sleep.

319
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,200
There is really nothing you don't know.

320
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,000
You have no reaction even though you're the main character of this huge announcement. Isn't that intriguing?

321
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,370

What's your dream?

323
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,540
I just tried asking wondering what kind of dream a guy who studies so well has.

324
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,190
Lee Seul Bi, here.

325
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,650
The thing is...

326
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,130
I'm sorry.

327
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,480
I'll see you at home later.

328
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,990
Hey, it sounds just like the conversation of newlyweds.

329
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,300
See you at home later.

330
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,420
You'll have to help me.

Yes. What shall I get you Customer?

335
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,240
What's that picture?

336
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,190
Jealousy, betrayal, love triangle.

337
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,310
From there to there. Bring it all.

338
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,460
Yes.

Hey, thanks.

It's $74 but I'll only take $170.

351
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,580
Get it from your mom since this is your mom's store.

352

What does that mean?

353
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,770
Your mom is this store's owner. Didn't you know?

354
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,720
Is that true? Did Teacher help us?

355
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,830
Since you're her biological son she spent a lot of money.

356
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,170
So what? It doesn't matter who the owner is. Calculate it properly.

357
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,410
I'm her son on her family registry so isn't this much okay?

358
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,270
Let's go.

359
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,260
Hey, Hwang Sung Yeol. Don't you get the sense that this is really petty?

360
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,700
I'll show you what being really petty is. Aren't you coming?

361
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,430
Woo Hyun, I'll leave first.

362
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,660
I'll see you at home.

363
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,010
Have you really decided to make things difficult for Woo Hyun?

364
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,070
I'm thinking to go to the end.

365
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,860
I don't know what will be the end of that path so don't ask.

366
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,240
You give pain to Woo Hyun, and you hurt as much as he does.

367
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,520
No, I don't hurt at all.

368
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,220
Are you okay?

369
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,390
You're not crying. You're quite sturdy.

370
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,480
<i>You normally smiled like that, warmly and sweetly.</i>

371
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,300
Walk carefully.

372
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,200
I'm sorry for lying earlier.

373
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,170
Woo Hyun's shoulder seemed to hurt him. I couldn't leave him to work alone.

374
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,110
Even if you lie I'm not going to send you any longer.

375
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,260
It would be nice if Woo Hyun could try living with his mother.

376
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,530
He always longed for her.

377
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,270

I don't care, I'll just eat later.

You eat first, I'll just eat later.

383
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,320
Both of you sit.

384
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:32,590
I don't know what happened to you two, but in this house, don't make it uncomfortable for everyone.

385
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,760
This isn't a place where only you two live

386
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,680

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:49,450
Let's try share the tasks. There's no one comfortable here. Got it?

389
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,440
Yes.

390
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,480
Did the store do well today?

391
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,440
Excuse me?

392
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,510
Yes. It was busy today.

393
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,500
That's a relief.

394
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,750
The store... I'll work hard to get it back

395
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,830
I can't repay the debt right now but

396
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,040
I have to pretend to ignore it even if it's a cowardly thing to do

397
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,420
Please wait a bit.

398
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,410
For a mom, it was the naturally thing to do. I would've done the same.

399
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,470
Everything,

400
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,630
Honestly, everything is uncomfortable and weird

401
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,590
I'm uncomfortable too, here.

402
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,960
I can't smile here

403
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,530
Even though I didn't know if my mom was ever going to come, I liked that house because I was waiting for her.

404
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,200
Sung Yeol can't forget his real mom either.

405
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,830
It must be the same for you

406
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,940
You guys are only 18

407
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,650
I'm running towards the end of a cliff

408
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,680
And Sung Yeol.

409
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,320
If Sung Yeol falls first, I will definitely catch him. Don't worry too much.

410
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,690
What if you fall first?

411
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,080
I can't fall. I have people to protect.

412
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,850
Thank you for taking me in

413
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,480
Are you okay?

414
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,700
Let go, I'll do it.

415
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,400
That's right! Sung Yeol is my son.

416
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,250
Aigoo...

417
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,990
Why are you like this?

418
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,970
Let go.

419
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,800
Ah, let's go.

420
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,290
It's okay.

421
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,740
I heard that humans drink alcohol when they're sad

422
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,850
The ahjusshi, teacher, and Sung Yeol all seem unhappy because of me.

423
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:47,920
Even if everyone else in the world is unhappy because of you, there will always be one person, one person who's happy because of you.

424
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,660
Who's that?

425
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,640
Me! Me!

426
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,630
Me too! Me!

427
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,830
You are hurt, why didn't you tell me?

428
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,710
It's all better now because you worried about me. It's fine

429
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,590
Pain in your body will heal over time but when will aches in your heart heal?

430
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,490
You, and Sung Yeol, too.

431
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,330
Hey, Hwang Sung Yeol.

432

You go in first.

434
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,100
Don't fight.

435
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,730
Out of all the sports, basketball, soccer, and running, the reason why I have to do this today

436
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,010
Forget it

437
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:49,260
If I win, the relationship between Teacher, you, and me will definitely stay a secret.

438
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,110
If I win, I'll reveal Seul Bi's secret.

439

Not bad

473
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,030
I'll eat well.

474
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,490
This-<br>- Woo Hyun.

475
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,740
Stop it!

476
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,830
What are you doing right now?!

477
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,570
Is that all you can do?

478
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,100
Being like this you...

479
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,250
This is all your fault

480
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:49,640
So, please stop now. Think of me

481
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,180
Are you okay?

482
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:40,050
Why did you just eat it. You can't even say you can't eat it?

483
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,460
Sorry. The only thing I gave you was allergies.

484
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,180
Just rest.

485
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:02,980
When you were six and crossing the busy street,

486
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,180
you crossed alone to get to your grandma's

487
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,350
As soon I caught you I hit you.

488
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:17,910
Saying how even without you things were difficult but why were you adding to my hardships?

489
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:26,170
The fact that I was a divorced, single mom having to take care of you alone,

490
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,660
It was really hard and embarassing.

491
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:39,260
As if you knew my feelings, you would cry yourself to sleep

492
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:46,410
I was afraid that if I kept you, you might have died

493
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,290
It's hard.

494
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,190
It sounds like a weak excuse to me

495
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,870
You're right. It's an excuse.

496
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,200
You have to live

497
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,660
and I have to live, too.

498
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,250
You would've been hurting too

499
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,050
Instead of me

500
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,040
I should've taken the pain for you

501
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,950
I realized that late, Woohyun

502
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,490
But,

503
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,560
Since, you're hurt

504
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,050
it's nice that I can see you for a long time

505
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,470
I'm really bad aren't I?

506
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,480
What do you think will change if you keep this up?

507
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,350
If you keep getting mad, both of you will just keep getting hurt more

508
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,440
And also, don't bother Woo Hyun anymore. I won't let it go anymore

509
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,330
Don't come close!

510
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,020
What are you?

511
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,080
What exactly are you hiding?

512
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
There's nothing I'm hiding

513
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,040
Perhaps, are you-

514
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Shut your mouth.

515
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,460
<i> I have nothing to do with the mess you and Teacher are in <i></i></i>

516
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,390
<i> Weirder and weirder things are happening. It's because of you isn't it? <i></i></i>

517
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,000
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with you?!

518
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,250
I'm sorry.

519
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,670
<i> Go away! Leave! <i></i></i>

520
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,420
<i> Let me see you even like this <i></i></i>

521
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,240
No, please!!

522
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,660
<i> Please don't let anything happen to us <i></i></i>
