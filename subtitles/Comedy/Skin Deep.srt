You exorcised your demons with credible
thoughts and good words on that typewriter

and your talent turned me on.

I really thought we had a chance
"until death do us part."

And then one day you stopped. You gave up.

-No, don't say it.

-What's that?
-The inevitable consequence

328
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:07,601
of excessive vicissitude.

329
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:11,229
-What's that?
-Pressure.

330

Well, come on, explain.

331
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:18,612
Two people, who live an inharmonious
existence together

332
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,906
eventually arrive at a point

333
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,950
where the pressure is so great,
somebody has to give.

334
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:27,078
Unless you bleed off a certain amount
of steam

335
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,664
in a pressure cooker, it will explode.

336
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:30,916
Excessive vicissitude.

337
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,335
When wood is too dry and the sun
is too hot--

338
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,128
Spontaneous combustion.

339
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:38,840
-Exactly.
-You were the wood, Molly was the sun.

340
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,551
A felicitous analogy.

341
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:44,346
-And what's that?
-Showing off with big words.

342
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:45,472
Oh.

343
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:49,684
It's a condition that occurs when I mix
a lack of self-esteem

344
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:54,356
with an abundance of alcohol.
To be precise, a Banzai Sunset.

345
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,775
-All right, Zach. Car keys.
-Uh-uh.

346
00:20:56,942 --> 00:21:01,321
Hey. Molly took my Jeep and my Mercedes
burned up with the fire.

347
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:03,865
Give her some credit, will you?
Most of the women I know

348
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,659
would have swung with the Mercedes.

349
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,746
-It had a flat.
-Oh, it had a flat.

350
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,082
When you pass out, where do I ship
the body?

351
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,708
I don't know. So far it's a toss-up

352
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,835
between your guest room
and the Ambassador Hotel.

353
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,505
-My guest room is occupied.
-By whom?

354
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,549
-By a guest.
-I don't believe you.

355
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,009
You're just timid about tidying
up after a drunk.

356
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,844
Tidying up is a cinch.

357
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,514
It's replacing furniture, buying
new carpet,

358
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,058
painting out the graffiti
is what makes me timid.

359
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,019
What are you looking for?

360
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,190
You hid the nuts. Didn't I reimburse you
for all that stuff?

361
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,901
-Some things are not reimbursable.
-For instance?

362
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:44,197
Like putting Krazy Glue on my dog's paws
and sticking him halfway up the wall.

363
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:47,534
-I see your point.
-Now look it's not that I don't empathize.

[woman 2] Hi, Lonnie!

369

-Lentil.

370
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:02,507
It was lentil last week.

371
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:05,760

something else.

No. I don't know anything about music.

-Do I?
-Are you?

410
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:33,658

-That a woman can be an individual

with taste and still be feminine?

412

Oh! If I admitted surprise,

00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:42,041
would that mitigate against us

00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,252
I don't know. I've never known a woman
who builds bodies.

425
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:26,437
Look at it this way, Zach. I've worked
five years, 52 weeks a year,

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,149
five days a week, three hours a day...

427
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:34,904

How'd you get in?

460
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:18,109
Sorry everything's in such a mess.
It's the maid's day off.

461
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,194
I'm not going to argue with you anymore,
Zach.

462
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,280
You're dishonest and you're too good
with words.

463
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:25,491
Hey, when have I ever been dishonest
with you?

464
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:28,327
Oh, come on! You were dishonest with me

465
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:30,371
from the time you decided you wanted
to fuck me!

466
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:33,583
We were introduced. I said,
"How do you do?

467
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,002
I wanna fuck you." What's dishonest
about that?

468
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,172
Zach, in the six months
of living together,

469
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,841
-we had a hundred arguments.
-I only counted 99.

470
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:44,218
Okay. Out of those 99 arguments,

471
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:46,804
was there ever one time that you thought
that I was right?

472
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:48,890
-Honestly? No.
-What does that tell you?

473
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:51,517
That you were wrong 99 times out of 100.

474
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:57,106
Get out of my face, Zach, or I swear
to God I'm gonna kill you.

475
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:00,818
-Can I ask you something first?
-No.

476
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,362
What are you looking for?

477
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,490
My runes.

478
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,700
-I'm sorry. You're what?
-Runes.

479
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,661
I cast them for you once when we started
going together.

480
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,539
-Runes?
-Viking runes!

481
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:17,543
Little stones with runic symbols
that tell your fortune.

482
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,003
You said they were bullshit,

483
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,880
but the last time I consulted them,
I turned up Isa.

484
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,132
Isa? Oh, well, what does that mean?

485
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,259
Spiritual winter.

486
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,970
-Oh.
-I'm spiritually frozen, Zach.

487
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,182
So what? You thought a good fire
would help thaw you out?

488
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:32,892
There you go.

489
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,814
So where did you keep these runes?

490
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:43,444
I put them in my bedside drawer.
I thought because they were stone,

491
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:47,865
-They must have melted or something.
-You won't find them here.

492
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:50,409
The bedroom's over there.
You're in the toilet.

493

[laughs]

494
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,749
Yeah, the story of my life.

495
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:00,086
-Molly.
-Don't worry.

496
00:31:00,878 --> 00:31:03,256
I'll bring back the Jeep as soon
as I find a job.

497
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:06,676

[piano music playing]

499
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,486
-You don't look great.
-I can't imagine why not.

500
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:30,783
I spent the past 24 hours escaping
from a burning house,

501
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,328
getting shitfaced and shacking up
with a muscle-bound sex maniac

502
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:37,290
and doing three hours
of kamikaze aerobics.

503
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,003
Speaking of burning houses,
they haven't said so in so many words,

504
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:44,338
but... they're making noises
like they think

505
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,340
the fire has been deliberately set.

506
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:48,843
"They" being? The insurance company.

507
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,971
-Based on?
-Information from the fire department.

508
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,765
-What information?
-We'll know that when they tell us.

509
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:58,102
Uh, another screwdriver for Mr. Hutton,

510
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,564
and I'll have, uh, Jack Daniel's rocks.

511
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,987
Sorry about Sparky.

512
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:13,201
-What about Sparky?
-Oh, I thought you knew.

513
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,578
-Oh, shit.
-It was on the morning news.

514
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,038
I thought someone would have called you.

515
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,998
Nobody knows I'm here but you.

516
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:21,250
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,254
Well, what was it, a heart?

518
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,798
A suicide.

519
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,426
Oh, God.

520
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,721
Oh, God!

521
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,730
I talked to him just a month ago.

522
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,358
I told him. I wanted to apologize.

523
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,694
-Apologize?
-For what, for Christ's sake?

524
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,283
Oh, for letting him down, for the things
I said the last time I saw him.

525
00:32:55,785 --> 00:32:57,912
But he said, "Well, that's very big
of you, Zach.

526
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:01,999
But I'm afraid it's too late.
You've cut me too deep."

527
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,755
Did he have any family?

528
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,344
No. Curt was the closest thing to family,
but...

529
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,930
God, I wonder how he's taking it.

530
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:29,360
I gotta get home
to the fucking loved ones.

531
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,321
Give Bernice my regards.

[Amy] I-- I don't know about those,
but don't be surprised,

cause sometimes Rick's sexual taste
can get pretty kinky.

769
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:07,969
[Zach] It says in the instructions

770
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:10,180
that it's been treated with an ancient
Chinese herb,

771

Rick, you scared the hell out of me.

00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:10,490
I'm sorry. I, uh-- I didn't mean to.

789
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:15,662
I, uh, came back to apologize.

-Too late.
-I--

-This.
-What?

This!

794
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:27,299
Rick, if you wanna talk,
we'll talk tomorrow.

795
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:32,137
-No, I, uh-- I don't wanna talk, love.
-No, Rick.

796
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:34,723
I thought maybe we could make a little
bit of love.

797
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:36,057
-No! No.
-Fine!

-Jesus!
-Where are you going?

799
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:41,771
I forgot my mousse.

-What the hell?
-What?

-This.
-Oh, Rick!

Amy, it was gonna be a surprise.

804
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,412
They were in that-- that drawer!

Oh what, you think I took them out and--

No! No!

807
00:49:00,373 --> 00:49:02,500
I think they got up all by themselves.

Rick, they're your stupid rubbers!

809

-Just take them and get out!
-All right!

All right! Fine!

I've heard the expression. Never used it.

No, I quit Brown. I'm going to Juilliard.

Juilliard. Well, how about--
That's what I want. Bless you.

917
00:54:06,971 --> 00:54:09,015

I'll be damned. Mm.

919
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,896
I didn't know you were that interested
in music.

920
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:16,856
Probably because you never thought to ask.

921
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:19,526
That's not fair. But accurate.

922

Fair doesn't count? Come on, Greg.

923
00:54:21,986 --> 00:54:24,197
You were only interested in rock 'n' roll,
like any kid your age.

924
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,033
He never gave me a clue--
he never went near a piano,

925
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:28,618
you know that. What, you want accurate?

926
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:31,079
You certainly never took the time
to tell me.

927

Not much worse, but...

I don't think Greg has quite forgiven--

Greg has really grown up to be
quite a young pain in the ass.

1085
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:22,169
His name is Jonas Mallard.

1086
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,547
Sounds like a duck.

1087
01:04:25,714 --> 01:04:28,217
<i>-Zach.
-Why wasn't he there tonight?</i>

1088
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,847
Because he's in New York on business.

1089
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:35,099
Is it serious?

1090
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:38,102
Yes.

1091
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,063
Gonna get married?

1092
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:43,941
We've talked about it.

1093
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:48,863
I don't know whether you know it or not,
but it's bad luck to marry a duck.

1094
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:53,117
Good night, Zach.

1095
01:04:54,076 --> 01:04:55,744
-Unless you're a duck.
-[thud]

1096
01:04:56,871 --> 01:04:59,498
Even then, it's no guarantee
it's gonna last. You know Barney?

1097
01:04:59,623 --> 01:05:01,417
Am I right? Are ducks monogamous?

1098
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:05,796
-No. Swans are.
-This guy's a duck. That was Alex.

1099
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:07,006
So I gathered.

1100
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:12,011
Hey, Barney,
how about another one?

1101
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:15,681
You know, of course, we're breaking
the law.

1102
01:05:15,806 --> 01:05:16,974
What "we"?

1103
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,934
I got a mouse in my pocket.

1104
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:21,979
We.

1105
01:05:25,524 --> 01:05:28,986
One thing's sure. Mice are not monogamous.

1106
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:30,070
For sure.

1107
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:33,866
-If they were, they'd be "monogomice."
-Yeah. I'll call a cab.

1108
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:35,242
Okay.

1109
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:38,746
I-- I don't go to hotels anymore.

1110
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:42,917
I'm on their shit list.
So if your guest room is still occupied,

1111
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,880
I'll just curl up on the bar right here.
All right.

1112
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:57,806
Okay, but no throwing up in the fish tank.

1113
01:05:58,057 --> 01:05:59,266
I cross my heart.

1114
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:01,602
-Let's go.
-Barney?

1115
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,146
-What?
-Carry me.

1116
01:06:04,813 --> 01:06:06,190
Oh, shit.

1117
01:06:06,982 --> 01:06:09,360
[Zach screams]

1118
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:20,162
I'm blind! I can't see!

1119
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:22,206
All right, all right.

1120
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,708
How did you do-- what is-- what is that?

1121
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,586
-It's a B-12.
-Do I need it?

1122
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,880
Did Custer need a bulletproof vest?

1123
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:32,258
-[Zach grunts] Barney.
-All right. Easy. Easy.

1124
01:06:33,133 --> 01:06:34,009
[sobbing]

1125
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:37,179
Okay, okay! God!

1126
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:38,514
-Jeez!
-Okay.

1127
01:06:39,473 --> 01:06:42,226
-I gotta pee.
-Huh? Easy, easy. All right.

1128
01:06:42,434 --> 01:06:43,644
All right. Take it easy.

1129
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:46,939
God!

1130
01:06:48,941 --> 01:06:51,026
Why did you wrap yourself in toilet paper?

1131
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:52,945
[Zach] Because I was cold.

1132
01:06:57,032 --> 01:06:58,826
[Zach moans]

1133
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:03,580

[panting]

1135
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:13,757
I'm in a lot of trouble, doctor.

1136
01:07:15,259 --> 01:07:20,055
Frankly, I don't have the strength
or the courage to go on like this,

1137
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:22,141
and even if I did, I wouldn't want to.

1138
01:07:24,685 --> 01:07:28,105
Every day, I get a little more depressed.

1139
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:31,775
I get a little more desperate.

1140
01:07:33,235 --> 01:07:36,613
I feel like I'm worse off
than when I first started with you.

1141
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:39,033
When you first started with me,
you were a mess.

1142
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:40,909
[laughs]

1143
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:43,495
I'm still a mess. I haven't changed.

1144
01:07:43,704 --> 01:07:46,123
Don't you know by now that changing
one's basic character

1145
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:47,875
is next to impossible?

1146
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:50,419
No. I don't know that.

1147
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:52,212
Jesus, doctor if I thought
I couldn't change,

1148
01:07:52,293 --> 01:07:54,068
-I wouldn't come see you in first place.
-I didn't say--

1149
01:07:54,143 --> 01:07:56,425
-I didn't say you couldn't.
-You just said it was impossible!

1150
01:07:56,508 --> 01:07:59,345
-I said it was next to impossible.
-Well, shit, doctor.

1151
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,555
"Next to" isn't that far removed.

1152
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,766
If it were, there'd be no analysts.

1153
01:08:04,475 --> 01:08:07,728
Not an entirely unhappy prospect, doctor.

1154
01:08:09,897 --> 01:08:12,775
Did I ever tell you the story
about the frog and the scorpion?

1155
01:08:14,068 --> 01:08:14,985
No.

1156
01:08:16,612 --> 01:08:19,323
A scorpion who couldn't swim
asked the frog

1157
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,408
to carry him across the river on his back.

1158
01:08:23,035 --> 01:08:24,912
The frog said, "Do you think I'm crazy?

1159
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:27,748
Halfway across the river, you'll sting me
and I'll drown."

1160
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:30,334
"That's not reasonable,"
said the scorpion.

1161
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:33,754
"If I sting you and you drown,
I'll drown too."

1162
01:08:35,547 --> 01:08:38,509
Frog thought about it, said, "Climb on."

1163
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,138
Halfway across the river,
the scorpion stung the frog.

1164
01:08:44,014 --> 01:08:46,767
And as the frog was drowning,
he said to the scorpion,

1165
01:08:47,643 --> 01:08:49,395
"But now you'll drown too."

1166
01:08:50,521 --> 01:08:52,606
The scorpion said, "Yes, I know."

1167
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,817
"But that's not reasonable,"
said the frog.

1168
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:59,988
And the scorpion replied,
"Reason has nothing to do with it.

1169
01:09:00,322 --> 01:09:03,242
I'm a scorpion. It's my character."

1170
01:09:07,996 --> 01:09:09,540
You know what I feel like telling you?

1171
01:09:09,873 --> 01:09:12,876
Yes. You feel like telling me
to go fuck myself.

1172
01:09:13,544 --> 01:09:16,588
And you probably will,
because that's your character.

1173
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:21,260
See you next Tuesday.

1174

[woman] The man was fabulous.
Absolutely fabulous.

1178
01:09:52,249 --> 01:09:54,251
I took one look at him,
and I just knew...

1179
01:09:55,294 --> 01:09:56,920
-Hi.
-Hi. You can go right in.

1180
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:57,921
Thank you.

1181
01:09:58,255 --> 01:10:00,507
I got to go now. Okay.

1182
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,389
-Can I help you?
-Uh, yeah.

1183
01:10:07,473 --> 01:10:10,350
I just happened to be in the building,
and I was intrigued

1184
01:10:10,434 --> 01:10:12,352
by the company name.
Is this the company name?

1185
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:13,604
Yes, it is.

1186
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:16,315
"Form 3, world's foremost fitness
and beauty program."

Mm-hmm

in three days

01:10:19,776 --> 01:10:21,695
and was completely cured of his asthma.

1190
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:23,947
-You take men?
-Mm-hmm.

1191
01:10:24,072 --> 01:10:25,991
Thirty-five percent of our clientele
are men.

1192
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:27,868
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

came in--

Emily?

1195
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,168
Emily, yes. She certainly didn't look
to be

1196
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:38,795
lacking in the fitness or beauty
department.

1197
01:10:39,129 --> 01:10:40,797
Well, you should have seen
her six months ago.

-The first herbal wrap is on the house.

-Working.

-Molly, this is silly.
-What's that?

1208

I don't need a complimentary herbal wrap
and electro-stimulation.

-I-- I didn't mean--

You know, I could've sued your ass off,
Zach.

1214

But instead I decided to get a job.
You may not approve, but it pays the rent.

I approve, okay?

If you think it's silly,
what are you doing here?

1217
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,347
I guess, I'm getting a complimentary
herbal wrap--

01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:38,105
-But if it's so silly--
-It's not, okay? Wrap me.

the more your muscles will contract.

-Molly...
-For the first silly treatment,

1223
01:11:51,285 --> 01:11:53,036
it's not advisable to exceed plus-three.

Zach.

-M-- Molly?
-After ten silly treatments,

1226
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,712
you should be able to handle plus-seven.

If an alcoholic wants me to cure him,
you know what I say?

1550
01:31:49,774 --> 01:31:51,650
<i>First, stop drinking.</i>

1551
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:57,865
I got it!

1552

Jake!

1553
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:08,876
You won't believe it!

01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:12,338
But there is a God! And he's a gag writer!

Close the door, goddamn it, Jake!

1560
01:32:23,724 --> 01:32:26,769
Bernice will never forgive Jake
for renting me his other beach house.

1561
01:32:27,186 --> 01:32:29,396
But anyway, I figured it out, Barney.

1562
01:32:30,105 --> 01:32:32,274
You can't cure a problem until you know

1563
01:32:32,608 --> 01:32:34,193
what's causing the problem.

1564
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,988
But before you can see what's causing
the problem,

1565
01:32:38,322 --> 01:32:41,033
you first have to remove the problem.

1566
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:44,495
You gotta give up the vices to get
to the virtues.

1567
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:47,498
-I could've told you that.
-Yeah? Why didn't you?

1568
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:50,292
You want it to take, you got to figure
it out for yourself.

1569
01:32:50,876 --> 01:32:52,753
Okay, wise guy, what's my problem?

1570
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,797
You're scared, like the rest of us.

1571
01:32:55,089 --> 01:32:58,050
You drink too much. You chase girls
much too much.

1572
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:01,011
and you don't use your God-given talent
anymore.

1573
01:33:03,138 --> 01:33:07,142
-You've known that all along?
-I'm a good bartender.

1574
01:33:07,351 --> 01:33:10,479
Now all I have to do is figure out
how to stop being scared.

1575
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:14,733
While you're at it, may I offer
a suggestion?

1576
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:17,069
[Zach] Okay, open up,
I know you're in there.

You were ravishing.

1582
01:34:00,412 --> 01:34:02,206
I switched you from tonic water to Slice.

1583

-Think you can handle it?
-Yeah, that's fine.

1584
01:34:03,866 --> 01:34:06,285
Just keep me away from those honey-roasted
almonds.

1585

Excuse me.

-Congratulations, Mr. Hutton.
-Oh, you read my book?

1587
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:15,085
No, but since you stopped drinking,
you're a much better kisser.

-Yes.

Hey, you guys. You're not mad, are you?

No, of course not. Congratulations, Zach.

Alex, I've stopped drinking. I've written
a bestseller.

In my book, two out of three ain't bad.

1622

No, but in my book, two out of three
just ain't good enough.

I had to...

change.
