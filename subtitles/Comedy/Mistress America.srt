1
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,446
She would say things like,

2
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,157
"Isn't every story a story of betrayal?"

3
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,660
"No, that's not true," I thought.

4
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,414
But I could never say that.
I could only agree with her.

5
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,067
It was too much fun to agree with her.

6
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,309
I was sleeping. Turn that off!

7
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:00,644
Sorry.

8
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:03,147
I'm your roommate.

9
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,316
My name is Laura
and I'm going on safari...

10
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,654
and I'm bringing with me
a car for Carrie...

11
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,531
a rolling pin, Ruth...

12
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,993
a jar for Juman...

13
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,162
and a...

14
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,872
Uh... Shit!

15
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,665
A tracking device for Tracy.

16
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,002
Right, a tracking device for Tracy...

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,547
and a lighter for me, Laura.

18
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,215
Aren't you coming to convocation?

19
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,717
You're going to that shit?

20
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,343
Yeah, isn't everyone?

21
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,679
I don't think anyone is going.

22
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:36,847
Except rapists.

23
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,348
What? Why rapists?

24
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,752
Or Christians and home-schooled kids.

25
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:41,894
Nobody really goes.

26
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,646
I think it's just
a candle-lighting ceremony.

27
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,258
How do you already know all this stuff?

28
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,901
School hasn't even started yet.

29
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,877
This is a starting point.

30
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,213
This is what college is for.

31
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,883
We're here to teach you
to write and think.

32
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,844
A "B"? That's so annoying.

33
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:19,932
I have trouble with procrastinating.

34
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:24,019
Did you ever think of...
just getting your work in on time?

35
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,856
Yes, I have thought of that.
I have trouble doing it.

36
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,942
Maybe you want to try a little harder.

37
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,444
Okay. Thanks.

38
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,905
Harder. I'll try that.

39
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,993
What comes to mind
when you think of the Renaissance?

40
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,413
I think of the Renaissance as being
very plush, like a lot of velvet...

41
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,500
inlaid with jewels,
brocades, that kind of thing.

42
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,001
Thank you.

43
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,628
I was actually asking about literature,

44
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,573
but that was very nice.

45
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,011
Hey, um, is the party
at the end of the hall?

46
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,304
Did you get an invitation?

47
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,639
No.

48
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,224
Then, no.

49
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,435
She's being a bitch.
Yes, it's right down the hall.

50
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,780
I could be anywhere.

51
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,323
It doesn't even feel like New York.

52
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,118
And by trying to participate,
I'm somehow not fitting in even less.

53
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,953
Aren't you meeting friends in classes?

54
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,997
Mom, nobody meets friends in classes.

55
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,832
Oh, okay. I didn't know.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
You know the feeling of being at a party
where you don't know anybody?

57
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,962
It's like that the whole time.

58
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,839
That sounds uncomfortable.

59
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,241
Did you get my email?

60
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,967
With the reading? Do you like it?

61
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,135
I liked it.

62
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,096
I think there's a darker element to what
Shakespeare's saying, but I liked it.

63
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,641
It's Thanksgiving weekend, so we'll
have a built-in rehearsal dinner...

64
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,143
on Thursday at the house.

65
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,311
Right.

66
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,314
It'll be the first time the two families
are all in the same room.

67
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,857
Oh, Stevie.

68
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,609
Oh, Trace.

69
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,987
You know I was very unhappy
for a very long time.

70
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,989
But I'm glad your dad and I
stayed together...

71
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,991
till you and your brother
were out of school.

72
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,453
I was not out of school. You broke up
when I was a junior in high school.

73
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,872
On your way out of the home.

74
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,499
I love you, Mom. Don't be worried.

75
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,335
I know, honey.

76
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,297
So after you do that, Brooke
will read a poem that she's written.

77
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,300
You should call Brooke.
She's in New York, you know.

78
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,802
I'm so bad at calling people
I don't know.

79
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,220
I hear she's fun.

80
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,556
She's, like, 30, and living
in New York with a life.

81
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:27,517
She doesn't need to hear from an
18-year-old she's tenuously connected to.

82
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,354
She's going to be your sister,
that doesn't sound tenuous to me.

83
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,523
And you have plenty to talk about,
you're both doing readings at our wedding.

84
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,900
Aces!

85
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,569
You aren't sarcastic,
don't pretend to be.

86
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:38,820
Okay.

87
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,199
Nothing's higher than the law.
That's the whole point.

88
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,410
Antigone thinks she's above
the law, but she's not.

89
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,664
Like, a celebrity
in a car crash or something.

90
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,499
That's really interesting,
Nicolette. It's great.

91
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,377
Why don't you continue with the reading?

92
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,587
"Because it was not
Zeus who ordered it...

93
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,450
"nor Justice, dweller with the Nether
gods, gave such a law to men."

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,592
Hey.

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,828
"Nor did I deem your ordinance

96
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,887
- Psst.
- "of so much binding force...

97
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:08,183
"as that a mortal man could overbear
the unchangeable unwritten code of heaven.

98
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,852
"This is not of today and yesterday."

99
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,729
That was really nice of you,
waking me up.

100
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,524
Takes a lot of moxie to fall asleep
in a 12-person class.

101
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,359
Thanks. I like moxie.

102
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,527
I get it.

103
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,738
It's like, I'm so grateful to be here, but
why are my parents taking out loans...

104
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,574
for me to listen to that
18-year-old asshole talk?

105
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,785
Loans everywhere.

106
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,204
I was gonna get frozen yogurt,
wanna come?

107
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,248
Yes, but...

108
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,125
Well, I have to get somewhere by 5:00.

109
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
Where?

110
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,528
Uh... It's embarrassing.

111
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:37,963
What is it?

112
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:41,299
I'm submitting a story
to the Mobius Literary Society.

113
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,927
Get out of town, sister!
I already gave mine.

114
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,262
Do you know how you find out
if you're in it?

115
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,430
They said they post a list.

116
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,099
No, the only people who check the list
are the people who didn't get in.

117
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,101
They come and wake us up
at night in our rooms...

118
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,063
and put pie in our face and then
bring us down to the quad...

119
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,940
and make us sing and stuff.

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,650
Yeah.

121
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:20,964
Oh, my God!

122
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,343
Am I in? Oh, my God, really?

123
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,312
Fuck!

124
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,315
They're self-elected douchebags.

125
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,259
I know. But I wanted to be one of them.

126
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,485
I could die then.

127
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:45,197
Yeah, me too. Both, I want
to be in, and I could also then die.

128
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,117
I heard they serve wine and cheese
and they all carry briefcases.

129
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,494
I know.

130
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,496
When I had my tour here...

131
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,457
the guide was one of them
and that's why I wanted to come here.

132
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,542
I heard the pie stuff all night.

133
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,445
They got the guy next door.

134
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,947
He doesn't even look like a writer.

135
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,469
I'm so sorry.

136
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,971
Do you wanna trade stories?

137
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,306
Sure.

138
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,558
I'll refresh our screwdrivers.

139
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,489
I liked it.

140
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,157
Thanks. I liked yours, too.

141
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,742
So, you want notes?

142
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,869
Oh, are we... Sure.

143
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,037
Okay.

144
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,373
I thought the middle part
sounded really fake.

145
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,499
Okay.

146
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,084
It's just my impression.

147
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,378
I'll work on that.

148
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,171
Do you have any notes for me?

149
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,422
Um...

150
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,550
No.

151
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,717
Great.

152
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,387
I have a car.

153
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,601
Let's go to the beach.

154
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,436
I don't want to leave Manhattan.

155
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,022
Why are we in your car then?

156
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,586
We look like we're in a song.

157
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,090
I think the way Aristotle
writes about ethics and morality...

158
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,759
is much closer to how most
people think about it.

159
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,470
Less like math, more like a story.

160
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,182
I think we should set up
a recycling system for our trash...

161
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,876
because a lot of what
we are throwing out

162
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,810
can be recycled.

163
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,006
Ruth, I think that fan
can go in the closet now.

164
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,315
It's 50 degrees out.

165
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,524
You seem happy today.

166
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,444
I love filing. It's satisfying.

167
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,281
Slow down, T!

168
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:58,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,165
Hey.

170
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,532
No more lonely nights

171
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:10,743
You my guiding light

172
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,177
This is Stevie Fishko.

173
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:15,347
I can't come to the phone now.
Please leave me a mess...

174
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:22,630
May I never miss the thrill

175
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,051
Of being near you

176
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,528
You've reached Brooke Cardinas.

177
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,973
Leave your name and number

178
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:35,158
and I will get back to you
at my earliest convenience.

179
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,980
I will do

180
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,732
What I feel

181
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,945
To be right

182
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,448
No more lonely nights

183
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,716
Never be another

184
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:52,842
No more lonely nights

185
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,761
Hello?

186
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,122
Hi, this is Brooke Cardinas.

187
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,014
I just got a missed call
from this number.

188
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,182
Hi.

189
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,227
Sorry. Um, this is Tracy Fishko.

190
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,438
My mom is marrying your dad.

191
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,856
You're reading the sonnet!

192
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,944
Right. We're doing Thanksgiving
and then wedding together.

193
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,697
I go to college in the city
and my mom said I should call you.

194
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,865
Have you eaten? Do you want to hang out?

195
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,143
Uh...

196
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,452
No, I haven't. Okay.

197
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,856
Well, do you know where Times Square is?

198
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:30,714
Tracy!

199
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,884
Welcome to the Great White Way!

200
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,213
Times Square is so crazy!

201
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:46,313
Isn't it?

202
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,506
I don't know anyone who lives here.

203
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,633
Yours truly.

204
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,818
I got off the bus from Jersey,
I thought this was the cool place to live.

205
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,904
It's motherfucking Times Square!

206
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,072
Why do you live in New York?

207
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,159
College. I go to Barnard.
It's all women uptown.

208
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,119
Well, "historically"
and kind of actually.

209
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,980
But there are boys
in my classes and stuff.

210
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,289
From Columbia.

211
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:05,665
- You gay?
- No.

212
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,069
The Columbia girls do their
best to make us feel inferior,

213
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,003
which it's like, "I already do."

214
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,755
That's stupid. Don't feel inferior.

215
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,758
You're right. That is stupid.

216
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,593
I never went to college.

217
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,371
I'm an autodidact.
Do you know what that means?

218
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:19,497
Yes.

219
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,916
That word is one of the things
I self-taught myself.

220
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:36,154
They all love you, you're a good girl

221
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,182
When you awake you'll find another man

222
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,269
Lying beside you

223
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,543
What's going on at college?

224
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,737
Everyone's really excited about

225
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,671
the frozen yogurt machine
in the student center.

226
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,715
- I watched my mother die.
- What?

227
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,884
I was with my mother while she died.

228
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,386
I don't know any dead people.

229
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,747
That's cool about
the frozen yogurt machine.

230
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,473
Everyone I love dies.

231
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,561
Brooke!

232
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,730
I heard you're opening a restaurant.

233
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,023
Yours truly.

234
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,191
W-T-F?

235
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:15,803
I know, it uses
all my talents except singing.

236
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,987
I sang with the band tonight.

237
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,407
This is my baby sister Tracy.

238
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,892
This bitch stole my favorite pants.

239
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,159
They're in here somewhere.

240
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,646
She thinks I don't know,
but I know everything.

241
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,205
- They're red.
- I'll look here.

242
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,165
People are always taking my shit.

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,777
My ex-friend and nemesis, Mamie-Claire,

244
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,446
stole my ideas and my fiancé.

245
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,546
Shit.

246
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,949
She took this t-shirt idea
that I had, started a company...

247
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,577
and fucking sold it to J. Crew,
so there's that.

248
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,262
She's one of those people that doesn't
have any good ideas for her own life...

249
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,222
so she just steals all of mine.

250
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,182
And then she literally stole my cats.

251
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,392
What were the t-shirts?

252
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,185
Just really hard-looking flowers.

253
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,104
Oh, my God! I bought
one of those t-shirts.

254
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,857
Yeah, flowers with, like,
skulls and shit. Daggers.

255
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,191
That's a great one.

256
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,403
My fiancé, Dylan, was super sexy.

257
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,571
And so rich.

258
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,072
But I wasn't gonna marry him.

259
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,032
Wait, you broke up with Dylan?
I thought she stole him.

260
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,620
And I never looked back.
He cried so hard, like whiny.

261
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,789
"Where are you going?"

262
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,877
I was being real, but Mamie-Claire
then goes and marries him.

263
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,279
They live in Greenwich, Connecticut

264
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,380
in some big gross house.
Do you know that place?

265
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,965
Yeah, Greenwich, Grossville.

266
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,051
Right? Living off of his
riches and my t-shirt idea.

267
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,386
I hate them!

268
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,332
I actually pity them.
They have no more dreams.

269
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,432
These?

270
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,726
I wanna marry you!

271
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,437
Ugh!

272
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:36,733
Must we document ourselves
all the time? Must we?

273
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,402
Is he your boyfriend? The bassist?

274
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,154
Nate? No!

275
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,948
My beau, Stavros,
is in Greece right now.

276
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,477
Betting against the country
or something gross.

277
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,744
Don't tell anyone that.

278
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,355
I won't. I'm good at keeping secrets.

279
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,622
You'll learn that about me.

280
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,249
He's the kind of person I hate,
except I'm in love with him.

281
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,419
I've been to a Greek Orthodox Easter
and I could totally see myself...

282
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,963
getting married in that kind of church.

283
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,423
You got a honey?

284
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,575
No.

285
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,469
There's this one guy, we got rejected
together, but he's got a girlfriend.

286
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:06,262
They all have girlfriends.

287
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,307
Actually, I think he met me
and then he got a girlfriend.

288
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:13,019
This summer, at my job, this one guy
just sucked on my boobs all night.

289
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,005
My restaurant should do a pierogi.

290
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,814
Fusion pierogi. You like yours?

291
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,192
Mmm, this is my second dinner.

292
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,444
Just a quick tweet on Twitter.

293
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,447
I'm very into social media.
You have to market yourself.

294
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,116
If you don't know what you're selling,
no one will know how to buy it.

295
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,326
What are you selling?

296
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,453
So many things. I don't tweet all of it.

297
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,456
Like, here are two ideas
that are not on the Internet.

298
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,667
If I did a cabaret...

299
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,711
it would be called "High Standards"
and I would sing all the standards.

300
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,296
Would you sing them in a higher pitch?

301
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,965
No, it wouldn't be about...

302
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,634
It's about principles,
those kind of high standards...

303
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,704
like one of those "String of Pearls

304
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,389
"and that's why I'm
a single gal" kind of show.

305
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,557
Oh, that's clever.

306
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:55,061
The second idea is a television show,
which I've read is the new novel...

307
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,648
about a woman who's
a government worker by day...

308
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,567
and a self-invented
superhero by night...

309
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,528
but it's like the essence of America.

310
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,321
It'll be its own mythology.

311
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,157
I think maybe it'll be called
Mistress America.

312
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,660
That sounds like she's
America's girl on the side.

313
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,062
I don't know, okay?

314
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,414
I'm not positive,
these are just some ideas.

315
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,582
Oh, me, too.

316
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,043
I'm sorry, I don't know anything,
I was just throwing something out there.

317
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,425
We need a sleepover party.

318
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,178
This apartment is technically
zoned commercial, but that's fake.

319
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,513
It's so stylish.

320
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,642
Fuck, I know, I freelance
as an interior decorator.

321
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,019
You know the Bowery Hotel?

322
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,353
Oh, my God, yeah.

323
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,023
Well, if you walk about a block south...

324
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,568
there's a laser hair removal center
that's very hip.

325
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:44,861
I did the waiting room.

326
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,863
- That's cool!
- I know!

327
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,475
I'm leaving here in January.

328
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,326
Moving to the East Side,
if you can believe it.

329
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,329
That's where Stavros lives.
I'm gonna redo his place too.

330
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,872
I want to write short stories.

331
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,374
Oh, me too! Not short stories, though.

332
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,085
But I got rejected by the Lit Society.

333
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,048
I'm so suggestible, like I think because
I got rejected I can't be a writer.

334
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,216
Why don't you make your own Lit Society?

335
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,886
I wish. Mobius is a big deal at school.

336
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,163
You've got other stories.

337
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,847
Just make another one up.

338
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,391
Maybe I'll write
something else and resubmit.

339
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,853
That was really fun
when we were dancing.

340
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,398
Yeah. I need to cut
all the negative people out of my life.

341
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,567
I just wasn't brought up that way.

342
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,694
Thank you, Brooke.

343
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,031
You're welcome, Baby Tracy.

344
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,159
My sweetheart, I miss you so much!

345
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,496
I can't wait for you to see
the chairs I picked out!

346
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:41,000
We start renovation so soon!
It's so exciting.

347
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,278
I've been going there

348
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:45,838
just to sit in the mess.
I love it so much.

349
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,032
Right?

350
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:51,135
Did you see the lease?
It's like 400 pages.

351
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,262
I wish you could just
come home already...

352
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,849
so I could suck your dick
in our new restaurant.

353
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,810
Can you start the coffee, please?

354
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,962
Oh, I don't know how.

355
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,479
Yes, you do. Don't be incompetent.

356
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,525
If you spent two seconds with
a coffee maker, you'd figure it out.

357
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,068
Hi. No, I'm here.

358
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,444
Where are you going?

359
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,181
Duh! Communal bathroom.
Do you wanna watch?

360
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,266
It's some girl.

361
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,976
- Sorry, are you mad at me?
- No!

362
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,354
We have four investors, including me.

363
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm what you call a principal investor.

364
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,374
Stavros is putting in my share...

365
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,960
but I insisted that it be
my assets on the line...

366
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,671
because I want him to know
I have skin in the game.

367
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,923
I'll pay him back, of course,
once we start making a profit.

368
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,534
We never went to restaurants growing up.

369
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,759
It wasn't part of our lives.

370
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,428
That's a shitty thing to say to me.

371
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,472
I didn't mean... I know
people will come to yours.

372
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,517
It's so weird to think that every
restaurant I see is the result...

373
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,729
of a person going, "I think
I want to start a restaurant."

374
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,440
No, that's not weird. That's everything.

375
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,316
What are you... What are you doing?

376
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,904
Actually... I'm writing down
what I said...

377
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,322
You're noting yourself?

378
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,991
Yeah, I guess so.

379
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,910
I've noticed something about myself that
would make a good character in a story.

380
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,162
Oh, yeah?

381
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,329
Yeah.

382
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,335
But I'm gonna save it in case I want
to use it in something that I write.

383
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,424
High five, sister.
That was an amazing night.

384
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,176
Yeah, it was. Best of my life.

385
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,761
I gotta go.

386
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,023
What did she say?

387
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:32,779
"He's one of those people that I hate...

388
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,785
"except that I'm in love with him."

389
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,661
Shut up, please.

390
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,796
Meadow DeRiggi lived exactly
how a young woman should live...

391
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,881
who wants to spend her youth well.

392
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,716
She did everything and nothing...

393
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:57,136
and spent time like I always
mean to: purposefully.

394
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,891
She sang with the band and knew everyone
and didn't owe anyone anything.

395
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,685
And couldn't pay up, even if she did.

396
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,729
Her beauty was that rare kind...

397
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,358
that made you want to look more
like yourself and not like her.

398
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,035
Being around Meadow
was like being in New York City.

399
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,413
It made you want to find life,
not hide from it.

400
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,209
Brooke!

401
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,486
Oh...

402
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,753
It's okay.

403
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,381
Where were you last night?
Did you get my text?

404
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,674
You text her? You texted her?

405
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,008
About work.

406
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,594
I went to check out this downtown
band at this downtown bar.

407
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,887
- Who were you with?
- Myself.

408
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,665
When you said you were
checking out the scores,

409
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,850
were you texting her? Are you sexting?

410
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,393
It was this place my sister showed me.

411
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,519
You don't have a sister.

412
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,730
I do. Or I will, when my mom
gets married at Thanksgiving.

413
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,025
Why don't you just text her
a picture of your balls?

414
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,193
Nicolette!

415
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:56,946
What's that?

416
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,182
It's this new story I wrote.

417
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,574
I'm gonna resubmit to the Lit Society.

418
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,617
Wait, you wrote another one already?

419
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,828
- You printed it on onionskin?
- You can read it if you want.

420
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,580
I have an extra copy.

421
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,874
Okay. I'd... totally give you notes.

422
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,026
No, I don't want notes.

423
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,419
But I thought about it
and I actually do have notes for you.

424
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,462
Uh, sure.

425
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,950
You write like you're imitating someone

426
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,718
who is free and wild...

427
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,722
and it is so weird,
because you aren't at all...

428
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,473
and it made me uncomfortable.

429
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,392
And I think it would make
everyone uncomfortable.

430
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,438
And, also, stop trying to be funny,
because you're not funny.

431
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,814
And...

432
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,400
it just adds to the awkwardness.

433
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,487
Oh, and it could also be,
like, 30% shorter, easy.

434
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:39,989
Okay.

435
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,657
Thanks.

436
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,099
Hey, Baby Tracy!

437
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,813
This is all about you, right now.

438
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,857
And you're giving it
as much as you've got,

439
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,025
so reach inside you...

440
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,946
and whatever it is inside of you,
you put it on the bike.

441
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,697
You feel me?

442
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,200
How you do anything
is how you do everything,

443
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,535
so leave it on the floor.

444
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,703
You did great.

445
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,372
I feel like I just went
swimming in my clothes.

446
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,207
- I'm glad you came.
- You are?

447
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,709
Shit, I've gotta change,
I've got a meeting.

448
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,127
Thanks, Brooke!

449
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,545
You're welcome, honey!

450
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,054
God, I am packed into this pencil skirt.

451
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,196
How do I look?

452
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,572
You look beautiful.

453
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
But do I look professional?

454
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,409
I get really nervous with the investors.

455
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:10,246
I'm usually fine with wealthy people,
it's just when I need something from them.

456
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,481
No, it's the opposite.

457
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,499
They need you and your restaurant.

458
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,543
Stavros usually does this stuff.

459
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,586
Maybe I shouldn't do it.
I'm not good at it.

460
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,172
I think you can do anything. Everything.

461
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,590
Right.

462
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,260
Kind and fearless.

463
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,684
It's amazing how much of business

464
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,910
is just stating the same thing
over and over again.

465
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,871
Your body language
looked very self-confident.

466
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,123
Thanks. You make me feel really smart.

467
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,374
Do you wanna see it?

468
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,584
Yeah!

469
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,178
The front part would be like
a shop during the day...

470
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:11,640
like a general store or a really
nice bodega, candy from Europe.

471
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,186
On Monday, we start demo,
and we open in April.

472
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,438
We'd also have cooking classes.

473
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:18,814
Maybe cut hair.

474
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,859
It would be like a community center...

475
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,653
and restaurant and a store all in one.

476
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:28,157
It would be the place
that you, like, loved to be.

477
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,867
I wish I had something
like that growing up.

478
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,120
Yeah, suburban New Jersey
isn't great with this kind of stuff.

479
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:36,165
Each plate would be different.
Here, let me show you.

480
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,374
Can I be a waitress here?

481
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,335
See? Look at all these plates.

482
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,003
Holy shit, you have a lot of plates.

483
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:45,382
I started collecting them so long ago,
I didn't know why and now I have a why.

484
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,244
This is going to be a great restaurant.

485
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,385
I know!

486
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,845
Are you going to cook, too?

487
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,681
I'll help create the menu
and I'll pitch in when needed.

488
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,851
I'm not trained,
but I'm an enthusiastic home cook.

489
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,645
I always used to cook with my mom.

490
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,064
That's the name
of the restaurant, Mom's.

491
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,190
Possessive.

492
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,733
"Let's go to Mom's for dinner."

493
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,819
Yeah, it totally works.

494
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,028
Can I be a waitress here?

495
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,139
I want the whole deal.

496
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:11,033
I want the dead-on-my-feet-
wake-up-and-I'm-40.

497
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,868
I've spent my whole life

498
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:16,038
chasing after things
and knocking at doors...

499
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,583
and I'm tired of running towards people.

500
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,961
I want to be the place
that people come to.

501
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,381
I want to make a home
for all the knockers and runners.

502
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,385
I'm good at that. I'm happy with that.

503
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,471
I keep the hearth.

504
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,851
That's a word, right? Hearth?

505
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,396
I tutor junior high because I didn't
get high enough SAT scores

506
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,730
to do SAT tutoring...

507
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,400
but you make way more money doing SAT's.

508
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,695
So, I'm gonna take the SAT's again
so I can make inroads into that racket.

509
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,655
I've always been
a really good test taker.

510
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,075
None of this will be necessary
when I'm a restaurateur.

511
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,744
But I'm good that way,
curating my employment.

512
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,746
So, um, should I wait here, or...

513
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,290
Oh, I thought
you had to go back to school.

514
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,208
Right. I should.

515
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,585
Do you want to stay?

516
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,545
I mean, if you don't mind.

517
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,365
I'd invite you in, but Peggy's mom
just got institutionalized...

518
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,718
for bipolar disorder,
so shit's pretty real upstairs.

519
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,262
Tutoring is like
60% middle school math...

520
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,472
40% I know too much about them.

521
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,474
That's okay, then. I'll just go home.

522
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,603
You remember where my apartment is,
go there. Bring my shit.

523
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,937
Seriously?

524
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,606
Pick up some pasta, I'll cook.

525
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,441
What kind of...

526
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,117
Mom? Hey, are you there?

527
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:36,827
Shit.

528
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,496
I just wanted to know

529
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:41,957
what kind of pasta you'd buy...

530
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,084
if you wanted to buy a nice pasta.

531
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,461
Like, the brand?

532
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,797
If you get this, can you
call me back right away?

533
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,842
This one is like bowties. Get that?

534
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,344
Do they have regular spaghetti?

535
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,138
Is that pasta the same way
as the others?

536
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,681
Is this some sex game?

537
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,016
No, we're actually talking about pasta.

538
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,684
- Hello!
- Yes.

539
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,353
Why don't you just put pasta
up her pussy?

540
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,313
Nicolette, seriously!

541
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,025
I remember
once enjoying a rigatoni dish.

542
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:12,780
So, I'll get that
and I'll get the bowties.

543
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,324
And there's shells.

544
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,853
I remember looking across the river...

545
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,856
at the unblinking lights
of Manhattan buildings.

546
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,025
Wondering who lived there.

547
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:53,362
X can be anything, any number,
that's what's crazy about X.

548
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,030
I just wanted to enter those spaces

549
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,865
and crawl up on the floor
and go to sleep.

550
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,368
X doesn't roll like that,
X can't be pinned down!

551
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,869
I was part of it now.

552
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,498
On the fifth floor, in a temporary
commercial apartment.

553
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,710
There was our castle, our fortress.

554
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,674
But outside the windows, I could
hear the hot sound of jackhammers...

555
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,592
taking the city apart.

556
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,014
In New York, neighborhoods change
as quickly as the weather.

557
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,850
Or maybe it's the other way around.

558
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,102
But I couldn't warn Meadow.

559
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,897
By the time I noticed it,
it was already too late.

560
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,901
Nate dropped a gram on Instagram.

561
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,069
That means a picture.

562
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,238
It looks like a really
stylish breath mint ad.

563
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,615
I know! Dave's a real shutterbug.

564
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:39,908
He made his own app.

565
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,036
Did these two drinks
earn me another free hot dog?

566
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,371
I would love
to get into the app business.

567
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,874
I think my dad met your mom
on the Internet.

568
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:47,984
Yeah, on a free dating website.

569
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,069
They didn't even pay.

570
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,420
Gross. But also I guess
it's pro forma now?

571
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,756
My dad's so strange.

572
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,425
I'm sure he's making her
convert to Catholicism.

573
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,052
Yeah, what's that about?

574
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,595
He's real Catholic now.

575
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,598
It's so boring, but it happened
when my mom got sick.

576
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,601
She was never that into it.
He's a geologist.

577
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,270
I know. I'd never met
a geologist before.

578
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:12,941
It's weird that someone who studies
rocks can be really into Jesus.

579
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,485
What did your mom do?

580
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,779
She was a special education teacher.

581
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,280
That's so nice.

582
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,448
She was really good at it.

583
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,450
I still don't like retarded jokes.

584
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,452
Do you want to see a picture of her?

585
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:27,732
She doesn't look like you,

586
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,959
but she has your expression, you know?

587
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:33,962
Hi.

588
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,131
Hello.

589
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,843
Hi. I don't know if you remember me,
we went to high school together.

590
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,136
Anna Wheeler?

591
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,596
Oh, yeah!

592
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,306
I was in the chorus of Anything Goes?

593
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,808
Holy shit, yeah!

594
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:46,975
What are you doing in the city?

595
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,143
Do you live here?

596
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,478
No, I'm in Tenafly.

597
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:50,771
My fiancé and I just went to see a show.

598
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,439
- Which one?
- Other Desert Cities.

599
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,591
Oh, that's a piece of shit.

600
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,818
And the girl who
replaced the lead is awful.

601
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,556
I used to run around with her.
Well, she was older, is older.

602
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,697
We loved it.

603
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,533
What are you guys drinking?
Let me buy you a drink.

604
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,700
You know, that's okay.

605
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,494
I just wanted to tell you because...

606
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,205
I never had the courage to do it
when I was actually in high school:

607
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,332
You really hurt my feelings.

608
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,376
What?

609
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,046
You don't remember?

610
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,549
What did I do?

611
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,385
That thing? "Yep, bitter."

612
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,913
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

613
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,180
I always liked you.

614
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,141
- You and your friend Abe?
- Abe!

615
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,560
You guys used to do this thing
where you would walk up to me...

616
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,188
touch my skin and then like taste it
and think for a minute, and then say:

617
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,983
"Yep, bitter." And then laugh.

618
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,526
Right! We did do that, didn't we?

619
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,652
We were weird.

620
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,738
I was standing right there,
every single time you did it.

621
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,240
It was really mean.

622
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,867
And I just wanted to say fuck you.

623
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:45,977
Whoa! Whoa.

624
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,996
The way you treated me
really messed me up for a long time.

625
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,831
Everyone is an asshole in high school!

626
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,875
You made a lot of people
feel bad, not just me.

627
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,294
I feel sorry for the 13-year-old
girl that was you...

628
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,946
but I don't feel sorry for you now.

629
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,046
We were 17.

630
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,049
If I was 13, I'd apologize to you,
but seeing as both of us are...

631
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,385
in our 20s, I don't feel the need.

632
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:04,621
- I just turned 30.
- Happy Birthday.

633
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,721
Thank you. You're welcome.

634
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:06,972
You're a bitch. Why?

635
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,017
You're the one that hung onto
this grudge for so fucking long!

636
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,186
I didn't even recognize you
when you walked up.

637
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,980
I don't say that to be mean,
that's the way it should be.

638
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,232
You're the same. Malevolent.

639
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,385
You were bitter.

640
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,636
That's probably why it hurt so much.

641
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,819
Because it was true.

642
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,572
I wish all bad things on you.

643
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,574
I don't on you because I don't care.

644
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:30,078
And neither should you!

645
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,754
That was so dramatic!
What a drama queen.

646
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,324
I can't believe she lives
in fucking Tenafly.

647
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,758
What is she, rich now?

648
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,927
How dare she talk to me
that way and be rich?

649
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,095
In junior high, this girl Tara Podwoski

650
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,931
used to pull my hair
and call me a cunt hunter.

651
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,583
I didn't do what that girl said.

652
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,934
I just wasn't brought up that way.

653
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,603
I should call Abe
and see if he remembers.

654
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,104
- Maybe do it later?
- Yeah.

655
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,008
I was so popular in high school,

656
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,234
but I didn't even try.

657
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,345
People just wanted
to be friends with me.

658
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,779
I didn't care about that stuff.

659
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:07,533
When someone told me I was popular,
I was like, "Really? Weird."

660
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,852
That's why you were popular.

661
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,953
Popular kids never care.
I cared too much.

662
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,206
Like if you want to know all the popular
kids' business, ask an unpopular kid.

663
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,525
They're the ones who know everything,

664
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,543
'cause they're the ones
who really pay attention.

665
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,362
I'm gonna shorten that, punch it up,

666
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,421
and turn it into a tweet.

667
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,883
Oh, no! Did I feed you too much liquor?

668
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,094
It's okay. I'll be okay.

669
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,804
Let's get you a cab.

670
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,973
Would it be okay if I slept over again?

671
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,879
I'm pretty sure college is supposed
to be more fun than I'm having.

672
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:36,963
Damn it.

673
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,772
- I'm kind of attractive.
- Ugh.

674
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,817
I might be up for another
drink. Is that crazy?

675
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,819
Goddamn it! What?

676
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,237
Fuck me!

677
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:46,572
What's happening?

678
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,725
I fucking don't believe this shit!

679
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,159
Motherfucking shit!

680
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,913
The goddamn locks are changed!

681
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,172
Hey, Kareem,
can we use your fire escape?

682
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,841
Yep.

683
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:14,308
Shit! I thought I left this window open!

684
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,101
I might have closed it.

685
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:17,811
Why?

686
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,480
I didn't want you to get robbed.

687
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,692
I can't believe
you fucking changed my locks!

688
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,487
Stavros saw a picture of her
kissing a musician.

689
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,282
Stavros is her boyfriend.

690
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,371
He told the super that Brooke
was living in a commercial space.

691
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,540
Is your place zoned commercial?

692
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,708
Yeah.

693
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,710
I hope he doesn't rat on you.

694
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,216
He's pulling out of the restaurant.

695
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,054
I hope Stavros doesn't rat out Kareem.

696
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,040
My partners are gonna bail.

697
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,557
They were only in
because Stavros was in.

698
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,559
They can go after my savings,
everything.

699
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:58,810
Oh, God.

700
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,896
Rich people will take any
excuse not to spend money.

701
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,465
You can just see it in their eyes.

702
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,940
They don't really
want to share life with you.

703
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,443
Rich people always give out
bad Halloween candy.

704
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,613
The contractors need another
$20,000 by Monday.

705
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,240
And the key fee payment,
that's $50,000... Oh, shit!

706
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,061
The refrigeration,
that's another $5,000!

707
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,787
I need whatever that equals by Monday.

708
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,080
That's $75,000.

709
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,289
Oh, my fucking God!

710
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,500
Isn't there someone else
you can ask to invest?

711
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,586
I already hit up every rich person
I knew the first time around.

712
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,922
This was well-thought through, Tracy.

713
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,491
I don't know,
it's such a good investment.

714
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,133
I'd put money in if I had it.

715
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:31,426
Do you secretly have money?

716
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,136
No, my mom never worked

717
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,347
and my dad was always
kind of mad at her for that.

718
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,016
But my parents' divorce
was way easier than this.

719
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,144
That's because they stopped
caring about life just entirely.

720
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,688
That's not the same thing.

721
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,941
My mom died, so don't even
start with me about your pain.

722
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,275
My uncle died.

723
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,485
Shut up, Ruth.

724
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,614
- I need some answers.
- I'm coming.

725
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,768
I'm gonna be worse off now

726
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,787
than I was before I started
trying to achieve stuff.

727
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,289
I know what it is to want things.

728
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,291
No, you don't.

729
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,446
You can't really know
what it is to want things

730
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,338
until you're at least 30.

731
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,534
And then, with each passing year,

732
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:12,843
it gets bigger...

733
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,139
because the want is more
and the possibility is less.

734
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:21,143
Like how each passing year
of your life seems faster...

735
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,479
because it's a smaller portion
of your total life.

736
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,023
Like that. But in reverse.

737
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,652
Everything becomes pure want.

738
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,364
Okay, Brooke, I'm ready.

739
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,106
Spirit says you have to seek out

740
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,582
an old friend.

741
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,833
Who?

742
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,170
Somebody who hurt you.

743
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,921
Just tell me exactly what to do.

744
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,176
Spirit says something about...

745
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
fabric?

746
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,557
It's your friend Mamie-Claire.
The fabric is the t-shirts.

747
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:03,602
Yes. And I see flowers.

748
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,020
Hard-looking flowers.

749
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,230
Please, Tracy!

750
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,691
Mamie-Claire is my enemy.

751
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,194
You have unfinished business
with this woman.

752
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,863
No, no, no, no. It's finished.
Tell Spirit it's finished.

753
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,281
What happened with Mamie-Claire?

754
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,600
She totally screwed Brooke over.

755
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,451
She married her fiancé
and stole her idea.

756
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,286
I never looked back.

757
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:23,413
Yeah, I'm seeing this. But...

758
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:24,915
Oh, I'm seeing trees.

759
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,317
You said she lives in Connecticut.

760
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,959
There are trees in Connecticut.

761
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,712
Well, to be fair, there are trees
pretty much everywhere.

762
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,047
You have to listen to Spirit.

763
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,590
Mamie-Claire can give you the money.

764
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,217
Hi-ho Greenwich!

765
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,162
Really? Can we get some confirmation?

766
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,888
Is Spirit sure of this?

767
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,932
Yeah. Look, the young one is right.

768
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,126
She's not that young!

769
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,726
Ten, ten to twelve years younger.

770
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,561
We're contemporaries, okay?

771
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:50,565
You must seek out this Mamie-Claire.

772
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,901
I'm so annoyed by Spirit.

773
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:57,239
The path isn't against you.
It's just the path.

774
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,559
Right. I don't wanna be petty.

775
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,827
I just wasn't brought up that way.

776
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:05,914
She's my nemesis, but she does owe me.

777
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,457
This has been heavy on you.

778
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,028
And sometimes you have to go back...

779
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,587
in order to go front.

780
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,658
Fuck this parade.
I'm going to Greenwich.

781
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:17,259
We're going.

782
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,594
You ready for this, squirt?
It's gonna get ugly.

783
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,263
- I'm ready.
- Great.

784
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,514
How do we get there?

785
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,099
I really don't like to leave the city.

786
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,935
You're gonna want to take
the Hutch to the Merritt.

787
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,020
I'll bet Dylan is still in love with me.

788
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,983
Marrying Mamie-Claire is like buying
a cashmere sweater from Old Navy.

789
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,776
Even if he's not,
this is a great investment.

790
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,529
And don't forget, she still owes you.

791
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:38,890
Yeah, it's win-win.

792
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,615
Because I'm sure he still loves me.

793
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:43,201
I'm not driving you to Connecticut
to break up a marriage.

794
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,871
I should be in my room
reading Nicomachean Ethics.

795
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,998
- Oh, calm down, rich boy.
- I'm not rich!

796
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,666
Yes, you are. You have a car.

797
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,210
No, I'm not. My dad is a mechanic.

798
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,629
He and my uncle have a body shop.

799
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,632
I have this car because it was
something he could give me.

800
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,885
Sorry. I think I offended
your boyfriend.

801
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,344
He's not her boyfriend. He's mine.

802
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:02,512
Why are you here?

803
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,638
Because Tracy made Tony drive you.

804
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,181
But why did you come?

805
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,392
I had a bad experience
with adultery before.

806
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,853
My last boyfriend committed adultery
when we were together...

807
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,897
and I just don't like to let
my boyfriends get too far.

808
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,425
Adultery? Why the fuck does it matter?

809
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,650
You're all 18.

810
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,737
Where is this old person
morality coming from?

811
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,364
There's no cheating when you're 18.

812
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:24,326
You should all be touching
each other all the time.

813
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,415
Do you ever get that feeling
when you're on a car trip...

814
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,876
that you never want to get
where you're going?

815
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:35,086
That you never want it to end?

816
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,289
Nicolette!

817
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,349
You fuckin' scared the shit out of me!

818
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:50,503
Sweetie, I... It feels nice.

819
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:53,855
I mean, I'm driving, I can't...
I can't right now.

820
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,909
You should be with him,
not that goth housewife.

821
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,786
No. He knew me and he chose her.

822
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,146
Only because you let him.

823
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,872
You have to chase down
the things that you want.

824
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,208
I was just gonna let it go.

825
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,544
Sometimes I don't know if you're
a Zen master or a sociopath.

826
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,129
I'm just normal.

827
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,299
Can you stay on the neck?

828
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:22,592
Like that?

829
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,387
I'll give him a backrub
he won't soon forget.

830
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,889
See, you don't give a shit, do you?

831
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,642
I'm so glad you're on my team.

832
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,398
The very things that had worked
so well for Meadow, up until then...

833
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,775
had started turning and fading.

834
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:43,154
She had no other skills,
no other way of dealing with the world.

835
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,949
In one instant her behaviors
turned from charming

836
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,326
to borderline hysteric.

837
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,996
People could feel her failure coming.

838
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,748
She smelled of something rotten.

839
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,502
Her youth had died and she was
dragging around the decaying carcass.

840
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,130
I had somehow become the pallbearer.

841
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,674
I'm trying to find
Mamie-Claire's address.

842
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,592
Does she have a different last name?

843
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,928
I have a visual memory of it.
It's kind of photographic.

844
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,179
Oh, you've been here?

845
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,249
Well, I kind of stalked them once.

846
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,100
I was so pissed.

847
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,647
Yep. This is it.

848
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,052
Oh, we're all going?

849
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,695
Okay, we look crazy,
but maybe that's good.

850
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,204
Can I help you?

851
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,708
Hi, yes, I was wondering,
is Mamie-Claire or Dylan in?

852
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,710
- I'm an old friend.
- Wrong house.

853
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,962
Oh. Which is their house?

854
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,797
I don't come here, I live in New York.

855
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,967
I'll take you there.

856
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,848
You guys just wait there.

857
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,718
Harold?

858
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:03,860
What do you think
I was doing last night?

859
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,528
I don't know, Harold.
Watching kiddie porn?

860
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:08,740
I was listening to you and your husband
shout, and I was not sleeping.

861
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,909
So sorry we interrupted
your kiddie porn.

862
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm a pediatrician.

863
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:13,411
Obviously.

864
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,498
Next time I hear decibel levels
like that, I'm calling the cops.

865
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,541
That is a promise.

866
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,111
This is the house.

867
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,237
Hello!

868
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,172
What are you doing here?
Who are these people?

869
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,425
Tracy's mom is marrying my dad,
Tony drove, Nicolette is jealous.

870
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,511
- Hi, I'm Tracy.
- Hi, Mamie-Claire.

871
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,054
- Nicolette.
- Mamie-Claire.

872
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,347
I'm Tony.

873
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,765
Wait, don't tell me, Mamie-Claire.

874
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,351
I thought we weren't speaking.

875
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,519
Right, I want to change that.

876
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,522
And I have something that I really need
to talk to you and Dylan about.

877
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,023
- Dylan's not here.
- Where is he?

878
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,275
He volunteers at a retirement community.

879
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,678
I'm in the middle of something

880
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,695
that's this thing we do.
It's like a party.

881
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:48,806
That's okay.

882
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,448
It's not for you to say okay...

883
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:51,783
it's for me to say okay.

884
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:52,951
We'll wait in the car.

885
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,077
No, that's weird.

886
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:55,578
People wait in cars.

887
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,123
You and your posse
can hang out in the kitchen.

888
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,290
Great!

889
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,363
Faulkner uses language

890
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:07,549
the way the Modernist painters
were using paint.

891
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:11,970
Exploring the reality of words,
or paint itself.

892
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,889
Only Faulkner was interested
in how this happens...

893
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,725
while his characters
are actually trying to communicate.

894
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,395
Holy shit, these pregnant women
are super smart.

895
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,731
I don't know if you're hungry, but
this is for if you're hungry.

896
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:24,983
This place is amazing.

897
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,151
Thank you.

898
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,402
It's really fucking nice.

899
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,611
Thank you.

900
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,823
Would it be okay if we sat
in on your discussion?

901
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,908
Uh, yeah, I guess.

902
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:36,077
This week's book
is Faulkner's The Hamlet.

903
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:39,414
Followed by a kind of junky biography
of Derrida, but it's fun.

904
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:40,790
- Tight.
- Awesome.

905
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,292
Look at this.

906
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,837
Apparently, she got recruited
by Tufts for crew...

907
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,839
and then went but never did it.

908
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:51,509
I mean, that's the kind of person
she is, just sly and shitty.

909
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,262
I would do that if I could.
I wasn't good at sports.

910
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,681
Yeah, I would too,
but it wouldn't be like my character.

911
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,349
It would just be something I did.

912
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,476
When does that become the same thing?

913
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,145
I don't know.

914
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:05,148
You look amazing.

915
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,524
Why are all these kids with you?

916
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,484
They aren't kids.
If they're kids, we are.

917
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,445
I'm an associate and her almost-sister.

918
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,764
I really need to talk to you.

919
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,516
Okay, how long do you think
you'll need with me, because...

920
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,851
How long do you think Dylan will be
giving back at the old folks' home?

921
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,118
I'd also like to talk with him.

922
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,270
We're both very busy.

923
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,495
I have an appointment after this.

924
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,023
Oh, come on,
Mamie-Claire, that's stupid.

925
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,041
- You aren't really busy.
- Yes, I am!

926
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:26,211
Remember this truth,
it is only people who don't have jobs...

927
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,505
and don't have anything to do,
that are always fucking busy.

928
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,840
Like, what are you doing?

929
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,675
We started a community farm.
We have goats.

930
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,703
Goats are more sustainable.
They're smaller.

931
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,247
- Than what?
- Cows.

932
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,373
Mamie-Claire? People are leaving.

933
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:38,582
Excuse me, I have to see my guests out.

934
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,750
I want to say goodbye to Marcy.

935
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,876
Do you have a crush on Marcy now?

936
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,310
She's seven months pregnant.

937
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,728
Why do you know that?

938
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,147
Bye, Marcy.

939
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:47,315
Bye, Tony.

940
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,483
See you guys.

941
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,386
Mamie-Claire, can me and Nicolette

942
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,362
- play with your chess set?
- Yes.

943
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:53,472
Bye, Tony.

944
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:54,572
Bye, Nadia.

945
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,159
Everything okay, Karen?

946
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:59,937
Yes, I'm just waiting for my husband.

947
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,663
He's late to pick me up.

948
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,914
You want to play chess with us?

949
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,207
You have to teach me!

950
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,375
No, he'll be here any minute.

951
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,752
Sorry, I got started
on the wrong foot there.

952
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,880
I meant to say I've been
missing you as a friend and...

953
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,007
She has a very exciting
business opportunity for you.

954
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,843
And I wanted to bring it to you
and Dylan as a peace offering.

955
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,679
I really think you're gonna
want to hear about this.

956
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,290
The last time I saw you,
you were hiding in the bushes.

957
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,625
And then you started incoherently
yelling at me and my husband...

958
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,184
about how we had ruined your life.

959
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,687
And the time before that,
you were throwing up at my wedding.

960
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:28,731
Which is why I'm bringing you
this exciting business opportunity!

961
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:29,941
When did you take my bishop?

962
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:32,511
I would like to offer you a share
in a restaurant I'm starting.

963
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,611
Why?

964
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:35,905
Because it's all set up and ready to go.

965
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:38,017
And I already have an ability
to draw a crowd,

966
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,201
and it's just gonna be perfect!

967
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,577
You'll love it. So will Dylan.

968
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,954
There are lots of other investors.

969
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:45,581
But not so many that it would
dilute your investment.

970
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,125
So why are you here?

971
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:49,585
Well, there was a slight snafu
with one of our people...

972
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,780
which allowed a very
coveted spot to open up,

973
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,089
which I'm offering only to you guys.

974
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,451
It's not really a good time for me
to get involved with business.

975
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,093
- Why?
- I'm trying to have a baby.

976
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,245
You'll never regret it.

977
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,345
Thank you, Karen.

978
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,539
It's just money.

979
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,056
You don't have to do any of the work.

980
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,626
You get the glory, and the profit...

981
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,794
and the satisfaction of being
involved with something awesome.

982
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,379
I don't think Dylan will buy into it.

983
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,731
We recently lost money
purchasing taxi cab medallions.

984
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,942
I don't mean to overstep my bounds here,
but I think that you might be wrong.

985
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,110
When is he coming back?

986
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,611
I really need to focus
on having children.

987
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,556
This is not part of
what I need to focus on.

988
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,490
No. Just... Can I just say no?

989
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,492
No, you cannot "just say no." Why not?

990
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,994
I don't need a why.

991
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:24,954
This money would mean nothing to you.

992
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,249
Look at all this shit, this house,
that patio furniture.

993
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,293
You could spare it,
you wouldn't even miss it.

994
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:31,919
And it really would make a profit.

995
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,463
No. You can't make me.

996
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,798
Yes, I can because you owe me!

997
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:37,008
Um, Brooke...

998
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,259
I don't owe you.

999
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,595
For Dylan, because that was just skanky.

1000
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:42,331
But really for the t-shirts.

1001
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,766
You stole my t-shirt idea
and you know it.

1002
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,001
I did not steal your idea.

1003
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,643
It was my idea and you
were there when I had it.

1004
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,811
No!

1005
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,256
That is so wrong.

1006
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:53,858
I remember it like the minute I said,
"What if these flowers were, like, tough?"

1007
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,386
And then we started riffing about it.

1008
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:56,486
But I said it first!

1009
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,554
No, you didn't.

1010
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:00,865
You are so annoying
when you get calm voice!

1011
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,496
Are those my fucking cats?

1012
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:10,333
They're mine. I paid for their
cat surgery, so they're mine.

1013
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,667
Did my cats die and you didn't tell me?

1014
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:12,877
Are those replacement cats?

1015
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,838
No! They're the same goddamn cats!

1016
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,469
If you do that,
your knight is vulnerable.

1017
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:22,804
What?

1018
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,847
Oh, thanks.

1019
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,641
You took your finger off it,
you made the move.

1020
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:27,793
I took my finger off it?

1021
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:28,976
Who am I playing here, Deep Blue?

1022
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,145
Karen, come inside.
Have a glass of wine.

1023
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,563
Oh, no, I'm fine.

1024
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,232
He'll be here.

1025
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,360
So you deny it? That you profited
from her idea that you stole?

1026
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:38,762
No, I don't deny it. She's right.

1027
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:39,987
The t-shirts were her idea.

1028
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,197
Then why did you just say that?

1029
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,658
I like making her mad. It's so easy.

1030
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:45,326
You took her idea.
That's not just, Mamie-Claire.

1031
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,994
No, I tried to include her.

1032
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,747
I set up a meeting with some people
and she never showed up.

1033
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:52,318
And then she stopped speaking to me
when me and Dylan got married...

1034
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,335
so I figured I could just go do it.

1035
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:55,487
So it's her fault?

1036
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,339
No. She is right that I stole
a lot of her life ideas.

1037
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,675
She really is more creative than I am.

1038
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,119
But she never would have used them.

1039
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,579
She has no follow through.

1040
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,747
So it's no one's fault.

1041
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:05,847
Obviously. That's always true.

1042
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,224
You know, the restaurant
is going to be really great.

1043
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:10,127
She's following through with that.

1044
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:11,853
If she's allowed to.

1045
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,690
- Check.
- Wait.

1046
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:17,024
What? No, it isn't.

1047
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,234
Check.

1048
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:22,613
I don't want to play anymore.

1049
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:23,781
Oh, come on.

1050
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:24,949
I just don't feel like
playing right now.

1051
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,201
You can't just quit
right before I'm about to win.

1052
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,537
I'm just not in the mood.
People can be not in the mood.

1053
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:31,414
I couldn't be your mother, thank God.

1054
00:46:31,582 --> 00:46:32,941
What are you, 30? We're 18.

1055
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,625
You could. Twelve year olds
can have kids.

1056
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,127
- Fuck you!
- Mamie-Claire.

1057
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,753
Sorry, Karen.

1058
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,595
Hey, Dad. I can't really talk right now.

1059
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,373
- Brooke...
- I'll call you tomorrow,

1060
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:48,723
I'm in the middle of something.

1061
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,141
Yeah, I know you probably don't care...

1062
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,851
I care about things.

1063
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,269
But I'm not getting married.

1064
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:54,687
Oh, really?

1065
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,840
No. We called it off last night.

1066
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,384
It's for the best.
I don't really know her.

1067
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:59,635
Yeah.

1068
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,178
She wasn't committed
to the church, either.

1069
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:02,945
I think that was all forced.

1070
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,739
Sure, sure.

1071
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:06,365
You okay?

1072
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,159
Yes, I just...

1073
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,828
You're really not doing it?

1074
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,956
I thought you guys
were really symbiotic.

1075
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:16,777
Wasn't it a web algorithm
that got you together?

1076
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,503
She seems amazing.

1077
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,505
You never even met Stevie.

1078
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:23,216
Through you, I met her!

1079
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:27,887
Come on, Dad, I don't know.
Don't just bail.

1080
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,500
That's what the Cardinases always do,

1081
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,851
move on to something else.

1082
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,437
Hang in there!

1083
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:39,315
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're so invested in this.

1084
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:42,026
Believe me, it's for the best.

1085
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,181
I have to go,

1086
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,282
I have a really important
business meeting.

1087
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,326
I love you.

1088
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:54,038
We can do Thanksgiving at my house if
you want, since there won't be a wedding.

1089
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:59,126
No, I'll probably just end up doing
something depressing, but young.

1090
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,836
Home is only a bus ride away.

1091
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,881
Is it? Just kidding, it is.

1092
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,678
So, what does this make me and Tracy?

1093
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,304
Who's Tracy?

1094
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:12,390
Never mind.

1095
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,476
Oh, right, her daughter.

1096
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,478
Nothing, I guess.

1097
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:27,071
Hello.

1098
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,739
Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak.

1099
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:30,533
Are you stalking me?

1100
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,701
I left my tote in here.

1101
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,286
I need my migraine pills.

1102
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:34,704
Let me have a sip.

1103
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,247
How much longer
do you think we'll be here?

1104
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:38,332
I don't know, however long it takes.

1105
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,834
After Dylan comes home, maybe.

1106
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,461
What are you really trying
to accomplish here?

1107
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,672
I'm enjoying this really stylish house.

1108
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,633
When you live in suburbia, you have
to really like being in your house.

1109
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,077
That's not what I...

1110
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,469
What're you doing with this whole thing?

1111
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,039
I want Brooke to get her restaurant.

1112
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,222
I'm helping out.

1113
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,683
I read your story, by the way.

1114
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:57,935
Brooke is the woman in your piece.

1115
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:00,855
You're collecting material.

1116
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,049
Did you like it?

1117
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:03,274
That's not what we're talking about.

1118
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:04,551
Why are you here?

1119
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,277
You needed a ride. You forced me.

1120
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:09,030
How does it feel to be forced?

1121
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,281
Feels uncomfortable.

1122
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,200
And how do you feel now?

1123
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:16,579
Still uncomfortable.

1124
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:20,916
- This is not what I want.
- It is what you want...

1125
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,127
but it makes you feel
like a bad person to want it.

1126
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,920
You're acting really crazy.
I don't like this.

1127
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,714
Why can't you say you like my story?

1128
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,342
I don't know! I'm jealous!

1129
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,887
It's better than mine. Sheesh!

1130
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:35,749
You want other people
to do the things you can't

1131
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:36,891
so you can blame them.

1132
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,601
You used to be so nice!

1133
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,729
I'm the same. I'm just the same
in another direction now.

1134
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,108
Can I have my glasses back?

1135
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,533
Tony, you're more
sophisticated than this!

1136
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,542
Dylan, baby, you're home!

1137
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,253
You know, I don't like it when
you try to force affection onto me.

1138
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:07,421
I'm just trying to hug you.

1139
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:08,699
Do you have to put your face
so close to mine?

1140
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:09,783
It's nice.

1141
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,051
You know how upset I get
when I visit the home.

1142
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,387
I want you to share it with me.

1143
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,583
Rosella and Lorene may not even be alive

1144
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:18,891
the next time I'm there. Okay?

1145
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:22,269
Just keep your face a little away
while I process that.

1146
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:23,396
Fine.

1147
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:26,732
Who are all these people?

1148
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,136
- I wondered if I could have some water.
- Of course, Karen.

1149
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,362
Oh, hi, Karen. I don't mean you.

1150
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,015
Tony. Nice to meet you.
Beautiful house, sir.

1151
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,099
Thank you.

1152
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,350
Have you seen a girl about this high?

1153
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,993
- That's my girlfriend.
- No, there's more of you?

1154
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:41,455
- I'm Tracy.
- Oh, Dylan. Tracy is a tight name.

1155
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,609
It's a name that totally is a name,

1156
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,751
but I don't know anyone
actually named Tracy.

1157
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:48,030
I am actually named Tracy.

1158
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,130
Tracy!

1159
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,011
Brooke!

1160
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,040
Hey, Dylan.

1161
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,250
- Has anyone seen Nicolette?
- Forget about Nicolette for a second.

1162
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,600
Stop trying to seduce me.

1163
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,687
Thanks. I got a little parched.
I think I'm sitting by a heating duct.

1164
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:07,481
- Stay here. Have a glass of wine.
- No. Ted really should be here soon.

1165
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,108
- Karen!
- Can I have a snack?

1166
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,317
Stress makes me hungry.

1167
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:14,488
- Brooke, I haven't seen you in a second.
- I know, right?

1168
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:15,641
What brings you to the burbs?

1169
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:17,809
- We were...
- Brooke needs money.

1170
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,561
No, I don't need money. I come
to you with an opportunity.

1171
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,328
I told her about the taxi medallions.

1172
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,706
Let me make you a drink.
What's the opportunity?

1173
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,942
- It's a good one.
- We're having dinner at the Baskins.

1174
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,111
So I'm sorry to say it,
but you guys will have to leave now.

1175
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,237
- Can I have this Chipwich?
- Yes.

1176
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,505
- Marty and Jiselle can wait.
- Didn't you park over at Harold's?

1177
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,091
- How do you know Harold?
- They don't.

1178
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,761
She's an old friend.
She can stay over if she wants.

1179
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,288
We have the room for you
and your students.

1180
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:40,556
They're not her students.
It's much weirder than that.

1181
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,793
- They're my friends.
- Always running with the young crowd.

1182
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:45,170
- She's starting a restaurant.
- I can't wait to tell you about it.

1183
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,396
Dylan, let's not do this.
She's already lost her shit once.

1184
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:49,633
- What's the restaurant?
- Brooke, this is uncomfortable.

1185
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:52,026
- Dylan doesn't want to do this.
- You don't know what I want.

1186
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:54,779
I know you see me a certain way,
but I'm not just some square.

1187
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,573
I saw Nirvana live
and this is way before Nevermind.

1188
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,949
You seem really cool to me.

1189
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:02,036
I DJ'ed at my college radio station,
the 2:00 am slot.

1190
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:04,705
We played Mudhoney, Superchunk,
Trip Shakespeare, I mean...

1191
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:07,859
No one wants to hear about your glory
days in college radio, Dylan. Okay?

1192
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:08,944
I do.

1193
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,294
I play this part for you.

1194
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:12,379
I play the guy wearing the fleece...

1195
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,424
but I'm not just some asshole
bankrolling your fitness goals.

1196
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:16,884
I've gotten really into triathlons.

1197
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,036
Brooke teaches cycling.

1198
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:19,220
So cool.

1199
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,597
No, I only like cycling when it's
combined with running and swimming.

1200
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:22,765
Why did you think of us?

1201
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:23,891
Because we owe her.

1202
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,309
Because you're into cool things.

1203
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,978
We are. You guys want to
smoke some weed? Huh?

1204
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,730
I have some frozen weed.

1205
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,774
MC, where's that weed Jason gave us?

1206
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:33,734
You've just said "weed" like 15 times.

1207
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,110
Did that kid take my weed?

1208
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,779
No! No one's touched it.

1209
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:38,989
It should be next to the Chipwiches.

1210
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:43,118
Are you sick?

1211
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:44,245
No, I'm healthy.

1212
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,789
Don't shut me out. You know
how hard that is for me.

1213
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:48,150
You sound like you're eating something.

1214
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,834
I have a Chipwich for you.

1215
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,293
You brought me a Chipwich?

1216
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:52,753
I can get you another one.

1217
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:54,505
Leave me alone!

1218
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:57,633
It was clear that the thing that Meadow
wanted most in the world...

1219
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,177
the thing that she wanted
to define her...

1220
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:02,972
to give her a place
to put her time and talents,

1221
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,265
her everything...

1222
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:07,977
the restaurant, it was clear
that it would never happen.

1223
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:11,939
The most surprising thing was that
Meadow was actually surprised by it.

1224
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:14,775
She could see the whole world
with painful accuracy...

1225
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,778
but couldn't see herself or her fate.

1226
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:19,613
And because I was in love with her...

1227
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,116
I decided I couldn't see it either.

1228
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:23,826
I'm starting a restaurant.

1229
00:53:23,994 --> 00:53:25,119
Oh, I'm an attorney.

1230
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,496
That's awesome for you.
I never went to college.

1231
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:29,191
That doesn't have to be
a permanent state.

1232
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,499
You aren't an amputee.

1233
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:31,667
I know that.

1234
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:32,835
You can still go to college.

1235
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,379
We'll get lifted and you'll
tell us about this venture.

1236
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:37,298
Do any of you kids know
how to make an apple bong?

1237
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:38,742
No one knows how to make an apple bong.

1238
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:40,509
- I do.
- Did you take my herb?

1239
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,677
- No.
- I'll get you an apple.

1240
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,554
The restaurant
is really going to be amazing.

1241
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:46,056
Right. Let's hear your pitch. Pitch us.

1242
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,474
- What?
- That's what you do.

1243
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,377
If someone wants something, they pitch.

1244
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,812
Come, pitch us on our media stage.

1245
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,148
Your media stage?

1246
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:56,134
We just ran Apocalypto on Blu-ray.

1247
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,569
Stunning. Stunning.

1248
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:00,237
I've gotten very into vinyl.

1249
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,032
I'm into compressed MP3s. Just joking.

1250
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,327
I've got a great early Mother Love Bone EP
that would be perfect for this occasion.

1251
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,329
Records are so warm.

1252
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,331
What are you doing?

1253
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,920
I just want you to know
that I really love Dylan.

1254
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,922
I love his blond hair and his beard.

1255
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,882
I know that you only
loved him for his money.

1256
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,884
But I love him as a person.

1257
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,386
And I also love him for his money,
but not in that order.

1258
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:26,331
I'm committed to being a happier person.

1259
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,514
Do you understand?

1260
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,239
Um, well...

1261
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:49,453
It's a restaurant, but also
where you, like, cut hair.

1262
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:51,372
Can I start over?

1263
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:54,249
Of course. We're old friends.

1264
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,417
Okay, great.

1265
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:00,881
I was, that was...

1266
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:02,925
pretend rewind. Like...

1267
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:10,933
It would have...

1268
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:15,729
big heavy tables and chairs.

1269
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,885
Um...

1270
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,944
It would feel like the home

1271
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,655
everyone wishes they had been raised in.

1272
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:36,083
No one who comes there will want
to take out their cellphones...

1273
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:37,251
because it won't feel that way.

1274
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:41,255
It would be like taking your cellphone
out in the woods. Totally wrong.

1275
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:42,631
It's so rude, I concur.

1276
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,675
Yeah. It will always
feel like fall inside.

1277
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:48,095
Even on hot summer nights
with all the windows open.

1278
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:51,306
Loaves of bread
that people tear off pieces.

1279
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,585
It would be the kind of place
where at 2:00 am,

1280
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:55,352
the chef and the waitstaff...

1281
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,147
would come out and eat something simple
they had fixed themselves...

1282
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,190
with the remaining guests.

1283
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,817
And open a bottle of good wine.

1284
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:03,318
It would be the best of capitalism.

1285
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,863
What politicians pretend they mean
when they say small business.

1286
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:08,949
We would resist doing too many pieces
in the Times and stuff...

1287
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,368
because we would want it to stay honest.

1288
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,288
They would want us to expand
and open another one...

1289
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,956
and maybe eventually we would.

1290
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,776
But we wouldn't try
to re-create the first one.

1291
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:20,044
It would be a totally new thing.

1292
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,670
And if I ever had kids...

1293
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,799
they would walk there after school
and do their homework in a corner table.

1294
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:28,844
They would grow up around
all these wonderful adults.

1295
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:30,372
Chefs and actors who are waiters.

1296
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:32,639
It'd be a big funny family
and they'd never be lonely.

1297
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,642
This could all be something
you guys share in.

1298
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,879
You'd be their auntie and uncle,

1299
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:40,731
part of the life and food.

1300
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:43,259
Eventually I'd train someone
younger than myself

1301
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,485
to run the day to day...

1302
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:48,322
so I could go up to Maine
with my family in the summer.

1303
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,324
And have the kids dive for lobsters.

1304
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,937
And everyone would be
so warm and happy inside

1305
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:55,662
knowing that in their lives...

1306
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,400
they had participated in something

1307
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,667
that was only good.

1308
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,171
Wow.

1309
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:05,422
Yeah.

1310
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:31,865
You know...

1311
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:35,536
I lived in the city for many years.

1312
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:38,705
Before I started at Goldman, I was...

1313
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:42,277
I was teaching at Baruch

1314
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,961
and I lived in an East Village walk-up.

1315
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:50,592
I was the people,
people make television shows about.

1316
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:54,263
It was quite beautiful.

1317
00:57:58,143 --> 00:57:59,794
This is very fucking interesting!

1318
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:00,936
Really?

1319
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,437
So, are you both doing it?

1320
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:03,605
No, but we're sisters and...

1321
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:04,773
Tracy is spiritual guidance

1322
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,108
- and waitress.
- Mmm.

1323
00:58:06,276 --> 00:58:08,110
Really? I wasn't sure
you'd heard me those times.

1324
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:09,486
I hear everything.

1325
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,321
And how much do you need?

1326
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:15,492
It's $200,000, but I calculated
and we need $42,500 by Monday.

1327
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,077
For refrigeration.

1328
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,662
42.5 stacks, huh?

1329
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,455
- What are stacks?
- A thousand.

1330
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:21,957
I thought stacks meant a hundred.

1331
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,359
I'm pretty sure a stack is a thousand.

1332
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,585
I thought a dime was a thousand.

1333
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:26,503
Never mind. You'd do that?

1334
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,130
I want to help you.

1335
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,007
That's Ted. Bye, everyone.

1336
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:31,466
Bye, Karen!

1337
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,093
Good luck with your restaurant.

1338
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:34,204
Thank you!

1339
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,680
Dylan, this is really something
for us to talk about privately.

1340
00:58:36,848 --> 00:58:38,682
Or maybe with Dr. Turkowitz.

1341
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,642
We need fresh drinks.

1342
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,479
Um, Mamie-Claire,
can you come here please?

1343
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:45,772
Can it wait, Karen?

1344
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,149
No.

1345
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:50,944
It's not Ted.

1346
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:52,112
Harold.

1347
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,993
Your guests' car
is blocking my driveway.

1348
00:58:58,745 --> 00:58:59,854
Could the weed be in the garage freezer?

1349
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:00,954
I don't know.

1350
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,873
- Can you check?
- No!

1351
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,126
I'm blowing Harold. Just kidding.

1352
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:07,961
I can't remember the last time
I was over here.

1353
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:10,631
I don't think you've ever
been over here, Harold.

1354
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:13,800
No, when you first moved here,
I came for a stilted barbecue.

1355
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,802
That was when we made an effort.

1356
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,306
Well, invite me in now.
I want a house tour.

1357
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:25,687
You are such a Swiss
Army knife kind of guy.

1358
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:29,524
I have to be a better loser.
I really love Nicolette.

1359
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,818
She's angry about the chess game?

1360
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,028
Yeah, I think so.

1361
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,323
I'm mostly in touch
with my feminine side, but...

1362
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,492
then I guess not, though, because...

1363
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,202
I don't understand her right now.

1364
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:44,081
Did you... Did you
want to be with me ever?

1365
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:45,332
I don't want to get into this.

1366
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,335
No, I'm not going to kiss you.
Just a question.

1367
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:49,503
Yeah.

1368
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:52,422
I liked you, but...

1369
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,757
I love Nicolette.

1370
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,842
And honestly,
I just never saw you that way.

1371
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,010
Why?

1372
00:59:57,178 --> 00:59:58,178
You seemed...

1373
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:03,225
I need someone I can love.
Not keep up with.

1374
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,231
Sometimes I really just think I'm smarter
and better than everyone else.

1375
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:12,192
Not necessarily with...

1376
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:13,428
math or science

1377
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:15,946
or whether something
is east or west, but...

1378
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:18,115
pretty much with everything else.

1379
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,575
And if I could figure out my look...

1380
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:23,578
I'd be the most beautiful woman
in the world too.

1381
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:25,372
Sometimes I think I'm a genius...

1382
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:27,483
and I wish I could just
fast-forward my life

1383
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:30,377
to the part where everyone knows it.

1384
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:43,015
I have to say, I'm impressed, Brooke.

1385
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,501
It takes a lot of moxie
to start a restaurant.

1386
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:46,669
Thanks.

1387
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,228
You're doing it, babe.

1388
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:52,441
You're out there doing something
besides amassing and hoarding money.

1389
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,402
If I could figure out how to amass
and hoard money, I'd do it.

1390
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,529
Well, you could have married
me or a dozen other guys...

1391
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,906
but you wanted to be your own person.

1392
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,601
Yeah, no, I'm over that now.

1393
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:05,037
You're funny 'cause
you don't know you're funny.

1394
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:06,246
I know I'm funny.

1395
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:07,941
There's nothing
I don't know about myself.

1396
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,083
That's why I can't do therapy.

1397
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,545
MC and I see a woman in New Haven.

1398
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,672
Oh, you guys see a therapist?

1399
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,342
She's totally on my side.

1400
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:22,846
She basically thinks Mamie-Claire
is holding me back...

1401
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,182
and I should just leave her.

1402
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,309
Your couple's therapist said that?

1403
01:01:27,477 --> 01:01:29,227
In so many words.

1404
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,688
But Mamie-Claire said you guys
are trying to have kids.

1405
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:35,134
We've talked about it,
but we've also talked about breaking up.

1406
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,234
Oh...

1407
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,028
I'm so sorry.

1408
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:39,196
No.

1409
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:40,697
No, it's...

1410
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:42,574
it's liberating.

1411
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,535
I feel great.

1412
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:46,745
Yay!

1413
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:50,290
I miss New York, man.

1414
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,125
I miss you.

1415
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:56,755
I look you up periodically
on the Internet.

1416
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:00,326
Oh, you look hot as hell
in those party pictures.

1417
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:02,886
Which parties? Because sometimes
I look like I have fat arms.

1418
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:04,622
I like fat arms.

1419
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,014
Oh...

1420
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,225
I'm going to help you
with this restaurant.

1421
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,935
Thank you!

1422
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:15,065
Mmm.

1423
01:02:20,113 --> 01:02:21,613
Here's what I'm gonna do for you.

1424
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,825
We'll take my 43 stacks or dimes...

1425
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:28,495
and pay back the other investors
whatever they're in for thus far.

1426
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,622
You got a space already? A lease?

1427
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,191
We'll put it up for rent immediately.

1428
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,458
It, uh, cool neighborhood?

1429
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:34,960
Williamsburg?

1430
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:36,279
Oh, come on, the coolest.

1431
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,629
We'll turn it over, no problem.

1432
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:39,673
Because, let's face it.

1433
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:41,242
Having a restaurant,

1434
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:45,804
it's like having a kid
with a drug problem.

1435
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:48,181
It's just...

1436
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,725
It's really draining.

1437
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:54,563
You're giving me money
to not start a restaurant?

1438
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,440
First of all, I am saving you.

1439
01:02:56,607 --> 01:03:00,235
If you started the restaurant, you would
be back here in a year asking for...

1440
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:01,736
five times this.

1441
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,196
Not if it was successful.

1442
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:07,367
What are the odds?

1443
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,202
You know...

1444
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:14,166
I'd love to see your life in the city.

1445
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,376
We should get a drink. Or...

1446
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:20,073
I like to drink.

1447
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:21,173
Mmm.

1448
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:24,676
Whatever you're doing, it's working.

1449
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:26,178
No.

1450
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:28,847
No, it isn't.

1451
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,310
Hey, guys.

1452
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:34,670
Did you ever find the pot?

1453
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,439
Tony just made the most
beautiful apple bong.

1454
01:03:37,607 --> 01:03:40,442
We'll have to, because
some celebrating is in order.

1455
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:42,861
I think we might have reached a deal.

1456
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:46,323
Yes. Dylan has made a proposition.

1457
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:47,741
I'm going to give her the money.

1458
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,075
Yay!

1459
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,536
What? You're giving her money?

1460
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,147
- Who was at the door?
- Harold.

1461
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,789
He's giving himself a tour of the house.

1462
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,374
- And where's Karen?
- I don't fucking know!

1463
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,693
You're giving her money?

1464
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,878
This is our decision, not yours.

1465
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:01,838
I'm not giving her 200 grand.
Don't worry.

1466
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,840
I'm just bailing her out
of her current situation.

1467
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,175
And then for the whole restaurant?

1468
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:07,161
No, I'm not gonna do the restaurant now.

1469
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,387
It's just gotten too crazy.

1470
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,249
This is a good result.

1471
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:12,599
This is even better
than getting the restaurant.

1472
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:14,142
Less financial uncertainty.

1473
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,062
He's right. I think I even feel
a little relieved.

1474
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,522
Mom's wasn't about money.

1475
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:22,609
Well, I don't think anyone starts anything
with the dream of not making money.

1476
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:23,777
Do they not?

1477
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,820
Why would you give her money?

1478
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,239
Because it's my money.

1479
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:30,492
I make it, and I can do
what I want with it.

1480
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,686
Like you have your t-shirt money.

1481
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:32,869
You can do what you want with that.

1482
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:35,872
We're married.
This is, this is our life.

1483
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,457
It's a real life.

1484
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:42,003
I know Brooke doesn't believe that,
but you do.

1485
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:49,386
You know what?

1486
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:53,890
I appreciate the offer, Dylan,
but I'm not going to take the money.

1487
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,106
I just wasn't brought up that way.

1488
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:03,191
What will you do?

1489
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:04,442
I'll figure it out.

1490
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,236
I always do.

1491
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:10,156
I am so impressed by you and so worried
for you at the same time.

1492
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:13,785
I'm so glad you're my sister.

1493
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:16,204
What are you talking about?

1494
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,123
Nothing happened. I love you!

1495
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:20,667
Don't lie to my face and stab
me in the back, butter boy!

1496
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:22,695
- That's so mean!
- Destroyer!

1497
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:23,821
What? No, I'm not.

1498
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,448
You're stealing my boyfriend!
You're cuckolding me.

1499
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:26,991
- You bitch whore!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1500
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:28,216
Stop it!

1501
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:29,467
Who the fuck are you?

1502
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:30,661
This is my girlfriend Nicolette.

1503
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:31,803
She's usually very polite.

1504
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:33,722
What is it about this house?
Everyone screams.

1505
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:34,889
She's stealing my boyfriend!

1506
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,099
I am not!

1507
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:37,517
I resisted! I resisted!

1508
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:38,685
Chill the fuck out!

1509
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:39,837
I don't like shouting around the baby.

1510
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:40,963
Is that a real thing?

1511
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,939
I'm right here, and she's
not stealing anything.

1512
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,400
It's not just that! There's also this!

1513
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:46,776
What the fuck is that?

1514
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,236
- Or cursing!
- Sorry, Karen.

1515
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,529
Tracy knows what it is.

1516
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:51,865
I'll give you a hint. It's onionskin.

1517
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:53,950
She's a home wrecker and a bad person.

1518
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,952
Stop calling her these old-timey names.

1519
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,746
I don't know why you're defending her.

1520
01:05:57,913 --> 01:05:59,649
She's publishing this story
all about you.

1521
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:00,775
I'm not publishing anything.

1522
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,876
I don't even know
if I got into the Lit Society.

1523
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:04,070
It's very competitive.

1524
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,670
- This is so nerdy.
- Yep.

1525
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,114
Baby, I resisted.

1526
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:08,241
Can I get a drink?

1527
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:10,175
Have mine.
They keep offering me alcohol.

1528
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:11,509
You wrote a story about me?

1529
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,470
She hates you. She wrote
mean things about you.

1530
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:15,748
It's not you. It's just inspired.

1531
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:17,015
You make me want to write.

1532
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:18,767
I want to read it if it's about me.

1533
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,477
- I'd like to read it too.
- You don't read fiction.

1534
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:21,978
When it's about my friends, I do.

1535
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,731
It's not really you.
It's just very funny.

1536
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:27,651
The character that Nicolette and Tony
misconstrued as being you...

1537
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,152
is a very funny character.

1538
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,821
Funny? What does it say?

1539
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,324
It's not funny. It's just, it's not you.

1540
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:37,702
Do you live in an apartment
that's zoned commercial?

1541
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:40,121
Give me that story.

1542
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,501
It wasn't meant to be hurtful.

1543
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:02,102
I didn't mean to hurt you, Brooke.

1544
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:05,772
You don't get to decide
what's hurtful and not hurtful.

1545
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,565
I can only tell you my intention.

1546
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:10,819
You wrote this after one night
with me? One?

1547
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,487
I guess so. Yeah, it felt longer.

1548
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:13,780
You think I'm a rotting carcass?

1549
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:16,157
That I am doomed to failure?

1550
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,493
No. It's fiction,
that's why it's fiction.

1551
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:21,496
So much of this "fiction"
did not happen this way.

1552
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:22,831
Karen, you're a lawyer.

1553
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:25,166
I'm going to sue you
until you have nothing.

1554
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:26,360
I'm just writing from my life.

1555
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,962
No! This is not your life.

1556
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,755
But I was there that night.

1557
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:32,132
I was gonna have that night anyway.

1558
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:33,425
You never were.

1559
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:34,759
But I did have it, though.

1560
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:37,178
You joined my life.
You needed a place to go.

1561
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:40,140
I invited you in
and then you stole my life.

1562
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:42,809
You're a leech! A bloodsucker.

1563
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:44,712
You loved being admired by me.
You loved it.

1564
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,604
You loved having lessons to impart.

1565
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:49,107
I didn't ask for you!

1566
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,984
Brooke, you know great plays, right?

1567
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:54,320
How would it have been if Tennessee
Williams hadn't used people he knew?

1568
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:55,488
There wouldn't be any plays...

1569
01:07:55,656 --> 01:08:00,118
I don't give a shit because I am not
a friend of Tennessee Williams!

1570
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:04,289
You took something I said and made
a tweet about it. How about that?

1571
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:07,234
That's different! It wasn't
some sneaky shitty thing.

1572
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,501
You knew I was Twittering.

1573
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:10,946
Do you want me to credit you?
No, I'll just delete it.

1574
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,698
That's not the point.
I'm asking you to empathize.

1575
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,716
It was my least popular tweet anyway.

1576
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:17,010
Stop talking about Twitter,
it's so awkward.

1577
01:08:17,178 --> 01:08:19,679
You are much more of an asshole
than you initially appear.

1578
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,181
I agree.

1579
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,184
You think I haven't dealt
with the pain of my mother's death?

1580
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:28,688
I deal with it all the time!
I talk about it all the time!

1581
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:31,357
You talk about it all the time
but you never talk about her.

1582
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,803
You just throw out that she died
and that shuts everyone up.

1583
01:08:33,903 --> 01:08:36,696
Your tragedy is your armor
in which nothing is ever your fault.

1584
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:38,808
Please! Please, friends!

1585
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,826
Somebody defend me against this monster!

1586
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,369
It was in pretty poor taste.

1587
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:44,704
I didn't even like the writing.

1588
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:46,873
Like your whole generation,
it's all pastiche.

1589
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,750
- It's not a nice story.
- I told you.

1590
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,710
I also told you.

1591
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:52,587
The emotional betrayal,
I can't speak to.

1592
01:08:52,755 --> 01:08:54,255
I didn't betray her.

1593
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:57,217
But I can say that
you portray women terribly.

1594
01:08:57,384 --> 01:09:01,054
And because of that, I've prepared some
questions I'd like you to think about.

1595
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:02,597
Are you fucking kidding me?

1596
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:06,559
One. Do you believe
in a woman's right to choose?

1597
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:07,894
Yes. What does that...

1598
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:09,062
Excuse me, I'm not done.

1599
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,230
She's not done, bitch!

1600
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:11,564
Brooke, please.

1601
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,008
Two. What do you think

1602
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,610
someone who bombs abortion clinics
would think of your story?

1603
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:17,237
There isn't even
an abortion in the story.

1604
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,613
No, you just portray women

1605
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,698
as crazy desperate gold diggers.

1606
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:25,036
Three. Do you believe the perpetrators
of female genital mutilation...

1607
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:26,913
would be hindered
or helped by your story?

1608
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,374
You seemed so cool,
so totally amazing...

1609
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:31,709
I didn't think it would be
possible to hurt you.

1610
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,420
Of course it's possible to hurt me.

1611
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,714
I am the most sensitive person.

1612
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:37,825
To your own feelings.

1613
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:38,925
Mamie-Claire!

1614
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,161
Sorry, I don't really think that,

1615
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:41,719
it's just something
I would have said at one time.

1616
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:45,223
I have to say,
what you did to Brooke is F-ed up.

1617
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:46,432
Karen, you don't see my side?

1618
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,767
No, sweetheart.

1619
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,103
You don't have a side.
You're just wrong.

1620
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,813
You must call the Lit Society

1621
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,940
and tell them you're
withdrawing your essay.

1622
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:56,150
It's not an essay. It's a short story.

1623
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:58,053
This cannot appear in print or online.

1624
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,779
Karen, will you represent Brooke?

1625
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:01,906
I'm a tax attorney, but okay.

1626
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,826
We should get dressed, baby.
Dinner at the Baskins.

1627
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:06,995
There's plenty of room for you
all to spend the night.

1628
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:08,288
You too, Karen.

1629
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,123
One sec.

1630
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:11,901
Will you draw up the contract, please?

1631
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:13,126
Yes.

1632
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:16,087
In the meantime, I'm gonna
ask you to rewrite the story...

1633
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,464
and then give Brooke
the re-written story.

1634
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:20,466
I'll give you my email
and you can BCC me.

1635
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,302
- She could just CC you.
- Nic's right

1636
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,595
because we'd already know
that you're getting it.

1637
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:24,804
Sure, CC me.

1638
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,472
Technology, it's very complicated.

1639
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,601
I know. I just learned what case sensitive
meant, seriously, like, yesterday.

1640
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:31,102
I'm not going to do any of this stuff.

1641
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,188
You're my sister and I love you
but I stand by what I did.

1642
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,648
Guess what, bitch?

1643
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:39,527
My dad isn't going to marry
your slutty, atheist mother.

1644
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:42,223
So we're not sisters, we'll never be.

1645
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,198
We're nothing to each other.

1646
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:49,120
There are ten questions here,
all equally important, for you to answer.

1647
01:10:58,505 --> 01:10:59,505
Brooke...

1648
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:39,712
Mom?

1649
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:41,422
Oh, honey.

1650
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:43,675
Ruth signed me in.

1651
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:47,804
I just saw a side of him
that I didn't know before.

1652
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:51,041
It's strange to not really know someone.

1653
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,141
Oh.

1654
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:55,144
I'm sorry. I know you liked Brooke.

1655
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:58,257
He told me that she worships you.

1656
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:03,387
She kept talking about how smart
you are, and interesting.

1657
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:07,740
Oh, honey. Don't cry.

1658
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:11,828
I went through a break-up too.

1659
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,331
You didn't tell me
you were seeing anybody.

1660
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:16,499
I know.

1661
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:21,212
Oh, my sweet girl.
Do you want to talk about it?

1662
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,380
No.

1663
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:25,216
It's too late now, anyway.

1664
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:29,262
I know this is crappy timing,
but I need to take a vacation.

1665
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:32,515
And I got the deposit back
for the flowers...

1666
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:36,853
and Colleen told me to come with her
family to the Caribbean over Thanksgiving.

1667
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,188
And, Trace, I need it.

1668
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:41,649
That sounds nice, Stevie.

1669
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:45,054
So, you're okay for Thanksgiving,
not coming home?

1670
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,154
Oh.

1671
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:48,656
I didn't put that together.

1672
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,200
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be fine.

1673
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:52,785
Are you okay?

1674
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:55,663
I'm very sad, but I'll be okay.

1675
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:59,208
I wish it had worked out...

1676
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:01,919
even though I didn't really know him.

1677
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:08,551
Me too, Baby Tracy.

1678
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:27,612
You're in.

1679
01:13:41,335 --> 01:13:44,613
Dream baby dream

1680
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:47,825
Dream baby dream

1681
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:51,286
Dream baby dream

1682
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,639
Dream baby dream

1683
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:59,685
Okay. Tracy, I'm ready.

1684
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:05,149
Sometimes I worry that I'm a bad person.

1685
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:09,862
That I'm one of those people
who essentially has no conscience.

1686
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,907
Spirit says...

1687
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:19,205
you need to find your home in yourself.

1688
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,625
Spirit says...

1689
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:27,463
you haven't dropped into your body yet.

1690
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:31,467
If I'm not in my body then where am I?

1691
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,721
Five feet to the left and unhappy.

1692
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:44,465
Dream baby dream

1693
01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:47,134
Dream baby dream

1694
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:49,011
If a person wanted
to start their own club,

1695
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:51,195
how would a person go about it?

1696
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:54,073
Well, I think it's pretty much
done for this semester...

1697
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,769
but you could put in an application

1698
01:14:56,869 --> 01:14:59,162
for funding next semester.

1699
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,625
Hey!

1700
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,211
Can I come in?

1701
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:09,380
Okay.

1702
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,051
You going home for Thanksgiving?

1703
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:16,304
No, I'm going to Baltimore
with Nicolette.

1704
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,471
Oh. Nice.

1705
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:19,849
Her dad fries a turkey, apparently.

1706
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:23,019
- You?
- No.

1707
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,066
It's an application. Two.

1708
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:33,571
I don't want to join Mobius.
Had enough rejection.

1709
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:36,532
It's not for Mobius.
I quit the briefcase club.

1710
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,869
You were right,
they're self-elected douchebags.

1711
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:43,748
I'm starting my own zine
and I'm not saying you're in...

1712
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:48,044
but I'd be very interested in getting
your and Nicolette's applications.

1713
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,383
I'll fix us some screwdrivers.

1714
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:56,719
Okay.

1715
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,123
It's my direction

1716
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:43,667
It's my proposal

1717
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:48,479
It's so hard It's leading me astray

1718
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,282
Hello.

1719
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:02,952
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
on Thanksgiving, but I met you once.

1720
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,621
I went through your window,
it was the middle of the night.

1721
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,316
- Yeah.
- I was with Brooke.

1722
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:08,457
You're her sister, right?

1723
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,209
Well, I was going to be.

1724
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:13,587
Do you have a number for her?
The old one isn't working.

1725
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,131
I don't.

1726
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:19,218
Anyway, I was gonna ask you,
do you know where she went?

1727
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:29,645
Her front door is still bolted shut.

1728
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:34,900
She's upstairs.

1729
01:17:37,446 --> 01:17:38,446
Thank you, Kareem.

1730
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:39,572
You're welcome.

1731
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:09,810
Hi.

1732
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:13,230
Hi.

1733
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:15,524
Can I come in?

1734
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:18,277
You're leaving?

1735
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:19,528
In a couple of hours.

1736
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:21,697
I'm gonna try my luck out west.

1737
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,449
You're going today, on Thanksgiving?

1738
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:26,019
New York isn't the New York
I used to know.

1739
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,578
There's too much construction.

1740
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:29,106
Maybe L.A. is my lady.

1741
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:31,499
In L.A., I qualify as well-read.

1742
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:33,360
I wanted to say...

1743
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,528
I know that you're sorry.

1744
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:35,878
I'm not really that sorry.

1745
01:18:36,046 --> 01:18:37,922
- You're not?
- No.

1746
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:39,131
Oh, well, then fuck this!

1747
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:40,299
No!

1748
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,592
No, wait.

1749
01:18:42,511 --> 01:18:44,345
I looked for you.

1750
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:46,180
I've been around.

1751
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:48,557
Are you okay? Like financially?

1752
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:50,726
Yeah.

1753
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:54,230
Mamie-Claire gave me what would have
been my share of the t-shirt profits.

1754
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:57,024
It was just enough to pay my debt
and get out of town.

1755
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:58,984
What will you do in L.A.?

1756
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,361
I don't know.

1757
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:02,306
I think I'm sick.

1758
01:19:02,406 --> 01:19:04,657
And I don't know
if my ailment has a name.

1759
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:07,394
It's just me sitting and staring

1760
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:09,453
at the Internet or the television...

1761
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:13,958
for long periods of time interspersed
by trying to not do that.

1762
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:16,710
And then lying about
what I've been doing.

1763
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:21,841
Then I'll get so excited about something
that the excitement overwhelms me...

1764
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:24,802
and I can't sleep or do anything.

1765
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:27,888
And I just am in love with everything...

1766
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:31,642
but can't figure out how to make
myself work in the world.

1767
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,060
I think I have that too.

1768
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,646
I wish we lived in feudal times...

1769
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:37,982
where your position
in the world couldn't change.

1770
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,801
If you were a king or a peasant,

1771
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:42,862
you had to just be happy
with who you were.

1772
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:46,198
But wait.

1773
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:50,953
You can tutor SAT's now.

1774
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:52,898
Well, I thought I might
actually go to college.

1775
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:54,081
I'm not an amputee.

1776
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,332
Right.

1777
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,027
I filled out a couple of applications.

1778
01:19:57,127 --> 01:19:58,919
I wrote my college essay all about you.

1779
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:00,254
Really?

1780
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:03,549
Oh, snap! No. It's about my mom.

1781
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:04,717
But I had you there.

1782
01:20:04,885 --> 01:20:05,885
Yeah.

1783
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:09,930
I let Mamie-Claire
and Dylan keep the cats.

1784
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:13,309
It's like, I gave them
a chance for a better life...

1785
01:20:13,477 --> 01:20:16,145
better than the life
that I could provide them.

1786
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:20,733
The cats went from stolen to given
because you changed your mind.

1787
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:22,860
Don't put that in a story.

1788
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:27,948
Not because I care, but because
it isn't a very good observation.

1789
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,786
You know what's funny?

1790
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,456
I'm not even done with my
first semester of college yet.

1791
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,209
This won't even be
your big college story.

1792
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:41,337
I think it will always be pretty big.

1793
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:45,382
Well, thanks for stopping by...

1794
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:48,594
but I have more packing
before Kareem comes over...

1795
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:50,596
and we break down the front door.

1796
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:55,392
It will be hard for me not to look at New
York and think of you somewhere in it.

1797
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Yeah.

1798
01:21:00,565 --> 01:21:01,607
Hey, Brooke?

1799
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:06,596
It's not going to be as great

1800
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:09,573
as what my mom and your dad
were planning, but...

1801
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:12,034
do you want to have
Thanksgiving with me?

1802
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:29,077
Meadow had made rich fat women less fat

1803
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:31,345
and rich stupid kids less stupid...

1804
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:34,348
and lame rich men less lame.

1805
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:37,643
And she wanted so badly
to be on the other side...

1806
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:41,355
to be fat and stupid and lame and rich.

1807
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:43,399
But what she couldn't see most of all...

1808
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:46,735
more than she couldn't see that she was
never going to get the restaurant...

1809
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:49,947
was that those people
were nothing compared to her.

1810
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:52,116
They were matches to her bonfire.

1811
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:56,620
She was the last cowboy,
all romance and failure.

1812
01:21:56,830 --> 01:22:00,332
The world was changing,
and her kind didn't have anywhere to go.

1813
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,861
Being a beacon of hope for lesser people

1814
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:04,628
is a lonely business.

1815
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:07,532
You could've been all right

1816
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:09,659
You could've been here tonight

1817
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:11,828
You could've been sweet as wine

1818
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:14,080
You could've been a lady

1819
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,249
You could've been all right

1820
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,460
You could've been here tonight

1821
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,629
You could've been sweet as wine

1822
01:22:20,729 --> 01:22:23,981
You could've been a lady

1823
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:36,311
They all love you, you're a good girl

1824
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:38,563
When you awake you'll find another man

1825
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:40,857
Lying beside you

1826
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:45,028
They all need you, they all want you

1827
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,239
Well, I'll be surprised if you realised

1828
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:49,032
Where you're going to

1829
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:51,284
You could've been all right

1830
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,411
You could've been here tonight

1831
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,622
You could've been sweet as wine

1832
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:57,791
You could've been a lady

1833
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:00,001
You could've been all right

1834
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,128
You could've been here tonight

1835
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:04,339
You could've been sweet as wine

1836
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:06,857
You could've been a lady

1837
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,902
You could've been all right

1838
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:10,030
You could've been here tonight

1839
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:12,240
You could've been sweet as wine

1840
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,799
You could've been a lady
