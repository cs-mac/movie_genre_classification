21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Get up. It's Monday, visiting day.
Also the day to water the flowers.

22
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,168
Here you go.
Ali, Ali.

23
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,602
Don't forget to buy me some snack.
- Alright. Okay.

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,007
Watch your hand, Mahmoud.
- We are here, grandpa.

25
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,091
Do not go home wearing smock. If sawdust permeate through
the carpet, it'd be hell of a job cleaning it up.

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
Sit here.

27
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,965
Here are the keys to the front door , room and refrigirator
Grandpa. Please don't let them make a mess.

28
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,247
Rest assured, dearest. When you return,
your house will be spick and span

29
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,129
This is widower's destiny. Transforming
himself from father-in-law to mother-in-law.

30
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,602
Mummy, chewing gum.
- Ask your grandpa.

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,964
Keep my share of yoghourt soup for me.
An artist makes it differently

32
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,567
All my housewifely skills are limited to cooking
broth in winter and yoghourt soup in summer.

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,289
Do something for Mahmud's Monday luncheon.
Whatever I <i>cook,</i> he'll eat at the sandwich shop.

34
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,091
Don't give him any money.
- I don't like yoghourt soup.

35
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,366
I won't eat lunch.
- Don't.

36
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,962
When he is hungry, he'll even eat a stone,
let alone yoghourt soup.

37
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,850
Haven't you finished this set yet?
Are you carving marbles?

38
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,171
This is not yoghourt soup. When it's
finished, you'll say it was worth all the troubles

39
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,602
Master Mehdi acknowledges
the alder more than me.

40
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,601
He loves wood like a termite. You are
Lucky your rival is wood, and infertile.

41
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,601
Otherwise we'd have a dozen
Pinocchios of varying ages and heights.

42
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,645
And the saw I used to work with has converted to a knife.
I fell washed-out...

43
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,049
I wish one of your carved
picture frames were my work...

44
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,164
...then I wouldn't mind peeling
potatoes for the rest of my life.

45
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,604
Let me remind you again. Don't set foot on the
house, while you are covered up with sawdust.

46
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,764
Hello?
- Brother? I'm with mother now.

47
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,202
At nursing home. Rearrange your schedule
So you'd be at mother's place before noon.

48
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,927
Mother is not feeling well.
And I am all by myself.

49
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,921
I've checked her out. We need
a car to bring her stuff back.

50
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,771
She wants us to
take her back home.

51
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,884
I am all welled-up
Brother.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,961
I never thought this day would come.
Do whatever you have to do to be here.

53
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
I will

54
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,449
I have bought fruit,
bread and meat.

55
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,245
All we do is fill and refill the fridge.

56
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,442
Have schnitzel for dinner.

57
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,441
Dr Azadi's secretary is going
to the beach for a week.

58
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,564
Don't use too much oil.
just enough to make it oily.

59
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,002
From tomorrow I'll be going to the
doctor's office in the afternoons.

60
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,442
Don't dirty all the dishes for a schnitzel.
Detergent is scarce.

61
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,531
I got one month's worth of her salary for a
week's work while she's on leave of absence.

62
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,644
A new novel again?

63
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,445
You never told me how the previous
Novel you were reading ended

64
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,564
Something is wrong with the front wheel
of the car. The one to the driver's seat.

65
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,002
Tomorrow is Tuesday and the
charwoman comes to clean.

66
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,124
If I am late, tell her
to do the laundry first.

67
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,211
Aunt Nafiseh called. She wanted
to know what happened to the loan.

68
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,281
She's called 3 times this week. Tell her in one word
whether she can get a loan on the apartment or not

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,445
Guess who I saw?

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,882
Fereshteh Nbati. She had brought
her husband for physiotherapy.

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,288
She's now married to a building contractor, I don't know
what she has done to him. He couldn't move a muscle.

72
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,041
He introduced himself as a civil engineer,
And that he owned a construction company.

73
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,970
To me, he was a
building contractor.

74
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,568
Jalal! How many times should I ask you
not to help me with the housework?

75
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,762
You have left the top of the
sugar holder almost open again.

76
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,963
Now ants are on parade everywhere,
Mr Maurice Meterling.

77
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,849
Hello?
- Hello, brother.

78
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,885
So, it's Monday again and
a call from my little sister.

79
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,609
This Monday is different.
- It's the series last episode tonight, isn't it?

80
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,089
Hold on a second,
sis.

81
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,489
The idiot German
hung up on me.

82
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,968
Go on.

83
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I've kept the line too long, bro. you go home
with our baby brother. We'll bring mother .

84
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,411
Our sister's also on her way from the Caspian.
- These traditions are obsolete, baby sister.

85
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,401
Who has taken a dying person home?
She could expire there, and Auf wieder sehen.

86
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,649
This is mother's request.

87
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,843
She doesn't want to die a lonely person in the
nursing home as her roommate did.

88
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,326
Tal'at called. Apparently mother
is not well, I have dressed up.

89
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,891
I may have to spend the night at mother's
Didn't have time to listen to your tape.

90
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,642
If you need anything, call
Mehdi's shop, he'll let me know.

91
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,721
Come on in.

92
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,409
Sit down, Fatso.

93
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,770
Only God Almighty is immortal.

94
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,761
Paradise lies beneath mothers' feet.

95
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,880
This is to announce the death of
the daughter of the late Mostofi...

96
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Pillar of knowledge, and the wife
of the late Captain Gholi Khan Naseri ...

97
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,880
...and the honorable
mother of Ebrahim khan ...

98
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,609
Don't play around.
Eat it up.

99
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,248
Hello? It is mom!
- May I speak with grandpa, Ali?

100
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,963
Hello, father.

101
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,162
Go on, girl.
- Mahmud had a sandwich, mon.

102
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,887
I don't want Mehdi and the kids to know.

103
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,641
Mother is not well and
she has asked to be taken home.

104
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,161
Don't worry.
- I'm worried about you.

105
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,363
Don't be, Do what you
have to do, Bye, girl.

106
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,489
The Association of the
Gut-Exporters of Iran.

107
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,042
Fatso, here comes your clan.

108
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,845
Are you well, Khodadad? Thank God.
- Fine.

109
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,606
Easy.

110
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,640
Mother seems up and about.

111
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,964
It looks like a paradise here.

112
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,448
All it needed was Mother
to fill this place up with her scent.

113
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,169
Easy!

114
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,522
Oh, I adore you.

115
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,611
Tal'at!

116
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,046
Mother seems up and about to me.
Your sweet crackbrained brother is here as well.

117
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,968
He is a mess! Everything goes
to him who doesn't want him.

118
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,527
Take it easy, brother.
<i>cool</i> it...

119
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,248
Worse comes to worse. And
your wisecracking is getting worse.

120
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,641
I'll be damned if I am to wisecrack my big
brother, I'll shut up, and say another word.

121
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,970
Okay, don't try to be sweeter than
sugar plum, Go mind your business.

122
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,163
Whatever you say
brother.

123
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,120
So your brother, Mr Ebrahim Khan,
the gut - spinner, is here as well.

124
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,451
We're all supposed to be here together.
This is mother's request during her last days.

125
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,610
Last days?
- Yes, brother.

126
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Hey, sugarplum! While I'm here, nobody is to spend
a penny, particularly this softy brother of ours.

127
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,122
The good-for-nothing meat
is the cheapest of kind

128
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,561
I've left a bunch of notes here. Take the
money, buy, cook and eat until you burst.

129
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Only mind your crackbrained brother. He's
never full, he might eat himself to death.

130
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,131
Try this very cup of tea with sugar.
Forget about your diet today.

131
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,165
The tea you used to brewed on a
charcoal samovar tasted different.

132
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,887
The tea is not freshly-brewed
with electric samovars.

133
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,603
This weaker tea is for our softy colorful brother?

134
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,768
The best of everything for our big brother.

135
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,042
Don't be silly.
Get lost.

136
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,049
The Tea taken without
Sugar is not bad at all.

137
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,450
It's bitter.
- You can't sweeten bitterness with sugar.

138
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,406
You have to illuminate
the night without a lamp.

139
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,288
It's bitter.

140
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,284
<i>My Monir is here!
My sweet pea!</i>

141
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,571
<i>Monir is here!
Monir is here!</i>

142
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:56,280
<i>Monir is here!
Monir is here!</i>

143
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Now your crackbrained son is welcoming
his cutie-pie sister. Ms. Sweet pea.

144
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,770
Hey dumb-head, you
keep your mouth shut

145
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,480
A finch lays seven eggs, and one turns out a nightingale
All my mother's eggs turned out nightingales

146
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,927
What a crappy lot!

147
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,886
Thanks to our uncle's genes, I became a
gut-spinner, and can take care of myself.

148
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,289
Otherwise, I too would have been a
good-for-nothing like the crappy lot here.

149
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,129
Out of the way.

150
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,407
I'm amazed why you even bothered this
cadaverously ill sister of ours to come over.

151
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,525
She'd be taken into hospital, if they are
to catch a glimpse of her on the streets.

152
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh, mother!

153
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,402
Oh, mother!

154
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,286
<i>Oh, Monir!
My sweet pea!</i>

155
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,604
Zinat has pomegranates.

156
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,841
Pomegranates fall from heaven.
- Zinat...

157
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,691
Red ones.

158
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,966
Zinat has pomegranates...

159
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,811
The green one.

160
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,003
Who is this?

161
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,048
Who are you?

162
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,764
Here you go.

163
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,885
A game!
- Gholamreza, come, let's play together.

164
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,409
Here I come. Run. I am
coming to catch you.

165
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,124
Catch me if you can.
Come on. Catch me.

166
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,042
L...l...
Wait, Oh...

167
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,364
I felt dizzy.
My pill.

168
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,570
Come here, Khodadad! Get the key
from my pocket and open the door.

169
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,681
Thanks, man.
So long.

170
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,249
That's enough, son.
He's exhausted.

171
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,448
Fatso has taken a tenner to
massage his big brother's feet.

172
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,201
It is not even a half time yet.
All right.

173
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,611
For your sake,
call it quits.

174
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,241
Hey, son! Gholam Reza! Give it a break!
You'll be sick to your stomach!

175
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,331
Eat some burned sugar, so you
won't have an upset stomach.

176
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,970
This lot is really something.

177
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,804
Jalal, come here.
and join the lot.

178
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,131
Don't avoid us, son.
For seperation is at hand.

179
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,088
Thank God I am not like them.
Thanks to my late uncle's foresight...

180
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,321
...I am tough and thick- skinned.
That's for sure. Nothing bothers me.

181
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,210
I might as well go this far to eat mellon and
honey mixed, without having upset stomach at all.

182
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,006
Monir, vinegar doesn't go well
with you. Drink some oxymel.

183
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,571
A mixture of yoghourt, fish, mellon and
honey would be my season salad.

184
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,361
Mother!

185
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,361
Vinegar is not good for you either.
- Why the hell are you depriving her?

186
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,121
Her sun is setting.
She's at the point of death.

187
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,691
She has her foot in the grave.
Her batteries will be dead soon.

188
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,804
Let her enjoy life in
these last minutes.

189
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,561
Mother's condition is similar to that
of extra time in a final soccer match.

190
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,923
Penalty kick is the final
solution to her situation.

191
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,564
Let's say some people such as mother
have as their engine that of Rolls-Royce's.

192
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,801
Suppose they have not put the pedal
to metal as in the course of a lifetime.

193
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:06,281
Penalty kick appears to be the final solution.
Since they have "nuke" as their magnetto.

194
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,930
So sudden as a firm kick would score
a goal, they might just kick the bucket.

195
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:20,040
(IMITATING A COMMENTATOR
REPORTING A SOCCER MATCH)

196
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,691
You didn't treat your
brothers and sisters well.

197
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,681
I think I'd better leave you all.
- A mother will always forgive.

198
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,681
But beware of the Judgment Day
and the spite of the oppressed.

199
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,565
The spite of the oppressed!

200
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,925
My God have mercy on you!

201
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,011
Okay don't curse me
so from up there.

202
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,045
All I have to do is to attend
your funeral ceremony

203
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,769
I can even send my blessing from here.
May God bless her soul!

204
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,528
Fetch my bloody jacket, Tal'at.
I am going back to my bloody life.

205
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,044
I am fed up with some people here.
- Okay

206
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,449
While the big brother is finishing his tea,
the baby sister will bring his jacket

207
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,927
It was ripped in the armpit.
I had to mend it.

208
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,207
If a butcher's knife tears my stomach
My wife won't touch a needle and thread.

209
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:16,320
But, she buys all kinds of fashion
journals to make dresses for her cubs.

210
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,691
Don't spread your dirt on the floor, you idiot.
You have infested our life with your germs.

211
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,804
The damn thing is cleaning it out.

212
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,244
Do you expect us to frame
you and put you on the wall?

213
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,729
He smells like shit, yet he
sits princely by the windowsill.

214
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,324
A fistful of water
will clean a dirty body.

215
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,288
It is dirty heart that won't be cleaned by a sea.
- Hey, softy.

216
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Tell your lady doctor to save a pack of DDT for
your brother, whose wavy hair is a commune of lice.

217
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,282
Tomorrow I'll take him to the bath.
and will wash the body of this pure soul.

218
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,646
No hot water, no hot water, please
I'll burn, oh my head!

219
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:32,008
Come and let me wash you.
Shut up or <i>I'll</i> belt you proper.

220
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,761
This kind soul needs
caressing, not belting.

221
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Then you better come and catch this lice
and collect them till you have a football team.

222
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,928
Tal'at, where is my bloody jacket?
- Here it is. I'm bringing it over.

223
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,123
May you bring the
news of my death.

224
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,082
Give it to me.

225
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,324
These feet used to have a covering.

226
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,444
I have washed your socks. they're still wet.
- Give them to me.

227
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,681
Maby I'll catch heart rheumatism
and I will be freed from you lot.

228
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,771
May that day never come.
- Well, it has, sister.

229
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,331
It's better to die naked than to be in this
funeral parlour, and listen to this nonsense.

230
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,731
One is born naked and die naked.
The lighter the better.

231
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,891
This world is like the sea
and our life is a ship on it.

232
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,367
Water in a ship is its hazard.

233
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,691
A mariner without clothes has a better
chance than a passenger with luggage.

234
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,570
Then you come and do it.
Mr Water Polo. Tarzan! Plato!

235
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,768
Here, come on and start your concert,
you Vienna Symphony Orchestra.

236
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,442
There's always room
for a wayfarer.

237
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,804
Instead of slapping him,
you could wash his face.

238
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,370
You listen to me, Mr Smarty Pants. My wife told
me either I stay here or this Gorilla the Grape.

239
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,769
So I submitted him to the
madhouse. Yeah, I did.

240
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,450
I couldn't take care of him like a baby
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

241
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,122
Now that I have said it, you all know
it. I have nothing to hide anymore.

242
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Here I had a shitty life in this world, and I
will be damned in the hereafter. So I lost it all.

243
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,848
It is my father. Only he comes through
this door with boots, sword and cane.

244
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,402
He has aged so
much he has died.

245
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,925
Late Captain Naseri's residence?

246
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,044
Welcome home,
son.

247
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,201
Thanks.

248
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,843
This young mariner is a souvenir
of your father's days in exile.

249
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,960
As much as your father suffered in exile, the
son benefited from the freedom and the sea.

250
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,806
After your father refused to give the order
to shoot in the Gowharshad Mosque...

251
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,963
...nearly forty years ago, unlike
these warm nights of the summer...

252
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,929
...in the dead of the winter, one night
they brought him home to take a bath.

253
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,367
Tal'at and Jalal
were not born yet.

254
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,011
Ebrahim was fourteen or so,
and Gholam Reza was five or six

255
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,961
Monir had just started to talk.

256
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,481
There are vacant rooms downstairs
You may find some bread and sheets.

257
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,846
No strangers should be allowed
here, as it the night of the lovers.

258
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:49,048
I will spend the night with my family. I'll be
back here early in the morning to pick you up.

259
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,562
I wish your night lasts forever.

260
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,482
Thank God my picture is
still on the wall of the house.

261
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,720
To the end of the world, your picture will be on the wall
and your name on the door and your love in our hearts.

262
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,641
I ruined this house.

263
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,209
As long as I am on my feet,
these walls dare not fall.

264
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,282
Sarah will hold this
rain-sodden roof like a pillar.

265
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,610
Do not mind the leaky floor,
and these copper tubs.

266
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,724
They are called "Winter Basins "

267
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,162
Don't you regret my going on that mission?

268
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,887
No
- You accept my disobedience?

269
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,401
Yes

270
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,641
At last, all the people who took
sanctuary in that mosque were killed

271
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,688
Somebody else ordered the shooting
not my noble husband.

272
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,809
That means I sold this world
for the sake of a future gain.

273
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,365
No

274
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,121
Even in lock and chain,
you are still a captain.

275
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,848
You used to have a position.
Now you have a name.

276
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,967
They only took a few starts off your shoulders.
Your stars are now on your forehead.

277
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,204
How are the kids doing?

278
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,085
Mischief!
Naughtiness!

279
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,724
And the little girl is talking sweetly.

280
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,571
The boys should grow
to become real men.

281
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,047
Let them enjoy their childhood.

282
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,562
This is like an egg yolk.

283
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,011
We had everything at home,
but I didn't want to prepare a feast.

284
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,202
I wanted you to know what the kids eat.

285
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,084
Boiled potatoes every night?

286
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,131
One night with the mint,
and the other with marjoram.

287
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,083
It is not monotonous this way.

288
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,721
Once you have wonderful wife, no
matter how poor you are, you feel rich.

289
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,041
A loving wife doesn't need
to do so much shopping.

290
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Thanks to her abilities the kitchen is
always running and the table is always set.

291
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:08,566
I've promised myself not to ask for
anybody's help until your term is finished

292
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,164
Everybody is willing to help. My brother , Your
relatives. Even the neighboring shopkeepers.

293
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,128
Even the grocer sent a message for
me to go and get whatever I needed.

294
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,802
Said he has an account
with you. I didn't accept it.

295
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,003
With the wheel of this sewing machine.
I'll move the wheel of life.

296
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,966
It is surprising that I have not been
executed. There is hope for exile.

297
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,604
Wherever you go, I'll take the kids
under my wings and fly to you.

298
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,965
Securing a house will be difficult. You
may have to stay in a boarding house.

299
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:56,080
Next to you, Captain Naseri
wherever we are is home.

300
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,603
Of course, if you are the housewife.

301
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,888
You didn't trust me?
did you?

302
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,402
The aim of a prisoner is to escape
and the duty of a guard is to watch out.

303
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,642
You spent a difficult night.

304
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,004
Given the joy of a heart-broken
family, it was worth my while.

305
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,442
Father was exiled.

306
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:33,560
The kids and I stayed in that town so
that father would not feel homesick.

307
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,561
The sky of that port blazed like fire.

308
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,924
The price of our togetherness
would be the life of my child.

309
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,284
And saving the child would cause
my husband's

310
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:54,090
At my request, the homeless man
remarried, with a native girl...

311
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,576
the fruit of which is this stepbrother.

312
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,725
The fruit of which is this stepbrother.

313
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,686
If you have doubts
in accepting me...

314
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,883
have no doubts in
accepting these gifts.

315
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,085
A gift is not valued
by the price it holds.

316
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,528
Some tokens for what I
imagined you would be

317
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,521
from what your
mother has told me.

318
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,009
A lighter for the biggest brother.

319
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,365
The perfume for my biggest sister.

320
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,925
This game for the second brother.

321
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,201
The tape recorder for
the youngest brother.

322
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,650
The scarf for the youngest sister.

323
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,889
And this fabric for my dear mother.

324
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,722
Hello to this day.

325
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:23,370
Now I am too old for such things.

326
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,161
Hey, Fatso!
Towels!

327
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:10,129
The towel should be next to the
wash-basin, you dummy. Quick.

328
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,282
Let the old woman die first,
then fight over her inheritance.

329
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,601
Where is this towel? Should I come
and use your curtains as towel. Quick.

330
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,006
Give it to me.

331
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:53,088
Take this pail and empty it in the toilet. Watch out not
to spill, othenuise I'll pour it down on your head.

332
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:03,648
Don't spill either or else I'll make
you like it. You fat stinking dummy.

333
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,128
You worthless piece of shit.

334
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,162
Look how thick his neck is!

335
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,690
You stink like shit.
Get up.

336
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:56,169
Some people so sentimental.

337
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,611
His hair is good enough to
make a whisk broom out of it.

338
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,645
First, we go to the barbershop,
then toward the bathhouse.

339
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,525
Go mind your own business.

340
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,847
Gholam Reza! Go bathe yourself,
so you'd be polite and educated!

341
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,730
Ali, if I ask you something,
will you tell me the truth?

342
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,207
Honestly?
- Honestly.

343
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:35,771
Don't you miss your mother?
- So what?

344
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:43,287
To go and see her? Also you've got a new
uncle who has brought you lots of gifts.

345
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,448
What about you?

346
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,882
You are a kid and more emotional.

347
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,211
I know what you are up to.
You miss her more.

348
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:00,441
I'll help you out to go to the grandma's
place for you to see mom, if you want.

349
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,201
But first you must take me
to a football game...

350
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,800
...then to an amusement park

351
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,321
Then buy me snack. I'm not finished yet.
- Alright.

352
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,762
Then buy me a coke,
and chewing gum.

353
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,884
You are so dirty I have
to shake you first.

354
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,322
Gholam Reza! Once you get back,
we'll play hide- and-seek.

355
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,444
Having taken a bath,
come here as quick.

356
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,681
Get back here as soon as you can for us to play
hide-and-seek together. Don't forget, all right?

357
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,122
Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, Carpenter.

358
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,564
Gholam Reza! I am tired of waiting
for you here. Come already.

359
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,848
<i>Master Mahdi,
come inside.</i>

360
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,361
Hello.
- Hello to you.

361
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,042
Your brother sent me to fetch
clean clothes for Gholam Reza.

362
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,924
Why don't you come in?

363
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,284
Another time, Your brothers
are waiting at the bathhouse.

364
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,802
Also, the kids are alone at home.

365
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,762
Go get Gholam Reza's clothes.
Tal'at.

366
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,088
Nothing.

367
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,804
No

368
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,965
Polish them.
Yeah, right.

369
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,965
Won't you come for a short while?
- What?

370
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,447
The kids miss you?
- The kids?

371
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,609
The kids are happier with your father.

372
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,405
I miss you, too.

373
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,844
You just saw me.
- The house misses you, too.

374
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,965
Oh, my onions are burning.

375
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,802
Move it.

376
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,924
Let me take you and clean you.

377
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,681
You stink like skunk, you poor
miserable devil. Where to?

378
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,681
You won't go to the
bathhouse in peace, will you?

379
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,122
You stink like shit, dummy!

380
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,361
No way!
- Come on! Maybe I should beat you to it!

381
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,121
Move it!
You worthless piece of shit!

382
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,562
Get up.
- Oh, no.

383
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,651
Get up, you idiot.
Move it.

384
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,322
Move your butt.
- Oh, no.

385
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:57,801
How many years since you last
washed? Bring me four bars of soap.

386
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:07,920
The water is damn too hot. I'm not coming.
- Get your hands off the doorway.

387
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,925
Gholam Reza,
come on up, son.

388
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,485
Good morning.

389
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,650
Not so much dust, as much as I've been
to the bath. I'm all wet. I'll get muddy.

390
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,045
Wait.
Let me see you.

391
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,562
You look so clean,
like a flower.

392
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,963
I was a flower. I went into water,
and now I am rose water.

393
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,687
Come let mother have a good
look to see how clean you look.

394
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,409
Oh, I adore you ,touch wood.

395
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,683
May God break his hand. Who
has made you so black and blue?

396
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,328
I did, and got him
cleaned, too.

397
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,081
Didn't know I would be
cursed instead of praised.

398
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,125
He wouldn't go under the
shower, so socked it to him.

399
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,802
No, he didn't beat me.
I fell down.

400
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,166
I slipped over the soap, and hit the
water tap with my eye. I swear to God.

401
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,567
Hey, bor. We'll take the injured planes to
your wife's hospital, so she can operate on them...

402
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,685
...and send them up again
to fly and raid each other.

403
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,487
Mahin works at a maternity hospital.
- They'll let me in.

404
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,208
My tummy is so big,
they'll let me in.

405
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,370
We'll take the big planes
to give birth to twin helicopters.

406
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,529
Put this ice under
your eyes, to <i>cool</i> it.

407
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:33,331
Ice is not ointment.
It will burn me.

408
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,445
Ice is for eating.

409
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:47,040
As much as it'll <i>cool</i> your liver.

410
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,604
Take this material to tuba,
your wife.

411
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,485
I won't last to wear a new veil.

412
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,051
My wife indeed!
The queen of cruelty!

413
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,611
As if I am the invisible man,
she never sees me.

414
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,803
Tuba!

415
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,922
What a daughter-in-law you have, mother.
The Queen of cruelty.

416
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,520
If only you knew my suffering.
- So all your wisecracking is for us then.

417
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh, mother!

418
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,922
Gut-spinning business doesn't bring
enough for this bunch of free loaders.

419
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,409
I have to do all kinds of things.

420
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,766
Mind if I join you?

421
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,289
I can't sleep tonight.

422
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,090
You are sleepless. You are
the light of this dark night.

423
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,961
Mother hadn't told you all the secrets of
this family. You know all of them yourself.

424
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,081
I gave each of my
daughters an apartment as dowry.

425
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:34,610
They have left their apartments
to come live with their mother.

426
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,123
Tuba was a good wife,
sympathetic.

427
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,729
At least my grandchildren...

428
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:48,051
...if see to theirjunk food,
accept me as their grandfather.

429
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,281
She was sympathetic, but as soon as
I bought her a house, she changed.

430
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,802
She's such a loose tongue.

431
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,891
You know what she calls me?
Buffalo.

432
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,925
You call your sisters and
brothers all kinds of names.

433
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,011
This is God's hand.
Come to your senses.

434
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,364
Everything will be
retributed in this world.

435
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,361
I labored for them so much
that I became a buffalo.

436
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:26,045
This princess Anne goes to sauna
and massage parlors to slim down.

437
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,242
Then all she fed me was fat
and junk till I became a barrel.

438
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,081
That witch only takes
grapefruit juice and leek.

439
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,244
Why bitterness among brothers?

440
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:43,207
At the end of his life, my uncle accepted my
brother as a partner in his gut-spinning company...

441
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,005
...which exported to Germany.

442
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:51,650
<i>And my brother went to Germany, so much he
studied, to become a doctor and treat me and Monir.</i>

443
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:59,760
<i>For Monir to get fat and chubby,
and kn me to become skinny.</i>

444
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,125
I represented the company and
my salary sufficed my studies.

445
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:16,966
Then uncle dropped dead.
May God bless his soul.

446
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:25,010
My brother gave me the sack, and with
a few words of Germany that he learned...

447
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,444
...he continued his dealings with
foreign companies on his own.

448
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,205
It is funny.

449
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,483
A bit to your left.

450
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,240
Don't move.

451
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,162
A bit to your right.

452
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,483
A bit to your left.

453
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,242
A bit closer.

454
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,405
Take each other's hands.

455
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,689
More friendly.

456
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,849
You are looking good now

457
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,567
Your clothes are good now

458
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,048
Now only prepare dinner , tea and coffee

459
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,087
Grandpa, look at daddy.

460
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,841
How it is that you're overjoyed?
- Well he's coming from grandma's.

461
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,964
He's in ajovial mood.
- Well, he's finally seen mom.

462
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,162
To get a glimpse of your mother,
he has become Superman.

463
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,442
You could have taken us with you.
It wouldn't hurt you or anything.

464
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,642
Well, he didn't.
- Come on, Get up.

465
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,842
Oh, look!
It's uncle's Mercedes!

466
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,043
No time for small talk.
- Don't raise your voice at him.

467
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,605
Hello.
- Hello to you.

468
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,168
Hello? Tuba,
is that you?

469
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,887
Well, well, well!
Mr, Ebrahim, the mother lover!

470
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,685
It's good to be alive and see
that you attend to your relatives.

471
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,330
That Jalal and his midwife wife, and your mad
brother and crazy sisters are all the same.

472
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,002
You fit the lot perfectly. All for that
ruin of a house of your mother's.

473
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:47,001
Don't worry. She will not kick the
bucket until she attends all our funerals.

474
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:54,208
Some women luck out. Their husbands
die on time, so the wives can relax a while.

475
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,881
Banoo's husband, may God
bless him, had a stroke at forty.

476
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,004
He left her a fortune...

477
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,001
...to spend time in Europe,
and be tickled to death.

478
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,805
Moradkhan, Vajiheh's husband,
who could be your son...

479
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,242
...died of leukemia,
quick and easy.

480
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,649
Now any boutique owners and
jewelers in Tehran is at her disposal.

481
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,685
Rafieh is better off
than everybody.

482
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,648
Her husband builds roads in Baluchestan,
and she's enjoying herself at beaches of Nice.

483
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,082
These are real men.

484
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:35,047
To cut the long story short, the
son-in-laws go after their father-in-law.

485
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,164
Your son-in-laws
are worse than you.

486
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,965
Giving hell to your daughters.

487
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,811
I am not in the mood
to take care of their widows

488
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,164
I am constantly babysitting for them while
they are at the hair dresser's or fortuneteller's

489
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:53,491
I wanted you to know I am leaving with Farideh and
Mahmud for Dubai, or Turkey along with Mohajeri.

490
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,003
Don't need more than one grand. We'll
take plastic sandals and bring back jeans.

491
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,761
Either you come along or drop dead.
That would be all.

492
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,884
In case I'd drop dead...

493
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,324
...where would you get the
easy dollars? Selfish bitch.

494
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,887
Hello?

495
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,764
May speak with Mrs. Zarbafian.
maternity ward.

496
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,202
So you are staying on, a family reunion.
You made peace with the enemy.

497
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,405
If you wanted a family life, why didn't
you stay with them in the fist place...

498
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,887
...and I'd have a normal life all through the
day, and went to the clinic in the afternoon...

499
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,082
...instead of being an all-night nurse.

500
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,488
You'd have to wait for 6 months to get an appointment
from Giti's clinic. She who dropped behind her studies.

501
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,682
And now I am a nurse.

502
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,122
All the lazy girls at the university
went after rich husbands.

503
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,770
Then I who was pretty and intelligent, and
wanted to be an intellectual married you.

504
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:49,364
Thanks to their husbands' money, they
are specialists, and university professors...

505
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,211
...and I have to be a night nurse.

506
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:57,486
Mrs Zarbafian to the operating room!
- They're paging me to the operating room!

507
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,528
Be patient. I'll leave the car
keys with Master Mehdi.

508
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,123
There're lost of empty tapes.
Fill them up.

509
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,006
Was the course straightforward?
- I made the cabinets in this ward.

510
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,963
The job was thanks to the
contractor, Mr, Nourani.

511
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,209
Jalal always praises your craft. Every time
he has bought way too many books...

512
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,765
...he says one of these days, Master

513
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,962
Mehdi is going to make a bookshelf.

514
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,162
I don't feel like working.

515
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,602
Come, let us examine you.
It could be a uric acid.

516
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,327
No, since Tal'at is gone.
I feel depressed.

517
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,444
She was next to me,
and I couldn't see her.

518
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,929
She was, so much as the eyelid, close
to me. Buy I didn't feel her presence.

519
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,851
We were never together.

520
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:53,000
He was at the bank in the morning and afternoons,
and I worked at the hospital on the shifts...

521
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,805
...to save up for a bigger apartment,
with a separate room for a baby.

522
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,651
Now there is the room,
but no mood for a baby.

523
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,402
When I heard him on the tape, I didn't feel the
separation, now the silence indicates his absence.

524
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,129
I have brought his car.

525
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,205
Without the passenger.

526
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,802
A penny for your thought.

527
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,721
Mother being secretive, and
the wisdom of this stepbrother.

528
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,084
And all the gifts, it feels like
father has brought souvenirs.

529
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,730
I secretly took mother's photo album from the
storeroom. She'll skin me alive, if she finds out.

530
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,605
She really knows
how to keep things.

531
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,811
I wish she could preserve us
like these pictures in the album.

532
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:46,527
Whatever you pick up from the storeroom
it seems like as good as new.

533
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,041
I wish we were still young.

534
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,527
You became detached
from your villa quite hard.

535
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,361
Now it's even harder to
detach from this place.

536
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,768
Haji Zavieh. Mother
talks very nicely of him.

537
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,611
Who caused their separation?

538
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,805
I did. The woman who should have
been left a spinster, and not a spouse.

539
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,605
Zavieh was a bazaar merchant. The word
is that half of Tehran belonged to his father.

540
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,121
A merchant, but a big
spender and hospitable.

541
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,368
My husband's family and I ...

542
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,450
all we did was partying around

543
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,564
going shopping from materials,
tailoring clothes, and jewels.

544
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,728
We had guests every day.

545
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,162
Mother says you had maids,
servants, gardeners, and cooks.

546
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,442
I was no housewife.

547
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,042
I said that I don't feel like
socializing with your family.

548
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,164
He forbade them from coming.

549
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:44,161
We were left with the servants.

550
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,681
How nice!
How romantic!

551
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,011
A house like a hotel!
A life like a journey!

552
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,487
A journey from purgatory to hell.

553
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,206
Mother says you wanted every night
to end in a fight on non-speaking terms.

554
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,281
The moment he came home,
my marriage duties would start.

555
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:09,364
Time of break porcelains and crystals. Zavieh
was filled with experience and patience.

556
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,881
He was young but not educated.

557
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,561
I begged him to remarry.

558
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,444
Didn't accept.

559
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,040
He was in love.

560
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,324
He was more concerned with
my health than his well-being.

561
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,081
Mother says he paid all the alimony
besides leaving you the house and all.

562
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:32,762
He wanted the house with me in it.
- We thought your quarrel was on going abroad.

563
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,167
Oh, that was an excuse.

564
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,161
After the divorce, he found me the best.
sanatorium in Europe and paid for everything.

565
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,726
So that's how the doctor appeared.

566
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,921
The hospital director was an Iranian
doctor, a fellow-countryman.

567
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,921
A respectable protector. A peaceful
shadow over a troubled soul.

568
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,407
He had wisdom and love combined.

569
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,205
He aimed for a total cure.

570
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:04,247
Mother says despite his desire to come
back, he stayed abroad for good.

571
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,682
With pregnancy, my
restlessness started.

572
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,485
I couldn't bear another
person within me.

573
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,285
With all that delusion, doubt
and compulsiveness...

574
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:18,930
Somebody breathed along with me.
- A child is a part of your body, not another person.

575
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,407
I feared this unknown creature.

576
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,921
Another being within me.

577
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,046
So I had an abortion.

578
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,642
Zavieh became homeless

579
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,960
The doctor remained in exile.

580
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,569
Father...

581
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,641
My unfortunate illness caused
our parents' separation.

582
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,842
Father died a lonely man.

583
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,808
All the men in my life were so gentle. Only
my unlucky star brought them misfortune.

584
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,002
Please take one.
Khodadad.

585
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,168
Please.
For me.

586
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,409
I'm putting it here.

587
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,528
I will close it.

588
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:34,561
Hello!
- Hello on your face, the gentle son-in-law.

589
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,242
Well, well. well. Here comes our
groom who is nicely groomed.

590
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,364
Have bought some ice cream. For
Gholam Reza.

591
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,881
So we're brickwall here, mister?

592
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,881
No, sir God forbids. There's plenty.
- Oh, ice creams!

593
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,451
As much as his wife is pregnant, he has
brought her ice cream to <i>cool</i> off her baby.

594
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,485
Please! Help yourself!
There is ice cream for everyone.

595
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,448
Hello, mother.
- Please do come in. Don't stand at the door.

596
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,122
I won't disturb a family reunion.
I'd better leave now.

597
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,641
<i>Tal'at
Tal'at</i>

598
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,971
Smells like your rice is burning.
Go and see to it.

599
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,005
I have some new orders!
A layette!

600
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,169
I have to make it ready before the baby is born.

601
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,284
Yeah, right. You'd better see to your work.

602
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,041
A man and his work.
- I wish you quick recovery.

603
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,085
Close the door.
- Go on.

604
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,964
You didn't treat him well.

605
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,130
Let's say he come to get a glimpse
of his wife. He has a right to her.

606
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:50,328
In my own house, I am henpecked, and here
I have to let our son-in-law boss me around?

607
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,762
She is my youngest sister.
I can beat her up.

608
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,125
The fact that I am a gentleman and do not
lift my hand against her is another matter.

609
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,083
Don't invite more than fifty people.

610
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,081
The evening you come back from
cemetery, give a dinner and that's it.

611
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:31,730
The money for the other ceremonies
should be given to the nursery home.

612
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,162
As for my shroud. Aziz has
brought me from Karbala.

613
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,764
One important request is about location of the
grave. I don't want it to be on some remote row.

614
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,488
Find one near a stream or under a tree.
- It's not time for leaving, mother.

615
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,083
We have just gotten together.
- You look much better than yesterday.

616
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Watch your tongue, cutie-pie! Touch
wood, these evil eyes can hurt bad.

617
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,682
Love defies evil. Today
mother has the look of a lover.

618
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,485
She hopes to join Him tonight.

619
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:13,448
And more, this is the dinner for
her wedding, not for her grieving.

620
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,691
Mother wants to get married.
only lovers marry, you know.

621
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,125
He is saying an apt remark.
This is a reunion.

622
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,211
I am to meet Him tonight.
I want nothing left for tomorrow.

623
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,245
We'll saute the meat, the onion,
and the potatoes today.

624
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,761
It wouldn't go bad for tomorrow.

625
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,841
I just want the rice and the stew
<i>to</i> be cooked tomorrow,

626
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,120
They have brought
the sheep to sacrifice.

627
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,201
Get up, bro. Let me wash
your face with cold water.

628
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,247
Your eyes are all welled-up from the onions'
smell. Then we'll play hide-and-seek.

629
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,604
I will hide. Let's see if you
can find your big brother.

630
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,451
Come here, dear.
- Thanks.

631
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,246
Come, sweet pie!
come, sugar!

632
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,002
There two tasks to be done here.
A sailor is a jack of all trades.

633
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:28,650
All you need to do is say the word, if you find
me capable of that task. I am all ears and eyes.

634
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:36,531
Your words are sweet as dates. Help break the
lumps of sugar, for you become as sweet as sugar.

635
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:44,046
This is the lady's oblation?
Thank God she's recovered.

636
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,404
No, Habib.

637
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,082
It is for the funeral dinner. Mother has
even provided the meal for her death.

638
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:58,606
The ceremony of our
mother's dying is some story.

639
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,485
What a story!
With God

640
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,889
Do not cry at the dinner.
Do not embarrass people.

641
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,963
We have a big samovar, enough cups and saucers.
Do not go round and borrow from the neighbors.

642
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:33,610
Make it respectable. Not with
wastefulness, but with manners.

643
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,931
It is the pleasantness of the host that adds
to the dinner table, not the variety of food.

644
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,681
See to it that your mother's
womanhood is respected.

645
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,088
Do not mince the meat too small.

646
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,522
They may say what their stew only
has is split pea and fried onions.

647
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,248
Let them talk, then
I will sock it to them.

648
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:59,526
The only thing left is the Halvah, which is
the bereaved's treat to the funeral attendees.

649
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,440
This, the only sweetness of the death funeral,
bears its scent and taste from people's blessings.

650
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,804
We have good oil in
the house. Saffron, too.

651
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,242
But the degree of oiliness and
sweatness is not criterion here.

652
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,001
A Halvah well-done is the respect paid
by the bereaved to the loved one.

653
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,442
In return, people will say their
blessings to the deceased.

654
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:25,011
I am only worried about the flour.
lam not sure if it is stale or not.

655
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,923
I'll get you the best in town.
The very best.

656
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,968
I'll <i>cook</i> you the Halvah. so yummy
that you have never tasted.

657
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,490
Where are you going?

658
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,204
What is up?
Where is Golam Reza?

659
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,609
He is sulking, he won't come up.
He has Monir dictate a story to him.

660
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:47,601
I am off to buy the flour. Fresh flour.
To Mash Bagher's. I'll be back in a bit.

661
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,441
And I have to call my office for the employees not
to get paid overdue, as it is the end of the month.

662
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,166
I am just accompanying them.

663
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,721
The liar's eyes betray him.

664
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,525
But when a child lies,
the mother believes it.

665
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,601
Go find your brother.
May God be with you.

666
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,484
Where is my lost lamb?

667
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:21,050
The time for sacrifice is at hand.
the sacrifice is happy waiting.

668
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,881
O, Gholam Reza,
my innocent lamb!

669
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,884
Did you get the flour, son?
Did you call your office?

670
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,121
Did you have a good time accompanying
them? Why are you back empty-handed?

671
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,961
Why are you silent,
looking down at your feet?

672
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:55,411
Look me in the eyes, and tell me
what has happened to Gholam Reza?

673
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,731
Gholam Reza is hot.
He is short of breath.

674
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,286
He is thirsty.

675
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,403
Do you know where he is?

676
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,925
Yes.

677
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,641
I am my father!
I am captain!

678
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,082
Capitan Gholikhan Naseri!

679
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,010
I am imprisoned.
lam in prison.

680
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,170
How many times should I tell
you not to come and visit me?

681
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,251
I do not want the officers to feast
their eyes on my wife and kids.

682
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,604
I'll come home myself.
With taking-a-bath excuse.

683
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,441
They're taking me to Bandar
Abbas, the far-off land.

684
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:07,802
Into the mouth of a dragon!
A fire-throwing dragon!

685
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:15,361
If the port is a sea of fire and shore
is the coast of snow, I won't set foot on it.

686
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:22,810
Father! Monir is not the cause of
your seperation from mother anymore?

687
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:28,131
I am not afraid of hot water anymore.
I'd put my head under the samovar's faucet.

688
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,881
Even if my eyes
become infectious again...

689
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,324
I'd rather be blind than see
a father die of loneliness.

690
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,125
Oh, father!

691
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,606
Oh my estranged father!
- No, my girl! My little girl!

692
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,769
You are sweet.
You are fragile.

693
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:54,046
You are a fragile kiddie!
Oh, girl! You will be wasted!

694
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,131
You are a snowball!
You will be melted away!

695
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,005
I'll take you to the port.

696
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,131
Daddy, when shall we get to Tehran?
- Are you tired?

697
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:28,601
I am thirsty!
- We'll be there in a blink of an eye!

698
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:40,643
I am scared of the road. Mother is waiting.
- I've learned driving from the Germans.

699
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,448
I am not a good-for-nothing
driver, like the drivers in the war!

700
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,482
I am hot!

701
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:57,601
The air is filled with flies!
- Buzz off, you stinking buzzing flies!

702
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,250
Here comes Capitain Naseri!

703
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:07,922
When we get to the neighborhood.
I'll run and knock on the door.

704
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,602
No, my sweetie. It's dark in
the alley. You'll be scared.

705
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,691
If you are at the foot of the
alley, I won't be scared.

706
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,044
I want to call out "Mother" "Mother"!
I've brought daddy out of exile.

707
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:26,371
What if I won't make it to Tehran?
What if they bring my coffin instead?

708
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:31,042
Where is your grave?
They never showed us.

709
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,849
Don't you and Ghoam Reza come to the grave.
Send them to a movie to laugh themselves silly.

710
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,964
As much as crying is bad for them,
it would make them sick at heart.

711
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,324
Tell Ebrahim to take care of you all.
- Okay.

712
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:52,440
Jalal is an angel. Shower Monir with kisses.
Give Gholam Reza a big bear-hug.

713
01:33:53,200 --> 01:34:00,049
I'll braid Tal'at's hair.
- Yes, do that. And tie them with red ribbons.

714
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:05,964
Do that. Tie them
with red ribbons.

715
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,800
<i>Monir!
- Gholam Reza!</i>

716
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,240
<i>Monir!
Gholam Reza!</i>

717
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,609
Do leave some food for Gholam Reza.
He might wake up hungry.

718
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:10,650
Fill up the water jug for Jalal.
Put an ashtray for Ebrahim.

719
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:16,244
Watch out for Monir not to forget to take
her pills, so she wouldn't be sleepless.

720
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:20,410
See what your new
brother needs, provide it.

721
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:25,082
Go to bed early, so you'd
get up early in the morning.

722
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:30,401
You have a lot <i>to</i> do tomorrow.

723
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,242
Hello to you.

724
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,491
Tal'at, go sort things out.
Prepare the beds.

725
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,682
Sorry for my bad timing.

726
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:03,730
They had brought some watermelon from the farm.
The watermelon is <i>cool,</i> and it is so hot.

727
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,525
I thought I'd bring you some.
- You did well, dear. Come and have a bite.

728
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:10,884
Thanks. I have
already eaten. Here.

729
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,211
It's not much of a dinner. And you
are not a stranger. you aren't strenger

730
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:23,169
Thank you. I've had my dinner. the
kids get sleepy, so we eat rather early.

731
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:29,083
Master Mehdi! Possibly the kids
will wake up and ask for you.

732
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,444
My father is with them,
nevertheless, you're right.

733
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:41,560
When their mother is not there,
my absence will upset them.

734
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:49,367
He has come to see Tal'at and enjoy her.
He has brought watermellon.

735
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:56,841
Did we come knocking your door to see her,
as much as she was at your place?

736
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:03,002
We'll return her when we're pleased. Let her baby
be born, get chubby, then she would come home.

737
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,170
You dummy!
- Master Mehdi, I beg you to for forgive me.

738
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:16,165
All you have done were good deeds.
May you live a long life.

739
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,887
Auf Wiedersehen. And
close the door behind you.

740
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,731
Good night.
- So long.

741
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,365
Good bye.

742
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:43,451
Time to see me off.
The train has not arrived yet.

743
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,882
But blessed is the caravan
that travels at night.

744
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,527
Arriving at its destination
early in the morning.

745
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,689
What a pleasure!

746
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,122
Like the morning prayer.

747
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:03,691
Hope for a new day. I said
I'll travel with the night train.

748
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,966
I can hear the bells toll.
The loud call.

749
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:14,689
Now the call of the caravan.
It is moving forward.

750
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,611
Oh, mother!
The light! The light!

751
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,088
Stand right there, mother. I am coming.
- Don't be scared, brother.

752
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,966
Mother...

753
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:48,524
...almond.
...alom...

754
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:54,841
...has...
...has...

755
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:04,131
Mother...
- Mother...

756
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,961
Mo...

757
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:15,771
...ther...
- Mother...

758
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:21,410
...has...

759
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:29,520
...pain_
. ...pain_

760
01:39:34,321 --> 01:39:41,728
...pain.
- Mother...

761
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:49,840
Mother...
- Mother...

762
01:39:54,200 --> 01:40:00,128
Mother is...

763
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:05,008
alive.

764
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:13,120
Mother...
...died...

765
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:23,209
...as much as she isn't alive.
