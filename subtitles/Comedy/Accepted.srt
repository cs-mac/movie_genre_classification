about $20,000 a year
in the current job market.

spend $80,000

155
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,934
or I could make $80,000.

157
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,193
Are you saying
you don't want to
go to college?

158
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,532
No. I'm saying that
it is fiscally irresponsible

159
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,607
for me to go
to college. You know?

160
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,815
Are you huffing?
Oh, God. No.

161
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,709
Are you high?
You're huffing grass?

162
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,164
No. I'm not huffing, Mom.
I'm not stoned.
I'm completely fine.

163

In fact, I'm more clear
and level-headed
than I've ever been.

164
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,807
Okay, cut the crap,
Bartleby.

Society has rules.

166
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:10,163
And the first rule is
you go to college.
Mmm-hmm.

167
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,751
You want to have a happy
and successful life?
You go to college.

168
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,734
If you want to be somebody,
you go to college.

169
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,881
If you want to fit in,
you go to college.

170
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,373
Well, you know what?
Maybe I didn't
get into college.

171

172

I've got a shot.

She's got a shot.
Listen, guys.

179
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,002
There are plenty
of successful people
who didn't go to college.

may the next four years

if one more person tells me

how excited they are
to go to college,
I'm gonna lose it.

Oh, man,
I heard about
the scholarship.

That's insane.
You're one of the best

Uh, the best. And, uh,

The exclusivity
of any university

00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,510
is judged primarily
by the amount of students

Unfortunately,
for the last few years,

459
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:59,078
we have been
unable to match
the amount of students

460
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,836
that Yale, Princeton,
or even Stanford rejects,

461
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,791

of our physical limitations.

is about to change.

00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,903
And now Harmon College
will have

465
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,040
the prestigious entranceway
it deserves.

466
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,607
A verdant buffer zone

467
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,015
to keep knowledge in,
and ignorance out.

468
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,665
That is a great idea, sir.
Yes, it is.

too overly optimistic,

what you want to be" crap?

484
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,785
No, no, Dad, they just--
they just have to say
stuff like that

485
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:52,906
just to keep
from being sued.

486
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,953
Yeah, well, sounds like
a bunch of crap to me.

487
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,032

Yes, of course
the college has a dean.

he's a busy guy,
though, you know,

00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,085
he can't just, uh,
set up a meeting with parents.

494
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:09,162
Listen. If I'm paying
for it, I'm meeting
with the dean.

the same education I did.

Wait, Dad, Dad, Dad,
I can't-- I can't... Aw, shit.

this corner right here.

In life, it's important
to distinguish between
need and want.

502
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,654

a bowl of rice to eat tonight!

Oh, my gosh.

You want me to be the dean
of your college?

No, I want you
to pretend to be the dean.

Yeah, well, technically,
he was fired.

00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:21,773
That's not true. I got fed up
with the education racket.

527
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:22,892
So I quit.

528
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:24,492
I did send in my resignation

529
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:26,387
in a rather
unorthodox fashion.

530
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:29,322
You sent
the dean of the university
a bag of dog shit.

531
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,214
It was a metaphor.
For what?

is just shake a couple hands
with some parents,

546

say, "Hi, I'm the dean,"
whatever.

for journalism majors.

it's for fine arts majors.

to a degree in photography.

1074
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,143
Wow, that makes,
that makes no sense at all.

1075
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,510
I know.
Um, but I'm really sorry.

1076
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:50,966
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late
for my Ancient Roman
History class.

1077

Okay. Bye.

BARTLEBY: I'm-- I'm
just saying, I mean,
is that what college is?

1080
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:05,850
What were you expecting?
A renaissance
of the human spirit?

1081
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:08,124
American education
is in the shitter.

1082
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,305
You know why?

1083
00:42:09,378 --> 00:42:12,345
Because people forget
the most important rule.

1084
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:15,130
College is
a service industry.

1085
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:16,472
A service industry?

1086
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:20,123
As in "serve us,"
as opposed
to the other way around.

1087
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,167
Look, you see
all these kids out here?

1088
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:23,702
They all paid
to come here.

1089
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,469
Right.
They all paid
for an experience.

1090
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:26,944
What kind of experience?

1091
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,399
The hell if I know.
I'm not a goddamn mind reader.

1092
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,676
Well, maybe
I should just ask them.

1093
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:33,599
Welcome to the conversation.

1094
00:42:33,665 --> 00:42:35,323
What do I want to learn?

1095
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:37,791
Why are you asking me?

1096
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:39,833
Well, I'm asking you, Glen,
because I have a hunch

1097
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:41,662
that no one's ever really
asked you that before. Yeah?

1098
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,797
Well, I like pancakes
and alfalfa sprouts
and lemonade.

1099
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:47,288
Okay, you know what,
let's appropriate the bulk
of this man's tuition

1100
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:48,769
to learning more
about the culinary arts.

1101
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:49,947
Huh?
Food.

1102
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,229
All right.
All right.

1103
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:52,476
Rory. What about you?

1104
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:55,066
Ever since nursery school,
every single waking moment

1105
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:57,048
of every single day
has been scheduled.

1106
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:58,748
So what do I want to do?

1107
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:00,535
Nothing.

1108
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,550
Cheap, zen, beautiful.
I like it.
Hands, what about you?

1109
00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:06,041
Summer camp
I made a paperweight
and won Camp Nagachewy's

1110
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,985
coveted woodcarving award
and next day,

1111
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:11,066
ran a 4.6 forty and it's
been football ever since.

1112
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,788
Mmm. Woodcarving,
sculpting. Good,
something with your hands.

1113
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:14,873
Well, there may be
something in there.

1114
00:43:14,947 --> 00:43:17,882
You can think about that,
and then get back to me.
All right?

1115
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,573
Schrader, what about you?
Well, B, I'm glad
you asked, actually.

1116
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:21,953
'Cause since
we're going to prison,

1117

a shank out of my toothbrush.

1118
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:26,211
Okay, ha-ha. I'll tell you
something, though.

1119
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:28,064
All our lives
we've been told
what to learn.

1120

Well, today the tide
is gonna turn, my friend.

1121

Because today
we're gonna ask the customer.

1122
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:34,011
What do I want to learn?
What do I want to learn?

1123
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,361
What am I interested
in studying?

1124
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:36,377
Huh?
What?

1125
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:37,946
W-What?
Come again.

1126
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:39,710
That's a good question.
No, really, come again.

1127
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:41,536
I thought you were
supposed to tell us.

1128
00:43:41,604 --> 00:43:43,098
Please come again!

1129

Well, as you can probably
tell at this point,

1136
00:43:53,636 --> 00:43:55,359
is that I really want to learn
how to slow things down.

1137

I'm really good at that part.

I want to learn
how to blow shit up

Well, write it

01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:55,566
Shit. Man, I'm sorry.

1679
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:58,539
All I ever wanted
was a run-of-the-mill
college experience.

1680
01:06:58,612 --> 01:07:00,399
But not me, right?
I can't have that.

1681
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:01,481
Not me!

1682
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:03,213
'Cause I'm too busy
getting the shit
kicked out of me

1683
01:07:03,284 --> 01:07:04,560
and being an accomplice
to fraud!

1684
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:06,122
BARTLEBY: Does
the run-of-the-mill
college experience

1685
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:07,624
include stripping you
of your dignity?

1686
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:10,700
Totally humiliating you,
making you wear a--a--a
frigging hot dog suit?

1687
01:07:10,771 --> 01:07:12,234
It's a tradition.
A tradition?

1688
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,834
Yes.
I got a tradition
for you.

1689
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:17,039
Schrader, you've been
my best friend
since we were 5 years old.

1690
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:18,766
That's the only tradition
I know.

1691
01:07:28,371 --> 01:07:30,477
I just messed up.
I really messed up.

1692
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:32,239
How? What happened?

1693
01:07:32,404 --> 01:07:33,582
With Schrader.

1694
01:07:33,652 --> 01:07:35,343
MAN: I know Bartleby
is by the pool.

1695
01:07:35,413 --> 01:07:36,461
Oh, my God.

1696
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,742
What is it? Cops?

1697
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:39,635
Worse. Parents.

1698
01:07:41,396 --> 01:07:43,731
BARTLEBY: Mom! Dad! Great!

1699
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,419
Hey, guys.

1700
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:47,217
Bartleby! Hiya, kid!

1701
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:49,451
Hey, oh, it's so good
to see you!

1702
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,859
Oh, it's great
to see you. Ow.
You look thin.

1703
01:07:51,926 --> 01:07:54,226
There's five good ones
right there
for my college boy, huh?

1704
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:55,570
Hey, hey, Dad.

1705
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,191
Wha-- What--What--What
are you doing here?

1706
01:07:58,294 --> 01:07:59,276
Well, Parents' Day.

1707
01:07:59,668 --> 01:08:01,644
What a wonderful idea
on the part of the college,
you know?

1708
01:08:01,717 --> 01:08:03,278
Yeah.
Oh, right.

1709
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,421
Parents' Day.
Of course.

1710
01:08:05,492 --> 01:08:08,143
Hello, everyone.
Now, welcome to Parents' Day.

1711
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,320
And, uh, we're very glad
you could be here.

1712
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,174
Um, we have a wonderful
guided tour planned

1713
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,897
a-around the grounds
and the campus,

1714
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,559
Show you
what we've been working on
all year.

1715
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,190
So, welcome one and all.
VAN HORNE: Excuse me,
everyone.

1716
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,342
May I have
your attention, please?

1717
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:20,591
Oh, shit.

1718
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:21,938
I knew I smelled bacon.

1719
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,921
My name is Richard Van Horne.

1720
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:24,973
Oh, Van Horne, yes.

1721
01:08:25,046 --> 01:08:27,467
The--The dean
of Harmon College,
our big sister school.

1722
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,430
Give him a round of applause.
He's earned it.

1723
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:31,436
Thank you for comin' by.
Great to see him here.

1724
01:08:31,511 --> 01:08:32,918
They are our
big sister school,

1725
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,121
and we are honored
by their presence.

1726
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:38,704
Thank you for that nice
introduction, young man,
but the joke is over.

1727
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:40,401
Ladies and gentlemen,

1728
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:42,642
South Harmon
lnstitute of Technology

1729
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:45,132
is not the sister school
of Harmon

1730
01:08:45,335 --> 01:08:46,861
or of anything else,
for that matter.

1731
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:48,626
More like cousins.
Thank you for coming.

1732
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:50,996
It is not accredited.
Any...

1733
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:53,974
Nor is it truly
an educational institution.

1734
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,653
Is this true, Bartleby?

1735
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:01,260
It is a sham, a fraud,

1736
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:04,112
that undermines the efforts
of real colleges everywhere,

1737
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:05,744
and I invite you
to confirm that

1738
01:09:05,817 --> 01:09:08,052
with the State Board
of Accreditation.

1739
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:10,291
To all those students
who have been duped,

1740
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,596
good luck applying
to schools next year.

1741
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:16,723
And to Mr. Gaines
I say you will be hearing
from our attorneys.

1742
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:23,061
Wow, Parents' Day.
Man, I wish I would have
thought of that.

1743
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:25,774
Oh, that's right, I did.

1744
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:27,311
Oh, and by the way,

1745
01:09:27,384 --> 01:09:28,978
if you, uh, if you see
that lease holder of yours,

1746
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:30,575
will you tell him
that his lease
automatically breaks

1747
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:32,536
when he's found
guilty of fraud?

1748
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,845
Cool. Thanks, D.

1749
01:09:33,914 --> 01:09:35,343
Er, was it G?

1750
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:37,557
That's right, it's F.
See you, F.

1751
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,972
Guys, I can explain.
Mmm-mmm.

1752
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:45,390
You have done
some stupid things
in your life, Bartleby,

1753
01:09:45,785 --> 01:09:47,126
but this...

1754
01:09:47,577 --> 01:09:50,326
You get your stuff together.
You meet us in the car.

1755
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:52,143
This is unconscionable.

1756
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:55,758
STUDENT: Ridiculous.

1757
01:09:58,074 --> 01:09:59,120
Hey.

1758
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:02,577
So,

1759
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:05,811
none of this was real?

1760
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:07,126
That's not true.

1761
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:10,903
Wait, Monica. Monica, wait.

1762
01:10:11,258 --> 01:10:12,436
Monica.

1763
01:10:16,058 --> 01:10:17,366
Sorry, man.

1764
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:19,157
It's cool. We tried.

Have you completely
lost your mind?

1804
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:12,504
Guys, the state defines
a college as a body of people

1805
01:12:12,572 --> 01:12:14,843
with a shared common purpose
of a higher education.

1806
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:15,990
Well that's us, isn't it?

1807
01:12:16,061 --> 01:12:18,331
I mean, you know,
with the word "higher"
kind of loosely defined.

1808
01:12:18,397 --> 01:12:21,048
Uh, yeah.
He's completely lost his mind.

1809
01:12:21,118 --> 01:12:22,743
No, no. Listen,
all we have to do

1810
01:12:22,814 --> 01:12:24,375
is go before
the state accrediting board,

1811
01:12:24,447 --> 01:12:26,552
with a licensed administrator,
and just present our case.

1812
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:29,011
B, look, let's just cut
our losses, okay?

1813
01:12:29,598 --> 01:12:31,061
What are we
talking about here, huh?

1814
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:32,411
We're talking about
a stupid piece of paper.

1815
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,723
I mean,
if a stupid piece of paper

1816
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,614
is what's gonna
make us acceptable,

1817
01:12:35,678 --> 01:12:37,402
then let's go for it.
Why not?

1818
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:39,838
'Cause you gotta remember,
it's not just about us
anymore, okay?

1819
01:12:39,903 --> 01:12:41,877
It's about everyone
who went to South Harmon.

1820
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:43,357
(CLAPPlNG)

1821
01:12:43,423 --> 01:12:45,049
Ah, great speech.

1822
01:12:45,374 --> 01:12:47,382
I was inspired,
I felt inspired by it.

1823
01:12:47,552 --> 01:12:49,406
Thanks a lot,
I'm-- I'm taking it on tour.

1824
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:50,519
What are you doing here?

1825
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:53,143
Aw, I don't know. I had--
I had to pick up some stuff.

1826
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:56,379
Some sage. Eggplant.
Olive oil. Some Funyuns.

1827
01:12:57,694 --> 01:12:58,840
Wait a minute.

1828
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:00,154
Come on!

1829
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:02,362
You're the one that applied
for accreditation,
aren't you?

1830
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:04,603
Well, someone had
to do it, you know?

1831
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,613
We all can't live

Mr. Gaines,

2045
01:22:01,426 --> 01:22:04,428
your presentation
was unorthodox,

2046
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:05,871
to say the least,

2047
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:07,499

2048
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:09,294
questionable at best.

2049
01:22:09,362 --> 01:22:10,408
However,

2050
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:14,344
the true purpose of education
is to stimulate the creativity

2051
01:22:14,418 --> 01:22:16,655
and the passions
of the student body.

2052

And in that regard
you have certainly succeeded.

This board does not
reject innovation,

watched carefully.
